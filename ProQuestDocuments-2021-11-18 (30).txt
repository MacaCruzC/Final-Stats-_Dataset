Texto completo: Johnson gained little notice in his life, but his songs -- quoted by the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and Led Zeppelin -- helped ignite rock 'n' roll.
Overlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.
Little about the life Robert Leroy Johnson lived in his brief 27 years, from approximately May 1911 until he died mysteriously in 1938, was documented. A birth certificate, if he had one, has never been found.
What is known can be summarized on a postcard: He is thought to have been born out of wedlock in May 1911 in Mississippi and raised there. School and census records indicated he lived for stretches in Tennessee and Arkansas. He took up guitar at a young age and became a traveling musician, eventually glimpsing the bustle of New York City. But he died in Mississippi, with just over two dozen little-noticed recorded songs to his name.
And yet, in the late 20th century, the advent of rock 'n' roll would turn Johnson into a figure of legend. Decades after his death, he became one of the most famous guitarists who had ever lived, hailed as a lost prophet who, the dubious story goes, sold his soul to the devil and epitomized Mississippi Delta blues in the bargain.
In the late 1960s, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and Led Zeppelin covered or adapted Johnson's songs in tribute. Bob Dylan, who, in the memoir "Chronicles: Volume One," attributed "hundreds of lines" of his songwriting to Johnson's influence, included a Johnson album as one of the items on the cover of "Bringing It All Back Home."
In the 1990s, a lightning-in-a-bottle compilation of Johnson's music -- "The Complete Recordings," released by Columbia Records in 1991 -- revived interest in the blues for yet another generation, selling more than two million copies and winning a Grammy for best historical album. In 1994, a United States postage stamp in Johnson's likeness memorialized him as a national hero.
The chasm between the man Johnson was and the myth he became -- between mortal reach and posthumous grip -- has marooned historians and conscientious listeners for more than a half-century. It would have made fertile terrain for one of Johnson's own songs, many of which frankly and masterfully tilled the everyday hopelessness and implausibility of segregated African-American life.
Indeed, his story is no more or less than the handiwork of the country in which it was written; a country where the legacy of African-Americans has often been shaped by others.
Johnson was born in Hazlehurst, Miss., in the wake of the Redemption era, a period following Reconstruction when white supremacists across the South reversed many of the freedoms and rights granted blacks after the Civil War.
His mother was Julia Major Dodds, the daughter of slaves, who had 10 children with her husband, Charles Dodds, before conceiving another with a field hand named Noah Johnson.
When Robert was around 7, his mother married another man, and he moved with her to Robinsonville, Miss. It was there, in the town's popular juke joints -- segregated stores or private houses that doubled, after hours, as recreational places -- that his now legendary music career began.
As recounted in Barry Lee Pearson and Bill McCulloch's biography, "Robert Johnson: Lost and Found" (2003), Johnson, perhaps as a teenager, attended juke joint performances by the early Delta blues pioneer Son House. The young musician had trained on a diddley bow -- one or more strings nailed taut to the side of a barn -- and wasn't much of a guitar player. But a surplus of ambition outweighed his lack of skill.
In a 1965 interview with the writer and academic Julius Lester, cited by Pearson and McCulloch, House recalled Johnson's habit of commandeering the stage during intermissions in order to play songs of his own. Chastened by House -- and the howls of his audience -- Johnson reportedly left town. But he returned six months later eager to perform again, this time asking for House's permission.
"He was so good!" House said of the new and improved playing style Johnson exhibited on the night of his re-emergence. "When he finished all our mouths were standing open. I said, 'Well, ain't that fast! He's gone now!' "
Variations on House's story -- a mysterious sojourn, sudden virtuosity -- are the source of the myth that Johnson, like Faust, sold his soul in exchange for his genius.
But friends of Johnson have given conflicting testimonies as to whether the singer himself ever endorsed the tale. And the two of his songs most often associated with the story, "Cross Road Blues" and "Hell Hound on My Trail," make no mention of an unholy encounter. Historians now suggest that Johnson's real benefactor may have been a guitarist in the Hazlehurst area named Ike Zinnerman (sometimes spelled Zimmerman).
As Johnson's music began to find an audience in the years after his death, however, critics -- many of them white and mystified by black culture in the South -- leaned into the legend.
As the music historian Elijah Wald wrote in "Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues" (2004): "As white urbanites discovered the 'race records' of the 1920s and '30s, they reshaped the music to fit their own tastes and desires, creating a rich mythology that often bears little resemblance to the reality of the musicians they admired."
What is true is that the guitar playing on Johnson's recordings was unusually complex for its time. Most early Delta blues musicians played simple guitar figures that harmonized with their voices. But Johnson, imitating the boogie-woogie style of piano playing, used his guitar to play rhythm, bass and slide simultaneously, all while singing.
Another innovation associated with Johnson, as noted by the critic Tony Scherman in 2009 in The New York Times, is the walking bass. Appearing on the Johnson songs "Ramblin' on My Mind" and "I Believe I'll Dust My Broom," the walking bass -- a low, ambling rhythm that evokes a swaggering strut -- became a building block of both Chicago blues and rock 'n' roll in the hands of the Johnson apostles Muddy Waters and Elmore James.

Like many bluesmen who lived in the shadow of Jim Crow, Johnson was a wanderer for most of his adult life and performed in juke joints -- often traveling with his fellow blues artist Johnny Shines -- as far as New York City. He married twice -- first to Virginia Travis, who died while giving birth to their child, who also died; then to Caletta Craft. In 2000, a court ruled that Claud Johnson, the child of a girlfriend of Johnson's named Virgie Jane Smith, was legally his son.
What survives of Johnson's short career is based on his only two recording sessions, arranged by the American Record Company executive Don Law in 1936 and 1937 in Texas. One song from the first session, the vibrant "Terraplane Blues," sold a respectable 5,000 copies, giving the singer the only real taste of fame he would know in his life.
Another record executive, John Hammond of Columbia Records, championed Johnson's music decades after his death. Hammond, who launched the recording careers of Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, issued a posthumous album in 1961, "King of the Delta Blues Singers," which compiled most of the American Record Company recordings.
The album captivated a fledgling generation of musicians at the dawn of rock's golden age. As Eric Clapton wrote in 2007 in "Clapton: The Autobiography," describing his first encounter with "King of the Delta Blues," "I realized that, on some level, I had found the master."
The story of how Johnson died, like so many facts of his life, is contested.
A death certificate recovered by the researcher Gayle Dean Wardlow showed that he died on Aug. 16, 1938, at a plantation near Greenwood, Miss. The cause was complications of syphilis, according to a note on the back of the certificate that was attributed to the plantation's owner.
But David Honeyboy Edwards, a contemporary of Johnson's who is believed to have performed with him just days before his death, said that Johnson had been poisoned, and that he was probably targeted by the vengeful husband of one of his mistresses.
The location of Johnson's grave has never been confirmed. Headstones at three different churches in the Greenwood area claim to mark his resting place -- the final riddle of a man whose brief, turbulent life became a cipher nearly as sensational as his songs.

Texto completo: Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow was reluctant to share her Harvey Weinstein story at first, but she’s now boldly speaking out about the mogul who launched her career and her role in helping take him down.
“The Politician” star has been back in the news because of that Netflix drama but also because of her involvement in breaking the scandal wide open, which is documented in New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey’s new book, “She Said.”
The reporters credit the A-list actress with facilitating their reporting and connecting them with women who had been hesitant about discussing their uncomfortable experiences with the mega-producer.
Paltrow, who did not appear in the initial story that catalyzed Weinstein’s downfall, said she was “really scared” about coming forward in those early stages.
“I think society had shown us only basically examples where women coming forward ended up not being advantageous for the woman. But I really felt like it was time,” Paltrow said on NBC’s “Today” show Thursday.
The “Shakespeare in Love” star has alleged that when she was 22, Weinstein summoned her to his hotel suite, placed his hands on her and suggested they go to the bedroom for massages. She also said her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt later confronted the producer about the alleged interaction. Weinstein has denied all of his accusers’ allegations of nonconsensual sex.
“I think also having a teenage daughter that’s the love of my life and worrying about her going into the workplace and feeling like if there was ever a chance that there could be a cultural shift on this stuff I wanted to participate in (it),” Paltrow added, further explaining why she later took a more prominent stand on the issue.
“I never could have imagined that collectively a shift this seismic would happen, but I feel proud that I have a small part in it.”
In “She Said,” the Goop founder is part of a narrative in which she hosted an event for high-profile survivors who had come forward about their sexual assaults. She’s also part of a surreal story in the book that involved Weinstein also coming to her home and her frantically hiding in the bathroom to speak with the reporters.
Paltrow’s connections to the producer and in Hollywood led to Kantor and Twohey recently calling her an unexpected hero for advancing their Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting.

Amateur pro-Trump Internet sleuths scramble to unmask whistleblower

Texto completo: The looming battle over President Trump's potential impeachment has sparked an online hunt in the far-right corners of the Web as self-styled Internet sleuths race to identify the anonymous person Trump has likened to a treasonous spy.
Their guesses have been scattershot, conspiratorial and often untethered from reality, spanning a wide range of such unlikely contenders as presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and Vice President Pence.
Some of the online commenters and anonymous posters said they have been spurred to action by Trump's fury, foreshadowing the online clashes that are likely to engulf any upcoming impeachment hearings and the 2020 campaign.
"Carpet bomb the memes. Everywhere," one anonymous poster on the message board 4chan wrote in response to one of Trump's angry tweets about the whistleblower. "Time to rise up. Your president has asked for your help."
The quest to identify the person who crafted the politically explosive complaint against Trump has become a fixation across the most extreme corners of such platforms as Twitter, Reddit and Gab - and has spread onto conservative news sites, radio shows and TV broadcasts.
The president's scornful portrayal of the whistleblower shaped and stoked the online conversation throughout the week, as it descended into a case study of the Internet at its worst - frenetic, fueled by rumor and frequently racist, misogynistic and crude.
One 4chan commenter asserted Thursday that "the whistleblower is not white," probably misreading a part of the complaint in which the whistleblower calls himself or herself a "non-White House official." The commenter continued: "see second set of bullet points on page 3. trump only has a handful of non white staff. I wonder who it might be."
The hunt for the whistleblower revealed a glimpse of how polarized partisan media and the Internet have become, in which every news event becomes an opportunity for online brawlers to try to steer mainstream conversations and defeat the other side.
"We're seeing all the elements of information warfare play out online during this episode," said Peter W. Singer, a senior fellow at the think tank New America. "There's this crowdsourced manhunt to find out who did it, and once that identity comes out, everything in their life - what they majored in in college, where they like to eat dinner, where their kids went to school - will be pulled out in the hope there is one little nugget that can be weaponized against them."
After the complaint was made public Thursday morning, pro-Trump commenters guessed the whistleblower is Hispanic or Jewish or Arab or African American and, many were sure, a woman - though rarely did the commenters use such delicate terms. A top choice soon became Susan M. Gordon, a former deputy director of national intelligence, though others thought a more probable candidate is CIA Director Gina Haspel.
Some commenters offered names or rough demographic characteristics, while others posted photos of potential suspects. One 4chan commenter focused on former national security adviser John Bolton as a contender, posting a close-up image of his trademark bristly mustache with the words "Operation Infinite Walrus!"
The speculation gained energy at several key moments, beginning with the release of the transcript of a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The frenzy accelerated with the release of the complaint itself and when Trump said the whistleblower, whom he suggested should be prosecuted, was "close to a spy."
Conservative commentator Bill Mitchell, who attended Trump's social media summit in July, replied in a tweet: "No Mr. President, that IS a spy."
On the pro-Trump Reddit message board r/The_Donald, a commenter using a pseudonym said, "This 'whistleblower' needs to be put in the public spotlight, and then f---ing prosecute him/her to the fullest extent of the law."
Another replied, "I bet the whistleblower is the fired ambassador [to Ukraine]," referring to Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career U.S. diplomat recalled abruptly in May.
The guessing game took another twist after the New York Times reported the complaint was made by a CIA officer detailed to the White House. A conservative writer, Stu Cvrk, tweeted out his guess a few hours later.
"Is This Guy The Ukraine Phone Call Whistleblower?" Cvrk tweeted, linking to a post he wrote on RedState, a conservative news and commentary site.
"A source known to me at the State Department, who will remain anonymous, tells me that everyone is pointing to Edward 'Ned' Price as the whistleblower who came forward with the accusation that President Trump 'abused his office' during a phone conversation with the Ukrainian president," wrote Cvrk. Price is a former CIA officer who retired in 2017 and is now a political analyst for NBC News.
Price, who was more amused than upset at the claim, said it made him concerned about the development of "discourse that is just divorced from the facts."
"It's part of the political atmosphere that we live in now," Price said. "People are looking for anything on which to hang their tinfoil hats."
Cvrk, in a direct Twitter message to The Post, stood by his assessment. "You didn't seriously think he would admit it, did you?" he wrote, adding that he was insulted by the inference "that I am a tinfoil hat guy."
On Friday, the Washington Examiner spread word of a $50,000 reward offered by two pro-Trump political activists known for smear campaigns, who called the scandal a "national disgrace" and said they hoped identifying the whistleblower would help put "this dark chapter behind us."
A post on the conservative Washington Sentinel suggested the whistleblower complaint was written by a "very organized" team of individuals, based on what they called "document analysis (grammatic profiling) software." Breitbart News said the "so-called whistleblower" marched to the orders of a vast operation bankrolled by George Soros, a longtime target of conservative conspiracy theories.
The whistleblower has remained anonymous. But should his or her name be publicized through the efforts of Internet sleuths, journalists or others, the consequences probably will be serious given the intensity of the fixation online.
Many people in such spotlights have had their personal information - such as their home addresses, family affiliations and Social Security numbers - published through online "doxing" harassment campaigns. It's not unusual for figures identified in this way to be confronted in person at their homes or workplaces.
"It's very disruptive," said Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. "The president has already branded this person as a snitch and a spy, and that's a problem."
The whistleblower's lawyer has publicly called for respect for the person's privacy. But many in conservative media have shown no interest in standing down.
In response to this request, the Trump-boosting talk-radio host Mark Levin said on Sean Hannity's Fox News show Thursday night, "Too bad, pal. Too late. You want to impeach our president, using this BS? We want to know all about your guy."

The Met's Peter Gelb should step down already

Texto completo: It seems that Peter Gelb, the general manager of New York City's world-famous Metropolitan Opera, doesn't think we know what “corroboration" means.
According to reporting by NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas, Gelb called a meeting on Saturday with the opera company's orchestra and chorus, in response to concerns about superstar singer Plácido Domingo. The subject: why he hadn't suspended or investigated Domingo, a Met favorite for over 50 years who was cast in two fall productions, in light of 20 women accusing the singer of workplace sexual harassment that spanned decades .
Asking that those present keep it in confidence, Gelb allegedly gave these reasons. First, the women were all anonymous. (Wrong: two allowed journalists to use their names.) Second, he said they had only come forward to the Associated Press, which published the allegations over two articles, and not other credible news outlets. Thus, Gelb reportedly said, the reporting lacked “corroboration."
Lacked corroboration. And this from the son of legendary newspaperman Arthur Gelb. Either Peter Gelb didn't have the facts straight, or he deliberately fed his staff . . . shall we call them “alternative facts?"
Domingo, who has disputed the allegations, withdrew from his planned appearances at the Met late Tuesday afternoon, issuing a statement that indicated he would not return to the opera house. An accompanying statement from the Met suggested the opera house had asked for his resignation. Does that settle the matter?
Not this time. It's too late. With his decision to go all-in defending the Spanish singer, Gelb proved that he cares more about one powerful, profitable man than the well-being of his staff. And with that, he's proven himself unfit to lead America's most iconic opera house.
So most of the accusers were anonymous. Of course they were! Reputation is everything in music: just one assertion that a musician is difficult to work with can spell doom. Two accusers, Angela Turner Wilson and Patricia Wulf, spoke on the record using their full names. One's a teacher. One's retired. The stakes aren't as high.
Now, let's talk corroboration. The AP articles describe how the allegations were supported and fact-checked. For the first article, the AP spoke with “almost three dozen" other opera-world professionals who confirmed Domingo's behavior, verified the accusers worked where they said they did, and talked to colleagues the accusers confided in. For the second article, the AP obtained Wilson's diary from 1999. These stories show the same patterns of behavior: late-night phone calls, unwanted kisses, clandestine strategies to avoid being alone with Domingo backstage. They read like a twisted rendition of the catalog aria from “Don Giovanni" — this many in L.A., this many in D.C., this many in Texas . . . “if she wears a skirt, you know what he does."
And if the AP hadn't been enough for him, Gelb would have only needed to look at articles from NPR or The New York Times (his dad's old paper), for which Wulf also spoke on the record.
No matter what journalists say, or how clearly they explain their rigorous process of reporting and verifying these stories, one gets the feeling that short of Domingo acting out in front of Gelb's eyes, no evidence was ever going to be enough. To him, the word of that one man was more important than that of 20 women. All this while other American companies struck Domingo from the roster, Europe continued to receive him with standing ovations, and the singer's superfans unleashed volleys of vitriol at anyone, reporter or opera fan, who posted a negative word online about their cherished Maestro.
If Gelb was attempting to reassure his rankled rank-and-file staff, he failed, and multiplied his troubles while he was at it. Gelb has gotten into dustups with the media before, but largely in response to negative reviews of Met productions. And classical music news usually doesn't make waves outside of a small network of enthusiasts (just ask my click count). But questioning the integrity of both the accusations and the AP's fact-checking? That'll get Gelb attention, and not the kind he wants. Even Brad Hoylman, the New York state senator for the district including Lincoln Center,weighed in with a tweet that called the treatment of the women “appalling" and pushed for Domingo to withdraw.
It's not like the Met is a stranger to handling allegations of backstage sex-pestery. The day after The New York Times published allegations of sexual abuse against longtime Met head honcho (and former Boston Symphony Orchestra music director) James Levine in December 2017, Gelb announced that Levine had been suspended and all his further Met conducting engagements were canceled. A scant several weeks later, stage director John Copley was dismissed from the Met's production of Rossini's “Semiramide" after a male chorister complained about a sexually charged remark. And just yesterday, the Met suspended tenor Vittorio Grigolo from all future performances pending an investigation by The Royal Opera; last week while touring Japan with the London company, Grigolo allegedly groped a female performer during a curtain call.
But in the Domingo case, the Met held to its initial decision to wait for the results of LA Opera's independent investigation, which was announced the same day the AP's first article came out. Why did Gelb double down to defend Domingo till the last minute?
I'll take a wild guess and say it's mostly about dollar bills. In an era of declining ticket sales, big names like Domingo sell seats. On Tuesday morning, seat maps for his Sept. 25 and 28 performances of Verdi's “Macbeth" (opposite Russian soprano Anna Netrebko, another singer with a colossal fanbase who has been openly dismissive of #MeToo allegations) showed that the 3,800-seat house was almost entirely sold out.
That doesn't happen often. And with Domingo scheduled to perform so early in the season, it was unlikely that any findings would surface in LA Opera's investigation before he appeared a few times.
What's more, Domingo has friends in very high places. To name one, there's Met Board of Directors chair Ann Ziff, who has given many millions to the Met and sits on LA Opera's board alongside Domingo. In the past two years, she underwrote exclusive 50th anniversary galas in the singer's honor at both the Met and LA Opera.
Whatever the reasons for Gelb's circling the wagons around Domingo, he simultaneously created a toxic environment for his staff and confirmed my worst fears about opera. His response reinforces a paradigm of opera as a hidebound, hierarchical world, where venerated men get away with absolutely anything. In the meantime, artists who depend on good relationships with the powerful few (a.k.a. almost everyone else working in opera) must stoically sing past all kinds of inappropriate behavior — or leave the field entirely.
It's time to ask: what do we want opera to stand for? I know what I want: I want an opera world where no one has to worry about giggling and smiling through harassment when they go to work. I want a world where having a famous name, or the support of the top 0.01 percent, or legions of adoring fans to descend on accusers and critics, doesn't mean it's easier to escape accountability. I want a world where less sympathy is given to abusers than those they abused, no matter how well those abusers might sing.
It's time for Gelb to go, and take the board with him. Time to bring in a team that wants to reclaim the beautiful living tradition of opera for the 21st century, this messy epoch that people still see as a newborn despite its being old enough to vote and almost old enough to drink. And until that happens, the Met Opera deserves every empty seat inside that house. Let them be testaments to all the singers and other professionals who ever learned, in some way or another, that what they survived didn't matter.

Texto completo: Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada on Friday became the first Republican member of the House to back the rapidly escalating impeachment inquiry — but he said he was reserving judgment on whether President Donald Trump should be impeached.
Amodei, 61, a four-term congressman from Carson City, is the chairman of Trump’s re-election campaign in Nevada, a swing state that the president lost by 27,000 votes to Hillary Clinton in 2016.
He said it made sense for Congress to investigate a whistleblower’s complaint, made public Thursday, that Trump used a July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s president to advance his personal interests, including asking him to look into unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his younger son.
Amodei discussed the impeachment inquiry process during a conference call Friday with members of the news media from his home state, and in a follow-up statement issued by his office.
“Listen, I want to see what the process produces,” Amodei said on the conference call, explaining that he had not ruled out impeachment. “And quite frankly, if there’s something there that rises to that level, then guess what, that’s not something that we can have by a Democrat or a Republican.”
A majority of House members now support the impeachment inquiry, according to a New York Times survey and public statements. On Tuesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California announced that the House would begin such an inquiry.
Justin Amash, independent of Michigan and a former Republican, had publicly favored impeachment even before the whistleblower’s complaint. Other than Amash, Amodei is the only non-Democrat in the House who backs the inquiry.
Jim Himes, D-Conn., the second-highest-ranking member of his party on the House Intelligence Committee, said Friday night that Amodei’s support for the inquiry was significant.
“That’s a big deal,” Himes said in a phone interview, adding that the reconstructed transcript of the call between Trump and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was damning. “That transcript — this is mob stuff.”
He said Amodei’s position was similar to that of many Democrats, including Himes, who support the inquiry but have stopped short of backing impeachment. He said that Democrats had not predetermined Trump’s fate.
A spokesman for Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the House GOP leader, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night.
Amodei, a former federal prosecutor, said that he was a big fan of oversight and that Congress should let the chips fall where they may.
“Please, nobody hang up the phone and say, ‘Amodei is Pelosi’s defender,’” he said on the conference call.

As Sea Ice Recedes, So Does an Alaskan Way of Life

Texto completo: With climate change, animals that sustain Native hunters are disappearing, and harmful algae are contaminating waters.
The Yupik whale hunters from Savoonga on St. Lawrence Island off western Alaska want to know when they will see bowhead whales again.
They listened patiently to eight hours of discussions among scientists recently at a workshop in Nome, Alaska, about how the rapid loss of sea ice is changing everything that lives in the ocean, from plankton to whales -- just as they wait patiently for the whales to return to their island.
Nome lies south of the Arctic Circle, on the edge of the Seward Peninsula along the northern Bering Sea. The peninsula is the closest point of the North American mainland to Russia. Months of darkness and daylight alternate there. And the effects of the warming climate are front and center.
In June, people there told us, they watched a herd of musk ox retreat to small patches of snow that lingered in the hills as they panted through a three-day heat wave of temperatures at and above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The normal daily maximum in June is 54.9 degrees. More ominous, the ocean is now free of ice most of the year; not that long ago, ice covered the sea near Nome generally from early November to late May. The ice is crucial to the sea life that is central to the people who live there.
Conditions are likely only to worsen. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released Wednesday, reports that it is "virtually certain that the global ocean has warmed unabated since 1970" and warns that the extent of Arctic sea ice will continue to decline as air temperatures continue to warm.
We were among the biologists and weather scientists at the workshop trying to explain the changes, and warning that more changes may be coming. We talked about how sea ice in the region is melting earlier and forming later. The ice was so thin last winter that an unusual series of southerly storms shattered what little ice there was in February and March, far ahead of the normal schedule.
This anomalous weather was followed by the fourth-highest recorded amount of snowfall in Nome in over 100 years. Heavier snowfall may seem counterintuitive, but the ice-free ocean now allows the atmosphere to hold more precipitation. The Iditarod sled dog race, which ends in Nome, was complicated last winter because, although there was plenty of snow, there were stretches of open water that were usually frozen over.
Over past centuries, the temperature gradient at the edge of the sea ice near Nome was a signal to marine animals that food was plentiful. Melting ice provides nutrients that fuel plankton blooms when sunlight is sufficient for photosynthesis. This ice melt during warmer, sunny days provides a banquet of plankton for small fish, shellfish and baleen whales. Those whales and other marine creatures typically followed the retreating ice, feasting as they hugged the Alaska coastline.
Now whales often show up emaciated because the timing and extent of the ice melt has changed. The system is out of sync. The ice melt happens too early in the season, when shorter days and lack of sunlight are insufficient to nourish the algae blooms.
What's also troubling is the recent discovery of enormous cyst beds, the seedlike dormant resting stages of ocean algae, in ocean sediments in the Chukchi Sea, north of the Bering Strait. Unlike the nourishing blooms that bring life to the waters of Nome, these cysts can hatch into toxic algal blooms when the ocean warms. The toxins produced by these algae were recently detected at low levels in over a dozen species of marine mammals throughout Alaska, many of which are consumed by Native Alaskans. These algal toxins were also identified in dead sea birds -- murres, fulmars and storm petrels -- found during an unusual die-off in Alaska beginning in 2015.
The international climate panel reports that harmful algal blooms have expanded and increased in frequency in coastal areas since the 1980s, in part because of the changing climate.
Will these harmful algae thrive in the warmer ocean of the future and grow rapidly, causing blooms large enough to dangerously contaminate Alaska's marine resources? Unusually warm water, an anomaly similar to one that resulted in a record-setting harmful algal bloom that extended from central California to the Alaska Peninsula in 2015, is developing again in the Pacific. If this blob of warm water doesn't dissipate this winter, its effects could be devastating, not only to the whale hunters and the families in Savoonga who eat the bounty from their hunts, but also to the Alaskan way of life.

Trump’s Ukraine Plotting Has Been Happening in Plain Sight. So Why Didn’t We See It?

Try for a moment to imagine the world as it was a week ago. Before we knew that President Donald Trump put the squeeze on another country to investigate his political opponent, before we knew he wanted to involve the attorney general, or that aid may have been held up in the plotting.
Except, we did know each of those things. The president hasn’t been quiet about what he’s up to. And while we didn’t know many details, much of the hanky-panky has been happening right before our eyes.
Let’s review a few facts.
The president urged an investigation into Ukraine and Democrats back in 2017 . He didn’t do it in a secret meeting. He tweeted.

Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - "quietly working to boost Clinton." So where is the investigation A.G. @seanhannity
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017
Trump and his allies theorized that Ukrainians had engaged in a kind of bank shot: They suspected Ukrainians of plotting to help Hillary Clinton by manufacturing evidence against Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort. (There’s no evidence to support that.)
Trump brought up the theory again this April, and he floated getting the Attorney General involved. “This concept of Ukraine, they’ve been talking about it actually for a long time,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. “I would certainly defer to the attorney general and we’ll see what he says about it.”
The next month, The New York Times reported that Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, was planning to visit Ukraine to pressure the government to investigate those who helped catch Manafort and to dig into former Vice President Joe Biden.
BuzzFeed and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project followed up in July with an even more detailed story on how Giuliani was pushing Ukraine “to discredit the president’s rivals.”
Giuliani was straightforward. “We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation,” he told the Times. Giuliani added that, of course, Trump knew about it. “My only client is the president of the United States,” he said. “He’s the one I have an obligation to report to, tell him what happened.”
The next day, Politico interviewed Trump. The president said he had spoken to Giuliani “very briefly” about his plans to pressure Ukraine. “He’s involved with a number of people that are looking into the whole thing because a lot of very bad, a lot of very bad things took place prior to the election.”
Politico asked Trump whether he would order Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate Biden’s son work in Ukraine. “Well, I haven’t spoken to him about it. But certainly it is a very big issue and we’ll see what happens,” Trump said, later adding, “Certainly, it would be an appropriate thing to speak about.”
Next came the July call between the president and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. We didn’t know the details of it at the time, but there were hints for those closely following. Here’s a snippet from Ukraine’s official summary of the call:

Donald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.

By that point, of course, Trump had already publicly discussed what exact “corruption” he wanted Ukraine to investigate. A month later, Politico reported that Trump had ordered the delay of aid to Ukraine.
The push to investigate a political opponent’s family. The prospect of using aid as a cudgel. It was all in the air. Vice President Mike Pence was asked directly about it at the beginning of September. “Can you assure Ukraine that the hold-up of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family?” a reporter asked Pence during his visit to Warsaw.
Pence didn’t give a clear answer. But he did say, “As President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.”
The Washington Post began to put it all together a few days later, on Sept. 5: Trump “is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.”
That didn’t run on the front page, or anywhere on the news pages at all. It was in the third paragraph of an unsigned editorial.
The point of all this isn’t that we knew exactly what was going on. We didn’t. The transcript of the call and the whistleblower’s complaint have been critical.
But the urgency for digging was clear. Some reporters were on the case. So why wasn’t more attention paid?
There’s the avalanche of news, scandal and outrage. Many of them have facts that are clear and easy to grasp. We have to make choices.
But there’s something else, too. Two weeks after the 2016 election, my colleague Jesse Eisinger and I recorded a podcast with Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen. We discussed how journalists should think about covering the Trump administration. She had a warning. If you dismiss something because it seems unimaginable, that’s a mistake.
It’s a failure of imagination.
Many years ago, I wrote about another scandal: the revelations about torture of detainees in U.S. custody. The fact that the U.S. was abusing detainees had been reported. It only became recognized as a scandal after the Abu Ghraib photos were published.
This time, it was a phone call. In both cases, the dots were there. But we couldn’t quite wrap our heads around it. Not just the facts of it, but the reality of it.
With torture, we couldn’t grasp that the U.S. government would treat detainees the way the photos eventually showed it did. And the same with Ukraine. “A president shaking down another country to investigate his opponent? It can’t be THAT!”

Texto completo: Donald Trump committed an impeachable offense on that call with the Ukrainian president. But that doesn’t mean Democrats are right to start an impeachment process.
Remember, impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. There is no obligation to prosecute. Congress is supposed to do what is in the best interest of the country. And this process could be very bad for America:
This will probably achieve nothing. To actually remove Trump from office, at least 20 Republican senators would have to vote to convict him. If you think that will happen because of this incident, you haven’t been paying attention to the Senate Republicans over the past 2 1/2 years.
Usually when a leader takes a big risk, it’s because there’s a big upside. But Nancy Pelosi is taking a giant risk and there is little upside. At the end of this process, Trump will probably be acquitted by the Senate. He will declare himself vindicated and victorious in his battle against The Swamp. An ugly backlash could ensue — in both parties.
This is completely elitist. We’re in the middle of an election campaign. If Democrats proceed with the impeachment process, it will happen amid candidate debates, primaries and caucuses. Elections give millions and millions of Americans a voice in selecting the president. This process gives 100 mostly millionaire senators a voice in selecting the president.
As these two processes unfold simultaneously, the contrast will be obvious. People will conclude that Democrats are going ahead with impeachment in an election year because they don’t trust the democratic process to yield the right outcome. Democratic elites to voters: We don’t trust you. Too many of you are racists!
This is not what the country wants to talk about. Pelosi said she would not proceed with impeachment unless there was a bipartisan groundswell of support. There is no bipartisan groundswell, and yet she’s proceeding. According to a Quinnipiac University poll, only 37% of Americans support impeachment.
The presidential candidates all report the same phenomenon. Voters are asking them about health care and jobs and climate change, not impeachment. This week, while all this was unfolding, I was in Waco, Nantucket and Kansas City. I had conversations or encounters with hundreds of people. Only one even mentioned impeachment, a fellow journalist.
There is a big difference between the conversation Twitter wants to have and the conversation the broader populace wants to have.
Democrats are playing Trump’s game. Trump has no policy agenda. He’s incompetent at improving the lives of American citizens, even his own voters. But he’s good at one thing: waging reality TV personality wars against coastal elites. So now over the next few months he gets to have a personality war against Nancy Pelosi and Jerrold Nadler.
The Democrats are having a pretty exciting and substantive presidential primary season. This is what democracy is supposed to look like. Why they would want to distract from that is beyond reason. Trump vs. Nadler is exactly the contrast Trump wants to elevate.
This process will increase public cynicism. Impeachment would be an uplifting exercise if we had sober leaders who could put party affiliation aside and impartially weigh the evidence. It would be workable if Congress enjoyed broad public affection and legitimacy. We don’t live in that world. This process is already devolving into the sort of mindless partisan war that causes Americans to be disgusted with Washington. Impeachment is no longer a rare and grave crisis in American life; it’s becoming a device parties use when the House and the presidency are in the hands of different parties. Democratic House members have already introduced impeachment articles against Trump on at least four occasions. It’s just another partisan thing.
This could embed Trumpism within the GOP. If Trump suffers a withering loss in a straight-up election campaign, then his populist tendency might shrink and mainstream Republicans might regain primacy. An election defeat would mean the people don’t like Trumpism. But the impeachment process reinforces the core Trumpist deep-state message: The liberal elites screw people like us. If Trump’s most visible opponents are D.C. lawyers, Trumpism becomes permanent.
This could distort the Democratic primary process. It’s already obvious that impeachment upstages the Democratic primaries. In the months ahead, the Democratic candidates are going to have a harder time getting attention. Democratic policy debates are going to be obscured. Congressional Democrats will become the most visible party leaders.
Impeachment will doubtless roil the Democratic primary race in unpredictable ways. The most bellicose candidates may profit as the impeachment wars grow more vitriolic. The moderates may be further marginalized.
Democrats are running against a man whose approval rating never gets above 45%. They just have to be normal to win. Instead, they’re rolling the dice in a very risky way. I get the need to remove this unfit man from office. But this process will not produce that outcome.
An election can save the country. An inside-the-Beltway political brawl will not.

Texto completo: Delaware's three Democratic congressional leaders are responding differently to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement that the U.S. House of Representatives will launch a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's actions.
U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, the state's lone congressional representative, announced in July that she supported impeachment proceedings.
As of Wednesday, neither U.S. Sens. Tom Carper nor Chris Coons had issued a statement about where they stand on the topic.
The impeachment inquiry followed reports that the president tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, a Delaware resident and former U.S. senator.
It also followed a whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official that the Washington Post and the New York Times have said involved details of a July phone call Trump had with Zelensky.
Blunt Rochester's July announcement came a day after former FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified on Capitol Hill about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
She joined more than 90 House Democrats who said they were in support of either impeaching the president or launching an inquiry. More lawmakers have come out in support for the inquiry since then.
Now, the second-term congresswoman says that the "latest developments underscore the need and urgency" for the inquiry.
"Congress needs to see the full whistleblower complaint that the Administration is illegally withholding immediately," Blunt Rochester said in a statement Tuesday night. "The American people deserve to see the full picture of this President's conduct – an impeachment inquiry allows us to do just that."
U.S. Sen. Tom Carper's spokesperson would not confirm Wednesday whether Carper supports an impeachment inquiry.
Nearly two months ago, Politico reported that Carper did not. Carper told the news organization then that the Constitution calls for the House, not the Senate, to "lead the charge on something like this."
In a statement Tuesday evening, Carper still warned of a president becoming an "all-powerful king."
"While the President has broad deference when it comes to conducting U.S. foreign policy, he does not have the authority to undermine Congress or pressure a foreign government to help him smear a political opponent," Carper said. "Trump and his administration must comply with the ongoing investigations."
As of Wednesday morning, Coons's spokesperson said the state's junior senator wants to "review the facts and get specific questions answered."
Coons is joining other Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats in calling for their committee to investigate the whistleblower complaint and hold a hearing with U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
Coons told the Washington Post on Tuesday that the allegations that Trump sought help from a foreign leader to damage Biden, "if proven to be true, would be clearly impeachable."
On Wednesday, the White House released the transcript of a July telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
According to the transcript, Trump pressed Zelensky to reopen an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company to focus on any involvement by Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The president did not tie any U.S. aid to the investigation, as some had inferred.
In 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings. During his tenure, Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin investigated the company.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son — that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great," Trump said, according to the transcript. "Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me."

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Previews & Openings
'ADRIENNE TRUSCOTT'S (STILL) ASKING FOR IT' at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 3). Subtitled "A Stand-Up Rape About Comedy" (plus some more words that aren't publishable), this update of the cabaret performer's 2015 show approaches gendered violence and toxic masculinity with savage wit and a surprising number of brassieres. Bring your own rape whistle! Ellie Heyman directs.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'BELLA BELLA' at City Center Stage I (previews start on Oct. 1; opens on Oct. 22). Bella Abzug, the radical lawyer and politician, had a signature style -- jaunty hats, vibrant blouses, the occasional strand of pearls. Harvey Fierstein may not dress the same (well, maybe a hat), but he will channel her spirit in his affectionate tribute to Battling Bella, set at the close of a hard-fought senate campaign. Kimberly Senior directs.
212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org
'DUBLIN CAROL' at the Irish Repertory Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 1). Before Conor McPherson's "Girl From the North Country" transfers to Broadway, audiences can catch the Irish Rep's revival of this drama, which made its stateside debut at the Atlantic Theater Company in 2003. Set on Christmas Eve, the spare, talky play stars Jeffrey Bean as an undertaker's assistant muddling through a hangover and an encounter with his estranged daughter (Sarah Street). Ciaran O'Reilly directs.
212-727-2737, irishrep.org
'FREESTYLE LOVE SUPREME' at the Booth Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 2). Quick! What rhymes with "limited Broadway run"? After a successful stint Off Broadway, this hip-hop musical comedy, improvised anew each night, moves uptown. Created by Thomas Kail, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Anthony Veneziale, the show stars Veneziale, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Andrew Bancroft, Chris Sullivan and Arthur Lewis, with special guest appearances.
212-239-6200, freestylelovesupreme.com
'GEORGIA MERTCHING IS DEAD' at the Ensemble Studio Theater (previews start on Oct. 2; opens on Oct. 10). A road trip garnished with ambivalence and pie, Catya McMullen's new play follows three young women (Layla Khoshnoudi, Diana Oh and Claire Siebers), one of them heavily pregnant, driving toward their shared past. Giovanna Sardelli directs this dark comedy about sex, road food and mourning.
ensemblestudiotheatre.org
'THE GREAT SOCIETY' at the Vivian Beaumont Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 1). In 2014, Broadway went "All the Way" with Robert Schenkkan's drama, which depicts Lyndon B. Johnson's attempt to pass the Civil Rights Act. This new play, starring Brian Cox and directed by Bill Rauch, takes up Johnson's tumultuous second term. With Grantham Coleman, Bryce Pinkham and Richard Thomas.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'THE INHERITANCE' at the Barrymore Theater (previews start on Sept. 27; opens on Nov. 17). Three generations of gay man live, grieve, love and mourn through the six and a half hours of Matthew Lopez's modern epic, which Matt Wolf called "capaciously moving." Staged in London last year, the play arrives on Broadway directed by Stephen Daldry and starring the original cast members John Benjamin Hickey, Paul Hilton and Andrew Burnap, as well as Lois Smith.
212-239-6200, theinheritanceplay.com
'IS THIS A ROOM' at the Vineyard Theater (previews start on Oct. 3; opens on Oct. 22). Is this a play? This Half Straddle drama, which had a celebrated run at the Kitchen in the winter, returns. The text is drawn, verbatim, from the transcription of an interview that F.B.I. agents conducted with Reality Winner (played by Emily Davis), an intelligence specialist who leaked evidence of election tampering by the Russians.
212-353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org
'THE NEW ENGLANDERS' at City Center Stage II (in previews; opens on Oct. 2). Eisa, a teenage girl, is coming of age. And maybe her dads are, too. In Jeff Augustin's new play about a mixed-race New England family, pretty much everyone is in an early-life or midlife crisis. Saheem Ali directs a cast that includes Teagle F. Bougere, Javier Muñoz and Kara Young.
212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org
'SEARED' at the Robert W. Wilson MCC Theater Space (previews start on Oct. 3; opens on Oct. 28). How do you like your restaurant comedies? Raw? Well done? Extra crispy? The playwright Theresa Rebeck and the director Moritz von Stuelpnagel introduce a show about a chef who is worried about selling out while his business partner is just interested in selling. Raúl Esparza and Krysta Rodriguez star.
212-727-7722, mcctheater.org
'VICTOR' at Axis Theater (previews start on Oct. 2; opens on Oct. 6). Edgar Oliver, the eerie raconteur and one-man Gothic novel, returns to Axis Theater with a new work of solo storytelling. This piece, which is directed by Randy Sharp and includes original music by Paul Carbonara, charts Oliver's two-decade friendship with a homeless man, Victor Greco.
866-811-4111, axiscompany.org
Last Chance
'SEA WALL/A LIFE' at the Hudson Theater (closes on Sept. 29). Make sure you have handkerchiefs at the ready for the final performances of Simon Stephens and Nick Payne's twinned one-acts about love and life, which star Tom Sturridge and Jake Gyllenhaal. In an admiring review, Laura Collins-Hughes described these plays, directed by Carrie Cracknell, as "the most stripped-down storytelling on Broadway right now."
855-801-5876, thehudsonbroadway.com
'WIVES' at Playwrights Horizons (closes on Oct. 6). Jaclyn Backhaus's comedy, about the subjugation of women in a patriarchal culture, ends its Off Broadway run. Though Ben Brantley noted that the time-jumping play, directed by Margot Bordelon, "ultimately careens off the rails in its revisionist enthusiasm," it is, he wrote, "a gleeful work of historical subversion."

Texto completo: Michael Edwardes, a famously pugnacious industrial turnaround artist in Britain who rescued the Jaguar, Mini and Land Rover automotive brands in the late 1970s while becoming a union scourge, died on Sept. 15 at his home outside London. He was 88.
The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, according to Caroline Watkin, a family friend.
In some ways, Mr. Edwardes (pronounced the same way as Edwards) was the Lee A. Iacocca of Britain. At roughly the same time that Mr. Iacocca (who died in July) was saving Chrysler, in part by persuading the United States government to provide an inflation-adjusted $ 5 billion in loan guarantees, Mr. Edwardes was trying to jump-start British Leyland, a government-owned car giant whose brands included Austin, Morris, Mini, Jaguar, MG, Land Rover and Triumph.
Each man came to personify corporate boldness, reputations they burnished by writing best-selling business memoirs.
Mr. Edwardes, who spent the early part of his career fixing parts of Chloride, a battery manufacturer, took over as British Leyland's chairman in 1977. It was a last-gasp rescue effort: The British government had assumed control of the company in a 1975 bailout, and the company was almost bankrupt again. Turnaround plans had gone nowhere, a result of near-constant worker walkouts, shoddy craftsmanship, disaffected managers and a convoluted corporate structure. Japanese and German competitors were gobbling up market share.
"It was a farce -- no one knew what the costs were," Mr. Edwardes told The New York Times in 2008, recalling how, when he arrived at the company, nobody seemed to know whether individual brands were profitable.
The labor problems that characterized Britain's postwar years were particularly severe at British Leyland: Its workers were represented by 364 bargaining units, most of which bargained on different schedules. In 1978, British Leyland counted 584 walkouts of an hour or more.
But shop stewards met their match in Mr. Edwardes, who cut British Leyland's work force by nearly 50 percent over five years by closing 19 of 55 facilities. At the same time, he drove up productivity by investing in technology. The number of cars built per worker at one major body plant was fewer than eight in 1980. The total rose to nearly 17 in 1981.
Mr. Edwardes, who was born in South Africa, won union concessions (a contract promising a 3.8 percent pay raise, for instance, at a time when inflation in Britain was 12 percent) by defying the conventional manner of conducting negotiations. He repeatedly went over stewards' heads and appealed directly to workers, sometimes turning up on factory assembly lines.
"One advantage of being a colonial is that I'm not weighed down by all that class nonsense," Mr. Edwardes said in 1985, referring to the divisions in British society. "I find it quite easy to walk on a factory floor and communicate with people."
Militant union bosses hated him for circumventing them -- they nicknamed him "the poison dwarf," a reference to his 5-foot-3 stature -- but many workers came to respect his approach.
Mr. Edwardes also slashed and burned through British Leyland's executive ranks, firing 20 percent of the top 300 executives and reassigning about 50 percent of those remaining to new jobs.
That shuffling, which Mr. Edwardes recounted in his memoir, "Back from the Brink" (1983), was informed by another of his unusual business practices: psychological testing for managers. He believed such tests could identify trustworthy employees. But the method was startling to others. "Such control freakery was anathema," John Fryer, a former labor editor at The Sunday Times, wrote in a recent column.
Mr. Edwardes left British Leyland in 1982. He was credited with helping British business leaders regain their self-confidence, particularly those who had come to feel powerless in the face of organized labor. And British Leyland had been saved.
But the company remained unprofitable, and the British government -- by then being led by Margaret Thatcher -- had grown frustrated. Mr. Edwardes had pushed Mrs. Thatcher for money to develop new models; when she suggested that he sell parts of the company to raise funds, he balked.
By the time British Leyland received its last government bailout, in 1988, it had gone through some $ 20 billion of inflation-adjusted taxpayer money over two decades and become a painful lesson on the limited effectiveness of bailouts. The company evolved into MG Rover, which was acquired by BMW, then spun off before eventually going bankrupt in 2005. Jaguar and Rover are now owned by Tata Group, a conglomerate based in India. BMW still owns Mini.
Michael Owen Edwardes was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, on Oct. 11, 1930, to Denys and Audrey (Copeland) Edwardes. His father worked at a small automotive company.
Mr. Edwardes studied law at Rhodes University in nearby Grahamstown. In 1951, through a family connection, he got a job at Chloride. In 1958, he married Mary Finlay, the daughter of a South African shipping executive. They had three daughters before divorcing in 1988, when he married his assistant, Sheila Witts.
Mr. Edwardes is survived by his wife; his daughters Susan Edwardes, Judy Cummins and Penni Brink; five grandchildren; and a sister, Jill.
As he climbed the rungs at Chloride over the next 26 years, ultimately serving as chairman, Mr. Edwardes became known for parachuting into troubled divisions and finding solutions with the same fervor he displayed on the squash courts. One such success came while running Chloride's central African operations from what is now Zimbabwe.
During his final years at Chloride, Mr. Edwardes, then living in London, was appointed to the National Enterprise Board, a government body set up to revitalize British industry. British Leyland was one of the board's most troublesome projects, and the turnaround that Mr. Edwardes orchestrated there earned him knighthood in 1979.
His work at British Leyland made him famous in Britain, and he went on to lead one smaller-scale turnaround (or sale) after another -- Mercury Communications, International Computers Limited, the Dunlop tire company. He favored quick, dramatic moves; on his first day at Dunlop, he ousted 11 of the company's 13 board members, something The Times of London deemed "management by hara-kiri."
Mr. Edwardes was named in the late 1980s to lead Minorco, part of the Oppenheimer-DeBeers gold and diamond syndicate. There he devised a hostile bid for Consolidated Gold Fields, a major mining company. But Consolidated Gold punched back hard, and Minorco was forced to walk away when a United States judge refused to allow the takeover to proceed on antitrust grounds.
Rather than recalling that defeat in bitter terms, Mr. Edwardes seemed to appreciate Consolidated Gold's mettle.
"I relish a good challenge and a bit of a fight if that is what it takes," he told the trade magazine Management Today in 1996. "You could say I'm a bit of a scrapper."

Texto completo: Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
COME OUT & PLAY FAMILY DAY 2019 at the Dumbo Archway (Sept. 28, 1-5 p.m.). You won't hear many New York City parents telling their children to take to the streets for fun. Once a year, however, the organization Come Out & Play produces a free festival at which the urban pavement is safe and the recreational opportunities vast. Rescheduled from its original date during the July heat wave, this event on the plaza under the Manhattan Bridge archway in Brooklyn promises a host of creative new street games. (An adult version is scheduled for the evening.) This year's Family Day will include Chalkitoomee, which uses chalk and Super Soakers for an outdoor drawing competition; Flight Club, in which opponents do combat with colored paper planes; and Peas Please, whose players don pod costumes and must pop as many peas as possible into a basket within a prescribed time.

FAMILY EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS FESTIVAL at the Staten Island Children's Museum (Sept. 28, noon-5 p.m.). Parents try to teach their children to avoid danger, but knowing what to do if it threatens anyway is just as important. That's the purpose of this free festival, which is sponsored by New York City's Office of Emergency Management and features that department's Ready Girl, a superhero who will appear in person to deliver a preparedness presentation and copies of the comic book in which she stars. The event, on the meadow in front of the museum, will welcome the city's regular heroes, too -- police officers, firefighters and emergency medical workers -- who will arrive with vehicles and equipment to explore, and canine and equine partners to meet. (If it rains, the activities will move inside the museum, which will open at noon and offer free admission, regardless of weather.) One attraction not to miss: the Fire Department's so-called smokehouse, a converted trailer in which children can practice crawling through a hallway filled with simulated smoke.

THE KNIGHTS: FAMILY SHOW at the BRIC House Ballroom (Sept. 29, 2 p.m.). These knights won't be riding to the rescue of anyone except, perhaps, parents. Families looking to engage their children in something fun and educational can turn to this hourlong program, which promises to introduce the young to classical music without requiring them to sit still for the entire event. The Knights, a Brooklyn chamber ensemble, will collaborate with Dance Heginbotham and students at the Gelsey Kirkland Academy of Classical Ballet to offer an interactive performance based on "The Flowers' Festival," a picture book by Elsa Beskow (1874-1953) in which fairies invite a little girl to share their midsummer frolic. Written by Colin Jacobsen, who also did the musical arrangements, the show will draw on works by Schumann, Elgar, Ravel, Paco de Lucía and others.

MEDIEVAL FESTIVAL in Fort Tryon Park (Sept. 29, 11:30 a.m.-6 p.m.). An era known for disease, drudgery and dubious hygiene, the Middle Ages weren't exactly glamorous. You might never guess that, though, if your impressions come from this free annual festival in Upper Manhattan, which emphasizes period chivalry and general good cheer. Presented by the Washington Heights and Inwood Development Corporation, the fair turns the area around the castlelike Met Cloisters into a medieval-style village. This festival, the 35th, will go on rain or shine and entertain young visitors with sword fighting (and sword swallowing), acrobats and aerialists, a friendly dragon, falconry demonstrations, storytelling, an interactive Robin Hood performance and jousts in which armored performers really do knock one another off horseback. Children who would like to get in on the act can dress up for a 4 p.m. parade (the information booth will have complimentary costumes, first come first served) and try swordplay with plastic-foam weapons. Girls are welcome to practice being knights as well -- one way that the festival isn't quite so medieval.

'THE SECRET WORLD OF ARRIETTY' at select movie theaters nationwide (Sept. 29, 12:55 p.m.; Sept. 30, 7 p.m.). The 14-year-old heroine of this animated film from the renowned Japanese company Studio Ghibli lives in a world where postage stamps are wall art, a staircase is made of nails, and a house cat is a giant monster. As fans of Mary Norton's books will recognize, that's because Arrietty is a Borrower, one of a clan of tiny people who live in the nooks and crannies of old houses and furnish their abodes with the small possessions of ordinary humans. Fathom Events and the distributor GKids are presenting the feature, an adaptation of the first Borrowers book, in an English-dubbed version (with the voices of Amy Poehler and Carol Burnett, among others) on Sunday and in Japanese with English subtitles on Monday. Part of Studio Ghibli Fest 2019, the adventure, which was directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, chronicles the budding friendship between Arrietty and Shawn, the normal-size boy who discovers her. "Studio Ghibli and Arrietty have a way of taking you where you may not expect," Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times in 2012.

'THE STRAY' at the Theater at the 14th Street Y (Sept. 28, 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.; Sept. 29, 1 p.m.; through Oct. 6). As its name implies, the educational theater company Rebel Playhouse does not encourage following the crowd. Or, in this show, the pack. A folk musical written and composed by Arif Silverman, "The Stray" features three wolf cubs whose behavior could hardly be more radical for their species: They're vegetarian. When this causes them to be expelled by their fellows, they challenge norms again by trying to bond with humans. Presented with the Theater at the 14th Street Y and intended for audiences ages 5 to 9, the hourlong production illustrates that nonconformity has its own rewards.

SUBMERGE MARINE SCIENCE FESTIVAL at Pier 84, Hudson River Park (Sept. 28, 11 a.m.-4 p.m.). An estuary is where freshwater converges with seawater, but that won't be the only meeting that these free festivities will celebrate. Children can look forward to working alongside scientists and anglers, as well as encountering birds of prey and aquatic animals like eels, terrapins, horseshoe crabs and oyster toadfish. Taking place at Pier 84, at the western end of 44th Street (registration is recommended, and the rain date is Sunday), the event will offer an area where young visitors can examine plankton under a microscope, observe an oyster dissection and design their own filtering devices with researchers from Hudson River Park's Estuary Lab. They can also enjoy kayaking, catch-and-release fishing and marine-themed demonstrations and entertainment presented on the festival's Science Stage.

Texto completo: After their sixth consecutive season out of the playoffs, expect the Lakers to begin training camp this weekend by talking about fresh starts and clean slates. The upcoming season might be new, but it’s not fresh or clean – the Lakers are still trying to learn from the last one.
Take Tuesday night’s appearance of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dwight Howard, Quinn Cook and Talen-Horton Tucker at a WNBA playoff game in Las Vegas. There’s subtext: The players were among the Lakers invited to Vegas by James, who is trying to do more to create team chemistry this year after the franchise strained at the seams while stumbling to a 37-45 record in his first season in L.A.
It’s a new group with the same measuring stick: A veteran-laden roster that is expected to be more competitive than last season and perhaps even bring the Lakers back to their longtime place as a title contender.
With Lakers media day scheduled for Friday morning in El Segundo, here are the top stories to follow between now and the Oct. 22 regular-season opener against the Clippers:
1. What is the balance of power between Anthony Davis and LeBron James?
James has so far insisted that Davis will be the focal point, something Davis reiterated to Yahoo Sports in an interview earlier this month: “To have a guy like LeBron, someone of his caliber, go tell management and ownership and the coaches that he wants me to be the focal point is an honor. I know what comes with that, and that’s a lot of heavy lifting. I want to be able to do that.”
Davis has been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, but he’s yet to win big in the postseason. James has also been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, and while signs of physical decline might be more evident in his 17th NBA season, the four-time league MVP is still going to be the one running most of the team’s plays.
There’s a natural fit to Davis’ and James’ games, particularly as pick-and-roll threats. That partnership also extends off the court, where the two men have appeared together at a variety of offseason events and share the same agent (and are slotted for starring roles in a “Space Jam” movie). But when push comes to shove, who takes the last shot? Who takes the lead in dictating habits in practice and the locker room?
There’s the matter of Davis’ leverage: He’s got just one year left on his deal, and his agent Rich Paul has promised that he will enter free agency next summer (even though the Lakers are the presumptive favorite to re-sign him). That will weigh on the minds of the team’s lead decision-makers, who must find ways to make Davis feel comfortable within the franchise. But it’s also up to James, as a co-star, to make sure the relationship remains as close as it’s appeared so far.
2. What is Frank Vogel’s stamp on the team?
The month-long process that finally led the Lakers to two-time NBA head coach Frank Vogel was a tortured one. His own introduction was overshadowed by the specter of Magic Johnson. But the 46-year-old New Jersey native has handled the awkward circumstances of his hiring as well as anyone could, outlining a bright vision for the coming season. He’s also no stranger to competing at a high level, as his best Indiana Pacers teams can attest.
The circumstances around Vogel, however, would be tricky for any coach to thread. From the politics of having two superstars, to working with an assembly of coaches who some observers have colored as possible successors, he’ll have plenty of challenges coming to L.A.
Vogel’s calling card in the past has been rugged and accountable defenses that have done just enough on offense. He’s said he’s eager to show how he’s evolved since a truncated stint in Orlando and a year-long sabbatical from coaching. But time is of the essence for Vogel to show how he can assert himself in a position that’s experienced a lot of recent turnover.
3. Who is the starting point guard?
Anyone who has watched James in the past two decades understands he will assume most of the playmaking duties. The question is who is the additional guard who starts alongside Danny Green.
There are several candidates on roughly the same footing: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Avery Bradley, Quinn Cook and Alex Caruso. There have been few signs so far of how the Lakers plan to divine a starting guard from the mix, particularly given that there are so many different strengths on the table without a clear-cut, No. 1 option on the depth chart.
There’s a good chance that the early part of the season will see a fair amount of juggling between those options to see how they fit alongside Davis, James and everyone else.
4. What does Dwight Howard bring to the table?
No one ever argued Dwight Howard can’t make a good first impression. In a preseason conference call with reporters, the eight-time All-Star’s words rang of humility.
“My goal is just to win, there’s nothing else that matters,” he said. “Whatever I have to do to be a great teammate, whatever I have to do on the court, it’s all about winning.”
The problem is Howard is well-versed in finding the right opening lines, but he hasn’t found a way to follow through on them. Including his previous Lakers tenure, he’s been an ill fit with nearly every roster he’s been a part of, despite repeated preseason oaths that he’s changed.
The compelling part of Howard is his talent. In Charlotte for his last healthy season, he averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds. The Lakers could benefit from solid and steady production in the post, as long as Howard is ready to get with the program.
There’s no problem for the team if it goes south: Howard’s reported contract details have him on a short leash. But if the Lakers can squeeze value from him, that could add a good deal of upside to their potential.
5. Can the Lakers finally get some luck with player health?
Even the summer is not kind. DeMarcus Cousins tore his ACL in August and is likely out for the year. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kyle Kuzma, another key component for the team, might miss part of training camp with the left foot injury that kept him out of the FIBA World Cup for Team USA.
The Lakers are already walking a perilously thin rope, even before you consider that James, 34, is coming off a season when he played the fewest games of his career, and the offseason roster moves have resulted in a significantly older squad. The practice of load management is currently en vogue after Kawhi Leonard sat out nearly a quarter of the regular season then led Toronto to the 2019 NBA title, so it’s certainly possible the Lakers could look to lessen the regular-season burden on their stars.
That could help down the road, but they have to get to the postseason first. The Lakers have to win enough games in a deep Western Conference to earn a playoff spot. Having to play any significant length of time without any of their stars could prove damning to that effort. Even though the Lakers have added a second superstar, that also means losing one of their best players would create a void that is even more difficult to replace.

Score one for 'smart' football Even in defeat, John Harbaugh earns a small victory for analytics community

Texto completo: If Aaron Schatz, founder and editor of the analytics website Football Outsiders, oversaw the blueprints for a new head coach designed at some far-off, modern football laboratory, his creation might look like a typical football coach but not think like one.
The coach would have the offense pass more than run, even more than at prevailing NFL rates. The coach would rely heavily on play-action and almost never run on second-and-long. The coach would go for it on fourth-and-short, even in their own territory. The coach would go for 2-point conversions when their team trails by double digits late and when a penalty moves the ball to the 1-yard line.
The coach would, in other words, act a lot like the John Harbaugh who became a darling of football's analytics community Sunday, even in defeat. In their 33-28 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, the Ravens attempted four fourth-down conversions, three of them in the first half; went for three 2-point conversions, including after the game's opening score; and played not a "field position game," Harbaugh said Monday, "but a possession game."
It was not quite Schatz's Create-a-Coach come to life, but it was close. Afterward, Harbaugh explained that he had followed the numbers, not his gut. To some vocal fans with the advantage of hindsight, the decision-making registered as questionable at best, coaching malpractice at worst. For the sport's quants and number crunchers, this was a small victory in the fight for smarter football.
"The thought was always that a coach would not be willing to own analytics because of the fear that the owner would fire him if it backfired," Schatz said in a telephone interview. "It just shows the whole franchise-wide commitment to the idea."
Harbaugh has long been among the NFL's bolder coaches. In Football Outsiders' annual Aggressiveness Index, he's typically ranked among the NFL's most aggressive on fourth down. Last season, according to a Sporting News review of NFL coaches, Harbaugh went for it on fourth-and-1 80% of the time, tied for the second-most aggressive rate. (In first was the Chiefs' Andy Reid, under whom Harbaugh previously worked on the Philadelphia Eagles' coaching staff.)
But even Harbaugh acknowledged Monday that the Ravens' "analytics guys will tell you that I don't follow the analytics nearly enough. They'll tell you that I go by my gut way more than I go by the analytics." On that point, he is probably not alone. One 2018 study by Derrick Yam, a recently hired Ravens quantitative analyst, and Michael Lopez, the NFL's director of data and analytics, found that the value of a more aggressive fourth-down approach for an average team could be 0.4 win per year.
According to the study, published recently in the Journal of Sports Analytics, NFL strategies have been largely static: From 2004 to 2016, in regular-season situations that The New York Times' 4th Down Bot would have gone for it, the rate of teams' fourth-down aggressiveness fluctuated between 12% and 17%.
With the growing embrace of quantitative analysis by coaches like Harbaugh and the Eagles' Doug Pederson, the NFL might be finally turning a corner, if haltingly. According to Josh Hermsmeyer, a football writer and analyst for FiveThirtyEight, coaches went for it on fourth down 14.9% of the time last season, the league's highest such rate in the past 10 years. And still, Hermsmeyer said, teams aren't being bold enough in their decision-making.
"We're pretty humble when it comes to what we say analytically in terms of what the numbers say," he said. "We're really, actually, pretty conservative. So when we're sitting here pounding the table on these things, it's because it's really, really clear.
"I don't think we're going to see these huge edges come from the rest of the data. We might. But I think these major edges we've already identified [such as on fourth down] are going to be the big ones. And if the NFL won't even embrace those, it just seems to me that it's going to be an uphill battle."
The problems are largely systemic, analysts said. Michael McRoberts, founder and president of Championship Analytics, a company that provides college football and NFL teams with data that can inform in-game strategic decisions, said going against the sport's long-held conventions can be difficult for coaches. A 2017 study of college coaches found that they became increasingly conservative the more likely they were to be fired.
For all their expertise, coaches are "definitely human," McRoberts said. When coaches go for it on fourth-and-1 instead of punting and don't convert, they know they're "going to hear about it from the press," he said, even if both outcomes would have led to the opponent scoring.
It's why, when new clients make an in-game decision that's analytically driven, McRoberts said he's "really, really hoping" that they're successful. Without positive feedback, he said, some coaches fall back on old habits.
"There's got to be an education that goes along with these numbers," he said. "You just can't put a chart in front of a coach that's been coaching for 20, 30 years and say, 'Hey, just follow this.' "
The NFL has long been a copycat league, as Hermsmeyer said. Successful coaches with conservative strategies have bred new coaches with equally conservative strategies. "It's almost akin to the priesthood," he said, "in that the only real wisdom in football for ages and ages was that which was delivered at the feet of the master."
The rise of analytics has challenged norms, sometimes uncomfortably. Of Harbaugh's aggressive moves Sunday, maybe none was criticized more than his ultimately unsuccessful decision to go for 2 when the Ravens, after scoring early in the fourth quarter Sunday, could've cut the Chiefs' lead to 10 with an extra-point attempt. But according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis from 2017, the difference between a lead of nine points and 10 points is equivalent to a win probability difference of 2.2%. And Kansas City's defense had just endured a 13-play drive.
"I wouldn't say [the decision to be aggressive] is hard in that sense," Harbaugh said Wednesday. "You just have to decide if you think you have a good chance to be successful with it."
It is possible, maybe even likely, that Week 4 Harbaugh is unrecognizable from Week 3 Harbaugh. The Cleveland Browns will be a different test at M&T Bank Stadium than the Chiefs were at Arrowhead Stadium. According to Football Outsiders, Kansas City has the NFL's second-most efficient offense but only the No. 21 defense; Cleveland is No. 28 and No. 8, respectively.
In the analytics community, there is hope that Harbaugh's calls Sunday are not just an aberration, that they will embolden him and others to believe in the numbers. He was, after all, more successful than not. On two of the three drives in which the Ravens went for it on fourth down, they scored a touchdown. They couldn't have failed on either subsequent 2-point conversion had they not kept the sticks moving in the first place.
"You want to see teams that are maximizing win probability, that are trying to win," Hermsmeyer said. "These coaches will go out there and they'll say things like, 'It's a game of inches,' and, 'It's all about winning. Winning's the only thing.' And then they go out there and they leave points on the field. They leave wins on the field. And there's nothing more frustrating, just from a fan's perspective."

But if we are concerned about U.S. officials inappropriately threatening aid to Ukraine, then there are others who have some explaining to do.
It got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote a letter to Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as "strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine," the Democratic senators declared, "We have supported (the) capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these (democratic) principles to avoid the ire of President Trump," before demanding Lutsenko "reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation."
So, it's okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it's not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?
And then there is Joe Biden. In 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire the country's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. According to the New York Times, "Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden ... who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general." The Post reports that it is "unclear how seriously Shokin -- who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall -- was scrutinizing Burisma when he was forced out." But what is clear is that Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: "I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a b --. He got fired."
This weekend, Biden told reporters, "I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings." That is flatly untrue. Hunter admitted in an interview with the New Yorker that his father expressed concern about the Burisma post at least once: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.' " Moreover, the New Yorker reports that, "In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter's relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration's special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden."
So, Biden was fully aware of his son's involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016. He should have known that his using U.S. aid as leverage to force the prosecutor's dismissal would create, at a bare minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest.
On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced that Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, "It's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president." Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Biden than the president. It will keep the story of Biden's conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election. Senate Republicans can demand that Hunter Biden testify, and subpoena Obama White House aides to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it.
Put aside the prosecutor's firing. Hunter took the position with a Ukrainian natural gas company just a few weeks after his father visited Ukraine in 2014 to urge its government to increase its natural gas production. He had no expertise in Ukraine or natural gas. It will not just be Republicans calling this suspicious; nonpartisan experts in ethics law will testify that this a major conflict of interest.
And the focus will not just be on Ukraine but also how, as The Post reported, "for more than two decades, (Hunter's) professional work often tracked with his father's life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China."
While Senate Republicans will not remove Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide that Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need. The irony is the Democrats' investigation might do more to deny Biden the presidency than Trump.

Texto completo: On Fox News, Tucker Carlson agreed with a guest who said of allegations against President Donald Trump, “This is all acceptable political behavior by presidents.”
Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, tweeted: “House Democrats should stop lying to the American people. They aren’t concerned with the truth. They are still focused on undoing the 2016 election.”
A right-wing group, Americans for Limited Government, offered this take: “Pelosi proposes impeaching Trump for denouncing Obama-Biden-led corruption in Ukraine.”
We’re going to encounter more of these tornadoes of obfuscation in the coming months. So let’s debunk this nonsense. Whether one is for or against impeachment, facts still have value: Trump did not engage in “acceptable political behavior,” this is not about undoing the 2016 election and Biden didn’t do anything corrupt.
A starting point is the White House’s reconstruction of Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The document notes that it “is not a verbatim transcript,” and I can’t help wondering if it has been somewhat sanitized, but it is still unlike any presidential communication I can think of in my 35-year career in journalism.
Days before the call, Trump had put a hold on nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine to fend off Russian aggression. On the phone, Zelenskiy delicately raised the question of getting military aid.
“I would like you to do us a favor, though,” Trump responded. I read that “though” as meaning: Yeah, we can help you defend yourselves, but I want something from you, too. Trump then asked Zelenskiy to coordinate with Attorney General William Barr on a politically driven investigation to help Trump in 2020.
The quid pro quo was implicit — rather like the gangster who drops in on a store and offers to provide “protection.” Trump in essence was saying: Such a nice country you have. Shame if anything were to happen to it. By the way, can you do me a favor?
Just in case Zelenskiy was particularly thick, Trump noted that the U.S. had been very helpful to Ukraine, said that Ukraine had not reciprocated, held out the promise of a meeting if Zelenskiy cooperated, and repeatedly encouraged Zelenskiy to speak to Barr and to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
If it were a single reference, one might wonder how much to make of it. But here is a compilation of Trump’s hints in the call:
“I would like to have the attorney general call you. … It’s very important that you do it. … I will ask him [Giuliani] to call you along with the attorney general. … If you could speak to him, that would be great. … If you can look into it [the Biden matter] … it sounds horrible to me. … I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to [have] Attorney General Barr call. … I’m sure you will figure it out. … Your economy is going to get better and better, I predict. … I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. … Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.”
If that presidential call were set to music, it could be the soundtrack for a “Godfather” movie.
The Times reports that the acting director of national intelligence and the inspector general for the intelligence community — each appointed by Trump — both referred the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal investigation into the president’s actions.
Surprise! Barr’s Justice Department decided not to pursue the matter.
As for the assertion that the real corruption is that of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, that’s false. Ukraine said in May that there was no evidence of illegality by Hunter. I do think that he inappropriately played on his father’s job as vice president to get a board seat with a Ukrainian gas company, just as Trump’s children — and Trump himself — have monetized Trump’s presidency. But whatever Hunter’s impropriety, there is zero evidence of misconduct by his father.
Journalists may try to be evenhanded by saying that Trump did this while Biden did that. That is false equivalence. Let’s be clear: Joe Biden appears to be completely innocent of any wrongdoing in this case, while Trump tried to use the power of the federal government and almost $400 million in taxpayer money to coerce Ukraine into meddling in a U.S. election.
Fresh from allegations of collusion with Russia to win the 2016 election, Trump turns out to have been trying to collude with Ukraine to arrange foreign interference in the 2020 election.
An impeachment inquiry will now unfold, and there’s no reason to prejudge the outcome or rush the process. Let the evidence emerge and be debated.
No one should be gleeful, for an impeachment process is a trauma for our country — and I’m not sure that Democrats living in blue bubbles appreciate the risk that this process may end up helping Republican candidates.
But put politics aside.
Trump weaponized taxpayer dollars to coerce a foreign leader to target U.S. citizens with a criminal investigation, aiming to affect an American presidential election. Whether or not you believe that is impeachable, we should be able to agree that it is unconscionable.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A whistleblower complaint and Democratic outrage over President Donald Trump's discussions with the Ukrainian president have sparked yet another inquiry into Trump's interactions with foreign leaders and has spilled over into the 2020 presidential campaign.
The story folds together diplomatic efforts from both the Obama and Trump administrations. Here we've attempted to breakdown what everyone is talking about.
First, it's important to know the players, who include familiar and some not-so-familiar names. They are: Trump, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin and current Ukrainian secretary general Yuriy Lutsenko.
At the heart of the matter are two developments that took place this summer: an August whistleblower complaint by a U. S. intelligence official and a July phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Zelensky. Democrats have demanded access to the whistleblower complaint and are seeking more information about the contacts with Ukraine, including those involving Trump and his personal lawyer, Giuliani.
A secret whistleblower complaint and a phone call
The whistleblower complaint remains shrouded in secrecy but The Washington Post and The New York Times have reported that at least part of it involved Ukraine.
Democrats want to know more about Trump's efforts to push Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of Burisma Group, an energy company in Ukraine. They contend that using the levers of diplomatic engagement to dig up dirt on a political rival is an abuse of power and raises questions about whether the president's actions amount to illegal soliciting of campaign assistance from a foreign country. The issue has further fueled growing Democratic pressure to impeach Trump.
On Sunday, Trump acknowledged bringing up Biden in a phone call with Zelensky but said the talk was appropriate.
"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption – all of the corruption taking place – and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine," Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Texas and Ohio.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump asked Zelensky eight times to investigate Hunter Biden.
Hunter Biden in Ukraine
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U. S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
Shokin was accused by U. S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out.
But Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
“Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws — at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,” Lutsenko told Bloomberg. “A company can pay however much it wants to its board. ”
Hunter Biden told the Times in May that he had "no role whatsoever" in the Ukrainian investigation of the company or any of its officers. The Post has reported there is "no evidence" Biden was trying to help his son.
Trump's call with Zelensky
On July 25, Trump called Zelensky, the Ukrainian president. Trump allegedly told Zelensky he could improve that country’s image by pursuing corruption cases, according to a letter from House Democrats investigating the call.
Trump also withheld more than $250 million in security assistance that Congress had appropriated and that Ukraine desperately needed. But the Trump administration made the funding available earlier this month.
Trump-Ukraine phone call: Trump acknowledges bringing up Joe Biden in phone call with Ukraine president
The day after Trump’s call, Ambassador Kurt Volker, the U. S. special representative for Ukraine, was dispatched to meet with Zelensky. And days later, Giuliani met in Spain with Andriy Yermak, a Zelensky aide, to discuss a possible meeting between Trump and Zelensky.
Giuliani has tweeted allegations of Biden corruption repeatedly, at one point alleging “bribery, extortion, money laundering and fraud” by the Biden family in China and Ukraine.
Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield told The New York Times in May that Biden acted "without any regard for how it would or would not impact any business interests of his son, a private citizen. ”
Standoff over the whistleblower complaint
Democrats are in a standoff with the Trump administration, which is refusing to turn over to Congress an Aug. 12 complaint from a whistleblower within the intelligence community. The conflict intensified after The Washington Post reported that the whistleblower had raised concerns over Trump’s contact with the foreign leader, including a "promise" he made to the leader.
The inspector general for the director of national intelligence (DNI), Michael Atkinson, said in a Sept. 9 letter that the matter involves an "urgent concern," which is defined as "a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of the law," but "does not include differences of opinions concerning public policy matters. " Atkinson said a preliminary review found the complaint credible.
Such complaints are typically reported to Congress within seven days. But Atkinson said he hit an impasse with Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, over sharing the complaint with Congress. Atkinson said he was told by the legal counsel for the intelligence director that the complaint did not meet the definition of an “urgent concern. ” And he said the Justice Department said it did not fall under the director’s jurisdiction because it didn't involve allegations concerning a member of the intelligence community or intelligence activity.
Atkinson said in a letter to Maguire he disagreed with that Justice Department opinion.
"I set forth my reasons for concluding that the subject matter involved in the complainant's disclosure not only falls within the DNI's jurisdiction, but relates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI's responsibilities to the American people," Atkinson wrote.
The inspector general said he requested authorization to at the very least disclose the “general subject matter” to Congress but had not been allowed to do so. He said the information was “being kept” from Congress.
Biden: I never talked to son Hunter about overseas business dealings
Democrats say they have "grave" concerns about the Trump administration's refusal to allow the complaint to be disclosed to members of Congress.
“Reports of a reliable whistleblower complaint regarding the President’s communications with a foreign leader raise grave, urgent concerns for our national security,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , said in a statement. “The president and acting DNI’s stonewalling must end immediately, and the whistleblower must be provided with every protection guaranteed by the law to defend the integrity of our government and ensure accountability and trust. ”
Giuliani admits he talked to Ukraine about Biden
Congressional Democrats said they were appalled by the efforts of Trump and Giuliani to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.
"If he demanded a foreign government do his political bidding, that’s when he crossed the critical threshold," Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn. , a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote on Twitter.
The dispute had been simmering as Congress investigated what was said during the call. But it began to boil over last week when Giuliani gave an interview to CNN in which he first denied that he urged Ukraine to investigate and then acknowledged it.
“Of course I did,” Giuliani said during the rambling interview.
Giuliani said he met with Ukrainian officials on his own and then told Trump.
“I did what I did on my own,” Giuliani said. “I told him about it afterward. ”
In reaction to Trump's acknowledgment that he talked about Biden in the call with Ukraine's president, Murphy tweeted: "If an American president gets away with bullying foreign counties to do his political bidding then we should just give up and accept our new banana republic. "
Three congressional chairmen – Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N. Y. ; Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. ; and Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. – had announced Sept. 9 that they were demanding records from the White House and State Department about alleged attempts to manipulate Ukraine’s judicial system.
“As the 2020 election draws closer, President Trump and his personal attorney appear to have increased pressure on the Ukrainian government and its justice system in service of President Trump’s reelection campaign, and the White House and the State Department may be abetting this scheme,” said the letter from the Democratic chairmen.
The State Department has insisted that President Trump’s attorney is “a private citizen” who “does not speak on behalf of the U. S. Government. ” Yermak publicly stated that “it was not clear to him whether Mr. Giuliani was representing Mr. Trump in their talks. ”
The IG meets with the House Intelligence Committee
The inspector general met privately Thursday with members of the House Intelligence Committee. But Schiff, the committee chairman, said the official refused to describe the complaint, but called it “both credible and urgent. ”
The committee plans to hold a public hearing with Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, on Sept. 26. Maguire and Atkinson also are expected next week at the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Schiff said the prospect of misconduct at the highest levels of government "raises grave concerns that your office, together with the Department of Justice and possibly the White House, are engaged in an unlawful effort to protect the President and conceal from the Committee information related to his possible 'serious or flagrant' misconduct, abuse of power, or violation of law. "
Rep. David Cicilline, D-R. I. , tweeted that withholding the complaint could become another part of the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment investigation.
"This is deadly serious," Cicilline said. "If the President does not allow the whistleblower complaint against him to be turned over to Congress, we will add it to the Articles of Impeachment. "
Trump said the complaint was partisan, although he later said he didn’t know who made it.
"It’s a partisan whistleblower," Trump said.
Trump's response
Trump has said Biden should be investigated, but when speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump refused to describe his July call with the Ukrainian president and he dismissed the whistleblower complaint as a partisan attack.
"Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case," Trump said. "It's a disgrace. " Trump has denied any impropriety in the call.
"I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate," Trump said last week. "It's just another political hack job. "
Biden's response
Biden lashed out Friday at Trump's effort to push Ukraine to investigate him.
"Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one," Biden said during a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. . "So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president. ”
Biden then put out a statement Friday evening.
"If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country," the statement said. "This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation — a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia — pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor. "
Biden said on Saturday he has never spoken to his son about his business dealings overseas.
"Here’s what I know," he said. "Trump should be investigated. "

Answers to some of your questions about the Trump-Ukraine whistle-blower scandal

Texto completo: This week, House Democrats announced that they would start a formal impeachment inquiry in regards to the burgeoning Trump-Ukraine whistle-blower ordeal. We asked readers what they wanted to know more about impeachment itself, as well as Trump's actions. Below are answers to some of your questions.
Why did Joseph Maguire, the acting intelligence chief, hold on to the whistle-blower's complaint? Maguire told the House Intelligence Committee that he consulted with the White House counsel's office because the complaint included details of President Trump's phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which meant the president had executive privilege over it. He said that was “a privilege that I did not have authority to waive."
He also said the IC [Intelligence Community] Whistle-blower Act required him to forward the complaint to Congress if it was a serious problem and if it involved someone in the intelligence community. Since Trump is “outside the Intelligence Community" his office consulted with the Department of Justice, which found the complaint did not meet the legal standard and didn't have to be released.
The White House later dropped its resistance to releasing both a rough transcript of the phone call and the whistle-blower complaint.
How long before the leaked phone conversation took place did Trump put a hold on the Ukraine aid? Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, in mid-July to hold back almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. The whistle-blower said in the complaint the word went out on July 18 and neither Office of Management and Budget nor National Security Council staff knew why the instruction had been issued. Trump and Zelensky spoke for 30 minutes on the telephone on July 24 and Trump repeatedly prodded the new leader to investigate his Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son.
When will the Democrats hold a formal vote to open up an impeachment inquiry? During the Nixon and Clinton impeachment efforts, the full House voted for resolutions directing the House Judiciary Committee to open the inquiries. But it is not clear whether that step is strictly necessary, because impeachment proceedings against other officials, like a former federal judge in 1989, began at the committee level.
Pelosi is reportedly planning to move forward without a resolution.
At her news conference Tuesday announcing the impeachment inquiry, she said she had directed the chairmen of the six committees that have already been investigating Mr. Trump to “proceed under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry." In a closed-door meeting earlier in the day, she said the panels should put together their best cases on potentially impeachable offenses by the president and send them to the Judiciary Committee, two officials familiar with the conversation told The New York Times.
Who is the whistle-blower? The whistle-blower's identity has not been released.
Maguire, the intelligence chief who testified Thursday before the House Intelligence Committe about releasing the whistle-blower's complaint, said that he doesn't know the person's identity, and that no one in the administration has asked him to find it.
He also said the intelligence community's inspector general, who received the report, was “properly protecting" the whistleblower's identity.
“And of course, you will do everything you can to protect the whistle-blower from any attempts to retaliate against him or her, correct?" Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois asked.
“I will not permit the whistle-blower to be subject to any retaliation or adverse consequences for going to the IG. I am absolutely committed to that," Maguire replied.

Texto completo: Every good story needs a hero, and the saga of Brett Kavanaugh’s rise to the Supreme Court has provided one: Leland Keyser.
She also became a victim when her longtime friend, Christine Blasey Ford, decided to hit refresh on a decades-old high school incident that apparently only Ford remembers.
Keyser is the other female student whom Ford named as having been at the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly pinned her down on a bed and groped her. She is also the friend who swore under penalty of perjury that she doesn’t recall such a party or, in fact, ever having met Kavanaugh. Her comments echoed those of the other partygoers Ford named, none of whom remembered such a gathering.
This isn’t what places Keyser on the heroes’ roster. What earns her that distinction is her steadfastness, at great personal suffering, in refusing to change her story despite what she describes as pressure to she rethink her initial statement. According to a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" by New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, some of Keyser’s erstwhile friends and acquaintances tried to persuade her to say she didn’t remember the party, not that it didn’t happen.
Keyser, reportedly a registered Democrat, has become increasingly convinced that Ford’s story isn’t true and doesn’t make sense, according to the book.
According to the book, Ford’s team of friends and advisers apparently saw Keyser as an obstacle to Ford’s narrative and brainstormed ways for her to get onboard. The book cites a group text among Ford’s acquaintances from soon after her testimony. Cheryl Amitay, who attended the same girls’ high school as Ford, wrote: "Maybe one of you guys who are friends with [Keyser] can have a heart-to-heart."
A man who had gone to a neighboring boys’ school chimed in: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is." To which Amitay responded, "Leland is a major stumbling block."
Keyser, a former professional golfer who has undergone numerous operations on her back and neck, has suffered addiction during her adult life. Although recovering, she told Kelly and Pogrebin she was concerned that this history would be used against her if she didn’t come up with a more-acceptable recollection of events. When pressed, however, she refused to take the easy route and protect herself.
For her integrity and valor under perceived pressure, she has been punished. Even Ford seemed to turn on her old friend, mentioning Keyser’s "significant health challenges," during her testimony, and seeming to suggest that her friend might have diminished capacities: "I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs."
This may have been one of the sweetest condemnations in the history of tossing inconvenient friends under the bus. But, importantly, Ford planted a seed of doubt about Keyser’s credibility, which has been cultivated by the Times writers. On CNN’s "Reliable Sources" Sunday, Kelly pointed to Keyser’s "memory issues ... because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges."
Oof. What a gut punch. If no one in recovery can ever be trusted again, then the world of rehabilitative addiction therapy may as well shutter its doors.
In fact, Keyser remembers very well the summer of 1982, when Ford believes the alleged incident occurred. It was the year after her grandmother introduced her to golf and Keyser became consumed with the sport, according to another book published this past summer, "Justice on Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Keyser worked full-time in the golf pro shop at a Washington-area country club and had little time for socializing. Her hard work at school and in sports paid off with stellar grades, seven varsity letters, and acceptance to the University of Virginia, followed by a professional golfing career and a coaching position at Georgetown University.
Today, Keyser keeps a low profile, as was always her preference. She is, indeed, in fragile health from her injuries and surgeries. But Keyser can stand tall for having remained true to her convictions despite being exposed and pressured by those who seemed to have used her struggles against her. In my book, that’s heroic.

Texto completo: The percentage of Long Islanders without health insurance dropped below 4% in 2018, continuing a steady yearslong decline in the rate of the uninsured, as nationally that number rose in 2018 for the first time since the Affordable Care Act went into effect.
The proportion of people in Nassau County without health insurance fell from 4.8% in 2017 to 3.9% in 2018, and in Suffolk County it dropped from 4.5% to 3.9%, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates released early Thursday.
The census data also showed that the median household income on Long Island was up and commute times were longer.
In 2010, when the Affordable Care Act - also known as Obamacare - was enacted, the uninsured rate in both counties was above 10%. The law went into full effect in 2014. The percentage of people statewide without health insurance also has declined sharply since 2010.
Nationally, the percentage of Americans without health care coverage rose from 7.9% in 2017 to 8.5% in 2018, according to census data released earlier this month.
Efforts nationally "to make it challenging" for people to enroll in Affordable Care Act coverage and the Trump administration's rhetoric assailing the law contrast with New York State's promotion of it, a key reason New Yorkers are more likely to have health insurance than other Americans, said Rebecca Sanin, president and CEO of the Health and Welfare Council of Long Island.
"New York State, having its [health insurance] marketplace, has always worked hard to protect New Yorkers' access to health care," she said. "So there's a public messaging about the fact we want people to be insured in New York State that has been intentional and consistent."
The Trump administration cut funding to promote the Affordable Care Act and help people with the enrollment process.
New York State has its own health insurance marketplace. Many states use a federal insurance exchange, and the impact of reduced promotion of the law likely is greatest in those states, said Dr. Norman Edelman, a professor at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University and an expert in public health.
Part of the reason for the rise in the number of uninsured people nationally is a drop in the number of people on Medicaid, census data shows. Edelman said that may partly be because, with unemployment low, more people have employer-based coverage.
Brian Blase, a former special assistant for health care policy in the Trump administration, told The New York Times that the drop in Medicaid coverage also may be because some people who enrolled in the program after the law went into effect weren't eligible and "my sense is in 2018 states probably started tightening eligibility."
Sanin said the Trump administration's immigration rhetoric also had an effect, even with people who are U.S. citizens but have family members living in the country illegally worried about scrutiny and less likely to enroll or stay in government programs.
The census data also showed that the median household income for Long Islanders rose by several thousand dollars between 2017 and 2018, and by more than 9% since 2014, using 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars.
In Nassau County, the median household income rose from $110,892 in 2017 to $116,304 in 2018. In Suffolk, it increased from $97,046 to $100,468.
That is reflective of "a very strong economy and more people working than ever before," said Kevin Law, president and CEO of the Long Island Association, the region's largest business group.
Nassau County median incomes long have been higher than Suffolk's in large part because "over 30% of Nassau residents still work in New York City, and New York City wages are higher, predominantly, than Long Island wages," he said.
The large amount of Nassau residents working in the five boroughs also explains why the median commute time is longer for Nassau than Suffolk residents: 37.4 minutes for Nassau residents and 33.3 minutes for Suffolk residents, Law said.
The census data revealed that commute times on Long Island continue to grow. They're up by more than three minutes compared with 2010.
Law said that's because with "more people working, more people are on the roads."
"I remember in 2008 and 2009 and 2010 when I was commuting from St. James to Uniondale, the traffic wasn't that bad," he said. "And a big reason for that was the higher unemployment rate."
BY THE NUMBERS The percent of people without health insurance in New York and Long Island fell significantly between 2010 and 2018. New York State, 2010: 11.9% New York State, 2018: 5.4% Nassau County, 2010: 10.2% Nassau County, 2018: 3.9% Suffolk County, 2010: 10.4% Suffolk County, 2018: 3.9% SOURCE: U.S. CENSUS BUREAU ESTIMATES

Republican contempt for the will of voters... [Derived Headline]

Texto completo: Republican contempt for the will of voters
“Why Republicans play dirty” is the headline of a recent New York Times opinion piece by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt. They make the case that the hardball tactics of the Republican Party subvert the spirit of the law and pose a threat to American democracy. With too many examples to cite, just look up Merrick Garland.
What is driving Republicans to play dirty? The answer is fear – fear of being displaced as the Grand Old Party slips increasingly out of step with a changing national demographic. The prospect of losing elections as the electorate itself changes is seen as an existential threat, ergo less-than-democratic tactics become acceptable and even necessary.
The authors of the article claim: “Democracy requires that parties know how to lose. Politicians who fail to win elections must be willing to accept defeat, go home, and get ready to play again the next day. This norm of gracious losing is essential to a healthy democracy.” I would add that democracy flourishes when gracious losers join with gracious winners in finding common purpose.
Nothing is more important to a healthy democracy than fair elections. Unfortunately, voter suppression and gerrymandering remain much in favor on the Republican side, and New Hampshire is hardly immune from these partisan ailments. Take redistricting. There is perhaps no greater blow to fair and democratic representation than the recent defeat of House Bill 706 at the hands of Gov. Chris Sununu and his partisan cohorts.
This bill would have established an independent redistricting committee and put a happy end to gerrymandered districts. But the demise of this noble effort was not all. The governor vetoed more than 50 bills (easily a record), almost all of which were unable to pass with the necessary two-thirds override. I wonder at the arrogance it takes for the elected person in charge to ignore so profoundly the will of the electorate.

Reporting and Chewing Gum at the Same Time

Texto completo: Davey Alba, a Times newcomer who reports on disinformation, has a taste for Ice Breakers and a trick for saving audio from her computer.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Davey Alba, who covers disinformation, discussed the tech she's using.
You joined The Times in August. How does the tech setup in The Times newsroom differ from other places that you've worked?
One thing that's unique about working in the Times newsroom is how security-focused it is. Not only does The Times give away webcam covers during orientation (along with stickers and swag), but the Slack culture in the newsroom is rather ... quiet. I guess it makes sense if you think about all the unflattering chat and data leaks that have made the news in recent months, but it's a change I have yet to get used to.
The upside is that this has prompted me to get coffee with other reporters and editors in my first few days here, and that's been nice! Imagine that: a tech reporter who is used to communicating virtually and online being forced to meet colleagues in person to chat.
In terms of gadgets, software and apps, the usual suspects are standard at The Times. I use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp to speak with sources securely. I use Dataminr to surface the news that's starting to bubble up in social media. And I'm ashamed how long this took, but I finally set up an account with a password manager for all my online logins. I use 1Password -- the company made accounts for journalists free on World Press Freedom Day, and I really appreciated that.
LinkedIn does the same and offers journalists the Premium tier if you go through its annual training. LinkedIn messaging has saved my butt several times while I was reporting.
What are your go-to tech tools for work?
Some of this is going to be embarrassingly low tech, but the best work hacks often are.
Every day, I make sure these things are on hand for me while writing and reporting: gum, stamps, AAA batteries, my voice recorder and telephone pickup microphone, the TapeACall app on my phone, and noise-canceling headphones.
I'm a gum addict. Chewing steadily helps me think while I'm typing away, but I also toss gum pretty quickly -- as soon as it loses its flavor. So I've got to have a good supply right at my desk and at home, too. (Fun fact: Some of my ex-colleagues and I used to take turns buying packs of gum in bulk, and we worked on a spreadsheet of the best gum brands. Right now, my favorite is Ice Breakers Peppermint Ice Cubes.)
The stamps are for filing Freedom of Information Act requests. Maddeningly, there are still government agencies that don't list emails for their public records offices, or don't have online portals for them, and I'm a pretty impatient person. When I get an idea for a FOIA, I try to write, address and affix the stamps to the letters and send them off in the same day. (Government agencies can take a long time to respond to FOIAs.)
My AAA battery reserve (40 pieces), voice recorder and telephone pickup mic are a trio that always stay together. (I use TapeACall, the voice call recording app, as backup when I somehow forget these things at home.) One trick I learned a few years ago is that you can record audio webcasts from your laptop by putting the telephone pickup earbud in your ear while it's connected to your recorder; then you wear your headphones over the earbud. Voilà -- that lets you create an audio recording of anything playing on your laptop.
You cover disinformation. What is the difference between disinformation and misinformation?
Disinformation involves nefarious individuals -- state-sponsored actors, or just online trolls -- seeking to deliberately and maliciously spread harmful, false messages to a vulnerable public.
In my opinion, it is much more insidious than misinformation, the process by which false news spreads by accident, with people often unwittingly sharing fake or conspiracy content.
How big an issue do you expect disinformation to be in the run-up to the 2020 American presidential election?
Huge. It's almost cripplingly terrifying to imagine the machinations being planned right now.
There will be things we expect, and things we haven't even discovered yet. We'll need a lot of people working on raising the curtain on disinformation in the next few months. And it won't just be in the run-up to the 2020 election in the United States -- this will happen all over the world.
One thing I always meditate on is how shallow my understanding of George Orwell's "1984," and the idea of propaganda in general, was when I was a kid. It was unfathomable to me that you could blast something on television, or inundate the streets with fliers, and people would unquestioningly believe the messages these mediums carried. Growing up, I'd think: Surely the internet, with all of its ability to deliver instantaneous fact-checking, would render the tactic useless, a relic of the past?
Turns out all you needed was Facebook to make propaganda as effective as ever.
Outside of work, what is your favorite tech gadget or app or tool, and why?
Hurrah, a non-doomsday question!
Outside of work, I love spoiling my two cats, Vivienne and Laser Beam, with high-tech things. Don't judge me.
I've got an automatic feeder (necessary), I have customized Popsockets with their faces on it, and I have bought this thing called the Mousr -- a robotic mouse with a feather tail that you can drive with your smartphone. (Vivienne loves it, and Laser Beam is so afraid of it.)
You have family in the Philippines. What tech is big there, and what do you use to communicate with family there?
Oh, it's all Facebook. And (the Facebook-owned) WhatsApp for instant messaging. My relatives, friends and everyone I met growing up have accounts on the platform, and without it I would never be able to keep up with family or reconnect with old pals.
I make sure I don't upload my WhatsApp backups to the cloud, though. I'm not going to pull a Paul Manafort and have my messages subject to subpoena by the government -- even if most of my WhatsApp messages are just silly texts to my mom.

Texto completo: At Scarsdale High School, a social studies class drew national press.
In the last year of the 1960s, a political poster began showing up on dorm room walls. It showed a hand holding up two fingers in a peace symbol, captioned "1966." Below that, in a second image captioned "1967," the index finger was lowered, middle finger up. "1968" was symbolized with a raised fist. The final image depicted an index finger extended horizontally, with the thumb pointed upward like the hammer of a pistol. That was 1969 -- a year when a taste for political violence had even spread to high schools in high-income New York suburbs.
By then, formerly pacifist antiwar activists had begun drilling with M1 rifles -- part of what the newly formed Weathermen called "bringing the war home." The cutting edge of the civil rights movement was game-planning military sorties as much as marches. And even a review in The New York Times praised a book titled "Look Out, Whitey! Black Power's Gon' Get Your Mama!" as an account that "arcs over the rotting outposts of the Republic like a mortar shell shedding its sulphurous glare, and lands plump in the heartland to detonate the conclusion that 'it is clear that America as it now exists must be destroyed."'
The spring of 1969 had brought a wave of student takeovers of university buildings. The most dramatic ended when members of Cornell University's Afro-American Society exited the student union building armed with rifles supplied to them by members of Students for a Democratic Society -- one with a bandoleer of shotgun shells across his chest. Then, hundreds of students eagerly fell into line behind the militants as they led a procession through the center of campus.
The coming 1969-70 school year was anticipated with fear and trembling. It was one of the reasons Woodstock was greeted so rapturously that August -- and not just by the young people Abbie Hoffman immediately christened "Woodstock Nation": It hadn't descended into "Lord of the Flies," as many people had fully expected. Instead, "Bethel produced a feeling of friendship, camaraderie, and -- an overused phrase -- a sense of love among those present," as Time magazine put it.
A suggestion of how well-placed that paranoia was could be found in an astonishing item of the front page of The Times, the morning of Woodstock's first day, Aug. 15. "Guerrilla War Tactics Taught at Scarsdale High," it was headlined. It described an elective course from the elite suburban high school's summer session, which awarded a half credit toward graduation. It was accompanied by a photograph captioned, "Stephen Kling, teacher, waves toy gun and holds 'grenade.' With him are male students and girl portraying a peasant."
Mr. Kling explained, "Revolution and guerrilla warfare are happening all over the world, and I think students in Scarsdale should know about it." He had also taught the course the previous year -- when field day took place not in the woods along the Bronx River Parkway but in Scarsdale itself, whose "takeover" the students strategized by studying the vulnerabilities of its public buildings and infrastructure. ("We found the village would be very easy to sabotage.") One pupil received an A for a paper in which she discussed adding LSD to the water supply.
The superintendent of schools was quoted as finding nothing to object to in the class. Another administrator, a bit more defensive, said Scarsdale High encouraged offerings that were "relevant to today's world." He continued, "We have lots of unorthodox courses in our curriculum. Why, we have courses in black-white relations, science fiction and mythology."
Mr. Kling, for his part, insisted his course had no ideological agenda, adding, "I don't believe that a public school should organize students for action."
It is reasonable to surmise, however, some of his pupils saw it as more than just a social studies lesson. One underground high school newspaper published in New York City that year was called The Street Fighter. An essay in another, collected in a volume called "How Old Will You Be in 1984?: Expressions of Student Outrage from the High School Free Press," proposed a strategy for shutting down schools by destroying all paper forms: "The success of a coup d'état is dependent upon the amount of confusion that can be created in the establishment during the actual takeover." A student interviewed for another book, "The High School Revolutionaries," promised, "The pigs' schools will be destroyed unless they serve the people."
That spring had seen an epidemic of student uprisings in New York City high schools, heralded by a citywide high school underground newspaper: "From April 21 to May 19 is our month! The streets, the schools, the communities are all ours, we're going to take them back." (Demands included sharing hiring and dismissal power with students and an end to suspensions.) One day of action saw fires at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn and DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, and the smashing of the windshield of a police cruiser in Queens.
And all signs suggested that the next school term would be uglier. At Georgetown, a senior administrator reported, "The freshmen are much more radical than the seniors, and I'm told the high school students coming up are even more so." Though the underground paper The Berkeley Barb put it more colorfully: "Che Guevara is thirteen years old, and he is not doing his homework." And here they were, a concerned Times reader could marvel, out in the woods practicing their tactics, with their teacher leading the rebel contingent. So, the fact that a half-million young people could come together in Yasgur's field and the worst that came of it were some bad acid trips was an enormous relief.
Perhaps, just perhaps, 1969 was a more innocent time after all. Along the Bronx River Parkway, The Times reported: "The game was briefly interrupted by two Scarsdale policemen. They said they had received a call from an unidentified woman that teen-agers armed with guns were running through the woods.
"The policemen left after Mr. Kling assured them that the guns were toys."
Rick Perlstein is the author of "The Invisible Bridge: The Fall of Nixon and the Rise of Reagan."

Texto completo: SAN RAFAEL >> Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, whose words captivated perhaps the most dedicated fan base in rock 'n' roll for generations, diedMonday at his home in San Rafael, his family announced Tuesday. He was 78.
No cause of death was listed but The New York Times reported he recently had surgery.
"It is with great sadness we confirm our beloved Robert passed away yesterday night. He died peacefully at home in his bed, surrounded by love. His wife Maureen was by his side holding his hand," a statement from the family read.
Although he didn't perform as part of the Grateful Dead, Hunter was arguably as much responsible for the success and longevity of the Bay Area band as Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh and the other players in the band.
Deadheads as the band's passionate fans are called treasured Hunter's words every bit as much as they did Garcia's guitar solos.
Indeed, it was Hunter's strikingly poetic lyrics in such classic Dead songs as "Box of Rain," "Uncle John's Band," "He's Gone" and "Touch of Grey" that helped set the Dead apart from the jam bands that followed. And although the Grateful Dead officially disbanded not long after Garcia's death in 1995, Hunter's songs are still being being played regularly by the band's various offshoots, such as Dead & Company, which performed before huge crowds during a two-night stand at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View earlier this year.
"As the Dead's lyricist, Hunter was the ideal combination of madman visionary after hearing Dark Star' for the first time, he dashed off transcendent words that captured the psychedelic nature of the song perfectly and a meticulous craftsman deeply rooted in poets from (Rainer Maria) Rilke to T.S. Eliot, whom he, in fact, partially quoted in at least one song," says band historian Dennis McNally.
Hunter, who collaborated mostly with Garcia on songs for the Dead, remained something of a mystery, mostly staying out of the limelight, even when the Dead was at the height of its commercial powers. He rarely consented to interview requests.
"As a person, he was sensitive and occasionally grumpy but one of the central moral voices of the band the reason that you don't hear "Truckin' " as the soundtrack to too many commercials is because he wouldn't allow it," said McNally. He guarded his privacy, "which kept him devoted to his craft in a way we're all pardon me grateful for," McNally added.
Still, many listeners felt like they knew Hunter perhaps because there was such a clear, distinctive voice to his work. He was a master storyteller, spinning yarns that at their best felt as timeless as anything created in rock 'n' roll history.
Yet, there was a duality to the lyrics. His words to a song like "Jack Straw" come across as if they might have been penned in the 1930s.
But there was also an element to Hunter's writing that connected to what was happening in the counterculture of the '60s and '70s.
"Hunter tapped into his generation the same way (Bob) Dylan did," Mike Campbell, lead guitarist of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, was quoted as saying in Rolling Stone magazine. "People will look back and say, That's American culture represented in music.'
"He captured the hippie freedom, the mentality of the little guy against the corporation. A lot of the songs are about gambling, card playing and riverboat guys who'll cut your throat if you look the wrong way."
One thing is for sure: His lyrics have lost none of their poignancy over the decades.
And they should only continue to capture the hearts and minds of fans for generations to come.
"For his fans that have loved and supported him all these years, take comfort in knowing that his words are all around us, and in that way (he) is never truly gone," the statement from the Hunter family read. "In this time of grief please celebrate him the way you all know how, by being together and listening to the music."
Born June 23, 1941 in the San Luis Obispo area, Hunter grew up an avid reader, devouring works by such authors as William Saroyan and T.S. Eliot, and later became fascinated with Pete Seeger and other musicians.
He was in the Bay Area by 1960, where he met Garcia (reportedly at a performance of the musical "Damn Yankees") and the two formed a folk music duo called Bob and Jerry. The partnership flourished after Garcia co-founded the Grateful Dead in Palo Alto in 1965 and the two soon began crafting such gems as "China Cat Sunflower" and "St. Stephen," with Garcia handling the music side and Hunter supplying the words.
He'd go on to also write songs with other band members, including Bob Weir ("Jack Straw," "Sugar Magnolia") and Phil Lesh ("Box of Rain"), as well as release several albums of his own as well as books of poetry.
He also collaborated with Elvis Costello, Bruce Hornsby, Jim Lauderdale and Bob Dylan, who, according to Rolling Stone, once said of Hunter: "We both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting."
But it was his affiliation with the Dead that defined Hunter's career. So much so that he was enshrined with the group into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has formally announced an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, meaning the investigations currently underway from several key House committees are now under an impeachment umbrella.
But the Ukraine scandal is still unfolding, and there are important developments that are expected in the coming hours and days. Already Wednesday morning, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff sent demands for documents related to the whistle-blower complaint, and the Trump administration released a memo summarizing the call with Ukraine's leader. The situation is volatile and things can change rapidly, but here's a look at key events we'll be following over the next two days:
Wednesday House vote on whistle-blower resolution: The full House is expected to vote on a resolution demanding the Trump administration turn over the contents of the whistle-blower complaint.
Timeline: The House is expected to debate the resolution at noon.
Trump meets with the Ukrainian president at the United Nations: President Trump has a series of meetings with foreign leaders scheduled at the United Nations, including with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian leader he pressured to investigate former vice president Joe Biden.
Timeline: Scheduled for 2:15 p.m.
Trump holds a press conference: President Trump is holding a press conference at the United Nations Wednesday afternoon. The press conference is ostensibly about Trump's meetings with foreign leaders, however it's fair to predict the questions from reporters will focus on his communication with one particular leader, Zelensky of Ukraine.
Timeline: Scheduled for 4 p.m.
Thursday Acting Director of National Intelligence testifies: Joseph Maguire, who took over for Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, is expected to testify publicly before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Watch for Democrats to press him on the contents of the whistle-blower complaint and his decision to stop the complaint from being forwarded to Congress, as is required by law.
Timeline: Scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday
Any day Release of redacted whistle-blower complaint: According to the New York Times, the Trump administration is moving toward releasing the redacted contents of the whistle-blower complaint that has been at the center of a legal battle. The process could be completed within days, the paper reported.
Timeline: Uncertain

Texto completo: EPA targets California over poor air quality, rules backlog
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration on Tuesday blamed California's worst-in-the nation air quality on shoddy paperwork, calling on the state to overhaul its plans for cleaning up toxic smog or risk losing billions in federal road dollars.
The government's warning comes days after the Trump administration moved to block the state's emission standards for cars and trucks, a move that would eliminate California's most important weapon for combating its biggest source of pollution.
Tuesday's announcement by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler chastised California for its backlog of pending rules and regulations to reduce pollution in areas that do not meet federal air quality standards.
"It makes no sense," said Gay MacGregor, a former senior policy adviser for the EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality from 1983 until 2016. "What they are doing today is basically punishing California for EPA's own inaction."
The federal government sets rules for pollution. Lots of places in the country don't meet those standards. But no state has more problems than California, where 85% of the population -- 34 million people -- breathe dirty air.
Federal law requires states to come up with a plan on how to reduce pollution. Those plans must be approved by the EPA. The federal agency has a backlog of these plans awaiting approval, and California accounts for about one-third of the total.
The EPA says it plans to issue $40 million in grants to help areas around the country meet federal air quality standards.

Unmarried partners in US have tripled in 2 decades, report says
A new U.S. Census Bureau report says the number of unmarried partners living together has tripled in the past two decades due to social acceptance.
The report released this week says the number went from nearly 6 million in 1996 to 19.1 million in 2018.
The report says unmarried partners are older, better educated, more likely to earn higher wages and more racially diverse than in the past.
Benjamin Gurrentz, a bureau survey statistician, writes that the growth in unmarried cohabitation reflects an increasing normalization. It's also viewed as an alternative to marriage for low-income and less educated people.
As a group, unmarried partners are still small compared to married partners, who numbered 127 million in 2018.
The report used data from the Current Population Survey.

Massachusetts temporarily bans sale of vaping products
BOSTON -- The governor of Massachusetts on Tuesday declared a public health emergency and ordered a four-month ban on the sale of vaping products in the state.
Republican Gov. Charlie Baker's order appears to be the first of its kind in the nation, though at least two states, Michigan and New York, have moved to ban vaping flavors.
His announcement came amid growing concern about the health effects of vaping products.
Baker said that during the ban, the administration will work with medical experts, state and federal officials to better understand vaping illnesses and address this public health crisis.
The administration will also work on providing more resources for a public awareness campaign and smoking cessation programs, he said.

300 sent notices for jury duty in newspaper shooting case
ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- The judge in the case of the man charged with killing five people in 2018 at a Maryland newspaper said Tuesday that 300 potential jurors are coming to court late this week to answer a questionnaire ahead of next month's jury selection.
Anne Arundel Circuit Court Judge Laura Ripken outlined the plans at a hearing in the case of Jarrod Ramos, who has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges. Ramos also has pleaded not criminally responsible, Maryland's version of an insanity defense.
Jury selection is set to begin Oct. 30 and last for three days.
The trial is set to begin Nov. 4.
If he is found guilty, a second phase would determine whether his mental state made him not criminally responsible.

Karzai says Afghan election threatens peace
KABUL, Afghanistan -- A presidential election that is days away in Afghanistan threatens the best chance of making peace with the Taliban and ending 18 years of war, former President Hamid Karzai said Tuesday.
The Taliban, with whom the U.S. abruptly ended peace talks this month, have threatened Afghans who go to the polls Saturday.
He called for an immediate resumption of peace talks not only between the United States and the Taliban, but also between the insurgent group and Afghan leaders.
With 18 candidates for president on the ballot, the majority are not campaigning, and some have thrown their support behind others.
Many supporters are also heavily armed, adding to fears that a contested election could result in violence.

Trump's Senate allies give OK to $5B wall request
WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's Senate GOP allies are pushing to give him his full $5 billion request to build about 200 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, but the plan ran into immediate opposition from Democrats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
The wall money is contained in a $71 billion draft funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security that cleared its first, easiest hurdle in a Senate panel Tuesday.
A heated debate awaits Thursday, when Democrats promise votes to cut back the border wall funding.
"If Republicans stand with President Trump, they will be saying they fully support allowing the president to take money from our military to fund the border wall," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

In New York: The New York Times says it turned to the Irish government to rescue a reporter threatened with arrest in Egypt two years ago out of concern that the Trump administration wouldn't help.
Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger revealed the incident during a speech at Brown University and in an op-ed. Sulzberger said the paper was warned by a U.S. government official that Egypt planned to seize reporter Declan Walsh.
The official said the Trump administration intended to let the arrest be carried out.
The paper turned to Ireland, where Walsh is a citizen, and one of that country's diplomats helped the reporter get out of Egypt.

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO, Calif. - The Trump administration on Tuesday blamed California's worst-in-the nation air quality on shoddy paperwork, calling on the state to overhaul its plans for cleaning up toxic smog or risk losing billions in federal road dollars.
The government's warning comes days after the Trump administration moved to block the state's emission standards for cars and trucks, a move that would eliminate California's most important weapon for combating its biggest source of pollution.
Tuesday's announcement by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler chastised California for its backlog of pending rules and regulations to reduce pollution in areas that do not meet federal air quality standards.
"It makes no sense," said Gay MacGregor, a former senior policy adviser for the EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality from 1983 until 2016. "What they are doing today is basically punishing California for EPA's own inaction."
The federal government sets rules for pollution. Lots of places in the country don't meet those standards. But no state has more problems than California, where 85% of the population - 34 million people - breathe dirty air.
Federal law requires states to come up with a plan on how to reduce pollution. Those plans must be approved by the EPA. The federal agency has a backlog of these plans awaiting approval, and California accounts for about one-third of the total.
The EPA says it plans to issue $40 million in grants to help areas around the country meet federal air quality standards.
Unmarried partners in US have tripled in 2 decades, report says
A new U.S. Census Bureau report says the number of unmarried partners living together has tripled in the past two decades due to social acceptance.
The report released this week says the number went from nearly 6 million in 1996 to 19.1 million in 2018.
The report says unmarried partners are older, better educated, more likely to earn higher wages and more racially diverse than in the past.
Benjamin Gurrentz, a bureau survey statistician, writes that the growth in unmarried cohabitation reflects an increasing normalization. It's also viewed as an alternative to marriage for low-income and less educated people.
As a group, unmarried partners are still small compared to married partners, who numbered 127 million in 2018.
The report used data from the Current Population Survey.
Massachusetts temporarily bans sale of vaping products
BOSTON - The governor of Massachusetts on Tuesday declared a public health emergency and ordered a four-month ban on the sale of vaping products in the state.
Republican Gov. Charlie Baker's order appears to be the first of its kind in the nation, though at least two states, Michigan and New York, have moved to ban vaping flavors.
His announcement came amid growing concern about the health effects of vaping products.
Baker said that during the ban, the administration will work with medical experts, state and federal officials to better understand vaping illnesses and address this public health crisis.
The administration will also work on providing more resources for a public awareness campaign and smoking cessation programs, he said.
300 sent notices for jury duty
in newspaper shooting case
ANNAPOLIS, Md. - The judge in the case of the man charged with killing five people in 2018 at a Maryland newspaper said Tuesday that 300 potential jurors are coming to court late this week to answer a questionnaire ahead of next month's jury selection.
Anne Arundel Circuit Court Judge Laura Ripken outlined the plans at a hearing in the case of Jarrod Ramos, who has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges. Ramos also has pleaded not criminally responsible, Maryland's version of an insanity defense.
Jury selection is set to begin Oct. 30 and last for three days.
The trial is set to begin Nov. 4.
If he is found guilty, a second phase would determine whether his mental state made him not criminally responsible.
Karzai says Afghan election threatens peace
KABUL, Afghanistan - A presidential election that is days away in Afghanistan threatens the best chance of making peace with the Taliban and ending 18 years of war, former President Hamid Karzai said Tuesday.
The Taliban, with whom the U.S. abruptly ended peace talks this month, have threatened Afghans who go to the polls Saturday.
He called for an immediate resumption of peace talks not only between the United States and the Taliban, but also between the insurgent group and Afghan leaders.
With 18 candidates for president on the ballot, the majority are not campaigning, and some have thrown their support behind others.
Many supporters are also heavily armed, adding to fears that a contested election could result in violence.
Trump's Senate allies give OK to $5B wall request
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's Senate GOP allies are pushing to give him his full $5 billion request to build about 200 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, but the plan ran into immediate opposition from Democrats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
The wall money is contained in a $71 billion draft funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security that cleared its first, easiest hurdle in a Senate panel Tuesday.
A heated debate awaits Thursday, when Democrats promise votes to cut back the border wall funding.
"If Republicans stand with President Trump, they will be saying they fully support allowing the president to take money from our military to fund the border wall," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
In New York: The New York Times says it turned to the Irish government to rescue a reporter threatened with arrest in Egypt two years ago out of concern that the Trump administration wouldn't help.
Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger revealed the incident during a speech at Brown University and in an op-ed. Sulzberger said the paper was warned by a U.S. government official that Egypt planned to seize reporter Declan Walsh.
The official said the Trump administration intended to let the arrest be carried out.
The paper turned to Ireland, where Walsh is a citizen, and one of that country's diplomats helped the reporter get out of Egypt.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Republicans appear to be sticking by President Donald Trump despite concerns he sought foreign help to discredit Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
The latest controversy riling up the White House revolves around Trump's contacts with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, a whistleblower complaint at a U.S. intelligence agency and whether Trump conditioned the granting military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into the former Vice President's son, Hunter Biden.
Trump has acknowledged bringing up Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic 2020 presidential contender, in a July phone call with Zelensky, but he denied offering the aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden.
"I didn't do it," Trump told reporters on Monday in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Many Senate Republicans on Monday resisted saying too much about the controversy, dodging questions by reporters and stressing that none of the information about the complaint or the president's conversations has been verified. But others downplayed the issue, saying this was another attempt by Democrats to amplify impeachment efforts. Some also repeated comments that the president himself has made that Biden should be investigated and that's what the media should be focusing on.
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin met with Zelensky in Ukraine earlier this month and said before his visit, he talked with Trump on the phone. Johnson said he hoped he could convince Trump to approve of the aid so he could relay that message in person to Zelensky. Trump declined.
"The rationale that he gave [me] is the concern about corruption in Ukraine, which is what I relayed to President Zelensky, and they all acknowledge it. It's why he won the election. They're trying to rid the country of corruption," Johnson said, adding Trump "did not mention anything about Joe Biden or anything" during their phone call.
Johnson said he didn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be made available to Congress, nor should a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. "It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have."
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue." He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner."
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum."
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it."
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance."
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that's a quid-pro-quo." She said it would be "helpful" having a transcript of the president's call and more information on the whistleblower complaint from the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Both the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the inspector general Michael Atkinson could appear this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
The prosecutor was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

Texto completo: Just as the aftershocks of the special counsel's Russia investigation seemed to have settled, the latest tremblor out of the Oval Office is whether the president used the levers of his foreign policy toward Ukraine for political gain.
A confidential whistleblower report might provide an answer. But once again, the nation's democratic processes are falling short of providing Americans what they need to decide whether Donald Trump did something wrong.
Short of someone violating the law by leaking that whistleblower complaint, or the whistleblower risking retaliation by bravely going to Congress, there's no quick or certain process for the public to learn its contents.
There is, however, a steady drip of news media reports, and a few admissions by Trump himself on Sunday.
According to The Washington Post and The New York Times, a whistleblower complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general focused on a promise Trump made during a phone call on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
During that conversation, Trump asked the Kiev leader to investigate a key political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter, regarding the younger Biden's past business dealings in Ukraine.
Still unclear is whether there's any connection between Trump's desire for dirt on the Bidens and $250 million in U.S. military aid for Ukraine, which is engaged in a five-year conflict with pro-Russian separatists. The aid was inexplicably delayed, then released a day after Congress raised concerns about the whistleblower complaint.
Was a meeting with Zelensky or the promise of Ukrainian assistance somehow, by inference or otherwise, made contingent on Kiev investigating Biden? If true, that would be a gross abuse of presidential power.
Trump acknowledged Sunday that he spoke with Zelensky about Biden, defending the conversation as appropriate and "perfect." If that's the case, why not make everything public?
The intelligence community's inspector general, Trump appointee Michael Atkinson, was so troubled by the whistleblower's report that he deemed it of "urgent concern."
The law requires that an urgent-concern whistleblower complaint "shall" be turned over to Congress. But the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, blocked this on the grounds that the alleged target of the complaint — presumably Trump himself — is not a member of the intelligence community.
A system of checks and balances guaranteed by the Constitution should inform the American people when their president violates the law or commits an impeachable offense. That system is being stretched to the breaking point.
Now it's up to members of Congress — not just Democrats but also Republicans who claim to believe in the rule of law — to get to the bottom of this latest tawdry tale by holding hearings, obtaining transcripts, and finding a way to gain access to the whistleblower complaint or that person's testimony.

Texto completo: In his first column for The Times, J. Kenji López-Alt tests his way to the best egg: perfectly peelable and tender throughout.
As a mostly stay-at-home dad responsible for all the meals in our household, I depend on a supply of boiled eggs in the refrigerator -- ready to be added to soups, salads, stews, sandwiches, stir-fries and tacos -- as an essential part of my planning.
Years ago, in an effort to answer a perennial question -- what's the best way to boil an egg? -- I hatched a plan using the only method I know: lots and lots of testing.
It was a multidecade endeavor. The series of tests I conducted variously as a kitchen monkey at Cook's Illustrated magazine, as recipe czar at the website Serious Eats and in researching my cookbook produced good data, but none of it felt definitive. Further home experimentations (there have been weeks when my wife, Adri, begged me to stop serving egg salad for dinner) have left unanswered questions and conflicting results.
Do older eggs really peel more easily? (The internet insists they do.) Can an ice bath prevent green yolks? Is there anything the Instant Pot can't do better? I simply did not have enough data to say for certain.
With that in mind, for my first column on cooking and science for The New York Times, I decided to undertake my greatest egg-peeling experiment yet, and I have finally come up with some answers.
Ninety-six volunteers came through my restaurant, Wursthall, in San Mateo, Calif., in August to peel and taste more than 700 eggs, cooked with various methods, making this -- as verified with a cursory search online -- the largest-ever double-blind egg-boiling-and-peeling experiment in the history of the universe. (If anyone from Guinness is reading, I have pretty extensive documentation.)
The eggs were ranked and timed to determine ease of peeling, then examined for flaws large (whites that were ripped or torn) and small (whites that were lightly pitted). Peeled eggs were tasted in pre-portioned, unlabeled, single-bite samples. When visual differences between the eggs may have affected the tasters' judgments, we blindfolded them.
For some experiments -- such as a test to determine how much eggs from true pasture-raised hens differ from the eggs that come 15-dozen-in-a-crate at Costco -- I administered a triangle test. (The taster is given three samples. One of them is different. Her job is to tell us which is different.)
All of these tests were administered double-blind, meaning that neither the subjects nor the test administrators knew which eggs were which. Using the results, I designed a few subsequent experiments for another day of testing before drawing conclusions.
I have bad news: There is no way to guarantee eggs that peel 100 percent of the time. But if 87 percent or higher is a number you can work with, let's crack on.
First, let me share my idea of a perfect boiled egg: It should be tender throughout, even when fully hard-boiled. The white should not be rubbery, nor the yolk chalky or green. And above all, it should peel easily. There are few frustrations greater than watching a chunky divot of egg white dislodge itself as you claw clumsily at the shell.
Here's the real trick, and it confirms the data I've been collecting for years now: By far the most important factor in determining whether a boiled egg will peel cleanly or not is the temperature at which it starts cooking. Starting eggs in cold water causes egg-white proteins to coagulate slowly, bonding tightly to the inner membrane of the shell. The difference is night and day: Cold-water eggs show nearly nine times more large flaws and double the number of small flaws.
There are two stovetop cooking methods that allow preheating for a hot start, and produce eggs that are equally easy to peel: boiling and steaming.
But taste tests showed that steamed eggs were more tender than their boiled counterparts. This is because steam is gentler than boiling water, allowing eggs to cook through without any hint of rubberiness in the whites or chalkiness in the yolks. Steaming an egg may take a minute longer than boiling it, but you save that time and more during setup: Bringing an inch of water to a boil is much faster than bringing a whole pot of water to a boil.
After testing three of the more popular time and temperature combinations on the Instant Pot (i.e., a pressure cooker), I unfortunately can't recommend using one. It's not any faster or easier than steaming eggs; the eggs are no easier to peel; and the time it takes various models of pressure cooker to achieve cooking pressure (and thus start the countdown timer) can vary widely, which makes the method unreliable.
Moreover, blindfolded tasters confirmed that the whites were noticeably tougher (given the same internal yolk temperature). This makes sense, given the high cooking temperature achieved in a pressure cooker.
Also not recommended: the briefly popular technique of baking eggs in their shells in a muffin tin.
Some variables had little to no effect. Adding small amounts of vinegar, baking soda or salt to your water is pointless. None offer advantages for peeling, while at the extremes, vinegar and baking soda produce off-flavors and colors (ghostly blue egg whites!).
The only difference between fridge-cold eggs and room temperature eggs is that room temperature eggs will cook about a minute faster.
What about freshness? Through my neighbor's connections with an underground cabal of backyard chicken owners, I wrangled over 100 eggs, from straight-from-the-oviduct to two days old, from backyard flocks across San Mateo. I compared them with supermarket eggs that were at least two weeks old. (Every carton of eggs sold in the United States is stamped with a three-digit number from 1 to 365, representing the day of the year they were packed.)
Turns out that age doesn't make much of a difference either. Even eggs still warm from the hen's body peeled just as easily as the most grizzled specimen. (Taste tests also showed that most folks could not tell the difference between backyard eggs and supermarket eggs, and those who could were split on which were better.)
Pricking the fat end of an egg with a pushpin doesn't affect how easily an egg peels, but it can prevent thin-shelled eggs from cracking under the pressure of gas expansion during boiling. It will also reduce the large dimple you often find at the fat end of the cooked egg, caused by the impression of an air pocket located there.
Immediately dunking your cooked eggs in an ice bath will have a similar dimple-reducing effect, but it also makes them a little more difficult to peel. This result surprised me, as previous smaller-scale tests had suggested a slight advantage in peeling eggs that were iced; but when a mountain of new data doesn't fit your previous hypothesis, you change your hypothesis.
An ice bath also did not help reduce the incidence of the sulfurous green patina around overcooked egg yolks -- eggs are so small that there is negligible carry-over cooking. If the yolk is green, it would have been green ice bath or no.
Even with evidence, I don't expect everyone to adopt the steaming technique, and that's fine. If you've got a method that works for you, stick with it (even if it's the Instant Pot).
Science can deepen your understanding of the interaction between heat and molecules, between taste and pleasure. It can undoubtedly make you a better cook. But there is far more to cooking than the pure science of the craft. I'm not here to tell you how to cook or to try and change your traditions and habits; my only job is to show you the data, demonstrate the science and deliver a tasty recipe or two.

Texto completo: A reader stresses the importance of a free press, in response to an Op-Ed by A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times.
To the Editor:
Re "The Growing Threat to Journalism Around the World" (nytimes.com, Sept. 23): I applaud the Op-Ed article by A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times.
As a child of the Cold War, I grew up with the belief that we were the good guys precisely because of our free press. As a public relations professional for 30 years, I respected the skilled reporters who wrote articles that sometimes took my organizations to task, and rightly so, for these reporters helped push for change when it was needed. When articles were inaccurate, was it possible that I was to blame for poor communication?
When I hear this administration demean and attack reporters, I am shocked and saddened beyond words. We have lost something precious. If we can no longer stand up and speak the truth, who will?

‘Fat-shaming’ controversy

Texto completo: HBO “Real Time” host Bill Maher had good intentions — even James Corden said so.
In “The Late Late Show” host’s now-viral response to a Maher monologue that asserted “Fat shaming doesn’t need to end — it needs to make a comeback,” Corden prefaced his criticism by saying “I sincerely believe that what you think you’re offering here is tough love and that you’re just trying to help by not sugarcoating reality for fat people.”
What’s been lost in this whole kerfuffle is that the polarizing Maher — in his customarily caustic and often-condescending manner — did make several cogent points about how obesity and poor dietary choices have become the leading causes of mortality in the U.S and are the biggest contributing factors to our healthcare system’s expenses.
Many of the facts Maher cited in his diatribe echoed an August New York Times opinion piece entitled “Our Food Is Killing Too Many Of Us.”
Both the Times article and Maher’s monologue started with the U.S. healthcare system — Why is it so expensive? Who should pay for it and how? What are the presidential candidates’ plans for improving it? — and then segued into the country’s biggest health crisis and cost-driver: obesity being caused by poor nutrition and overconsumption.
But here is where the Times piece — co-authored by cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozzaffarian and former U.S. Sec. of Agriculture Dan Glickman — and Maher diverge.
Mozzaffarian and Glickman suggested an array of possible solutions and public policy initiatives, including:
1. Increased nutrition education.
2. Patient prescriptions for healthy produce.
3. Medically tailored meals.
4. Taxes on sugar-filled drinks.
5. Tax subsidies on healthy fruits, vegetables, nuts and other high-nutrition foods.
6. Public-private partnerships and investments to “financially reward companies for tackling obesity, diabetes and other diet-related illness.”
In other words: Incentivize the behavior you want to encourage — and tax the behavior you want to prevent.
And also, as the 2020 presidential campaign heats up, pin down candidates on their “food platforms.”
Mozzaffarian and Glickman proposed a well-reasoned multi-pronged approach for dealing with obesity
and its myriad impacts on disease, mortality and healthcare costs.
Where’s Maher’s monologue got him in trouble was in adding an unnecessary — and what can only be interpreted as mean-spirited — component: fat-shaming.
Maher emphasized that while he made no value judgment about the aesthetics of being overweight, he was adamant in believing the national dialogue has to change about what it means to be fat: “Can fat be beautiful? That’s in the eye of the beholder. But healthy? No — that’s science.”
He also said that while “overeating shouldn’t be singled out as the only vice” and that “we shouldn’t taunt people” for being fat, society also shouldn’t be as “accepting” of how overweight so many of us are.
Here’s where his faulty reasoning — and lack of compassion — become apparent: He suggested that, in the same way U.S. culture has become increasingly intolerant of smoking and drinking (“there’s no ‘drunk acceptance’”), we should strive for the same with fatness.
Now, stigmatizing public behaviors that have the potential to harm others is one thing.
But to stigmatize anyone’s physical self — no matter how much or how little their own behavior contributed to it — is simply cruel.
Even worse — as Corden adeptly and self-deprecatingly pointed out — it might exacerbate an overweight person’s struggle with self-destructive eating habits.
The Centers for Disease Control says that more than 70% of adults in the U.S. are either overweight or obese.
Holding folks accountable for the food choices they make can and should be a component of tackling this issue.
But let’s take shaming off the menu — and replace it with a triple helping of education, encouragement and compassion.

Bork, Thomas, Kavanaugh: Third time's the charm?

Texto completo: The attempt to revive last year’s Brett Kavanaugh fracas by way of a book and a New York Times story was a loss for the Democrats in more ways than one.
First, the new charges turned out to have no more basis than the original ones. Second, the high court is the one cause that unites all Republicans. And third, it blew up the biggest and best card that the Democrats have to play in next year’s elections: that President Trump has “shattered the norms” of polite public discourse. True, Trump seems to step on a norm every time he opens his mouth, but his transgressions seem small indeed next to the rampage of unrestrained breakage that results each time a Democrat comes within striking distance of a Republican president’s Supreme Court nominee.
Norm No. 1 was put to the sword in 1987, when Edward M. Kennedy took to the floor of the Senate to inform the world and the country that Judge Robert Bork was a threat to the republic, all four of our freedoms, and all we hold dear.
Norm No. 2 was broken just three years later, when someone on the staff of the same Sen. Kennedy found a female associate of Judge Clarence Thomas who was willing to say he had impugned on her virtue in varying incidents. In its day, this drama and its mention of “Coke” and “pubic hair” was thought shocking. But 30 years on, the restraints have all fallen away.
In the age of Kavanaugh, Ted Cruz and his wife were beset by a mob when they went to a restaurant and had to be escorted home by police; swing vote Susan Collins received letters and calls expressing the hope that she and her staff would be raped and/or murdered. She was stalked late at night near her Washington residence and had her home in Maine quarantined and tested for ricin after a series of threats.
As Kavanaugh was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts, protesters pushed police lines aside and pounded on the massive bronze doors of the court building. As Ryan Lovelace informs us in Search and Destroy, his book on the hearings, “Images of shrieking protesters slapping the doors and climbing into the lap of the marble statue Contemplation of Justice were broadcast on cable news throughout the day.”
All this seemed just fine with the Democrats — even the feminists, who had not one word of support for their colleague from Maine but a great deal of feeling for their ungainly witness and her breathy description of people and places that nobody else could recall.
Having tried twice to blindside a jurist whose ideas they opposed with a witness whose story lacked any accompanying evidence, the questions remain: “Will they try it a third time?” and “will anyone care if they do?”
In the Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan insists that they will because they believe in the “larger truth” of their claims, no matter what happens. But the rest of the world may tune them out. “Déjà vu all over,” they may say with the late Yogi Berra, or “There you go again,” as Ronald Reagan himself once proclaimed.
Meanwhile, they may come to miss all those norms that they shattered — as many or more than Trump himself managed to break.

A.G. Sulzberger: The growing threat to journalism around the world

Texto completo: Our mission at The New York Times is to seek the truth and help people understand the world. That takes many forms, from investigations on sexual abuse that helped spark the global #MeToo movement; to expert reporting that reveals how technology is reshaping every facet of modern life; to important and hard-hitting cultural commentary, like when we proclaimed “the Aperol spritz is not a good drink.”
But at a moment when surging nationalism is leading people to retreat inward, one of the most important jobs of The Times is to shine a light outward.
The Times is privileged to be one of the few news organizations with the resources to cover the world in all its complexity. And with that comes a responsibility to go where the story is, no matter the danger or hardship.
Every year, we put reporters on the ground in more than 160 countries. We’re in Iraq and Afghanistan, covering the violence and instability wrought by decades of war. We’re in Venezuela and Yemen, reporting on how corruption and conflict have led to mass starvation. We’re in Myanmar and China, eluding government monitors to investigate the systematic persecution of the Rohingya and Uighurs.
These assignments carry considerable risks. In recent years, my colleagues have suffered injuries from land mines, car bombs and helicopter crashes. They’ve been beaten by gangs, kidnapped by terrorists and jailed by repressive governments. When militants attacked a Nairobi mall, you could spot our journalist in the crowd because he was the only one running toward the gunfire.
Having covered conflicts since the American Civil War, we’ve learned from experience how to support and protect our journalists in the field. In any given year, our newsroom budget includes funding for bulletproof vests, hazmat suits and armored cars. We develop detailed security plans for high-risk assignments, and our journalists themselves prepare obsessively. C.J. Chivers, a former Marine who spent years reporting on war for The Times, trained himself to lift the weight of his photographer, so he could carry that person to safety if that person were shot or struck by shrapnel.
Those of us leading The Times find it hard not to worry, knowing we have colleagues on the ground where war is raging, disease is spreading and conditions deteriorating. But we’ve long taken comfort in knowing that in addition to all our own preparations and all our own safeguards, there has always been another, critical safety net: the United States government, the world’s greatest champion of the free press.
Over the last few years, however, something has dramatically changed. Around the globe, a relentless campaign is targeting journalists because of the fundamental role they play in ensuring a free and informed society. To stop journalists from exposing uncomfortable truths and holding power to account, a growing number of governments have engaged in overt, sometimes violent, efforts to discredit their work and intimidate them into silence.
This is a worldwide assault on journalists and journalism. But even more important, it’s an assault on the public’s right to know, on core democratic values, on the concept of truth itself. And perhaps most troubling, the seeds of this campaign were planted right here, in a country that has long prided itself on being the fiercest defender of free expression and a free press.
Let me start by stating the obvious: The media aren’t perfect. We make mistakes. We have blind spots. We sometimes drive people crazy.
But the free press is foundational to a healthy democracy and arguably the most important tool we have as citizens. It empowers the public by providing the information we need to elect leaders and the continuing oversight to keep them honest. It bears witness to our moments of tragedy and triumph and provides the shared baseline of common facts and information that bind communities together. It gives voice to the disadvantaged and doggedly pursues the truth to expose wrongdoing and drive change.
It is also under great and growing pressure. In the two decades since I began working at The Providence Journal, writing about daily life in the small town of Narragansett, the press has faced a cascading series of existential challenges.
The advertising-based business model that supported journalism collapsed, causing the loss of more than half of the country’s journalism jobs. Google and Facebook became the most powerful distributors of news and information in human history, accidentally unleashing a historic flood of misinformation in the process. And a rising drumbeat of legal efforts — from whistleblower prosecutions to libel suits — aims to weaken long-standing safeguards for journalists and their sources.
Around the world, the threat journalists face is far more visceral. Last year was the most dangerous year on record to be a journalist, with dozens killed, hundreds imprisoned and untold thousands harassed and threatened. Those include Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered and dismembered by Saudi assassins, and Maksim Borodin, a Russian journalist who fell to his death from the balcony of his apartment after revealing the Kremlin’s covert operations in Syria.
The hard work of journalism has long carried risks, especially in countries without democratic safeguards. But what’s different today is that these brutal crackdowns are being passively accepted and perhaps even tacitly encouraged by the president of the United States.
This country’s leaders have long understood that the free press is one of America’s greatest exports. Sure, they’d complain about our coverage and bristle at the secrets we brought to light. But even as domestic politics and foreign policy would change, a baseline commitment to protecting journalists and their rights would remain.
When four of our journalists were beaten and held hostage by the Libyan military, the State Department played a critical role in securing their release. Interventions like this were often accompanied by a stern reminder to the offending government that the United States defends its journalists.
The current administration, however, has retreated from our country’s historical role as a defender of the free press. Seeing that, other countries are targeting journalists with a growing sense of impunity.
This isn’t just a problem for reporters; it’s a problem for everyone, because this is how authoritarian leaders bury critical information, hide corruption, even justify genocide. As Sen. John McCain once warned, “When you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press.”
To give you a sense of what this retreat looks like on the ground, let me tell you a story I’ve never shared publicly before. Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh. Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.
But this particular call took a surprising and distressing turn. We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger.
Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help. Within an hour, Irish diplomats traveled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him.
We hate to imagine what would have happened had that brave official not risked their career to alert us to the threat.
Eighteen months later, another of our reporters, David Kirkpatrick, arrived in Egypt and was detained and deported in apparent retaliation for exposing information that was embarrassing to the Egyptian government. When we protested the move, a senior official at the United States Embassy in Cairo openly voiced the cynical worldview behind the Trump administration’s tolerance for such crackdowns. “What did you expect would happen to him?” he said. “His reporting made the government look bad.”
Since assuming office, President Trump has tweeted about “fake news” nearly 600 times. His most frequent targets are independent news organizations with a deep commitment to reporting fairly and accurately. To be absolutely clear, The Times and other news organizations are fair game for criticism. Journalism is a human enterprise, and we sometimes make mistakes. But we also try to own our mistakes, to correct them and to rededicate ourselves every day to the highest standards of journalism.
But when the president decries “fake news,” he’s not interested in actual mistakes. He’s trying to delegitimize real news, dismissing factual and fair reporting as politically motivated fabrications.
So when The Times reveals his family’s fraudulent financial practices, when The Wall Street Journal reveals hush money paid to a porn star, when The Washington Post reveals his personal foundation’s self-dealing, he can sidestep accountability by simply dismissing the reports as “fake news.”
Even though all those stories — and countless more that he’s labeled fake — have been confirmed as accurate, there is evidence that his attacks are achieving their intended effect: One recent poll found that 82% of Republicans now trust President Trump more than they trust the media. One of the president’s supporters was recently convicted of sending explosives to CNN, one of the most frequent targets of the “fake news” charge.
But in attacking American media, President Trump has done more than undermine his own citizens’ faith in the news organizations attempting to hold him accountable. He has effectively given foreign leaders permission to do the same with their countries’ journalists and even given them the vocabulary with which to do it.
They’ve eagerly embraced the approach. My colleagues and I recently researched the spread of the phrase “fake news,” and what we found is deeply alarming: In the past few years, more than 50 prime ministers, presidents and other government leaders across five continents have used the term “fake news” to justify varying levels of anti-press activity.
The phrase has been used by Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, who have levied massive fines to force independent news organizations to sell to government loyalists. It’s been used by President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who have attacked the press as they’ve led bloody crackdowns.
In Myanmar, the phrase is used to deny the existence of an entire people who are systematically targeted with violence to force them out of their country. “There is no such thing as Rohingya,” a leader in Myanmar told The Times. “It is fake news.”
The phrase has been used to jail journalists in Cameroon, to suppress stories about corruption in Malawi, to justify a social media blackout in Chad, to prevent overseas news organizations from operating in Burundi. It has been used by the leaders of our longtime allies, like Mexico and Israel. It has been used by longtime rivals, like Iran, Russia and China.
It has been used by liberal leaders, like Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar. It’s been used by right-wing leaders, like Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Standing next to President Bolsanaro in the Rose Garden, President Trump said, “I’m very proud to hear the president use the term ‘fake news.’”
Our foreign correspondents have experienced the weaponization of the “fake news” charge firsthand. Last year, Hannah Beech, who covers Southeast Asia, was at a speech by Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia. In the middle of his remarks, Mr. Hun Sen uttered a single phrase in English: “The New York Times.” He said that The Times was so biased that it had been given a ‘fake news’ award by President Trump, and he threatened that if our story didn’t support his version of the truth, there would be consequences.
Hannah felt a growing hostility in the crowd of thousands as the prime minister searched her out and warned, “The Cambodian people will remember your faces.”
I have raised these concerns with President Trump. I’ve told him that these efforts to attack and suppress independent journalism is what the United States is now inspiring abroad. Though he listened politely and expressed concern, he has continued to escalate his anti-press rhetoric, which has reached new heights as he campaigns for reelection.
President Trump is no longer content to delegitimize accurate reporting as “fake news.” Now, he has taken to demonizing reporters themselves, calling them “the true enemy of the people” and even accusing them of treason. With these phrases, he has not just inspired autocratic rulers around the world, he has also borrowed from them.
The phrase “enemy of the people” has a particularly brutal history. It was used to justify mass executions during the French Revolution and the Third Reich. And it was used by Lenin and Stalin to justify the systematic murder of Soviet dissidents.
The treason charge is perhaps the most serious a commander in chief can make. By threatening to prosecute journalists for invented crimes against their country, President Trump gives repressive leaders implicit license to do the same.
In the United States, the Constitution, the rule of law and a still-robust news media act as a constraint. But abroad, foreign leaders can silence journalists with alarming effectiveness.
Nick Casey, a Times reporter who was repeatedly threatened and ultimately barred from Venezuela for aggressive reporting on the brutal Maduro regime, stressed how much more serious consequences can be for local journalists. “If this is what countries are capable of doing to me, as a Times reporter, what are they capable of doing to their own citizens?” he asked. “Far worse. And I’ve seen it.”
Even as we worry about the dangers our own reporters face, those dangers usually pale in comparison to what courageous local journalists confront around the world. They search for truth and report what they find, knowing that they and their loved ones are vulnerable to fines, arrests, beatings, torture, rape and murder. These reporters are the front-line soldiers in the battle for press freedom, and they’re the ones who pay the greatest price for President Trump’s anti-press rhetoric.
The cases of intimidation and violence I’ve discussed today are just a few of the ones we know about. On any given day, similar stories are unfolding around the world, many of which will never surface or be recorded. In many places, fear of reprisal is great enough that it has a chilling effect — stories go unpublished; secrets remain buried; wrongdoing remains covered up.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – La Casa Blanca prevé entregar al Congreso de Estados Unidos una copia de la queja interna sobre la llamada del presidente Donald Trump con su homólogo ucraniano, Vladimir Zelensky, que ha provocado el inicio de un proceso de “impeachment”, según medios.
El Gobierno se había negado hasta ahora a dar este paso, pero según The New York Times y Politico, tras el inicio formal del proceso de juicio político la Casa Blanca cambió su estrategia.
De acuerdo a los planes descritos por fuentes conocedoras de la cuestión, se hará entrega de la copia de la queja a finales de semana, junto al informe que elaboró el receptor de la filtración: el inspector general de la Comunidad de Inteligencia, Michael Atkinson.
El rotativo neoyorquino, además, también indicó que el Gobierno sopesa permitir que el filtrador, cuya identidad no se ha revelado, pueda reunirse con los investigadores del Congreso.
Estos movimientos son una muestra de la seriedad con la que la Casa Blanca ha recibido el inicio de la investigación sobre un juicio político contra Trump.
Está previsto también que este miércoles la Casa Blanca divulgue la transcripción de la llamada que mantuvieron Trump y Zelensky el pasado 25 de julio, origen de todo este terremoto político.
En esa llamada, el presidente estadounidense pidió a Zelensky que investigase al exvicepresidente Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter por supuestos actos de corrupción en Ucrania.
Además, Trump supuestamente bloqueó cerca de 400 millones de dólares en ayuda militar para Ucrania con tal de coaccionar a su Gobierno para que abriese esa investigación, unos fondos que finalmente transfirieron el pasado 11 de septiembre.
La presidenta de la Cámara Baja de Estados Unidos, la demócrata Nancy Pelosi, anunció este martes que abrirá una investigación de juicio político contra Trump por haber “traicionado” la seguridad nacional y la Constitución.
Trump consideró esa decisión como una “basura” y una “caza de brujas”.
Más tarde, la Casa Blanca emitió un comunicado en el que afirmó que “lejos del trabajo y los resultados de este presidente, los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes han destruido cualquier posibilidad de avance legislativo para el pueblo al seguir centrando toda su energía en ataques políticos partidistas”.
“Sus ataques contra el presidente y su agenda no solo son partidistas y patéticos, sino que incumplen su deber constitucional”, añadió el comunicado.

Texto completo: In the Trump era, a columnist risks appearing like the boy (or girl) who cried wolf. Time and time again, we say this scandal is the big one.
But in our ill-fated version of the story, the wolf comes every time. The violations of morality and law have become progressively bolder and more dangerous to the constitutional order. And they have culminated in an abuse of power both highly serious and totally unconcealed.
By his own admission, the president of the United States urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open a criminal investigation of the son of a political rival. Trump denies that this request involved a quid pro quo. But with Ukraine engaged in conflict with Russian-backed separatists, and with $250 million in American military aid being held up (at the time) for "review," the threat did not need to be explicit in order to be palpable and powerful.
This groundbreaking form of political corruption shocked everyone with a conscience who was privy to it. U.S. embassy staff in Kiev expressed alarm about Rudy Giuliani’s contacts with Ukrainian officials. A whistleblower in the intelligence community risked his or her career to report it. The intelligence community’s inspector general found the matter of "urgent concern." But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Department of Justice — playing the role of political enforcers — have blocked the transmission of the whistleblower’s report to Congress. They are pursuing a cover-up in plain sight.
Here we need to be clear. Treating the presidency in this fashion is not only corrupt but unpatriotic. Trump has set his own interests above the interests of the nation. The American criminal justice system was created to deal with normal types of political corruption, not with a rogue president, testing the limits of executive power. That form of warped ambition must be checked and balanced by the coequal branches of government. But many members of Congress — mostly Republicans but also some Democrats — appear to have lost their taste for that role.
The political risk to elected Republicans when they oppose Trump appears very real. But the moral hazard is far greater. When they use their office to shield shady political dealings, they become a party to public corruption. When they ignore or excuse Trump’s use of the nation’s power and influence for private reasons, they have chosen Trump above their country. Worst of all, they are teaching their political supporters that the rule of law is a small and expendable thing.
In the scarier regions of the Trump right, the problem is far advanced. Every revelation of the president’s abuse of power is met with a sentence beginning: "But Biden ..." Their tolerance for corruption seems limitless — and frightening. By what firm political principle would they condemn Trump if he closed down The New York Times (an "enemy of the people") or arrested a few whistleblowers (part of the "deep state" that is conducting a "coup")?
None of this seems possible. But too many impossibilities have recently become realities. Opposing Trump’s corrupt abuse of power — here, now, before it goes further — is the calling of patriotism in our time.

Texto completo: BEIJING -- President Xi Jinping was holding a military parade, and the Chinese police wanted me out.
Officer Wang Yong, a veteran of the Beijing security bureau with nervous eyes and amber teeth, came to my door one recent Saturday morning to deliver the news.
"Do you know about the National Day celebrations?" he asked.
I nodded. In early October, Mr. Xi would be the host of a grand celebration to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, along the Street of Eternal Peace, near my apartment.
"You need to leave," Officer Wang said. "Armed police will be stationed inside for four days."
As an American journalist based in Beijing for the past four years, I am accustomed to onerous visa rules, hassles at the airport and arbitrary detentions in the countryside.
But never had the police insisted on occupying my home. I imagined a cantankerous bunch of officers spread out on the sofa, poring over books on dissident art and American politics as they smoked the night away.
Officer Wang, strong but slumping, with gray tufts of hair springing from under his navy cap, grew impatient. "Do you understand?" he said. "Don't you have another place to go?"
Even in quiet times, Beijing can feel stifling: the police, the propaganda, the smog.
But the city is in a state of extreme agitation before Mr. Xi's parade, a show of strength meant to signal to the United States and other countries that China and its leader, who is also general secretary of the ruling Communist Party, are more resilient than ever.
Officials are leading a more extensive security crackdown than usual, perhaps reflecting concerns within the party about threats to social stability, as unrest brews in Hong Kong.
Bomb-sniffing dogs patrol shopping malls. Police and military officers stand guard on street corners. X-ray machines and metal detectors protect entrances to residential buildings, shops and hotels along the parade route.
Even by the standards of an authoritarian government, the rules are strict. The city has imposed bans on flying kites, drones, balloons and captive pigeons, a popular pastime, in many areas. Some Chinese cities are barring officials from consuming alcohol in the run-up to the parade.
Mr. Xi, China's most powerful leader since Mao, is the unmistakable star of the show, and the streets are filled with bright red propaganda banners urging the public to rally behind him, referring to his call for a "new era" of centralized control and his vision of a "Chinese dream" of economic prosperity.
"Seek happiness for the Chinese people, seek rejuvenation for the Chinese nation," one banner says.
"Everybody is a witness, pioneer and builder of the new era," reads another.
"We are all chasing the dream," proclaims a third.
Since early September, the authorities have placed my entire neighborhood, not far from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, on lockdown. Roads are blocked, and the internet has slowed to a crawl. Security officers pat me down every time I enter my apartment building, morning and night.
On weekends, during rehearsals for the parade, tanks rumble down the street and fighter jets and helicopters patrol the skies, carrying red hammer-and-sickle flags as cargo.
The police have imposed curfews, requiring residents to return to their homes by 5 p.m., and lock windows and close curtains by 8. Police officers sleep in the hallways of apartment buildings to ensure the rules are followed.
In messages slipped under my door, the authorities thanked me for my cooperation in the security campaign, known as "safe and sound Beijing." But the checks were tedious and exhausting, another reminder of the strength of the police state in China, where surveillance cameras and facial-recognition technology are used to spy on citizens on a huge scale.
Yet many of my Chinese friends are indifferent, even proud. When the Beijing government posted an online notice detailing nightmarish traffic disruptions, internet users rejoiced.
"I look forward to the grand military parade," said one of the most popular comments made in response to the post on WeChat, a popular messaging app, punctuated by three thumbs-up emoticons. "My country is amazing."
On a recent afternoon, I walked to Tiananmen Square, the site of pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989 that ended in a bloody crackdown. The parade was set to culminate in Tiananmen, though this painful chapter in modern Chinese history would not be discussed, in keeping with the party line.
Outside the Forbidden City, which is just north of Tiananmen Square, many people told me the parade was another sign of China's growing military and economic prowess.
"China now ranks top in the world," said Wang Wanting, 22, a university student in Beijing. "China will get stronger and stronger and surpass the United States."
Nearby, Li Peiqin, a food delivery worker, sat on his scooter, watching tourists wander around the gates of the Forbidden City.
Mr. Li said he moved to Beijing last month from the southern province of Guangdong so that he could experience two things: the snow and Mr. Xi's parade. He had stocked up on instant noodles and rice in anticipation. He said he was most looking forward to the cannons and fighter jets, which are expected to be featured alongside intercontinental ballistic missiles, drones and other weapons.
"China needs to better protect itself," he said.
I walked to a nearby park. A propaganda sign now hung at the entrance: "Let patriotism become every Chinese person's firm belief and spiritual sustenance."
Inside, construction workers napped on benches. Small groups of chain-smoking men played poker, shouting obscenities as they slapped cards on the table.
"They can't stop our games," a retiree, Xu Jin, said of the security crackdown, as he anted up 35 renminbi, or about $ 5.
With the curfew approaching, I headed home. From my window, I could see police officers gathering on nearby rooftops, assembling tents and surveying the neighborhood through binoculars.
At 8 p.m., I closed my curtains, following police orders. About a half-hour later, Officer Wang was at my door, more brusque than before.
"Didn't I tell you there was an exercise today?" he asked. "Why didn't you close your curtains?"
I explained that I had, but Officer Wang, incredulous, stepped into my living room to inspect. "Keep them closed," he said, storming out.
In the days that followed, Officer Wang called my cellphone to remind me I needed to leave and to ask where I would go. It was clear that there was no room for negotiation, that I had no choice but to obey the rules.
One day, I awoke to a rainbow-colored tapestry outside my window. The authorities had hung 40 lines of red, blue, green and yellow flags between two buildings that overlooked my street. The flags were most likely aimed at blocking views of Mr. Xi and the weapons, but they were decidedly out of place, an irreverent diversion from the sea of black-and-gray office buildings that surround my home.
I watched one day as a group of visiting Tibetan monks wandered over to the multicolor display, seemingly amused by its likeness to traditional prayer flags.
As police officers patrolled the neighborhood and office workers submitted to pat-downs, the monks stood before the flags and smiled blissfully, snapping selfies in the late-summer sun.

Russia Receives Ultimatum Over Missing Doping Data

Texto completo: The World Anti-Doping Agency has asked Russia to explain how positive drug tests were deleted from a database sent to the regulator or face a new ban from sports.
The World Anti-Doping Agency has given Russia three weeks to explain how a number of positive drug tests were deleted from a database sent to the world's antidoping regulator as it investigated one of the biggest cheating scandals in sports history.
Any punishment would almost certainly include Russia's ban from next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo, but it could extend to competitions in any sport whose governing body is a signer of WADA's doping code, including soccer's World Cup, track and field's world championships and dozens of other sporting events.
The chief executive of Russia's antidoping agency, Yury Ganus, this weekend declined to rule out the possibility that the data sent to WADA from the Moscow lab at the center of the 2015 doping scandal had been manipulated. In a text message on Monday, Ganus said he was "frustrated" with that possibility, and said the potential consequences for all Russian sports "will be more than serious."
"I think this situation is the most critical since this doping crisis began," he said.
Russia's promise to deliver a database of thousands of athlete records was a key factor in WADA's decision to lift a ban on the country's antidoping agency in late 2018. That determination ended a three-year suspension that had been imposed after the discovery of one of the most audacious and sophisticated cheating schemes in history, one that corrupted a number of major international sporting events, including several Olympics.
The scandal meant Russian athletes were barred from competing under their own flag at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the new investigation most likely means a group of especially vetted Russian athletes will once again compete as neutrals at the world track and field championships that open on Friday in Doha, Qatar.
Speculation had mounted in recent days about the data set submitted by Russia. At a meeting of WADA's executive board on Monday in Tokyo, the board members were told that a WADA investigative team had found inconsistencies between a data set passed to it by a whistle-blower in 2017 and the evidence extracted from the Moscow laboratory in January.
"There were positive findings that were deleted; the question is why," Jonathan Taylor, chairman of WADA's committee tasked with overseeing Russia's compliance, said in a telephone interview from Tokyo.
Russia, Taylor, added, needed to "pull a rabbit out of the hat" if it was to avoid facing new penalties, which under new regulations trigger a process that sports governing bodies are compelled to abide by. He cautioned, though, that it was important not to prejudge the final result until Russian authorities had provided a final response. "We will give them a chance to explain," he said.
Taylor's committee will convene, probably by phone, on Oct. 23 to decide whether to recommend to WADA's executive board that Russia be designated "noncompliant." If the board agrees, a case most likely will be fast-tracked to the Court of Arbitration for Sport for a final ruling.
While individual sports, in the past, had it within their power to decide whether to sanction Russia, new rules adopted in April 2018 mean a negative ruling for Russia at CAS could trigger an automatic suspension for Russia. Under such a ban, Russian teams and athletes would be ineligible to compete in international sporting events, and the country would not be allowed to host them, until the WADA suspension is lifted.
That could lead to Russia's team missing out on the Olympics in Tokyo, and even put at risk its national soccer team's participation in qualification matches for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
"The situation is very serious," the president of the Russian Olympic Committee, Stanislav Pozdnyakov, said in a statement, The Associated Press reported. "The Russian Olympic team's prospects of taking part in the Games in Tokyo next year could be under threat."
Ganus, the chief executive of Russia's antidoping agency, known by its acronym Rusada, acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times last week that he could not rule out the possibility that the Russian data had been manipulated before its transfer to WADA.
"I want to hope for the best, but I live in a country where we have to be ready for all possible situations," he said.
WADA said in a statement Monday that it had sent Rusada and the Russian Ministry of Sport copies of reports prepared by independent forensic experts "that detail the inconsistencies in question." Russian authorities, WADA said, "have been given three weeks to provide their comments, together with answers to a list of specific questions."
If Russia is found to have violated antidoping rules again, it will once again bring focus -- and possibly embarrassment -- on sports bodies that were quick to try to move on from the 2015 scandal. Those include, most notably, the International Olympic Committee and its president, Thomas Bach, who restored Russia's membership only days after the conclusion of the 2018 Winter Olympics even though it remained under WADA suspension.
Under Ganus, Rusada has made strides in moving past the 2015 scandal. Rusada says it is testing more athletes than ever, and it has even won praise from WADA. But the Moscow laboratory at the center of the earlier scandal is managed by a separate body, and its secrets continue to cause problems for Russian sports.
WADA lifted its ban on Russia in 2018, much to the frustration of the wider global antidoping community and athlete groups, even though the authorities there continued to refuse to accept the findings of independent reports that concluded the conspiracy reached the highest levels of the Russian government. WADA said it had to make the compromise to ensure it could finally determine the identities of hundreds of athletes suspected of cheating.
Criticism that Russia, which, according to a WADA investigation, had used its internal intelligence agency in its yearslong cheating scheme, would manipulate the data it sent to WADA began almost immediately, and concerns only grew when experts sent to retrieve the data were initially refused entry to the Moscow laboratory.
Since receiving the data, WADA has identified 47 suspected doping cases, and evidence packs have been sent to various sports federations to start disciplinary proceedings against the athletes involved. Successfully prosecuting those cases is now at risk if there are questions around the larger database, though, according to Rob Koehler, a former WADA executive who now leads Global Athlete, a lobbying group for athletes that has been critical of the global regulator for not forcing Russia to stick to the road map to return that it had committed to.
"Almost all athletes were calling out WADA for its U-turn, national antidoping agencies were not happy, yet WADA and the compliance review committee felt they were outsmarting Russia," Koehler said. "If this is the case, and the data has been manipulated, we're back to the same situation."

Texto completo: Joe Biden's campaign team on Monday accused President Trump and his allies of peddling “roundly debunked conspiracy theory” about the former vice president and his son's dealings in the Ukraine.
The campaign also called on the media to focus on whether Trump abused his authority by allegedly pressuring a foreign leader to dig up dirt on the former vice president and his son.
Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said some in the media “have allowed the most dishonest president in American history to function as their assignment editor" in the aftermath of reports that Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate the former vice president's son Hunter Biden.
“Quality reporting on this issue has made it increasingly clear that Trump did indeed attempt to bully a U. S. ally into disingenuously investigating the potential Democratic nominee he fears most,” Bates said in an email to reporters. “The second narrative that needs to be pointed out is that, unfortunately, not all coverage of this episode has responsibly highlighted the relevant facts that have been widely reported for months. ”
The Biden campaign raised its concerns as Trump insisted on Monday that he “put no pressure on them whatsoever” to investigate Hunter Biden. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky eight times in that call to investigate the younger Biden. Trump has acknowledged that he brought up Biden in the July phone conversation with the newly-elected Zelensky that Trump says served as a mostly congratulatory call.
Trump told reporters Monday while at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that “what Biden did was wrong” and suggested that he might eventually release a transcript of the call — something that the former vice president and Democratic lawmakers are demanding.
Trump said a transcript would show that he did nothing wrong, but he also said he is concerned about the precedent of releasing details of a call with a foreign leader.
Trump on alleged Ukraine pressure: 'I didn't do it. ' Trump denies he threatened to hold back Ukraine's foreign aid over Biden
Ukraine scandal explained: What's going on with Trump and Ukraine? And how does it involve Biden and a whistleblower complaint?
The back-and-forth comes as scrutiny of Trump’s actions during the call is mounting amid renewed calls among House Democrats to impeach Trump.
The issue came to a head after a multiple news reports about a whistleblower complaint brought by a member of the intelligence community raised concerns about Trump’s comments to a foreign leader. The whistleblower complaint remains secret, and Democrats and the Trump administration are in a standoff over demands that the report be turned over to Congress.
Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani for months have pushed uncorroborated claims that Biden as vice president sought the 2016 ouster of Ukraine’s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to stop an investigation into Burisma Group, a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board of directors.
Giuliani alleged in an interview on Fox News Sunday that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin, because “Biden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter and he went over there and got [Shokin] fired. ”
The push by the former vice president, however, came alongside calls for Ukraine to get rid of Shokin from both European diplomats and the U. S State Department, because international leaders felt Shokin was doing too little to fight corruption in the Eastern European country.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while still serving as vice president , threatened to withhold $1 billion in U. S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind Burisma.
Shokin was accused by U. S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out.
But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
The Biden campaign says that Trump his allies are trying to muddy the waters about the former vice president's actions in Ukraine because they see Biden as the most potent potential 2020 Democratic rival.
“The president and his lackeys are so terrified of that prospect — and have abandoned any pretense of having an iota of truth on their side as they flail and try to distract from what may be the greatest presidential malfeasance since Watergate — that they fell all over themselves lying on the Sunday shows,” Biden’s deputy campaign manager Kate Beddingfield said in a memo to interested parties that was titled “Correcting the Record on Rudy Giuliani's Lies. ”
Biden told reporters while campaigning in Iowa on Saturday that he has never spoken to Hunter Biden about his overseas business dealings, but the younger Biden told the New Yorker magazine in an article published in July that two had one brief exchange about Burisma around December 2015.
Around the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue of Hunter's work with Burisma with the Vice President, according to the article.
“‘Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you’re doing,” and I said, ‘I do,’ ” the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article.

Biden problematic on racial issues

Texto completo: All five of these things are simultaneously true:
* Joe Biden is the Democratic front-runner and may well be the nominee.
* He is by far the favorite candidate among Black voters.
* He was a loyal vice president to Barack Obama, and the two men seem to have shared a deep and true friendship.
* He, like the other Democratic candidates, would be a vast improvement over Donald Trump.
* Biden's positioning on racial issues has been problematic.
This issue exposed itself again during the presidential debate in Houston. Moderator Linsey Davis put a question to Biden:
"Mr. Vice President, I want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race. In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, 'I don't feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I'll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.'
You said that some 40 years ago. But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?"
Biden could have taken responsibility for his comments and addressed the question directly, but he didn't. Instead, he gave a rambling, nonsensical answer that included a reference to a record player. But, the response ended in yet another racial offense in which he seemed to suggest that Black people lack the natural capacity to be good parents:
We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It's not that they don't want to help. They don't - they don't know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television - excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the - the - make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school - a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.
His language belies a particular mindset, one of a liberal of a particular vintage. On the issue of race, it is paternalistic and it pities, it sees deficiency in much the same way that the conservative does, but it responds as savior rather than with savagery. Better the former than the latter, surely, but the sensibility underlying the two positions is shockingly similar. It underscores that liberalism does not perfectly align with racial egalitarianism, regardless of rhetoric to the contrary.
On Sunday, Biden made a speech on race in Birmingham, Alabama, commemorating the 1963 bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church, in which he said on the issue of how racism and racial hatred affect Black people:
"We know we're not there yet. No one knows it better. My mom used to have an expression, 'You want to understand me, walk in my shoes a mile.' Those of us who are white try, but we can never fully, fully understand. No matter how hard we try. We're almost, we're almost at this next phase of progress in my view."
Progress. That is the wall behind which white America hides, including white liberals. (Even many Black leaders have absorbed and regurgitate the progress narrative.) It expects Black people to swell and applaud at their effort. But, how is that a fair and legitimate expectation? Slavery, white supremacy and racism, are horrid, man-made constructs that should never have existed in the first place. Am I supposed to cheer the slow, creeping, centuries-long undoing of a thing that should never have been done?
Malcolm X was once asked if he felt that we were making progress in the country. He responded: "No. I will never say that progress is being made. If you stick a knife in my back 9 inches and pull it out 6 inches, there's no progress. If you pull it all the way out, that's not progress. The progress is healing the wound that the blow made."
I don't even think that's progress. That just returns the situation to a common baseline before the crime was committed.
Furthermore, it's not what Biden says in prepared remarks that's problematic, it's what he says off the cuff and under pressure that to me reveal an antiquated view on racial matters and racial sensitivities.
It was the way he advocated for the 1994 crime bill, a bill that contributed to America's surging mass incarceration, which disproportionately affected Black and Brown people in this country.
The bill did some good, but the harm it did cannot be overlooked or understated. Rather than fully owning up to the disastrous aspects of the bill, Biden has over the years bragged about it and defended it.
It was in the way he described then-candidate Barack Obama in 2007 as an African American who was "articulate and bright and clean." Clean? As opposed to what?
This critique of Biden isn't personal. I bear no ill will for the man. But, a fact is a fact, and no amount of growth, change or well-intentioned good-hearted-ness has the ability to erase it. - (The New York Times)

Leonard Pitts: We were told our institutions would save us

Texto completo: Once upon a time, there was an ideal. It was called the United States of America.
<img class="size-full wp-image-2657490" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Leonard-Pitts-Color.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="193" />
And in 2016, the presidency of the United States was captured by the flamboyantly incompetent star of a TV reality show, a man who doesn’t believe in any ideal beyond his own enrichment and aggrandizement. Some shaken observers assured us everything would yet be all right. The institutions of democracy — the courts, the Congress, the news media and the agencies of the federal government — would save America from the worst consequences of one of its worst decisions.
“The Guardrails Hold,” exulted the headline of a piece by the late conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer. He was highlighting acts of resistance to Donald Trump’s bizarre excesses by entities as varied as the Boy Scouts of America and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
That was in August of 2017. It has since become painfully clear Krauthammer exulted too soon. The vaunted institutions of democracy have proven largely unequal to the task of checking Trump’s transgressions.
The courts? The record is mixed; Trump’s bid to rig the Census was rejected, his Muslim ban was not.
The Congress? A hotbed of spinelessness that has given Trump less trouble than the Washington Generals give the Harlem Globetrotters.
The news media? Aggressive reporting is met with widespread apathy and partisan claims of “fake news.” The New York Times reported that Trump committed “outright fraud” as a businessman. Nobody cared.
Which brings us to federal agencies and last week’s news that the acting director of national intelligence is apparently shielding Trump from questioning over allegations of still-unrevealed misconduct. It seems Trump, who has a history of cavalier behavior with classified information — he once blurted intelligence secrets to Russians in the Oval Office — had an interaction with a foreign leader wherein he made an unspecified “promise” that so troubled one official it led to the filing of a formal whistleblower complaint.
As first reported by The Washington Post, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson found the complaint credible and designated it a matter of “urgent concern.” That’s a legal finding requiring notification of congressional oversight committees. But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to provide that information to lawmakers.
It’s important to note the context here.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation of four automakers after they reached agreement with the state of California to maintain higher fuel-efficiency standards than the federal government requires. It can be no coincidence that Trump has long been at war with that state.
At roughly the same time, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportedly were threatened with termination for contradicting Trump’s claim — he tried to prove it by marking a map with a Sharpie — that Alabama was menaced by a killer storm.
Now here’s the acting DNI throwing his body between Trump and accountability. We are seeing the credibility of the federal government mangled in service to this guy’s fragile ego. How weak the guardrails of democracy turn out to be. Even this one — a government of, by and for the people is looking suspiciously like a government of, by and for Trump.
But where guardrails fail, things crash and fall apart. Something to remember as we wait out the long years until next November.
We were told our institutions would save us. They’ll be lucky if they can save themselves.

Texto completo: It was after midnight when Kaitlin Chad Moss, her new husband, Jeremy Moss, and a handful of devoted wedding guests lingered as long as they could before they were politely informed that the celebration was over and it was time to go home.
“That’s when it hit me,” said Kaitlin Moss, 29, who was married last September at the Green Valley Ranch, a lodge and events space in Coram, Montana. “I’m never going to have everyone I love in one room like this again. It was hard to accept. I felt sad, and it didn’t go away.”
Kaitlin Moss broke down that night in front of her girlfriends. “I wish someone had warned me that this was something you could feel. Why is no one talking about this?” said Kaitlin Moss, who lives in Denver.
Thomas Meehan, 28, a government relations liaison officer for the Texas State Office of Risk Management, who married his husband, Philip Arnold, last New Year’s Eve in New Orleans, posed the same question to his mother, sister and friends. “I had six months of intensive planning, and after our wedding was over there was this void. I felt alone,” he said. “Everyone was shocked a guy could feel like this - depressed, lonely, and like I didn’t have a purpose.”
Post-wedding sadness is not uncommon among the newly married. Laura Stafford, a professor and director of the Bowling Green State University’s School of Media and Communication, and Allison Scott Gordon, an associate professor at the University of Kentucky’s Department of Communication, have jointly conducted two studies on depression, specifically concerning newly married women.
“In 2016 we looked at 28 women, half of whom said they felt sad or let down after their wedding,” Stafford said. Last year they interviewed 158 women. Twelve percent of the women interviewed in the second study expressed feelings of depression after being wedded.
“These women were the center of attention, and planning a wedding takes up so much of your time, it would be weird to not feel some kind of letdown,” Stafford said. “We also found there was more focus on the wedding than on the marriage. There was also uncertainty about their goals, their role as a wife, their relationship and partner choice.”
The pair are working on a third study where the same 158 women will be interviewed again to see if their moods have changed a year later.
“I kept waiting for my wedding bliss but instead I fell into this funk. I’d just gotten married to a great guy and I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t happy,” said Kaitlin Moss, the founder of theeveryhostess.com, a website covering lifestyle and entertaining. “It was like losing a job you love. That feeling lasted for three months.”
Brittny Drye, 34, who got married in 2015 and is the founder and the editor-in-chief of Love Inc. magazine, had a similar reaction. “I was very down and felt bad for six months. It was very confusing. I just got married, why am I not on Cloud 9?”
There are many reasons behind the emotional crash. For some, it’s returning to everyday life. For others, it’s the elimination of planning and anticipating such a big celebration or the loss of looking forward to that cultural, life-altering event. Then there’s the diminished attention, social letdown and the pressures and expectations that come with your new life and spouse.
To distract herself from her melancholy emotions, Drye hosted dinner parties. “I thought doing something that had elements of my wedding, but on a smaller scale, like home decor projects or entertaining friends where I’d mix cocktails, do floral arrangements, and make a meal would help,” she said. “But it was temporary and the sadness would return.”
Elizabeth Sloan, a licensed professional counselor and a clinical fellow at the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy in McLean, Virginia, said the wedding glow eventually dims.
“It’s normal to have mixed feelings about the life changes you’ve just made, which are now permanent and somewhat out of your control,” Sloan said. “It’s easy to look at your gains: a wedding, a spouse and new life. But there are also losses: the life you used to have. And when we feel loss, there’s sadness.”
Sloan added that changes in the level of neurotransmitters in the brain could be a contributor. “There’s a dopamine rush that comes with planning a wedding, and a dopamine cliff afterward because you’re not always doing exciting things,” she said. “You’re back home paying bills and going to work and figuring out what to make for dinner. That drains dopamine, it doesn’t increase it.”
Scott Stanley, a research professor and co-director of the Center for Marital and Family Studies at the University of Denver, cited social media and an inability to be present during the wedding as additional triggers.
“People are experiencing performance pressure because everything is announced on social media, including successes and achievements,” Stanley said. “There’s also more pressure for perfection, and to find the perfect person and not make a mistake. Physically and emotionally it’s exhausting. Some people struggle to rebound.”
Meehan, the government relations liaison officer, isolated himself after his wedding. “I lost the desire to socialize,” he said. “People started asking if I was OK. And people couldn’t understand why I wasn’t.”
Some had assumed, he said, “something was going on with me and Philip, but we were fine. It was hard to verbalize because how do you get depressed from your wedding?”
Meehan said he believes the emotional attachment to the event, paired with the fact that he was the driving force behind the planning, were partly to blame. “People think this is a women’s thing or a gay thing - it’s not,” he said. “Men don’t want to be perceived as weak or vulnerable. I’m just one of the first to be vocal about it.”
Bret Levesque, 36, an academic adviser for the University of Miami who got married in March at the Living Sculpture Sanctuary in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, spoke similarly. “Gay or straight, male or female, this is a thing that’s happening. I just didn’t know what it was called. I didn’t know why I felt lonely or that I lost a sense of purpose except that all the stimulation from planning our party was gone.”
Gone, too, is the couple’s professional wedding posse.
“They lost an insta-family who wanted to create their vision,” said Michelle Rago, the founder of Michelle Rago Destinations, an event planning and design firm based in New York. “The constant conversation they’ve had for the past year with this team of people, who they liked and whose attention and dedication was focused on them and producing their wedding, can be very intoxicating.”
But then, she continued, “There’s a huge drop of connectivity and that’s difficult for people. There are no more phone calls, meeting for drinks, or support system. It’s hard to give up the attention that was on you for over a year.”
Meehan used FaceTime to stay in touch with friends. He talked about his feelings with his husband. He forced himself to reconnect and to become more extroverted. Eventually the loneliness lifted.
Drye, the editor-in-chief of Love Inc. magazine, was easily angered and on edge after the wedding. “My new husband and I fought more than normal,” she said. “We have a strong marriage, we got through it, but it’s more serious than people give it credit. I should have seen a therapist; it would have helped me and my marriage. The blues is like this cutesy word people use. This is a real, concerning issue that should be taken seriously.”
Professionals agree. “For most, this kind of sadness is temporary,” said Sloan, who added that these melancholy feelings generally lessen during the months that follow your wedding. “First talk to other married friends, then talk to your spouse. Holding a secret creates distance,” she said.
Other positives that can emerge are greater connections with your spouse.
“Going through an intensive experience only to return inward can evoke emptiness, anxiety, loss and loneliness,” said Dr. Orna Guralink, a New York-based clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst. “But these feelings can inspire curiosity about the next stage for your life and ask you to figure out how you want to live as a married person. That can lead to a better discussion or a good opening for a new kind of conversation.”

Texto completo: Bruce Springsteen has a story to tell.
That's one aspect of a young Springsteen that former manager Carl "Tinker" West noticed early on.
"He's a good storyteller," said West, who's also a giant in the surfing world thanks to his founding of Challenger Eastern Surfboards in Ocean Township. "Vini (Lopez of the future E Street Band) brought him over to the shop (in Ocean Township). He was a smart kid, sort of quiet and he wrote songs. I said, 'You just keep writing something, you guys rehearse — work here all day, make surfboards and rock 'n' roll.'"
That was the plan. It worked.
Springsteen has sold millions of records, plays to stadiums around the world, is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, all for his rock 'n' rolling.
Now as Springsteen turns 70 on Monday, he's in an era of new artistic pursuits, new creative formats. The latest is the movie "Western Stars," a filmed version of his latest album. He co-directed "Western Stars" with frequent collaborator Thom Zimny. The film features a performance of the folk-rock orchestral album, and vignettes starring a solo Springsteen.
The film follows the hit "Springsteen on Broadway," which featured the Boss baring his life story, set to song and remembrance. "Springsteen on Broadway" ran from October 2017 to December 2018.
The music play was based on his New York Times best-selling memoir "Born to Run," which was released in September 2016. Springsteen did a nine-city book tour, where he greeted thousands of fans in person for hours at a stretch in a feat of physical and mental stamina.
The Boss stood on a platform, under lights, while he met fans.
Cindy Marselis of Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, was in tears after meeting Springsteen at the Freehold Barnes and Noble signing on Sept. 27, 2016.
"I met the person I always wanted to meet," said Marselis, at the signing. "I got to kiss him. It was awesome."
Springsteen is still telling stories, and still on stage. But now he's exploring new formats for the stories, and the stories he's telling are largely his own these days.
"I think he's said this before, but he truly envisions himself as an artist and I feel that all of these projects are in service of him wanting to tap into all of the different facets of who he is," said Caroline Madden, 26, of Toms River.
Madden is set to release a book on Springsteen's music in films and TV, "Springsteen as Soundtrack: The Sound of the Boss in Film and Television," from McFarland & Co. "That's why he's so unique and has endured as an artist for so long – he doesn't settle. He's always looking to renew himself or try something new."
West saw that creative energy up close when Springsteen fronted the band Steel Mill, which West managed and did sound for.
"I liked Springsteen because those guys would go in the back of the shop and they would rehearse," West said. "Vini Lopez, Danny Federici, they would write lots of music and whenever we'd get a couple of songs together that were pretty good, we'd go and try it out at Pandemonium, right at the bottom of Sunset Avenue."
The club was less than a mile from West's surfboard factory.
"What changes his music is that he wants to write something different," West said. "He writes some great stories. Stories to me are what makes great music, especially the early stuff. The first two albums ('Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.' and 'The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle'), people are still asking for those songs. Even so, he's written a lot of stuff after that's pretty damn good."
West and Springsteen's enduring friendship is explored in the book "Born to Run" and, subsequently in "Springsteen on Broadway." A highlight of the play is West, Springsteen and West's dog driving out west in West's 1950 Chevy flat-bed truck to play a concert and meet music industry contacts.
Springsteen didn't know how to drive until he drove the Chevy truck with West in the passenger seat. West still owns the truck.
"He knew what he wanted to do, I'm pretty sure," said West of Springsteen's artistic drive. "He wanted to wow an audience and he did. He had a great band. Federici was great. Lopez was great. Little Vinnie Roslin was great."
West used his connections and hustle to get a deal with Paramount Records.
"I finally found a deal that wouldn't screw him over," West said. "Then he said 'I don't want to do Steel Mill anymore.' (I said) That's up to you."
"I introduced him to Mike Appel. He introduced him to John Hammond and the rest is history," said West of Springsteen's subsequent manager and the of the famed Columbia Records talent scout. .
The stories Springsteen has been telling in recent years are stark, revealing and confessional.
"For a long time, if I loved you or if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could," says Springsteen in "Western Stars."
He talked without censor of his troubled relationship with his father in "Springsteen on Broadway" and has been candid about his struggles with mental illness.
"I have come close enough to (mental illness) where I know I am not completely well myself," Springsteen previously told Esquire. "I've had to deal with a lot of it over the years, and I'm on a variety of medications that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically and ... just ... the wheels can come off a little bit. So we have to watch, in our family. I have to watch my kids, and I've been lucky there. It ran in my family going way before my dad."
Springsteen is married to Patti Scialfa and they have three children, Evan, 29; Jessica, 27; and Sam, 25.
Springsteen's non-rock 'n' roll work of the past few years has also framed the aging process for fans. He's showing the way to baby boomers about what to do, how to do it, and what's important in life when you get to a certain age.
The fans of his generation might have looked to John Lennon for the answers, but he didn't get to grow old like Springsteen. Lennon would have been 78 if he were still alive.
"Aging is scary but fascinating, and great talent morphs in strange and often enlightening ways," said Springsteen in "Born to Run."
There no official events planned to recognize Springsteen's 70th birthday, but area venues do have Boss-themed shows, including the Brian Kirk and the Jirk's-led "Born: Celebrating the Boss' 70th" at the Count Basie Center in Red Bank on Wednesday, Sept. 25, and Thursday, Sept. 26. Visit thebasie.org for more info and tickets.
"Springsteen: His Hometown," an exhibit presented by the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, opens Sunday, Sept. 29, at the historical association in Freehold.
Ticket information is at www.SpringsteenHisHometown.com.
Preview showings of "Western Stars" are scheduled for Oct. 19 and 23 in area movie theaters. Visit www.fathomevents.com for more info and tickets.
As for the E Street Band, Springsteen ain't done yet, despite the success he's had with his new avenues of artistic expression.
"We want the band to get back together," said Springsteen to applause on Sept. 12 at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I've got some songs written for the band and I'd like to make a really good rock band record with the E Street Band.
"We'll be seeing you."

Texto completo: One was a pioneering female journalist with a deep understanding of the totems and taboos of Washington. Another was a pioneering television broadcaster with a sharp eye for history. The third was a pioneering business reporter with an obsession with detail. All were enriched by a figure they lived with: parents and a spouse in one case, a college roommate in another, a brother in yet a third.
Cokie Roberts. Sander Vanocur. Paul Ingrassia. The three died within hours of each other, an unusual moment of mortality that reminds us not only of how fragile and ephemeral is life but also of the passing of an era of probity and civility in public affairs that seems almost antiquarian in our amped-up world.
Together they left the legacy that all journalists crave - figures of integrity and intelligence who changed the way we look at the world even as they changed the way their craft was conducted. We in our business are all their legatees, and you as consumers of news are their beneficiaries.
Cokie Roberts was the daughter of two House members, one a Capitol Hill baron en route to the speakership when he perished in an Alaska air crash, the other a quiet but imposing lawmaker who also was a diplomat. She grew up in, and as an adult moved back into, a courtly house at the bend of Bradley Boulevard in Bethesda, Md.
She married Steven V. Roberts, a force of nature at The New York Times and for many years a Cokie colleague on the marble floors and, often, in the cloistered back rooms and hideaway offices of Capitol Hill. She and the formidable Linda Wertheimer, her NPR colleague on the Hill, knew more of the inside workings of Congress than most backbenchers and half the leadership. She and Steve drove me home from work in the Capitol press galleries every night. It was a graduate education in American politics, and they paid for the tuition, which was the gasoline.
But Cokie's impact was only part in her work, which was not simply professional but peerless. It was also in the role she grew into with remarkable grace, as the grande dame of Washington journalists. She, along with fellow New York Times wife Judith Weinraub, recoiled and rebelled in their identity as Wives of The New York Times and blazed a trail of independence and accomplishment that was an inspiration to a generation of female journalists.
In a different but equally potent way, Mr. Vanocur was a figure of elegance and refinement in the raucous environs of the pressroom. Working for the Manchester Guardian and The New York Times before assuming his principal role as inquisitor and intellectual at NBC News, he was the final surviving participant of the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon debates. He was a towering figure, but not looming so large that my 8-year-old daughter, at lunch with him in his Santa Barbara retirement, couldn't share an inadvertent off-color comment with him and prompt an embarrassing laugh around the table.
At work, Sandy was a figure to reckon with; he broadcast all night and into the morning the day Robert F. Kennedy was shot. In retirement he was a gentle critic and genuine booster of those he chose to follow, and when Sandy followed you he read every word. He was possessed of humankind's greatest attribute, the gift of friendship, and perhaps his oldest friendship was with his Northwestern roommate, Newton N. Minow, who gained fame of his own when, as chair of the Federal Communications Commission, he described television as a "vast wasteland." (It was no surprise that the shipwrecked boat on television's moronic "Gilligan's Island,'' which ran from 1964 to 1967, was named the S.S. Minnow.)
"Sandy was equipped with deep intellectual and political curiosity, which gave him exceptional insight into how government succeeds or fails," Mr. Minow, now 93 years old, told me. The two men were neighbors in Washington's Cleveland Park section during the Kennedy years. "Always ahead of the curve, Sandy's reporting enlightened our nation with his mind, heart, courage and wisdom."
The final figure to leave the pressroom in this sad passage was Paul Ingrassia, a former Reuters managing editor who shared a Pulitzer for his Wall Street Journal investigation of the management of General Motors. The day after he died, the columnist E.J. Dionne described Paul as a "reporter's reporter," a description that would have pleased Paul no end.
In a way, Paul's heart wasn't in the right place. It migrated after his right lung was removed 22 years ago. But in the most important way, it was in just the right place, sometimes on his sleeve, always at the center of his work.
Paul's brother Larry, who held top positions at The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times, provides the best testimony to his skill. "Paul could be a very demanding boss, an editor who held reporters and subjects - and himself - to the highest standards," Larry said in a sad email exchange the day after his brother died. (Paul once told Paul Gigot that if he couldn't cease making errors he should find another line of work. Mr. Gigot won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2000 and a year later became the editorial page editor of The Journal, a position he still holds.)
"Paul was innately, scrupulously fair," his brother went on. "He didn't care who you were or where you came from. What mattered was what you did. If you worked hard and did well, you were heaped with praise and encouragement or got a story written about your company that you liked. If you fell short, well, that would be another matter."
That was a quality - a point of view - a hard truth - shared by all three. That is why we mourn and miss them already, even as we thank, and celebrate, them for their work, their lives and above all their sacred honor.

Democrats want to impeach Kavanaugh? Go for it!

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party’s presidential candidates.
No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh’s impeachment. “These newest revelations are disturbing,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding “Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.” Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh’s “place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached.” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former congressman Beto O’Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former vice president Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and “follow the evidence to wherever it leads.” That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field.
Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats’ way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see Kavanaugh impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see.
Let’s remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let’s relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to a college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties — all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let’s rehash Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let’s remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sex predator.
That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party’s campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were “like an adrenaline shot” for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of his party’s presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh’s impeachment to “get real.” “We’ve got to get beyond this ‘impeachment is the answer to every problem,’” Durbin said. “It’s become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you’re unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that’s how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we’re ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said “no.”
Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could “restructure” the court when they take power in the 2020 elections — packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority.
Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. The Washington Post reports that in 2016,“26% of Trump voters told pollsters that Supreme Court nominees were the most important factor in their voting, compared with only 18% of Hillary Clinton voters who said the same.” As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.
In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin.

Texto completo: This week's book events focus on strategies for survival, in alternate realities, current realities and everything in between. Hollywood star Demi Moore divulges how to persevere in her memoir, "Inside Out." Annalee Newitz's novel, "The Future of Another Timeline," shows what a teenage riot girl has to do to keep afloat in a man's world. In "We Are the Weather," Jonathan Safran Foer suggests consuming less meat as a way to ensure the planet keeps spinning. But if we're talking survival skills in publishing, then Beyond Baroque's Small Press Book Festival will offer sustenance. A panel at the Annenberg Beach House shall provide, too: I'll join writers Adam Popescu and David L. Ulin to discuss how to make the leap from journalism to novels.
Small presses but big books
In its first annual small press book festival, Beyond Baroque presents an afternoon of Saturday workshops, performances and readings throughout the day. Local small presses will be on hand, including cosponsor Vagabond Press, Tia Chucha, Angel City Press and the Los Angeles Review of Books, as well as the Culver City Historical Society and Los Angeles Poetry Society.

11:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Saturday. The Wende Museum of Cold War, 10808 Culver Blvd ., Culver City. Free.
--
The long road to publication
Adam Popescu, a New York Times contributor, will share the path to getting his novel "Nima" published; the book is about a teen Sherpa who flees a marriage and finds herself assisting a hiker on Mt. Everest. David L. Ulin, a former Times book editor, shares his experience with "Ear to the Ground" (cowritten with Paul Kolsby), his satirical sendup of 1990s Hollywood when an earthquake prediction resuscitates a dead-in-the-water script. And I'll be talking about the journey of "Neon Green," which kicks off with the arrival of a spaceship in suburban Chicago in 1994. All three novels were published by Los Angeles' Unnamed Press.
6:30 p.m-8 p.m. Tuesday. Annenberg Beach House, 415 Pacific Coast Hwy. at Beach House Way, Santa Monica. Free.
--
Why we should eat less meat
Jonathan Safran Foer's "Eating Animals" took on animal suffering in factory farming. In his latest, "We Are the Weather," the author who broke out with the 2002 novel "Everything Is Illuminated," comes at the same issue through the prism of climate change. Though he acknowledges that our animal agriculture practices are just one piece of the puzzle, Foer lays out an argument for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by abstaining from meat for the first two meals of the day. At Scripps College, he'll be in conversation with "The Big One" host and KPCC science reporter Jacob Margolis.
7 p.m.-8 p.m. Thursday. Garrison Theater, Scripps College, 241 E. 10th Street, Claremont. Free.
--
Moore's own take on her life
In 1996, Demi Moore received an unprecedented $12.5 million for her role in "Striptease." The salary earned her the derisive nickname "Gimme Moore" in the press. In truth, Moore was an early advocate for equal pay in Hollywood. In her memoir, "Inside Out," Moore writes about the dissonance of being a high-paid actress while working through childhood trauma, addiction and raising three children. The actress, now 56, will open up about her memoir at the Writers Guild Theater.
8 p.m. Thursday. Writers Guild Theater, 135 South Doheny Drive, Beverly Hills. $20-$53.
--
Time travel for everybody
Annalee Newitz's latest novel, "The Future of Another Timeline," involves a teenage riot girl in 1992 and an idealistic geology professor in 2022 battling against a secret cabal of men who hope to destroy time travel. In this reality so close to our own, time travel allows anyone to jump into the past and future, but the cabal wants it only for the elite. Michelle Tea ("Black Wave") praised the book as "the mind-blowing punk feminist sci-fi time traveling thriller you've been waiting for." Newitz, who founded the science fiction website io9, will be in conversation with Sean Carroll, Mindscape host, author and professor of theoretical physics at Caltech.
7:30 p.m. Thursday. Skylight Books, 1818 N. Vermont Ave. Free.

Texto completo: A New York street wear company showcased sweatshirts last week featuring bullet holes and the names of schools where students have been killed in mass shootings.
The New York street wear brand Bstroy's new hoodies are unremarkable at first glance. They come in powder blue, a dark and worn gray, a muted red and a light green. Each one is stamped with collegiate-style block lettering featuring the name of one of four well-known American schools. They look like any other school sweatshirt, until you notice the bullet holes.
The backlash began immediately this week after the company posted photos on Instagram of the bullet-hole-riddled hoodies with the names of schools where dozens of students have died in mass shootings: Columbine, Sandy Hook, Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Virginia Tech.
The photos showcasing the hoodies, which were introduced at a Manhattan fashion show on Friday, drew the ire of those affected by school shootings, along with many others.
"Under what scenario could somebody think this was a good idea?" Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime Guttenberg, was killed in the Parkland, Fla., shooting last year, said on Twitter on Tuesday.
"This has me so upset," he said, adding that if any of his followers knew anyone involved with the clothing line, they should "please ask them to stop it immediately."
On Monday, Delaney Tarr, a survivor of the Parkland shooting, called the sweatshirts "disgusting" and "unacceptable." She pointed out that March for Our Lives, a student-led gun control advocacy group, sells shirts of its own whose proceeds "go to actually empowering survivors."
Despite the uproar, the brand, which did not respond to requests for comment this week, found scattered support among those who felt the bullet-hole design brought needed attention to the issue of gun control.
DeAndre Rodriguez, who commented on Instagram in support of the hoodies, said that the idea was "executed perfectly," but that people were not ready to talk about it yet.
"These shootings were some of the worst in the U.S. and I completely forgot about them till I saw the hoodies yesterday," he said, adding that he grew up two hours from Virginia Tech and was old enough to have remembered the shooting.
"Nobody talking about how this enrages people more than the actual gun violence itself," commented another Instagram user.
One of the brand's co-founders, Dieter Grams, offered an explanation of the concept in a statement to Time.
"We wanted to make a comment on gun violence and the type of gun violence that needs preventative attention and what its origins are," he said, "while also empowering the survivors of tragedy through storytelling in the clothes."
According to Time, Bstroy never intended to sell the sweatshirts online, but the intense response may have changed that.
The brand's other co-founder, Brick Owens, defended the designs in a post on his personal Instagram account.
"Sometimes life can be painfully ironic," reads a statement on a card printed with the collection's name. "Like the irony of dying violently in a place you considered to be a safe, controlled environment, like school."
Bstroy's spring 2020 men's wear collection, Samsara, was named for "the cycle we must transcend to reach Nirvana," according to the statement, which also refers to "life's fragility, shortness and unpredictability."
"It is this push and pull that creates the circular motion that is the cycle of life," the statement reads.
"We are making violent statements," Mr. Grams, who goes by Du, told The New York Times for an article last week that details the brand's provocative aesthetic and its hopes for a future in luxury fashion.
"That's for you to know who we are, so we can have a voice in the market," he said. "But eventually that voice will say things that everyone can wear."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Trump administration plunged into an extraordinary showdown with Congress Thursday over access to a whistleblower’s reported complaint about incidents including a private conversation between President Donald Trump and a foreign leader. The blocked complaint is both “serious” and “urgent,” the government’s intelligence watchdog said.
The administration is keeping Congress from even learning what exactly the whistleblower is alleging, but the intelligence community’s inspector general said the matter involves the “most significant” responsibilities of intelligence leadership. One report said it involved a promise Trump made in a phone call to a foreign leader. A lawmaker said the complaint was “based on a series of events.”
The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday evening that at least part of the complaint involves Ukraine. The newspapers cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter. The Associated Press has not confirmed the reports.
The inspector general appeared before the House intelligence committee behind closed doors Thursday but declined, under administration orders, to reveal to members the substance of the complaint.
The standoff raises fresh questions about the extent to which Trump’s allies are protecting the president from oversight and, specifically, if his new acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, is working with the Justice Department to shield the president from the reach of Congress.
Trump, though giving no details about any incident, denied Thursday that he would ever “say something inappropriate” on such a call.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he was prepared to go to court to try to force the Trump administration to open up about the complaint.
“The inspector general has said this cannot wait,” said Schiff, describing the administration’s blockade as an unprecedented departure from law. “There’s an urgency here that I think the courts will recognize.”
The Washington Post reported the complaint involves an intelligence official’s allegation that Trump made a promise to an unidentified foreign leader in a telephone call. The Post cited two anonymous former U.S. officials.
The Associated Press has not confirmed the report.
Schiff said he, too, could not confirm whether the Post report was accurate because the administration was claiming executive privilege in withholding the complaint. But letters from the inspector general to the committee released Thursday said it was an “urgent” matter of “serious or flagrant abuse” that must be shared with lawmakers.
The letters also made it clear that Trump’s new acting director of national intelligence, Maguire, consulted with the Justice Department in deciding not to transmit the complaint to Congress in a further departure from standard procedure. It’s unclear whether the White House was also involved, Schiff said.
Because the administration is claiming the information is privileged, Schiff said he believes the whistleblower’s complaint “likely involves the president or people around him.”
Trump dismissed it all.
“Another Fake News story out there – It never ends!” Trump tweeted. “Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!”
He asked: “Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially ‘heavily populated’ call.”
Trump tapped Maguire, a former Navy official, as acting intelligence director in August, after the departure of Director Dan Coats, a former Republican senator who often clashed with the president, and the retirement of Sue Gordon, a career professional in the No. 2 position.
Maguire has refused to discuss details of the whistleblower complaint, but he has been subpoenaed by the House panel and is expected to testify publicly next Thursday. Both Maguire and the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, are also expected next week at the Senate intelligence committee.

The UAW strikes General Motors — now and 49 years ago

Texto completo: The United Auto Workers has gone on strike against General Motors. Once upon a time, within my living memory, this would have been — was — front-page national news. When the UAW went on strike against General Motors in 1946 and 1970, GM was the nation’s largest employer and the UAW one of its largest labor unions. Some 343,000 UAW members went on strike in 1970, 22,000 of them in Canada, and the strike lasted 67 days. This was during what turned out to be the last months of a recession.
In contrast, just 46,000 UAW members went out on strike this week. The work stoppage at GM has had an impact on suppliers and factory communities, but it’s orders of magnitude less on the national economy than during the strike 49 years ago.
I have noticed some thoughtful writers urging a return to the postwar economy, with its high wages, generous fringe benefits and job guarantees. As the old saying goes, nice work if you can get it. But dependence on one company assumes that company will remain of similar magnitude or only grow larger over time. That was plausible in 1970 (it was the great theme of John Kenneth Galbrath’s 1967 bestseller The New Industrial State), when General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler seemed to be as dominant in the U.S. auto industry as they had been a generation or more before. But it’s no longer plausible today.
Back then, it was assumed that wage settlements reached by industrial unions and giant employers would set a pattern that would be followed, with higher pay and higher prices, through very large parts of the economy. Presidential administrations followed the negotiations closely, hoping that strikes would not cause or prolong recessions and that the reverberations from a settlement would not prove inflationary.
Forty-nine years later, nobody thinks these negotiations will have a significant effect on the larger economy. UAW strikers in 1970 constituted four-tenths of 1 percent of the work force—about 1 of every 200 workers. UAW strikers today constitute three-hundredths of 1 percent of the work force — about one out of every 3,300 workers.
One other big difference: The UAW president in 1970 was Leonard Woodcock, who succeeded to the position after Walter Reuther, president from 1946 to 1968, died in a plane crash. Woodcock and his ultimate successor Douglas Fraser continued the austere institutional culture instilled by Reuther, in which union leaders received relatively low pay and perquisites and were held to the highest standard of honesty. As I noted earlier this month and as a Washington Examiner editorial noted yesterday, that culture seems to be extinct, with UAW officials accused of or in some cases already found guilty of corruption.
The definitive history of the 1970 strike is The Company and the Union, by William Serrin, a Detroit Free Press reporter when it was first published in 1973 and later a reporter for the New York Times. Serrin criticized the UAW for not gaining more in wages and fringe benefits and argued, in an introduction to a later edition, that it was ludicrous to think that any auto company was threatened with bankruptcy. He was proven wrong on that. But he also made the point that both the union and the company did little or nothing to make assembly plant work less rote and routine, in line with the theories of Frederick W. Taylor that workers should be treated like animals and only required to perform the simplest tasks over and over again. Here, the foreign-owned (and especially the Japanese) auto companies had more enlightened management ideas which the U.S. based companies ultimately tried to imitate, sometimes with resistance from some (not all) UAW leaders, who preferred the adversarial approach encouraged by U.S. labor laws. On this point, Serrin was way ahead of his times.
Personal note: I lived and worked in Detroit at this time and knew Serrin. At the time, I thought he was right that the auto companies were financially impregnable and wrong that a non-Taylorite, Japanese-style, cooperative labor-management relations would work better. I was exactly wrong on both counts.

Texto completo: Elizabeth Spatz feels like she's being bilked by the University of Cincinnati.
The senior marketing major, who carefully monitors fees tacked on to her tuition each semester, must buy UC student health insurance for $2,360 total for the school year. Due to an outstanding balance on her account, her status as a student was placed on hold, which prevents graduating and accessing transcripts.
Here's the rub for Spatz: She already has insurance through her mother's plan. But it doesn't meet the minimum requirements set by UC's Board of Trustees.
The requirements include coverage for emergency services, ambulatory patient services and prescription drugs – all areas Spatz has covered under her mother's plan.
But because her mother's plan lacks maternity and mental health coverage, Spatz must opt in to UC's plan, too.
Spatz, 21, is not pregnant. She doesn't use substances. And she's less than nine months from graduating.
"Although I'm covered with health insurance, it's not deemed acceptable," Spatz said. "More money into the hole."
Phil Diller, a professor of family and community medicine and senior associate dean at UC's College of Medicine, said that "safeguarding the lives, health and safety of our students and our wider community is the reason we require our students to carry health insurance with certain minimum coverages."
Without comprehensive insurance, Diller added, debt from a medical event could preclude a student from graduating, or an illness could spread through the UC community.
Spatz contends her existing coverage is ample. She points to free counseling and psychological services already offered to students.
All students have access to an initial counseling visit and three individual therapeutic conversations, wrote M.B. Reilly, a UC spokeswoman, by email. Group therapy sessions are free, but Reilly added that the program does not include psychiatric care, inpatient or outpatient care or hospitalization.
Young adults (age 21-25) had the second highest incidence of mental illness in 2018 among all age groups, at 27%, according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
UC has offered or required student health insurance since at least 1978, according to the Ohio Administrative Code.
Currently, all students enrolled in six or more credit hours are automatically brought in to UC's plan, but they can submit a waiver request to opt out.
As part of the waiver request, which is due on the 15th day of each semester, students must prove their existing insurance meets all minimum requirements as set by board rule.
Many colleges and universities in Ohio and nationally require full-time students to carry health insurance, said Reilly, the UC spokeswoman. These mandates, she added, are to ensure a medical event doesn't prevent students from continuing their education.
Reilly wrote that UC had "less than five" appeals of waivers denied this fall. UC's insurance includes benefits such as no charge for primary care visits.
Spatz contends that the rule's goal – to keep students in school – may actually be hindered by the rule itself. She knows several classmates who have dropped out due to general affordability issues. Adding a mandatory second health insurance premium could hurt students already struggling, Spatz said.
Many universities provide primary care services, said the New York Times. The University of Michigan offers such services for a $10 co-payment, which is covered by a mandatory student fee. No such fee exists at UC.

Texto completo: While President Donald Trump's Twitter spats and derisive nicknames for critics draw much attention, the administration's war on science goes largely unnoticed.
Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., is wisely attempting to draw attention to that battle in calling for an investigation into what has become known as Sharpiegate. While that kerfuffle is a relatively minor and almost comical scandal, it reflects the serious damage the president is doing to the federal government.
You likely know the story by now. As Hurricane Dorian approached the U.S. a couple of weeks ago, Trump tweeted out a warning that Alabama might be in the storm's path. The National Weather Service office in Birmingham quickly clarified that Alabama would see no impact from Dorian, and the president spent the next several days insisting he was correct. He even produced a map — apparently altered with a Sharpie — to support his position.
That was absurd but relatively harmless — simply another example of Trump's thin-skinned response to criticism. But then the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration got involved, castigating the weather service for, essentially, being correct in disputing the president. The New York Times reported that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire NOAA staff who did not back Trump's statements about the hurricane.
As Cantwell said: “The Trump administration's attacks on science get more and more harmful and outrageous every day. We cannot allow science to be censored by politics or politicians.”
Such censorship is modus operandi for the administration. In 2017, Trump nominated Barry Myers as NOAA director. Myers was the CEO of AccuWeather, a family business that competes with federal weather services. His nomination has not yet been considered by the Senate.
The Interior secretary is David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for oil and gas firms whose desires stand in direct conflict with the department's mission. The Environmental Protection Agency administrator is Andrew Wheeler, also a former lobbyist for energy companies. The Health and Human Services secretary is Alex Azar, a former drug industry lobbyist. In these departments and elsewhere, Trump has appointed ideologues and sycophants who have little interest in using scientific study to develop policy.
The president repeatedly has undermined intellectual honesty in favor of promoting his particular view of the world — a view often in conflict with reasonable evidence. As Robert Gebelhoff of The Washington Post wrote: “The administration has suppressed, blocked or ignored scientific research on the environmental effects of mining in national forests, the dangers of asbestos, the status of endangered species, the effect a citizenship question would have on the U.S. Census, the safety of children's products and countless other issues.”
Scientists — people who have spent their professional lives developing expertise — have routinely been undermined by an administration that is replacing the swamp of Washington, D.C., with intellectual rot. That likely was to be expected from an administration that in its earliest days defended the use of “alternative facts,” but it should be a concern to anybody who has an interest in government making decisions based upon reliable information — which should be all of us.
Cantwell's call for a hearing on Trump's undermining of science is likely to be ignored by the Republicans who control the Senate. But it should be followed by an outcry

Texto completo: The Wicked Streatery food truck is coming up on its one-year anniversary, which means chef-owner Jeremy Playford is almost 12 months into living his best life.
A classically trained chef with credentials through the American Culinary Federation, Playford worked as a local country club chef for 16 years. But with two young and active boys, his 70-hour work week was hard to balance with family life. So, Playford hung up his executive chef apron and went out on his own, launching his truck last November.
"Deep down, a lot of chefs have this fantasy of having a food truck, going around, just doing food for us," Playford said.
"This gives us the freedom to express ourselves."
Playford takes that self expression seriously. Because of his country-club background, he's comfortable with a range of cuisines — classic American, Spanish, Asian — and his dishes showcase a variety of flavors. Since he's not locked into a set menu at Wicked Streatery, he can choose what to serve based on his own whims.
"I go to the markets every week and see what's inspiring me that week, then I write our menus around that," Playford said.
He focuses on casual fare done well, with some upscale twists on classic comfort food — like his grilled cheese sandwich made with fried green tomatoes, Havarti, applewood smoked bacon and his scratch-made fire-roasted-tomato mayo.
"I was doing five-star dining for so long. I'm trying to do more familiar stuff so people aren't afraid to try things," Playford said.
One of the biggest hits he's had at Wicked is the crispy fried Brussels sprouts finished with a vinaigrette infused with Serrano chilies and walnuts.
"That was one of the dishes that did well at my club and I wanted to take to the bar scene," he said.
Other favorites include the bistro burger, a two patty burger with bourbon-bacon jam, baby arugula and aioli; and the Korean tacos made with gochujang-marinated chicken or shrimp served over kimchi slaw in a flour tortilla.
During the week, customers can catch Wicked Streatery at office buildings around Southwest Florida at lunchtime and at local breweries in the evenings. The truck's range extends from RipTide Brewing in Naples to Scotty's Bierwerks in Cape Coral. Playford and his crew — his wife, Alyssa, is usually on the register — will also do events at churches, concerts, weddings or private functions.
"Anywhere that's looking for good food, we try to show up," he said.
Now that he's out of the country-club scene, Playford has fully embraced the food truck lifestyle.
"We're really enjoying the culture of other food truckers," Playford said.
"We went into it thinking there would be fierce competition, but everybody's been really accepting. We've made lots of food-truck friends along the way."
On their days off, the Playfords even go out looking for other food trucks.
"It's locals supporting locals," he said. "That's going really well."
Now that he's in a truck instead of back in the kitchen, Playford gets to meet his customers face to face, which he enjoys. He likes seeing first-hand their reactions to his creations and hearing their feedback.
Another unexpected bonus of being out and about instead of stuck inside?
"I actually get a tan," Playford said.
Just one more reason he's living his dream.

Ross Douthat: The abortion mysticism of Pete Buttigieg

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has made his Christian piety a minor theme of his presidential campaign — quoting Proverbs on the debate stage to critique Republican opposition to a minimum-wage increase, attacking conservative evangelicals over their “porn star presidency” and un-biblical approach to refugees, urging his party to court religious voters and take religion more seriously.
Buttigiegian integralism does not include, so far as I can tell, support for any policy that deviates from the progressive catechism; like certain fervent Republicans of the religious right, he appears to believe that God’s will has finally been perfectly instantiated in the platform of a single political party 2,000 years after the birth of Christ. But because Buttigieg is a smart guy — a Rhodes scholar, even — I assumed that his religious politics at least included some kind of intelligent-sounding explanation for his position on abortion, his support for his party’s absolutely-no-restrictions line.
Buttigieg offered such an explanation on the radio early this month. I want to quote it in full, because right and left have been arguing over what he meant.
“Now, right now, (Republicans) hold everybody in line with this one kind of piece of doctrine about abortion, right, which is obviously a tough issue for a lot of people to think through morally. Then again, you know, there’s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath, and so even that is something that we can interpret differently. …
“No matter where you think about the kind of cosmic question of where life begins, most Americans can get on board with the idea of, alright, I might draw the line here, you might draw the line there, but the most important thing is the person who should be drawing the line is the woman making the decision.”
The immediate conservative interpretation of this quote was that Buttigieg was justifying pro-choice maximalism with Scripture, by citing the same Bible he quotes to condemn the GOP on other issues to claim that human life begins with a baby’s first breath outside the womb. The progressive response was that no, he was saying instead that (to quote the noted theologian Wiggum of Springfield) the Bible says a lot of things , nothing it says on abortion is definitive, and so even a polity influenced by Christian piety should leave both believers and nonbelievers alone to decide the fetal personhood question themselves.
The progressive interpretation is probably the more accurate description of what was going through Buttigieg’s mind when he was answering the question. But the conservative claim that he believes that personhood is mystically imparted via the inhalation of oxygen is the more accurate description of his actual legal position, and the emerging orthodoxy of his party.
That orthodoxy, as embodied by legislation in liberal states and pressed by activists upon the Democratic candidates for president, would allow abortion absolutely throughout pregnancy while still prohibiting infanticide absolutely thereafter. You can describe that kind of regime as agnostic about fetal personhood if you wish, but in legal terms it is stringently definitive. It draws an incredibly bright line — here a legal nonperson who can be terminated for any cause, there a legal person whose killing is a grave offense — at exactly the moment Buttigieg’s biblical reference invoked, the moment of first breath outside the womb.
So it’s fitting that the Smartest Guy in the Room (trademark) among the Democratic candidates gestured to Holy Writ in defending this position, however dubious his exegesis. Because the gesture captures the reality that the Democrats, in their zeal, are moving toward the most mystical, the least scientifically defensible, of possible positions on fetal personhood — one that only a special revelation could support.
All definitions of human personhood are equally mystical , comes one response, but that’s not really true. The difficulty of the pro-life position, the extremism inherent in any anti-abortion politics, rests not in our mysticism but in our biological-philosophical rigor. Our side of the debate has the simplest and most scientifically coherent definition of personhood, and our difficulty comes in persuading people that this logical coherence should outweigh the muddle of moral intuitions on the status of the embryo and the requirements of female equality. The pro-life position is rejected, when it is rejected, for leaning too heavily on scientific definitions, not for ignoring them.
A pro-choice philosophy, meanwhile, can be more or less scientific depending on where, instead of conception, it wants to draw its moral lines. A case for legal abortion that’s organized around brain development or fetal viability, for instance, has difficulties insofar as both definitions are moving targets. But both at least encompass some biologically relevant status that a fetus could acquire, some benchmark it could reach, that would establish its right not to be dismembered and destroyed.
The first-breath definition, by contrast, has nothing to do with fetal development at all, which means that it requires a kind of magical thinking about what happens to the fetus when it passes through the birth canal. Or else it requires believing that there is nothing that could give a fetus a right to life so long as it lives inside a woman; your unborn child could be reciting Shakespeare to you in sign language and it would still have no right to life.
The latter position is held by certain activists and philosophers, but even the most liberal politician hesitates to defend abortion rights so baldly, which is how you get the mysticism of life’s first breath instead. But neither argument, neither form of maximalism, has much support outside the liberal base. Instead, Roe v. Wade has been sustained for many years precisely because the country understands it to ratify some kind of developmental or viability-based system — a system that seems closer to the uncertain, conflicted middle than the more exacting ethic proposed by the anti-abortion side
So it’s striking that with Roe perhaps threatened by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court (perhaps!), the abortion-rights movement has decided that allowing any room for viability and developmental-based restrictions is capitulation, and that a mystical maximalism is the necessary play.
This isn’t just a matter of what Democratic candidates are now expected to say, the disappearance of “safe, legal and rare” from left-of-center rhetoric. Planned Parenthood, which has long benefited from its cultivated reputation as a health care outfit that occasionally performs medically necessary abortions, is currently embroiled in a messy fight with its former head, Leana Wen, that reflects the new maximalism: Wen, hired originally because she was a talented M.D., says she lost her job in part because she wanted to embrace the health-provider reputation and do outreach to the conflicted and lukewarm — and that goal conflicted, in obvious ways, with a “not till the first breath” definition of when legal personhood begins.
Meanwhile, as a kind of grimly ironic accompaniment to his scriptural musings, Buttigieg’s hometown, South Bend, has just discovered that its longtime abortion provider, the late Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, kept a substantial collection of fetal remains on his property: 2,246 “products of conception,” to be exact, carefully preserved.
The version of pro-choice politics that has been generally successful in this country allows Americans to support abortion rights within limits, while still regarding figures like Klopfer as murderous or monstrous.
But the more maximalist and mystical your claims about when personhood begins (or doesn’t), the more strained that distinction gets. The unapologetic grisliness of a Klopfer, or a Kermit Gosnell before him, haunts a Buttigiegian abortion politics more than it does a “safe, legal, rare” triangulation, because it establishes the most visceral of contrasts — between the mysticism required to believe that the right to life begins at birth and the cold and obvious reality that what our laws call a nonperson can still become a corpse.

Texto completo: Last week my friend and Post-Gazette colleague Mike White was reading the news about the 2018 Triple Crown winning racehorse Justify, now freshly accused of doping, when the peerless high school sports oracle suddenly remembered that back in the '80s, I'd had some good luck interviewing the participants when I covered the Kentucky Derby.
I could not remember that, but then, I can barely remember Friday.
Still, I thought, what could it hurt to waste a call to Justify, who is apparently in Australia, getting on with his life's work.
Ring: Hellooooo ...
Me: Uh, yes hello, I'm trying to reach Justify, the 2018 Triple Crown winner?
Justify: Yeah this is he.
Me: Oh great. Hey I'm calling from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette today.
Justify: Pittsburgh? You want my reaction to Roethlisberger? Mad bummer, right? A true thoroughbred that guy; I feel terrible for him because I know myself when you're not out there running with the boys you just want to compete so bad, man. Out for the season! Terrible.
Me: True, true, but I was actually calling about a story in the New York Times.
Justify: Oh Kavanaugh. Not touching that one, bro. Nolo commentooooo ...
Me: Well no, not Kavanaugh. It was actually a story that says, in some detail, how you failed a drug test prior to the Santa Anita Derby in April of 2018, a race you won and, of course, qualified you for the Kentucky Derby, and a shot at the Triple Crown.
Justify: Of course.
Me: Of course, what?
Justify: Of course, it qualified me, that's all. Of course. Of course.
Me: A horse is a hor . . .
Justify: Stop.
Me: Sorry, well look, unfortunately, I have to ask if you took scopolamine prior to the Santa Anita Derby, because according to the Times, the California Horse Racing Board says you did and, of course, Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert says you didn't, so do you have a few minutes to talk about this?
Justify: Of course.
Me: Oh, c'mon.
Justify: I've got a couple of minutes; you caught me between sessions.
Me: Sessions?
Justify: Stud man.
Me: Steadman?
Justify: Stud. S-T-U-D.
Me: Oh, stud. Right. So there are multiple sessions in the same day?
Justify: Three a day.
Me: Whoa.
Justify: I know, right?
Me: What's that like?
Justify: It beats workin' (snort!).
Me: Did you just snort?
Justify: Just get to your questions; I've got like 20 minutes.
Me: Well, as I indicated, the main question is whether you did or did not ingest scopolamine prior to the Santa Anita Derby.
Justify: I've never taken anything man. Scopolamine? What is it? Never heard of it.
Me: Apparently, it's an environmental contaminant that grows wildly near piles of horse dung and can accidentally get into a horse's feed or stable bedding. Metabolically, it can act as a bronchodilator, clearing your airways, making the heart more efficient, in other words, a performance enhancer.
Justify: Did you say horse dung?
Me: Yes.
Justify: Oh ... the dung weed. That's scopolamine? The dung weed?! Me and the boys, oh, God.
Me: Oh, God?
And then there was a silence that seemed to last longer than the Belmont Stakes.
Me: Are you there?
Justify: Yeah I'm here. We smoked it man! We smoked the dung weed! Oh my freakin' God. This is so stupid because you know, usually horses hate the dung weed because it stinks so bad; we used to dare guys to do it, but nobody would. But that spring in California - I mean the climate's changing man - it was so warm the dung weed was almost fragrant man. One night me and a coupla other racers found some out behind the far stables. No one was around. You know these horse people are morning people. No one's around at night.
So yeah, we did it. Got wasted. So I guess they take back the Triple Crown. That's great. Just great. Anything else I can do for the freaking Pittsburgh Post-Gazette?
Me: Well, there was this other story I was wondering if you might comment on. It seems that Vice President Mike Pence ...
Justify: Oh cripes.
Me: Yeah Pence was at some Republican function in Baltimore when he told a story about how he visited the farm where American Pharoah ...
Justify: My man! What about him?
Me: Pence says Pharoah bit him.
Justify: Say that again.
Me: Vice President Mike Pence says he was bitten on the arm by 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah, and, here, I'll read you the exact quote, the bite was "so hard I nearly collapsed."
Justify: Oh my God that is the biggest load of horse ... Let me tell you something about American Pharoah OK? I never met the dude, OK? But everybody I know and everybody in the industry knows that that horse is as gentle as a Kentucky breeze. I know trainers who say they've seen complete strangers walk up to American Pharoah's stall and put their faces right against the dude's nose, nuzzling him, and all he does is purr like a kitten.
Sweet, they say. Some said that's why he'd never be a big winner. Too sweet. And boy did he show you people. And now I'm answering questions about American Pharoah biting Mike Pence. Geezus Mike freaking Pence. What's wrong with people?
Me: Well Justify I really appreciate . . .
Justify: No I'm asking you sincerely what is wrong with people? Horses don't act like this! What the hell is wrong with you people?
Me: I don't know. Look I gotta go; it was nice . . .
Justify: Oh, you gotta go. You're busy?
Me: Well, I got this Roethlisberger thing.
Justify: Yeah, don't call me again.

Texto completo: A North Carolina children's hospital that stopped performing complex heart surgeries in recent months after high death rates were disclosed may now resume the procedures, according to an advisory board that was examining the hospital's practices.
The board noted "significant investment and progress" had been made at North Carolina Children's Hospital while suggesting areas for improvement, including increasing the number of surgeries performed, a factor associated with better outcomes.
The external board made its recommendations in a six-page report released on Tuesday by UNC Health Care, which runs the hospital and is affiliated with the University of North Carolina.
The report was one of several initiatives launched by UNC Health Care in response to a New York Times investigation in May that detailed turmoil at the medical institution in 2016 and 2017, when cardiologists, department leaders and the former head of the children's hospital expressed concerns about patients faring poorly after heart surgery. Secret audio recordings provided to The Times captured physicians talking openly, some even saying they might not feel comfortable allowing their own children to have surgery there.
Some doctors had tried to get mortality data to help them decide where to refer patients, but the hospital did not have the information to share at the time, even internally. In June, after a yearlong legal battle with The Times, UNC provided data that showed its death rate was especially high among children with the most complex heart conditions -- nearly 50 percent.
Dr. Wesley Burks, chief executive of UNC Health Care, said in a statement on Tuesday that the health system had made significant efforts over the years to improve its pediatric heart program, and that it would "make further enhancements because we recognize the importance of caring for very sick children with incredibly complex medical problems."
The health system did not say when the surgeries would resume.
Last month, state and federal regulators determined the children's hospital was in compliance with federal rules, but "significantly different than it was during 2016-17," according to a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A recent survey by the Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, also found no current issues with the pediatric heart surgery program.
UNC administrators have denied there were problems affecting patient care during those years, saying only that difficult team dynamics had been resolved by staffing and leadership changes. The chief surgeon from that time has been on leave since earlier this year for "family medical reasons," according to UNC.
The advisory board did not seem to address conditions at the hospital when doctors voiced concerns several years ago, but noted that "team dynamics and interactions appear to be strong." Recommendations it made to the hospital's board of directors included continuing to publicly report mortality data; hiring a second full-time pediatric heart surgeon; and considering a joint venture with another hospital to increase the volume of surgeries.
Concerns about the quality of pediatric heart surgery programs have been disclosed at hospitals across the country, especially at institutions with a smaller number of surgeries. Several programs have been suspended or shut down; other hospitals have merged their programs with larger ones to achieve more consistent results.
The advisory board was composed of three doctors from outside institutions: Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio; the University of Michigan School of Medicine; and Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
Two doctors leading UNC's pediatric heart program previously worked at two of those institutions: Dr. Timothy Hoffman, chief of pediatric cardiology, came to UNC from Nationwide Children's Hospital. Dr. Mahesh Sharma, chief pediatric cardiac surgeon, joined UNC from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

As Kavanaugh allegations agitate Washington, high court remains silent

Texto completo: Sometimes, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said recently, people ask how she has dealt with the arrival of her newest colleague, Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the allegations of sexual misconduct that accompanied his confirmation.
Her answer is not one to which other liberals have subscribed.
"We are all human beings, we all have pasts," Sotomayor told a judicial conference in Santa Fe last week, according to a Wall Street Journal report. "Now, whether things occurred or didn't occur, all of that is irrelevant. It is yesterday, today is today, and moving forward, I have to work with him."
Revivals of allegations against Kavanaugh roil the White House, Capitol Hill and the Democratic presidential nomination trail.
But at the Supreme Court, once you're in, you're in. It is a no-roil zone.
Kavanaugh, 54, has done his best to keep it that way since his arrival nearly a year ago . He's been an equal-opportunity collaborator, in the majority more than any other justice in cases the court decided in his first term. He agreed with some of the court's liberal members almost as much as he agreed with some of the court's conservatives, including Neil M. Gorsuch, the other justice chosen by President Trump.
Such evenness has brought grumbles from some conservatives about what they consider Kavanaugh's go-slow approach. He has balanced that by voting in favor of every important Trump administration initiative that has reached the court during his tenure.
Trump responded to allegations against Kavanaugh in a new book by two New York Times reporters with a ferocious defense on Twitter. "DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued!"
At the Supreme Court, where nine people are bound together by life tenure and equally weighted votes: silence.
There is no doubt that justices - most especially Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. - do not relish another controversy bound to intensify the political battle over what they strive to portray as a nonpartisan court.
But there are institutional and strategic reasons to live and let live. The court's decisions will not be respected unless the court is, the justices say. And when five votes determine which view of the law prevails, today's adversary can be tomorrow's ally.
Just a month after the bitter partisan battle over Kavanaugh resulted in a 50-to-48 Senate confirmation vote last fall, Justice Elena Kagan spoke to a group of law students at the University of Toronto.
Maybe she shouldn't ask, a young woman in the audience said, but how can the court claim legitimacy on issues such as violence against women when two of its members have been accused of sexual misconduct? She was referring to Kavanaugh and Justice Clarence Thomas, whose 1991 confirmation exploded with Anita Hill's charges of sexual harassment.
You're right, Kagan, one of three liberal women on the court, told the student: "You should not have asked me that question."
She added: "I'm a part of this institution. I care about it a lot, I care about my colleagues a lot, and that's something I'm not going to be talking about."
Thomas recounted in his memoir that, as soon as he was confirmed, Justice Byron White came to welcome him.
"It doesn't matter how you got here. All that matters now is what you do here," Thomas recalled White saying.
When Roberts last fall wanted to directly confront the idea of the Supreme Court as a political body, he chose to paraphrase "our newest colleague" to say that "we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest, we serve one nation."
It's not surprising that the court closes ranks. The justices are linked for life, working closely together, getting to know one another's families. Thomas has been at the high court nearly 30 years , Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer more than 25. The justices can write brutally about each other's legal opinions, but they swear the personal affection is real.
Kavanaugh was hardly a stranger when he was elevated to the high court. He was a former clerk to White and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whom he replaced. He served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where Roberts, Thomas and Ginsburg had served.
He is a longtime insider in the Republican legal establishment, yet his clerks went on to work for almost every Supreme Court justice.
The bonhomie on the court is reinforced by tradition. For instance, a new justice is welcomed with a dinner organized by the previously junior member. Thus the stoic Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. honored Sotomayor's heritage with a Spanish guitar player. As he promotes his new book, Gorsuch has been telling reporters how he recruited some of the "racing presidents" who perform at Washington Nationals games for baseball-lover Kavanaugh's dinner.
At speaking events this summer, Ginsburg praised Kavanaugh for hiring only female clerks for his initial term, which for the first time meant that more women than men filled the prestigious jobs. She noted that she had assigned him an important majority opinion in a case where he crossed over to join the liberals.
At the Santa Fe event, Sotomayor discussed the strategic advantage of keeping your ideological adversaries close.
"There is common ground in selected areas," Sotomayor said. "And it's important not to forget that because those agreements are important in building bridges that help you in the future, perhaps, in slowing things down."
In their first year together, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh diverged on issues more than any pair of justices nominated by the same president since President George H.W. Bush's pair of Thomas and former justice David Souter. Gorsuch has tended to side with Thomas on the right, Kavanaugh closer to Roberts at the court's center.
For lawyers on the left, that means their best hope - even if slim - is those two. Trump wrote on Twitter that the continuing investigations into Kavanaugh are intended to "scare him into turning Liberal!"
Kavanaugh has kept a low profile on the court. He's not a recluse - he's coached his daughters' basketball teams, just as he did in the past. On Friday, he was at a ceremony for Judge Naomi Rao, who took his spot on the D.C. Circuit.
But he has turned down almost all speaking engagements. There was a noncontroversial talk at a judicial conference in the spring, and his law school teaching gig this summer took place about 4,000 miles from Washington, in England.
As of now, his speaking debut could be in November, when he has pledged to address the national lawyers meeting of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group that has been instrumental in Trump's successful nominations to the federal judiciary.
His friends are braced for other events beyond his control. At least two other journalists have been working on books about Kavanaugh.

The awful, lingering price of denials

Texto completo: During Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings last year, I remember thinking there was a better path for him than the shouting, conspiracy-peddling one he chose. I remember thinking he should have frankly addressed how much he'd drunk as a youth - to the point of stupor, several of his friends told reporters - and used that context when responding to accusations of sexual misconduct.
Something like: "I have no memory of these events. But I drank a lot in high school and college. I sometimes drank until I puked; I sometimes drank until I blacked out or wasn't sure of my actions. If I did what I've been accused of, I am horrified. I welcome a full investigation. I am ashamed, and I am so, so sorry."
He didn't do that, of course, but I wished he had. I longed for the dialogue a statement like that could have forced us to have.
This week, we're all catapulted back to last year, thanks to a new book with new revelations. Now, it's hard not to ask whether Kavanaugh was lying during his hearings - if not to the Senate, then to himself.
In "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," authors Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, both of the New York Times, dig into allegations by Deborah Ramirez that Kavanaugh, her classmate at Yale, thrust his exposed penis at her during a party. Kavanaugh emphatically told the Judiciary Committee that the event had never happened, saying that if it had, it would have been "the talk of campus." One year later, Pogrebin and Kelly write: "Our reporting suggests that it was."
They found seven corroborators to Ramirez's story, all of whom had heard about the alleged penis-waggling long before Kavanaugh was nominated, two of them within days of the party at which it allegedly happened.
It's important to remember that Kavanaugh's defense all along was never, "I was young and dumb and drunk." His defense was "It never happened. Everyone else is lying."
His defense was about black and white, but we all could have had a lot to discuss in the gray of it; we could have waded into some truly thorny conversations. His defense, as it turned out, worked well for him. But it kneecapped the rest of us.
I would have liked for Kavanaugh to inspire a national conversation about young people and alcohol, about young people and toxic pack mentality, about young people and the alcohol-infused toxic pack mentality that might cause a blackout-drunk Yale undergrad to, say, thrust his genitals into the face of a mortified classmate as friends around him laughed.
I would have liked for him to encourage a conversation about the ways a few men behaved back in high school and college, and how they account for that now. We could have talked about what it means, as a 50-something, to realize you might have done some terrible things when you were young, things you would now never do and can barely recognize.
We could have talked about how a person wrestles with that: how you find a way to atone for sins that you have no memory of committing but which are very likely to be true because they were corroborated by at least seven people .
Those conversations could have been about pain and growth and reconciliation, but we didn't have them.
Instead, we had Kavanaugh improbably claiming "Beach Week Ralph Club" did not refer to a group of young men binge-drinking at the shore but rather to his sensitive stomach and delicate constitution. Instead, we heard him insist "Devil's Triangle" referred not to a fantasized sexual exploit - the definition commonly accepted by everyone else - but instead to a three-cup game similar to Quarters - a definition used by nobody but Brett Kavanaugh.
Instead of allowing for the possibility that he was a complicated person, one who had grown and matured with age, he insisted on the unlikely narrative that he was perfect and always had been.
Instead of grappling with credible accusations, and his ensuing doubt and self-reckoning, he used his platform on national television to shout, and bluster and blame the Clintons.
They're all liars , was his message. I'm the real victim here .
He slammed the door on thoughtfulness. He repelled nuance. He placed his own nicked pride above everything else, including truth. Including justice.
What a missed opportunity. What a waste. What a lingering wound, for the entire country.
A year has passed, and there are still so many important conversations we didn't have.

Texto completo: The Santa Fe Institute is trying to figure out what to do about a $25,000 donation billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein gave the 35-year-old research center after his release from jail in Florida, where he took a plea deal more than a decade ago on charges of soliciting a minor.
Leaders of the organization plan to donate the $25,000 "to an appropriate charity that would help victims of sexual violence, abuse or trafficking," institute spokeswoman Jenna Marshall told The New Mexican on Monday. But they have to examine legal issues surrounding contributions from one nonprofit 501(c)(3) group to another.
The institute's board of trustees plans to discuss the matter in November, Marshall said.
That contribution -- made in 2010 and earmarked for research by Murray Gell-Mann, a friend of Epstein's and one of the institute's founders -- is only a fraction of the total amount of donations the think tank received from Epstein, 66, who died by suicide in a New York City jail cell last month as he awaited trial on charges of trafficking dozens of girls for sex.
"A review of our funding reveals the Santa Fe Institute received $250,000 in donations from sources related to Jeffrey Epstein prior to 2007," Marshall told the online news organization BuzzFeed in August.
The distinction "prior to 2007" is significant because that was before Epstein -- in a plea bargain that's been called shockingly lenient -- admitted guilt in a Florida state court to two counts of procuring a girl under 18 for prostitution. He spent 13 months in jail.
He could have faced life in prison on federal child sex-trafficking charges. But federal prosecutors, in a secret deal in 2008, agreed not to pursue the case if Epstein pleaded guilty to the lesser state charges.
Accusers in the federal case, who sued the U.S. Justice Department over the controversial plea negotiations, suffered a setback Monday in their case when a federal judge in Florida ruled they were not entitled to compensation from the Justice Department, even though prosecutors violated their rights by not notifying them about the deal.
Marshall told BuzzFeed the 2010 contribution to the Santa Fe Institute "prompted our leadership to decide not to accept any additional funds from Mr. Epstein or related sources." She said the fact that the money was designated for Gell-Mann's research violated the think tank's policy that "no donor will ever have any say over the substance or direction of SFI research."
On Monday, Marshall said, "It was wrong for SFI to accept those funds at the time, and I've been told that the 2010 donation prompted the leadership [which was different in 2010] to meet and decide to accept no further funds from Epstein."
Gell-Mann, who died in May, mentioned Epstein in the preface of his 1994 book The Quark and the Jaguar, Adventures in the Simple and the Complex. "Support of my work through donations to SFI by Jeffrey Epstein and by [others] is also gratefully acknowledged," Gell-Mann wrote.
Epstein, who owned large residences in Florida, New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands, also owned the massive Zorro Ranch near Stanley in southern Santa Fe County.
In July, the New York Times reported Epstein had told scientists and others he wanted to use his New Mexico property as a "baby ranch," where he would impregnate women and spread his DNA. It's not known whether Epstein actually impregnated any women or girls at the ranch.
The Santa Fe Institute isn't the only research institution that benefited from Epstein's money following his criminal conviction. On Monday, the online publication Axios published a story showing how Joscha Bach, a cognitive scientist at Harvard, was funded indirectly by Epstein in 2014 through $100,000 routed through the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before his conviction, Epstein donated about $8.9 million to Harvard between 1998 and 2007.
Martin Nowak, a mathematical biologist at Harvard, also was connected with Epstein. In 2014, the web page for Nowak's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, which is now deleted, said Epstein "is actively involved" in the program "and regularly participates in lectures and academic events."
Earlier this month, Joichi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab -- who solicited money for Bach -- resigned after admitting he took $525,000 from Epstein for the lab, as well as more than $1 million for his own investment funds.
Seth Lloyd, an MIT professor as well as an an adjunct faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute for more than 30 years, took grants from Epstein as recently as 2017. In August, he published an apology to Epstein's victims.
"These were professional as well as moral failings," Lloyd wrote. "... By continuing to participate in discussions he had with me and other scientists and by accepting his donations, I helped Mr. Epstein protect his reputation, and I disempowered his victims. I should have focused on them instead of him."
Lloyd said he's "committed financial resources to aid you and other survivors of sexual abuse and trafficking and will work assiduously to help make your voices heard."

Elizabeth Warren wins an endorsement and hands Trump another opportunity

Texto completo: President Trump should be happy. After all, Elizabeth Warren took another step towards usurping Bernie Sanders' socialist throne on Monday when the Working Families Party endorsed her campaign for president. Speaking to the New York Times, the party's National Director Maurice Mitchell explained why 60% of eligible party voters had chosen Warren on the first ballot. "Senator Warren," he said, "knows how to kick Wall Street kleptocrats where it hurts, and she’s got some truly visionary plans to make this country work for the many ..."
Those words should ring happy in Trump's ears.
With Warren in second place to Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary contest, the senator from Massachusetts has a real shot at becoming her party's nominee. And if that happens, Trump will just have gained another line of attack against his general election opponent: namely, that she's the far-left's chosen candidate.
Warren, of course, will say otherwise. Warren and her Working Families Party supporters will say that she is the candidate willing to take on big business and fight for a fairer life for everyone else. But as long as the economy remains strong, Trump will have an alternate narrative to offer.
He'll be able to point to the economy as a marker for Trump-Pence 2020 being the safest bet. He'll then be able to say something like: "You may not like some of my tweets, but why take the risk on wacky Warren? Why take the risk, that is, to see the economy rot under someone who believes government should control the economy? Why take the risk on someone who wants to tax you trillions of dollars more in order to substitute your personal health insurance for government triage-based care? Why take the risk on someone who openly wants to destroy our most successful companies? Why take the risk on someone who believes government bureaucrats can regulate your small business better than you can run it? Why take the risk on a candidate who lies about Afghanistan and seeks a return to Jimmy Carter's foreign policy?"
Why indeed.
Then again, Democrats still have an ace card — namely, the guy currently leading their primary contest.
Refusing to sign up to "Medicare for all" and other tax exploding plans that Warren supports, Biden can insulate himself against these kind of attacks even as he takes a more left-wing stance than President Barack Obama did in 2008 and 2012. Instead, Biden is giving himself a little space to tell independents in the general election, "Look, I didn't get Warren's endorsements because those endorsers know that I'm a moderate. I'm running for all Americans, not just the far-left."
Not Warren. She's increasingly stuck to socialism, and the far-left loves her for it.

New York Times reporter: 'Too much is being made' of botched Kavanaugh story

Texto completo: The New York Times reporters behind the botched story alleging Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh committed sexual misconduct said "too much is being made" of the details that were left out.
Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly adapted a story from their upcoming book for the Times, alleging that one of Kavanaugh's classmates at Yale University said that he made inappropriate sexual contact with a female student. However, the article failed to mention that the female student who was the alleged victim has no recollection of the supposed event and declined to be interviewed.
Pogrebin appeared on WMAL's Mornings on the Mall to discuss the omitted details and the ensuing backlash on Tuesday.

WMAL Interview - Robin Pogrebin
"We found that this was kind of just an inadvertent error in the sense that often in the New York Times, you kind of debate the use of a victim's name, and in this case, I think our editors were kind of debating the appropriateness of that. In kind of omitting her name, the whole sentence kind of came out, which sort of referred to whether or not she remembered the incident," Pogrebin stated.
"It had originally been in there," she continued. "But, I actually frankly think too much is being made of it given that this was somewhat of a hasty editing process as this was going to press. Even though we do name her in the book, I think there was a feeling that it might not necessarily be important to name her in the story where you're then directing attention to the victim."
The two reporters were on The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell Monday night and they blamed their editors for removing the section about the victim not remembering the alleged misconduct.

Texto completo: Silicon Valley quietly got involved in the bitter fight over Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
A new book revealed a handful of executives from big tech companies aided Christine Blasey Ford before and after she went public with allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the early 1980s.
Among those who assisted Ford in the summer of 2018 were Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, game company Zynga founder Mark Pincus, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, according to The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, written by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly and on shelves Tuesday.
Sandberg, through her sister, Michelle, advised Ford to retain a lawyer after Ford relayed her alleged encounter with Kavanaugh to Rep. Anna Eshoo and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, both California Democrats, in late July 2018, the book revealed. The Facebook executive also compiled a list of attorneys who Sandberg heard specialized in cases like Ford’s, which was given to a friend of Ford’s through Sandberg’s sister.
Ford ended up hiring Debra Katz and Lisa Banks of the firm Katz, Marshall & Banks, which handles whistleblower and employment matters and was recommended by Feinstein’s office.
Pincus and Hoffman, meanwhile, lent Ford and her friends their private plane and hired a flight attendant when they traveled to Washington, D.C., for the high-stakes Sept. 27 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which Ford and Kavanaugh both testified.
The private jet “had been secured through colleagues of [Ford’s] as a way to simplify the travel and avoid public attention," according to the book.
In the lead-up to the explosive Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Pogrebin and Kelly wrote, Ford’s supporters “canvassed a small group of wealthy local residents to see if they would be willing to provide transportation,” and Pincus and Hoffman offered up their jet.
The two are major Democratic backers and donated to Hillary Clinton's and Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns.
According to the book, Hoffman and Pincus decided to cover the flight because they wanted to help Ford and believed she should “have a chance to air her information.”
“They also knew well how radioactive the situation had become, given that their own pilots had been anxious to interact with Ford and her friends for fear of being identified and harassed by Ford’s detractors later,” Kelly and Pogrebin wrote. “To assuage the pilot’s concerns, the billionaires hired a flight attendant to work the trip.”
Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her during a small gathering at a house in suburban Maryland in 1982, revelations that roiled Kavanaugh’s already contentious confirmation battle.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied Ford's claims. The FBI conducted a supplemental investigation after Ford and two other women accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, though it yielded no corroborating evidence. He was confirmed to the Supreme Court by a slim 50-48 vote in October.

Charles M. Blow: Joe Biden is still problematic on racial issues

Texto completo: All five of these things are simultaneously true:
* Joe Biden is the Democratic front-runner and may well be the nominee.
* He is by far the favorite candidate among black voters.
* He was a loyal vice president to Barack Obama, and the two men seem to have shared a deep and true friendship.
* He, like the other Democratic candidates, would be a vast improvement over Donald Trump.
* And, Biden’s positioning on racial issues has been problematic.
This issue exposed itself again Thursday during the presidential debate in Houston. Moderator Linsey Davis put a question to Biden:
“Mr. Vice President, I want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race. In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, ‘I don’t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I’ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.’
"You said that some 40 years ago. But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?”
Biden could have taken responsibility for his comments and addressed the question directly, but he didn’t. Instead, he gave a rambling, nonsensical answer that included a reference to a record player. But, the response ended in yet another racial offense in which he seemed to suggest that black people lack the natural capacity to be good parents:
We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not that they don’t want to help. They don’t — they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the — the — make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school — a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.
His language belies a particular mindset, one of a liberal of a particular vintage. On the issue of race, it is paternalistic and it pities, it sees deficiency in much the same way that the conservative does, but it responds as savior rather than with savagery. Better the former than the latter, surely, but the sensibility underlying the two positions is shockingly similar. It underscores that liberalism does not perfectly align with racial egalitarianism, regardless of rhetoric to the contrary.
On Sunday, Biden made a speech on race in Birmingham, Alabama, commemorating the 1963 bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church, in which he said on the issue of how racism and racial hatred affect black people:
“We know we’re not there yet. No one knows it better. My mom used to have an expression, ‘You want to understand me, walk in my shoes a mile.’ Those of us who are white try, but we can never fully, fully understand. No matter how hard we try. We’re almost, we’re almost at this next phase of progress in my view.”
Progress. That is the wall behind which white America hides, including white liberals. (Even many black leaders have absorbed and regurgitate the progress narrative.) It expects black people to swell and applaud at their effort. But, how is that a fair and legitimate expectation? Slavery, white supremacy and racism, are horrid, man-made constructs that should never have existed in the first place. Am I supposed to cheer the slow, creeping, centuries-long undoing of a thing that should never have been done?
Malcolm X was once asked if he felt that we were making progress in the country. He responded: “No. I will never say that progress is being made. If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there’s no progress. If you pull it all the way out, that’s not progress. The progress is healing the wound that the blow made.”
I don’t even think that’s progress. That just returns the situation to a common baseline before the crime was committed.
Furthermore, it’s not what Biden says in prepared remarks that’s problematic, it’s what he says off the cuff and under pressure that to me reveal an antiquated view on racial matters and racial sensitivities.
It was the way he advocated for the 1994 crime bill, a bill that contributed to America’s surging mass incarceration, which disproportionately affected black and brown people in this country.
The bill did some good, but the harm it did cannot be overlooked or understated. Rather than fully owning up to the disastrous aspects of the bill, Biden has over the years bragged about it and defended it.
It was in the way he described then-candidate Barack Obama in 2007 as an African American who was “articulate and bright and clean.” Clean? As opposed to what?
This critique of Biden isn’t personal. I bear no ill will for the man. But, a fact is a fact, and no amount of growth, change or well-intentioned good-heartedness has the ability to erase it.

Texto completo: The latest New York Times report detailing allegations that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to women without their consent during drunken Yale dorm parties may have prompted several leading Democratic presidential contenders to call for his impeachment, but it fundamentally doesn't change the story of his disgraceful confirmation to the court. Yes, it reports allegations that such incidents happened not once but twice, but there was already plenty of reason to believe he was less than truthful when he painted himself as a serious, studious youth in his confirmation hearings. There was good reason to believe he lied about the extent of his past drinking, about when and how he learned of sexual misconduct allegations against him and about his involvement in various matters during his time as an attorney in the George W. Bush White House. All of that was in plain public view when the Senate voted 50-48 to confirm him.
If the new report doesn't tell us much we didn't already know about Mr. Kavanaugh's fitness to serve on the high court, it does underscore just how very unfit the man to whom he most owes his post is for his office. We're not talking about President Donald Trump, who is now offering vague suggestions that the Department of Justice should "come to his rescue," whatever that means. He may have nominated Judge Kavanaugh, but the person who really got him on the court is the one who rigged the process: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Mr. McConnell responded to the latest Kavanaugh news by tweeting that the "far left's willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year's confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate." The confirmation process was, in fact, a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate, but not for the reasons he thinks. It was embarrassing because of his determination to afford no more investigation of Mr. Kavanaugh's past than was necessary to give wavering Republicans cover to vote yes, and certainly not enough to actually determine the facts.
Even before Christine Blasey Ford came forward with her claim that Mr. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her during a high school party in Montgomery County decades before, Mr. McConnell oversaw a process in which Mr. Kavanaugh got away without answering perfectly reasonable questions about his views on abortion, the separation of church and state, the limits of an investigation into a president's conduct and the limits of executive power. And once Ms. Ford's allegations became public, he and his fellow Republicans showed no interest in the truth, just political expediency.
Yes, they held a widely viewed televised hearing in which they (or, awkwardly, a prosecutor from Arizona Mr. McConnell once referred to as a "female assistant") questioned Ms. Ford and later Mr. Kavanaugh. But that was an exercise in senatorial speechmaking, not a true inquiry. And when a very credible Ms. Ford fueled the public outcry over a rush to judgment, the Senate made no effort to probe further but instead relied on the extremely curtailed additional FBI investigation that the Trump administration authorized.
That investigation was so limited in scope that agents interviewed neither Ms. Ford nor Mr. Kavanaugh. They did talk to a woman who accused Mr. Kavanaugh of drunken misconduct at a party but they did not follow up on the dozens of potential corroborating witnesses she and her attorneys provided. And as the New York Times new reporting reveals, they did not investigate at all a tip made to the FBI at the time by another Yale classmate that Mr. Kavanaugh had engaged in strikingly similar behavior at a different party. We don't know whether either allegation would stand up to full and fair scrutiny, and because of Mr. McConnell's eagerness to throw away the Senate's duty to provide advice and consent if it would get him another conservative on the high court, we never will.
We see little chance that two-thirds of the Senate would ever vote to remove Judge Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court, and while the House Judiciary Committee has opened an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, we're a long way from a two-thirds Senate vote to convict him of anything. But there is one person who can and must be removed from power over the handling of the Kavanaugh confirmation: Mitch McConnell. Whether that's by virtue of a Democratic takeover of the Senate or an upset in his reelection bid in Kentucky, it is a must if there is any hope of ever restoring the judiciary as an untainted, nonpolitical branch of government.

Texto completo: White House Roundup
NEW YORK - President Donald Trump on Monday said Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is under assault, following a New York Times story about a sexual misconduct allegation that was revised to reflect that the alleged victim couldn't recall the incident.
The newspaper has also apologized for an offensive tweet that was sent out to promote the weekend article.
The Times reported on an allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a Yale University party as a freshman. That new allegation was included in an article, excerpting an upcoming book about Kavanaugh, about classmate Deborah Ramirez, who had claimed the future justice pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her another time at a different party.
In writing about the new allegation, the story did not initially include the detail that the woman supposedly involved in the incident declined to be interviewed, and that her friends say she doesn't recall it. The article was revised to include that information, with an editor's note.
Kavanaugh denied Ramirez's accusation in the past.
The newspaper also apologized for a tweet sent out Saturday through the account of its opinion section, where the Kavanaugh piece ran. The tweet said, in part, that "having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun."
Warren rolls out sweeping
anti-corruption proposal
NEW YORK - Elizabeth Warren has released a proposal aimed at government corruption, providing a detailed policy roadmap for a fight she says is at the core of her presidential campaign.
Warren's plan would ban lobbyists from many fundraising activities and serving as political campaign bundlers, tighten limits on politicians accepting gifts or payment for government actions and bar senior officials and members of Congress from serving on for-profit boards.
It also would prohibit federal judges from avoiding misconduct investigations by leaving their posts, prevent courts from sealing settlements in public health and safety cases, and ban class action waivers for all cases involving employment, consumer protection, antitrust and civil rights.
NYC prosecutors subpoena
Rrump's tax returns
NEW YORK - New York City prosecutors have subpoenaed President Donald Trump's tax returns.
A person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press on Monday that the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. sent a subpoena to the accounting firm Mazars USA seeking eight years of Trump's personal and business returns.
The person was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity.
Vance is a Democrat. He previously subpoenaed the Trump Organization for records related to hush money paid to the porn actress Stormy Daniels.

Texto completo: Harris fundraises in Greenwich
Sen. Kamala Harris made her first fundraising trip to Connecticut Sunday.
The Democratic presidential candidate attended an afternoon reception hosted by Dita Bhargava of Greenwich. Bhargava, a longtime Harris supporter, ran for state treasurer in 2018.
Bhargava said the fundraiser was expected to bring in more than $110,000 for Harris.
In a Facebook post, state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest said she was "beyond fortunate" to have the chance to talk with Harris at the Greenwich fundraiser.
"She's better in person and I already thought she was pretty fantastic," Gilchrest said.
In addition to contributions, the California senator also picked up several endorsements from prominent Connecticut Democrats, including New Haven Mayor Toni Harp and state Reps. Quinton Phipps of Middletown, Anne Hughes of Easton and Bobby Gibson of Bloomfield. Harris has already been endorsed by U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes.
Bhargava said Harris' supporters view her as the Democrat best equipped to defeat President Donald Trump.
"She's progressive but she's also pragmatic," Bhargava said.
Harris is a former prosecutor "and she has the experience to prosecute the case against Donald Trump," Bhargava added.

Blumenthal: Investigate Kavanaugh
Sen. Richard Blumenthal is calling for an investigation into new sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
"These allegations reinforce the concerns that led me to very aggressively oppose Brett Kavanaugh's nomination," the Democratic senator said Monday. "These allegations ... and others were never fully investigated by the FBI. There should have been an investigation then and there should be one now."
On Saturday, the New York Times published an essay adapted from a book that contains new details relating to Kavanaugh's days at Yale. The book's authors, New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, found another account that corroborates allegations made by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's who said the justice thrust his penis at her during a party.
Blumenthal, who voted no on Kavanaugh's confirmation last year, said there should be an investigation into the allegations contained in the book.
"Lying to Congress should be disqualifying for a Supreme Court justice," he said.

No September special session
Although Democrats were told to set aside two days in late September, there will be no special sessions this month.
House Democrats were told that any session days have been postponed, which was confirmed by spokesman Todd Murphy.
"There will be no session scheduled for this month," Murphy said Friday. "At this point, there is no decision on a date in October."
The main reason for a possible special session had been to approve a detailed settlement between the state and the Connecticut Hospital Association to resolve a long-running lawsuit that started under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. Lawmakers have already agreed to set aside more than $160 million from the last fiscal year's operating surplus in order to settle the lawsuit, but the nuts and bolts of the deal are still being worked out.
When Gov. Ned Lamont came into office nine months ago, his administration pledged to seek to end the contentious, public clash with the hospitals and settle the lawsuit - and the two sides have reached a tentative agreement.
But the legislation is not ready, lawmakers said. Senate Republican leader Len Fasano of North Haven said he has not seen the final language on the complicated hospital settlement.
"I haven't been told the hospital tax is ready to go," Fasano said. "I haven't been told anything about the hospital tax whatsoever. I know that they're still hammering out a deal. I know that the deal hasn't been formalized and that it has to go through all the hospital CEOs, which is going to take some time. I know they're working hard, and it's a tough issue."

Thais Seized 147 Tigers From Temple. 86 Are Dead.

Texto completo: BANGKOK -- Eighty-six tigers that were seized three years ago from Thailand's notorious Tiger Temple over concerns that they were being mistreated have died in the government's care, Thai officials said Monday.
That leaves only 61 surviving tigers from the 147 that were taken from the sprawling Buddhist temple compound, an unlicensed zoo that promoted close contact between tourists and tigers, including feeding the animals by hand and taking photos with them.
Officials from Thailand's Department of National Parks said that the main cause of the deaths was laryngeal paralysis, an upper respiratory condition that interferes with breathing. Canine distemper was a secondary cause of death, and the stress of the tigers' relocation was also a factor, they said.
Edwin Wiek, founder of the Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, said the death of so many tigers could have been averted. He said he had advised the department at the time to take preventive steps, such as placing cages farther apart so that diseases could not spread easily among the tigers.
"It is a very sad story," he said. "I warned them about it at that time. It was avoidable, but they wouldn't listen."
For years, animal rights groups criticized the Tiger Temple for allowing tourists to handle the animals, a business that brought in $ 5.7 million a year for the temple.
Critics also contended that the temple was a front for smuggling tiger parts for the illegal but lucrative trade in so-called traditional medicine in China and Vietnam.
This concern was borne out during the 2016 raids, when the authorities arrested three monks attempting to smuggle more than 1,600 tiger parts out of the compound, located in Kanchanaburi Province, about 100 miles west of Bangkok. The authorities also found 60 dead tiger cubs in jars and a freezer.
No one at the temple was ever prosecuted for illegally possessing tiger parts or operating the compound as an unlicensed zoo, activists said.
The tigers' removal turned into a highly public spectacle as monks and their supporters blocked the main gate at one point to prevent park rangers from entering the compound to seize the tigers.
The operation to remove the tigers lasted several days and involved 30 veterinarians, 60 park rangers and hundreds of other personnel. Each tiger was sedated and carried out by stretcher before being driven by truck to one of two government facilities.
The parks department built new cages to house the tigers, but they were not as large as those at the temple and were placed close together, facilitating the spread of disease.
And unlike the temple compound, the government facilities did not initially provide enrichment activities for the tigers, or large enclosures where the tigers could have a chance to move around freely, adding to their stress.
For months, the Department of National Parks had dodged questions about the welfare of the tigers and reports that many of them had died.
In a November interview with The New York Times, the director of Thailand's Wildlife Conservation Office, Kanjana Nitaya, acknowledged that some tigers had died, but declined to say how many.
"We are taking the best care of the tigers we can provide," she insisted. "They are the tigers under the spotlight, so we take good care of them."
On Monday, the parks department's deputy director-general, Prakit Vongsrivattanakul, put the death toll at 86 but suggested that the government was not responsible.
Many of the tigers were inbred, he said at a news conference. He also asserted that some were already suffering from canine distemper -- a disease that is typically found in domesticated dogs but that can spread to tigers -- when they arrived at the two facilities.
"The tigers were infected before they arrived because the two facilities are far away from each other, and tigers in both facilities died in a similar time frame and with similar symptoms," he said.
Tanya Erzinclioglu, an animal welfare activist and British national who helped care for the tigers for six years at the temple, said she was devastated when she witnessed the arrest of the three monks, who possessed tiger pelts, tiger teeth and 67 tiger-skin lockets containing photos of the temple's abbot.
After leaving the temple, she founded the nonprofit group For Tigers. The organization has raised money to buy nutritional supplements for the tigers and build larger enclosures for them.
At the time of the raids, she advocated leaving the tigers at the temple and having the parks department take over their care and management, a plan the government rejected.
She said that the tigers were in good health when they left the temple, but that many had trouble adjusting to the new conditions, including a change in diet that caused some of the cats to stop eating altogether.
She said that she offered the parks department the complete health records for all the tigers, but that officials declined to accept them.
"The deaths could have been prevented if the raid and subsequent removal of the tigers had been managed in a better way," she said. "The tigers were the ones who got in the middle. It was handled poorly, and the tigers suffered for it."

Inaction on Kavanaugh claims reignites rancor

Texto completo: Sen. Coons criticizes 'constrained' FBI probe of misconduct allegation
Four days before Brett M. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court by the narrowest of margins, Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) sent a letter to the FBI, urging "appropriate follow up" on new information he believed was relevant to sexual misconduct allegations made against the nominee.
Then, apparently, not much happened.
Not at the FBI, which assured Coons it had received the letter but did not interview the person whom the senator referred to the bureau. Not in the office of then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), which was copied on the letter that contained few in the way of specifics. And not among Democrats, several of whom had been unaware of the information until a New York Times report this weekend detailed a new alleged incident involving Kavanaugh.
That inaction - made public in recent days through new reports about Kavanaugh's alleged misbehavior - has renewed a bitter debate about how his confirmation was handled, angering Democrats about a process they felt was rushed and animating Republicans who decried what they viewed as attempts to assassinate Kavanaugh's character.
The revelations about the process also revived one of the most rancorous episodes in recent political history and thrust it into the center of the 2020 presidential race, as several Democratic candidates called on the Supreme Court's newest justice to be impeached by the House.
In an interview Monday, Coons said he was "disappointed and upset" that the scope of the FBI background check - greenlighted by the White House just over a week before Kavanaugh was confirmed at the insistence of Republican senators - was, in his view, "so constrained."
"Of many things that are still not known about the whole matter, one of the things that deserves to be better understood is, at whose direction [did] the FBI narrow that investigation?" Coons said. "I don't think the FBI makes decisions like that on their own about the scope of an investigation. So I think the important question is, at whose direction and what does this say about future nominations?"
One person with knowledge of the process said this week that the White House decided what to investigate based on conversations with senators and what they wanted to know. Republican senators - all of whom supported Kavanaugh except for Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) - were largely satisfied with the probe.
The new allegation against Kavanaugh was made public Saturday night in a book excerpt published by the Times from two of its reporters. The report said Max Stier, a Yale University classmate of Kavanaugh who now leads a prominent nonpartisan group in Washington, said he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a party, where friends pushed Kavanaugh's penis into a young woman's hand.
According to the book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation," the woman involved in the alleged incident has told friends she does not recall it - context that was not included in the first version of the excerpt published on the Times website.
A plea for help, and a letter Coons, an acquaintance of Stier's who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an interview with The Washington Post Monday that Stier had quietly contacted him in late September of last year with information he wanted to relay about Kavanaugh to federal investigators.
He was "very concerned about confidentiality," Coons recalled. In his initial conversation, Stier seemed optimistic he would ultimately be able to relay his information to the FBI by "reaching out through other means," Coons said.
But on the night of Oct. 1, 2018, Coons and Stier spoke again, with Stier stressing that the week-long FBI investigation was almost over and imploring Coons to help.
"I said, 'I'm happy to try one more time,' " Coons said.
Coons then wrote to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray on Oct. 2, 2018, requesting an "appropriate follow up" with Stier. Although the name was redacted in the one-page letter obtained by The Post, a spokesman for Coons confirmed Monday that the individual was Stier.
Stier was one of several people who went to Yale at the same time as Kavanaugh who reached out to the FBI last year seeking to provide information, but were not interviewed, according to people familiar with the matter.
In his letter, Coons said "several individuals" had contacted his office saying they wanted to share information with federal authorities but had "difficulty reaching anyone who will collect their information."
"I cannot speak to the relevance or veracity of the information that many of these individuals seek to provide, and I have encouraged them to use the FBI tip portal or contact a regional FBI field office," Coons wrote to Wray. But Stier, Coons added, "was one individual whom I would like to specifically refer to you for appropriate follow up."
The two top senators on the Judiciary Committee at the time - Grassley and ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) - were copied on Coons's letter to the FBI. But neither had information beyond what Coons wrote, according to two Senate aides. The letter does not describe the information Stier said he had in detail.
Stier also did not contact committee leadership, according to officials involved in the process.
Grassley, who had a team of nearly 40 attorneys and other officials who vetted several Kavanaugh-related accusations last fall, said he found out about the new alleged incident Sunday, after the Times published its report.
"They did everything we asked them to," Grassley said Monday of the FBI. "The problem is, there was just a name given. . . . So I think it's just a case of somebody saying you ought to talk to somebody. That doesn't give you much to go on."
Feinstein told reporters that she "had no other information at that time."
"The problem was that the FBI did not do the investigations that we hoped they would do," Feinstein said. "We need to clear this up."
Wray has defended the FBI's handling of the Kavanaugh background investigation, although the House Judiciary Committee, led by Democrats, has indicated the FBI director will face questions on the issue in October, which is the next time he is scheduled to appear before them.
Background check limits The FBI's investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations was always limited in scope, in part because a background investigation is not like a criminal probe to uncover possible wrongdoing. Rather, it is an inquiry made on behalf of a specific client - the White House.
The inquiry into sexual assault allegations made against Kavanaugh was even more restricted because it was a supplemental investigation to the previous FBI background probe.
To address questions raised by Republican senators who were wavering on voting for him, the White House tasked the FBI to do some limited, additional digging, according to people familiar with the matter. Democrats cried foul at the time, saying the FBI was hamstrung by the White House, and the FBI ultimately interviewed fewer than a dozen people connected to two allegations leveled against Kavanaugh.
One was the accusation brought by Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when both were teenagers in suburban Washington. The other was brought by Deborah Ramirez, another Yale classmate who alleged that Kavanaugh exposed himself during a dorm party. Kavanaugh has denied all the allegations.
"When I heard from several senators that they were being assured that this would be a by-the-book investigation, I called White House counsel [Donald] McGahn and said, 'Where's the book? What's the rules? What's the background?'" Coons recalled.
Aides said Coons wrote the Oct. 2 letter because he wanted to get relevant information about credible allegations as quickly as possible to the FBI. Kavanaugh was confirmed Oct. 6.
As the FBI was wrapping up its investigation, intermediaries working on behalf of Stier delivered his account to agency officials. The intermediaries told The Post last year they had relayed that a classmate of Kavanaugh's had witnessed an incident while taking a study break at Yale's Lawrance Hall, a dorm. They declined to give the classmate's name to The Post.

Sen. Chuck Grassley never even received the latest Kavanaugh 'allegation'

Texto completo: The latest salvo in the Left's and the media's endless assault on Justice Brett Kavanaugh comes from Max Stier, a Beltway-based attorney who represented President Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. According to the New York Times' relaying of the controversial new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, the Yale graduate claims to have seen Kavanaugh at a dorm party "where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
The story is thinly sourced and the alleged victim denied the allegation through multiple friends (a fact the Times omitted in its original story). Given that the poorly sourced charge is so explosive, it's hard to imagine the Times would run this allegation against almost any other target. To justify publishing an uncorroborated, largely debunked, 30-year-old accusation by a political operative, the Times tries to make it a story about how Stier's accusation was handled by authorities.
But on this meta-story, the reporters also left out an important fact. While Stier, the Democratic operative, told the FBI of the allegation, he never told the main authority responsible for litigating the matter publicly: the office of Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley — at least according to staffers who worked the confirmation process.
The Washington Post, which also reported that Grassley's office never received the allegation, reports that Democratic Senator Chris Coons wrote a letter to the FBI asking them to investigate the matter, which would imply that Stier informed both the FBI and a minority member of the Judiciary Committee, but not the chairman responsible for publicly handling the Kavanaugh case. (Coons' office did not respond to a query on this.)
So Stier claims to have seen other people shove Kavanaugh's penis into the hand of a woman who multiple people say denies it, and he thought this such a disqualifying and urgent matter that instead of alerting the one office with the immediate power to publicly investigate it in a show-trial that implicitly employed a preponderance of evidence, he alerted the FBI, which thought the story so uncorroborated that the premier independent investigatory body of the nation declined to pursue it.
Hardly convincing stuff.

Brett Kavanaugh, the New York Times, and the lack of accountability in journalism

Texto completo: Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is facing calls for impeachment from Democrats for what seems to be a bombshell accusation of sexual assault from his college days.
According to the New York Times, a previously unreported story about Kavanaugh during his freshman year at Yale University echoed the allegations made by Deborah Ramirez. The Times wrote, "A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly.”
This was another "bombshell," and it sure entered the public debate with a bang. The Times tweeted out: “Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn’t belong at Yale in the first place.”
First of all, what? Remind me not to party with the Times' social media team.
More importantly, the Times failed to mention in this piece that the female student who was allegedly on the receiving end of the incident does not recall that it even happened.
After receiving heavy scrutiny for the piece, the Times updated their article and included an editor’s note, reading, "An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.”
Another item omitted from the Times' attack on Kavanaugh: The new Kavanaugh book by the Times' reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly also contains details undermining the accusations by Kavanaugh's original accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.
While Ford gave an emotional testimony in September 2018 to the Senate Judiciary Committee detailing Kavanaugh groping her at a high school party in the 1980s, her high school friend, Leland Keyser, cast doubt on Ford's claims, telling the authors, "I don’t have any confidence in the story.” Keyser went on to explain that she doesn’t even recall that particular get-together where Ford was allegedly assaulted by Kavanaugh, saying, "Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense.”
There’s no way for the public to fully know what happened in Brett Kavanaugh’s past. What can be said about this whole saga is that it’s looking more likely that the press willingly engaged in a smear campaign against a respected federal judge to keep him off the Supreme Court. What’s worse is that those who participated in dragging Kavanaugh through the mud probably won’t be held accountable.

Texto completo: One of the New York Times reporters behind the bombshell story detailing a new sexual misconduct allegation about Justice Brett Kavanaugh also authored a deleted tweet that said thrusting a penis in a woman's face could be considered "harmless fun."
Promoting the report Saturday evening, the Times's opinion account tweeted, "Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn't belong at Yale in the first place."
The Times then deleted the tweet after it received intense backlash on social media, saying it was "poorly phrased." That apologetic tweet was also deleted and replaced by another that read more forcefully, "We deleted a previous tweet regarding this article. It was offensive, and we apologize."
The author of the original tweet was culture reporter Robin Pogrebin, according to a "Times insider familiar with the matter" who spoke with Politico.
“It was really neglectful,” the source said, referring to a lack of adequate vetting. “There were serious errors made along the way.”
The Washington Examiner has reached out to both the Times and Pogrebin for comment, but did not immediately receive responses.
The Times exposé, adapted from an upcoming book by reporters Pogrebin and Kate Kelly titled The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation and due out Tuesday, centered around Deborah Ramirez, who alleged Kavanaugh thrust his penis into her face at a Yale dormitory party in the 1980s.

Biden fails to join other candidates in calling for Kavanaugh impeachment

Texto completo: Joe Biden is not joining other Democrats in demanding the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, calling for handling the matter "the right way" with an investigation into how sexual misconduct allegations against the judge were investigated.
"We must follow the evidence to wherever it leads," Biden said in a statement Sunday. "Doing this the right way is critically important in getting the truth and restoring the American people's faith in their government."
Earlier on Sunday, several Democratic presidential hopefuls, including California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, called for Kavanaugh's impeachment in wake of a New York Times story that reported a previously unknown sexual misconduct allegation. Max Stier, who was a classmate of Kavanaugh's at Yale, said he remembered an instance where Kavanaugh had his pants down during a dorm party, with friends forcing his penis at a female student who inadvertently touched it. The female student, however, has not spoken publicly about the allegation, and her friends said that she does not remember the incident.
[Related: New York Times sinks its Kavanaugh claim with Editor's Note stating alleged victim 'does not recall the incident']
"We need to get to the bottom of whether the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans pressured the FBI to ignore evidence or prevented them from following up on leads relating to Justice Kavanaugh's background investigation, subsequent allegations that arose, and the truthfulness of his testimony to the Senate," Biden said.
Kavanaugh was confirmed in October 2018 after a grueling confirmation process that largely centered on decades-old sexual misconduct allegations from Christine Blasey Ford, who attended a high school near Kavanaugh, and Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale at the same time as Kavanaugh. Ford said that when they were in high school, Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed and covered her mouth, while Ramirez said that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a college dorm party. Kavanaugh denied the allegations.
"This weekend's report in the New York Times raises again profoundly troubling questions about the integrity of the confirmation process that put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court in the first place," Biden said in the statement. "The women who continue to come forward, as Dr. Blasey Ford courageously did, deserve to be treated with dignity and be listened to. It takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward, under the bright lights of millions of people watching, and relive a traumatic memory."

The Deborah Ramirez 'corroboration' that wasn't

Texto completo: New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly claim that they have seven sources who "more fully [corroborate]" Deborah Ramirez's allegation that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party.
Yet of those seven, only one even claims to have heard that Kavanaugh was the person in the story at the time, as they admit in their book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation. And even he is only a third-hand source of information, not having actually been there himself, and having heard it from a source whose identity he does not disclose.
Kenneth Appold, who had previously spoken to the New Yorker, claimed to have heard at the time that Kavanaugh was the person who had exposed himself to Ramirez.
"Within a couple of days of the party, Ken Appold stood in a Lawrance Hall entryway and was told by two Stiles freshmen (whose identity he can't recall) what Kavanaugh had done to Ramirez," write Pogrebin and Kelly in their book. "'It was fresh in their recollection,' Appold said. 'One person saw it; the second person was hearing the story from him for the second time.'"
The only other of the seven who claim to have heard about the story in its immediate aftermath was fellow Yalie Richard Oh, who the book reports "overheard a female student emotionally describing making contact with a fake penis, saying 'It's not real,' and then realizing it was real." There is no indication, however, that Oh identified Kavanaugh by name as the culprit.
A few years after the alleged incident, Ramirez's mother claims her daughter told her, "Something happened at Yale." She did not go into any further detail or provide a name.
Another person supposedly proving that the story is "more fully corroborated" is Michael Wetstone, who claims to have heard "about the incident" from Appold, his graduate school classmate, "within a few years of when it allegedly happened." The book does not make clear if Appold identified Kavanaugh by name.
Two other Yale classmates, Chad Ludington and James Roche, are described as "vaguely remember[ing] hearing about something happening to Ramirez during her freshman year." Roche had only a vague recollection of hearing about the Ramirez incident, but he also told the New Yorker, "I cannot imagine her making this up," adding that he remembered Kavanaugh as "frequently, incoherently drunk.'" Ludington comments further in the book that he believes that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking habits, but is not further quoted on the Ramirez allegation. The book does not imply that either Roche or Appold identified Kavanaugh by name or the extent of their familiarity with the rumor.
The seventh and final source is "an unidentified friend of Ramirez's who said in a recent affidavit that she heard about the incident in the 1990s — remembers being told about it within a decade of its alleged occurence." In the affidavit, the book reports that the friend described "a male classmate." The book does not imply that she identified Kavanaugh by name.
Ramirez names David White, Kevin Genda, and David Todd all as witnessing the alleged incident, yet in their statement to the New Yorker, all three said, "We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it — and we did not." No one other than Ramirez claims to have witnessed the alleged incident, and the book reports that she did not recall telling anyone about it at the time.
To recap: Of the seven sources meant to bolster the credibility of Ramirez's allegation, only one recalls hearing Kavanaugh mentioned as the perp by an unknown source who, if he ever existed, has since failed to come forward. Only one other person claims to have independently heard about such an incident at the time, but he does not appeared to have named Kavanaugh in connection with it. Three of the sources may not have recalled any details about the incident, and another one just heard it from the first.
Ramirez's own mother, meanwhile, cannot corroborate anything past "something happened."
And finally, every person named as being in the room when this supposedly happened denies that it ever happened. That's corroboration for you.

Texto completo: El Fiscal de Distrito de Manhattan se niega a dejar de ver las declaraciones de impuestos del presidente Donald Trump.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, la oficina que dirige Cyrus R. Vance Jr . ha solicitado ver ocho años de impuestos de Trump, tanto los personales como los corporativos. El pedido es parte de la investigación sobre supuestos pagos secretos a la actriz porno Stormy Daniels , quien habría tenido relaciones sexuales con el presidente.
El pago lo habría hecho Michael Cohen, exabogado de Trump, para comprar el silencio de Daniels. El magnate o su organización habrían reembolsado el dinero a Cohen. El mandatario ha desmentido las acusaciones pero tampoco ha revelados sus impuestos tal y como prometio en 2016.

Texto completo: It isn’t often that a modern film features a 13-year-old boy choosing refinement over the stereotypical horndog antics of, oh I don’t know, just about every teen movie or TV show. It’s as if this depiction is so pervasive any kid who chooses to understand the complexities of literature, classical music and fine art is literally a freak of nature.
That’s the interesting thing, though. For young Theo Decker (played as a youth by Oakes Fegley), the world revolves around his beautiful, sweet mother who takes the time to help him understand the wonder, and the layers of story and connections, found within refined things. That’s why they are at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City at such a pivotal moment you can practically see the kid holding his breath to see what’s next. For one, his mother is explaining the background to a lovely little painting upon which the film is titled by 17th century artist Carel Fabritius while a pretty red-haired girl about his age seems interested in him and even moves close enough to touch his hand. Then, a bomb detonates, changing his world forever.
The film is based upon a New York Times bestselling novel by Donna Tartt, who first saw the painting in question 20 years before the release of her book. It was also awarded a Pulitzer Prize.
In the film, directed with steady skill by John Crowley, a mystery is created in that moment as well which we won’t find the answer to until the end of the movie, and which I certainly won’t reveal here. But, it is a mystery that audiences might find a little hard to hold onto the strings of which for a while, especially as we follow Theo as he is taken in by the wealthy Barbour family (headed by Nicole Kidman and Boyd Gaines). That’s because among victims of the blast was Theo’s beloved mother. Theo was friends with young Andy Barbour (Ryan Foust) and the two become close.
The other reason Theo is taken in by the Barbours is because his father Larry (Luke Wilson) disappeared a long time ago and is basically out of the picture — until one day, he shows up with a woman named Xandra (Sarah Paulson). The next thing you know, Theo is whisked away to low-rent life in Texas (really New Mexico subbing in).
Before all that, Theo needs to take care of something left over from the explosion. It seems that an old man who was fatally injured has given Theo a ring and the name of a man he made Theo promise to find. The man was Weldon “Welty” Blackwell and the man he had to give the ring to is his business partner, James “Hobie” Hobart (Jeffrey Wright). This sets off another thread that Theo will wind up following even as he becomes and adult (now played by Ansel Elgort). There are others too, most fatefully his friendship with a Ukranian kid named Boris (Finn Wolfhard).
Before long Crowley begins putting the pieces together of this plot, which about a third of the way through starts to feel hopelessly lost in character development hell. But don’t give up. Like the perfect denoument in a great piece of classical music, there are grace notes here as well. Highly recommended.
Tempo grade: A

The Farewell
MPAA rating: PG for thematic material, brief language and smoking.
Taos Community Auditorium
In this funny, uplifting tale based on an actual lie, Chinese-born, U.S.-raised Billi (Awkwafina) reluctantly returns to Changchun to find that, although the whole family knows their beloved matriarch, Nai-Nai (Shuzhen Zhao), has been given mere weeks to live, everyone has decided not to tell Nai Nai herself.
To assure her happiness, they gather under the joyful guise of an expedited wedding, uniting family members scattered among new homes abroad. As Billi navigates a minefield of family expectations and proprieties, she finds there’s a lot to celebrate: a chance to rediscover the country she left as a child, her grandmother’s wondrous spirit, and the ties that keep on binding even when so much goes unspoken.
With “The Farewell,” writer-director Lulu Wang has created a heartfelt celebration of both the way we perform family and the way we live it, masterfully interweaving a gently humorous depiction of the good lie in action with a richly moving story of how family can unite and strengthen us, often in spite of ourselves.
This film will be screened at 2 p.m. Sunday (Sept. 15) and 7 p.m. Monday through
Wednesday (Sept. 16-18) at the Taos Cmmunity Auditorium, 145 Paseo del Pueblo Norte. For tickets and additional information, call (575) 758-2052 or visit tcataos.org.

Alabama tracks students to keep them in the stands

Texto completo: TUSCALOOSA, Ala. - Sweat from an afternoon under a unrelenting sun and in stifling 100-degree heat had soaked through parts of Taylor Pell's fraternity pledge uniform: khaki pants, blue blazer, white shirt and crimson tie.
But he was embracing the grind.
"Games like this is when it matters," said Pell, a sophomore from Huntsville, Alabama, standing in the largely vacant bleachers in the south end zone during the fourth quarter of Alabama's 62-10 shellacking of New Mexico State, its first home game of the season.
Pell's approach would have drawn a nod of approval from the famously hard-to-please Nick Saban, who might well have been prouder of the fan than of some of his backup players on Saturday.
Saban, the Alabama football coach, has long been peeved that the student section at Bryant-Denny Stadium empties early. So this season, the university is rewarding students who attend games - and stay until the fourth quarter - with an alluring prize: improved access to tickets to the SEC championship game and to the College Football Playoff semifinals and championship game, which Alabama is trying to reach for the fifth consecutive season.
But to do this, Alabama is taking an extraordinary, Orwellian step: using location-tracking technology from students' phones to see who skips out and who stays.
"It's kind of like Big Brother," said Allison Isidore, a graduate student in religious studies from Montclair, New Jersey.
It also seems inevitable in an age when tech behemoths like Facebook, Google and Amazon harvest data from phones, knowing where users walk, what they watch and how they shop. Alabama isn't the only college tapping into student data; the University of North Carolina uses location-tracking technology to see whether its football players and other athletes are in class.
Greg Byrne, Alabama's athletic director, said privacy concerns had rarely come up when the program was being discussed with other departments and student groups. Students who download the Tide Loyalty Points app will be tracked only inside the stadium, he said, and they can close the app - or delete it - once they leave the stadium.
"If anybody has a phone, unless you're in airplane mode or have it off, the cellular companies know where you are," he said.
But Adam Schwartz, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy watchdog, said it was "very alarming" that a public university - an arm of the government - was tracking its students' whereabouts.
"Why should packing the stadium in the fourth quarter be the last time the government wants to know where students are?" Schwartz said, adding that it was "inappropriate" to offer an incentive for students to give up their privacy. "A public university is a teacher, telling students what is proper in a democratic society."
The creator of the app, FanMaker, runs apps for 40 colleges, including Clem-son, Louisiana State and Southern California, which typically reward fans with gifts like T-shirts. The app it created for Alabama is the only one that tracks the locations of its students. That Alabama would want it is an example of how even a powerhouse program like the Crimson Tide is not sheltered from college football's decline in attendance, which sank to a 22-year low last season.
The Tide Loyalty Points program works like this: Students, who typically pay about $10 for home tickets, download the app and earn 100 points for attending a home game and an additional 250 for staying until the fourth quarter. Those points augment those they garner mostly from progress they have made toward their degrees - 100 points per credit hour. (A regular load would be 15 credits per semester, or 1,500 points.)
The rollout during Alabama's home opener did not go very well.
The stadium's network servers were overwhelmed by the number of fans in the student section, which seats 17,000 - slightly more than half the student body. That meant that many students were unable to open their apps, leading to long lines at several help kiosks and to students' taking photos with the scoreboard in the background to prove they had stayed.
"It's like Wheel of Fortune," said Giuseppe Rallo, a senior from LaGrange, Illinois, displaying the spinning icon on his phone, signifying that his app was not loading.
And the carrot of prized tickets had only a marginal influence on students staying in their seats, as the heat led dozens to find shelter in the concourses and thousands to head to the exit before halftime, when Alabama led, 38-0.

Marc Thiessen: CNN caught dealing in fake news

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Here’s some advice for the media covering President Trump: If you don’t want to be accused of reporting fake news, don’t report fake news.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" />
Case in point: On Monday, CNN correspondent Jim Sciutto reported that a highly-placed U.S. intelligence source inside the Kremlin was pulled “in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.” Sciutto continued, “The decision to carry out the extraction occurred soon after a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump discussed highly classified intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. … [that] had been provided by Israel.”
Sorry, the decision to extract the source was first made before Trump took office, and the reason was mishandling of classified intelligence not by Trump, but by the Obama administration . As The New York Times reports this week, “C.I.A. officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia.” What prompted that decision? Leaks to the media about the covert source’s reporting that Russian president Vladimir Putin personally ordered and orchestrated Russia’s election interference campaign.
The impetus for the extraction decision was a December 14, 2016 NBC News report that “Two senior officials with direct access to the information” said Putin personally directed Russia’s election interference and that “the intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies, the officials said.” NBC added that this new intelligence showing Putin’s direct involvement went much further than the information the U.S. was relying when all 17 intelligence agencies issued a report in October holding Russia responsible for the DNC hack, and that “now the U.S has solid information tying Putin to the operation.”
This leak exposed the fact that the CIA had a spy in Putin’s orbit who was passing on intelligence about the Russian president’s decision making. Who leaked the information? Two senior Obama administration officials. The Times reports that Obama CIA director John Brennan considered the Kremlin source’s reporting “so delicate, and the need to protect the source’s identity so important,” that he kept his reports out of the President’s Daily Brief (PDB) sent them to Obama in “special sealed envelopes to the Oval Office.” The PDB is already one of the most restricted U.S. government documents, so the sealed reports were restricted to an even smaller circle of senior Obama aides. Yet the leak, according to NBC, came from officials “with direct access to the information.” Which Obama aide leaked it? That is for U.S. attorney John Durham to find out, but this much is certain: It was not Donald Trump.
It was after this Obama administration leak that the CIA decided to pull the source. The reason he was not actually pulled at the time is that he initially refused — a decision the Times reports raised concerns that “the informant had been turned and had become a double agent.” Eventually, the source changed his mind. But the decision was made before Trump came to office.
That’s not all. CNN falsely reported that the source was pulled after Trump’s meeting with Russia officials in which he shared intelligence on Syria that was “provided by Israel.” But as I pointed out in May 2017, Trump did not reveal that Israel was the source of the intelligence. That classified information was revealed to the Times by what the paper described “a current and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information.” Any former official familiar with that intelligence was from the Obama administration. So this leak also came from Team Obama. Even Brennan, the Obama CIA director and virulent Trump critic, admitted that Trump was not to blame and said that “the real damage to national security is … what was leaked in the aftermath, what was put in the media.”
So, CNN tried to blame Trump for the loss of Kremlin source, when it was really the Obama administration that was responsible for the catastrophic leaks that burned him — and did so citing a leak that did not come from Trump at all, but most likely from a former Obama official. Talk about fake news! Yet despite all this, CNN has not pulled its “fake news” story. Indeed, Sciutto still has it proudly pinned at the top of the Twitter feed. What a disgrace.

Trump ofrece “rescatar” a juez de Corte Suprema de acusaciones de conducta sexual “indebida”

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha salido este domingo en defensa de Brett Kavanaugh, el juez la Corte Suprema señalado por conducta sexual indebida . Trump ha animado a Kavanaugh a demandar por injurias y asegura que, en caso contrario, el Departamento de Justicia puede salir en defensa del juez.
Tras una investigación de The New York Times que vio la luz este sábado, varios precandidatos demócratas han pedido un juicio político para Kavanaugh . El reportaje de The Times es el borrador de un libro que publicarán en breve periodistas del diario neoyorquino y que asegura confirmar los argumentos de Deborah Ramirez , compañera de universidad del actual juez.
Ramirez afirma que Kavanaugh le mostró el pene durante una fiesta con alcohol cuando ambos eran estudiantes . Al menos siete personas, entre ellas la madre de Ramirez, aseguraron a los periodistas que habían oído hablar de dicha conducta indebida de Kavanaugh antes de que este se convirtiera en juez. El juez negó las acusaciones durante su audiencia de confirmación en el Senado el pasado otoño.
La nota de The Times también revela una cuenta que se hace eco de la historia de Ramirez. El también antiguo compañero del juez en la Universidad de Yale describe cómo Kavanaugh empujaba durante una fiesta sus partes privadas hacia las manos de una compañera . Según el diario, el hombre informó sobre el incidente a senadores y al FBI pero la agencia no investigó.
Algunos d emócratas que se enfrentan a Donald Trump en las elecciones de 2020 dieron su opinión sobre la investigación.
“Las revelaciones de hoy confirman lo que ya sabíamos: durante su audiencia, Kavanaugh enfrentó acusaciones creíbles y probablemente mintió al Congreso”, dijo el senador Bernie Sanders .
The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.
— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019
“Brett Kavanaugh mintió al Senado de Estados Unidos y, lo que es más importante, al pueblo estadounidense. Debe someterse a un juicio político”, sentenció Kamala Harris , miembro del Comité Judicial.
I sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.
He must be impeached.
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 15, 2019
“Confirmación no es exoneración. Y estas nuevas revelaciones son inquietantes. Igual que el hombre que lo nombró, Kavanaugh debería enfrentar un juicio político”, dijo la senadora Elizabeth Warren también en Twitter”.
Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.

Otros candidatos demócratas como Beto O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar o Julián Castro también se pronunciaron al respecto. A todos ellos, el presidente Trump les contestó llamándoles “demócratas de izquierda radical” y culpándoles (junto a los “medios ineptos”) de perseguir a Kavanaugh. “¡Solo quieren asustarlo para que se vuelva liberal!”, sentenció.
Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. "The Testaments" by Margaret Atwood (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The feminist dystopian classic "The Handmaid's Tale" (1985) gets a sequel at long last. Atwood says of the book, "Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book in a review, saying, "'The Testaments' is worthy of the literary classic it continues."
2. "The Institute" by Stephen King (Scribner, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: Twelve-year-old genius Luke Ellis is whisked away in the middle of the night and taken to the Institute, where psychic kids are being held captive to save the world.
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book in a review, saying, "King leans into the theme of 'great events' happening with the smallest of decisions as well as the world-changing power of togetherness. And in that case, it's a frequent lesson he extols that never gets old."
3. "Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America" by James Poniewozik (Liveright, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The New York Times TV critic examines the history of television and American media to explain how Trump mastered the medium to win his base and become our 45th president.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "This intelligent eye-opener belongs on the small shelf of valuable books that help explain how Trump created his base."
4. "The Education of an Idealist" by Samantha Power (Dey Street, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish-American diplomat and human rights advocate traces her journey from immigrant to war correspondent to presidential Cabinet official in a revealing memoir.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "Power's vibrant prose, exuberant storytelling, and deep insights into human nature make for a page-turning memoir."
5. "After the Flood" by Kassandra Montag (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: In this dystopian adventure novel set in a water-logged world altered by climate change, a mother embarks on a perilous voyage to rescue her kidnapped daughter.
The buzz: "Anchored by a complicated, compelling heroine, this gripping, speculative, high-seas adventure is impossible to put down," says Booklist.

Is college broken? Best-selling author coming to Portland to talk about it Paul Tough will discuss higher education in America with his friend Sara Corbett on Friday at USM.

Texto completo: Timing is everything, and Paul Tough could not have picked a better time to write a book about the broken-down conditions of American colleges and what can be done to fix them.
"The Years That Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us" came out last week, just as actress Felicity Huffman was trying to persuade a federal judge in the college-admissions scandal that she should not spend time in jail for paying thousands of dollars to alter her daughter's SAT scores. The case has heightened the perception that wealth and privilege have more to do with getting into an elite school than good grades. Tough's book shines an even brighter light on the issue of fairness among the haves and the have-nots by presenting mounds of evidence and anecdotes that suggest that's exactly what's happening, leaving America in an educational crisis. A contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine, Tough - who lives in Austin, Texas, and will be in Portland this week - spent six years researching and writing the book.
"The Years That Matter Most" is about the intersection of higher education and social mobility in American life. In the not-too-distant past, the relationship between those themes was obvious and straightforward. Higher education was the engine of social mobility. "It still works for individual young people, but more broadly the engine has broken down," Tough said in a phone interview. "For so many young people now, higher education is obstacle to progress."
Tough's previous book, "How Children Succeed," was an international best-seller and earned him a place on the list of cultural influencers. The new book should keep him there, said his longtime friend, Portland writer Sara Corbett. She will interview Tough at 7 p.m. Friday at Hannaford Hall at the University of Southern Maine.
The event is a collaboration among The Telling Room, the Maine Writers and Publishers Alliance, USM and Portland Public Schools. Corbett is co-founder of The Telling Room, which works with young people to build writing skills and confidence. Corbett and Tough became friends when both worked as contributing writers at the New York Times Magazine. Corbett edited Tough's first draft of the new book and guided him through the revision process.
She believes "The Years That Matter Most" will reshape how we view the impact and role of college in American culture. "It's truly the kind of book that people are going to want to chatter endlessly about, a journalistic deep dive on what role college plays in the lives of young people - its impact on economic mobility, the intricacies of the college-admissions process, and the obstacles faced by first-generation college students and students of color. It's riveting reading," she wrote in an email. "It's definitely going to make a big splash."
Among the conclusions of "The Years That Matter Most":
The country's most selective colleges and universities are admitting more wealthy students and fewer poor and working-class students, even as they attempt to create an image that the opposite is true;
The battle for tuition money among colleges is so fierce that colleges enroll students they do not want;
Poor students who are admitted to elite schools are overwhelmed and beaten down by the inequality of wealth on campus;
College was once a symbol of hope and promise and a path to a better life with more economic opportunity and security. Today, young people make their decisions about college motivated less by hope and more by fear, he writes. Instead of being a path to a better life, college is increasingly seen as "an insurance policy against moving down," he contends.
Tough is traveling the country to talk about his research, and hopes the book inspires conversations like the one he will have with Corbett on Friday. He's quick to note that his book is not a policy book. It's a book of stories and ideas, he said.
He blames admissions officers at selective colleges for continuing to put "undue weight" on SAT scores that favor wealthy students and for favoring legacy students, and he also blames state governments and legislators for cutting educational spending at a time when more students need more help.

Virtuosic violinist makes case for year-round chamber music The Portland Chamber Music Festival presents Johnny Gandelsman's recital at Cove Street Arts.

Texto completo: The Portland Chamber Music Festival runs for only a couple of summer weeks, but it occasionally asserts its presence with one-off concerts during the rest of the year. Lately, the frequency of those concerts has been increasing, which is a good thing: Apart from a couple of string quartets, a piano trio, faculty and student ensembles and occasional imports by Portland Ovations, there is not much chamber music here in the fall, winter and spring. In an ideal world, where raising the funding necessary for a major expansion is not an issue, the festival would reconfigure itself as a year-round enterprise.
This year, the organization began its post-festival activities early - less than a month after the Aug. 17 finale - by presenting a solo recital by violinist Johnny Gandelsman at Cove Street Arts on Thursday evening. Gandelsman is a founder of Brooklyn Rider, an innovative string quartet that plays both standard repertory and new music, with an emphasis on the latter, and is heard frequently in other contexts, too, most notably as a member of the Silkroad Ensemble, a group that explores music (old and new, traditional and composed) from the ancient trade routes running from Asia to North Africa and Western Europe. He also runs his own record label, In a Circle Records.
Gandelsman's "Bach Along the Silk Road" program touched on a few of his associations, including a fascination with Bach that has already yielded a superb recording of the six Sonatas and Partitas for Unaccompanied Violin (on In a Circle) and will soon extend to a recording of his transcriptions of the Cello Suites, as well as three works written for him this year, two by composers (or, at least, on subjects) with Silk Road roots.
Opening with Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 in G (BWV 1007) was an interesting choice: You would expect a violinist to give pride of place to a work written for his own instrument. But Bach was fairly agnostic about scoring, often reconfiguring works for multiple instrumental combinations. So as familiar as the suite's dark-hued, heftier cello version is, Gandelsman's violin performance was illuminating, and not out of keeping with Bach's own practice.
Taken at consistently brisk tempos, the suite's seven movements sounded lighter and brighter, and thoroughly natural on the fiddle. And as one might expect, Gandelsman brought the same qualities to it that can be heard in his accounts of the violin works - subtle shifts in coloration and dynamics that highlight the real magic in these pieces, which is the illusion of counterpoint, despite the fact that the score is, for the most part, a single line of music.
Gandelsman created that illusion unfailingly, both in the cello work that opened the concert and in the Partita No. 2 in D minor (BWV 1002), one of the solo violin works, which closed his program. The acid test here was the Chaconne that ends the work, a movement generally agreed to be a peak of the Western repertory. Essentially a set of variations on a repeating harmonic sequence, the Chaconne is monstrously difficult. Gandelsman walked a fine line here, moving through the piece as if its challenges were nothing to him, while also maintaining the tension and focus that those challenges yield. He succeeded remarkably, with a fluid performance that seemed both soulful and virtuosic.
The first of the new works Gandelsman played between the Bach suites, Akshaya Tucker's "Pallavi: A Meditation on Care," is a fantasy on a Hindu devotional song, and begins with hints of its origin - a drone on the lower strings that serves as the backdrop for a sliding melody that even a listener unfamiliar with the quoted song would identify as Indian. But that Indian accent does not hold the spotlight for long; Tucker moves toward more thoroughly Western figuration in a piece that grows increasingly virtuosic.
Dana Lyn's "a current took her away" is essentially an ecological essay. The "her" in the title is a bit of plankton, loosened by warming oceans and carried off. It is a gentle piece at first, the plankton bobbing like a feather on a breeze. But this is also a showpiece for a master fiddler, and it grows increasingly involved, playing to Gandelsman's strengths, which include the kind of clarity necessary to keep the plankton in focus while other underwater activity swirls around it.
Lyn's work was a world premiere, commissioned by Gandelsman and the festival, as was Layale Chaker's "SinekemÄn." The work's title refers to a Turkish fiddle, and there are moments when that instrument's sound is hinted at. Mostly, though, the piece is a richly chromatic and increasingly dense-textured meditation, with fleetingly modal passages that come as reminders of its multicultural inspiration, which Gandelsman played engagingly and with a supple approach to balance and coloration.

Texto completo: "Dedicated to serving others, these inspiring honorees have made an irrevocable impact on the global community. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to honor and celebrate their contributions, which put into action Eleanor's ideals."

Chelsea Clinton visited Dutchess County in April 2016 to speak on the accomplishments of her mother, Hillary Clinton, in the midst of her Presidential campaign.
Next month, the former first lady, Secretary of State and U.S. Senator will return the favor for her daughter, when Hillary Clinton presents Chelsea Clinton with a Eleanor Roosevelt Val-Kill Medal.
The former first daughter and current author and professor will be one of five recipients of the honor, which remembers the legacy of of the late Eleanor Roosevelt, Dutchess County's very own first lady.
Hillary Clinton is counted among the list of those who have previously been given the prestigious honor — a recipient in 1995.
The 32nd Eleanor Roosevelt Val-Kill Medal Ceremony on Oct. 13 will be held at the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site in Hyde Park, which is also known as Val-Kill.
Hyde Park residents and philanthropists John and Gloria Golden; humanitarian, author and journalist Zainab Salbi; and Celebrity Cruises President and CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo will also receive medals, The nonprofit Eleanor Roosevelt Center at Val-Kill announced Friday. The organization, its educational programs and annual medal ceremony celebrate and showcase the late first lady's sweeping vision and impact on the nation.
"Dedicated to serving others, these inspiring honorees have made an irrevocable impact on the global community," said April Gozza, executive director of the center. "We are thrilled to have the opportunity to honor and celebrate their contributions, which put into action Eleanor's ideals."
Chelsea Clinton, an author and vice chair of the Clinton Foundation who was married in Rhinebeck in 2010, selected her mother as presenter. The duo are the first mother-daughter recipients of the medals.
Chelsea Clinton, whose father Bill Clinton was the 42nd U.S. President, teaches at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health and is the author of several, books, two of which were New York Times bestsellers. "The Book of Gutsy Women," authored by mother-and-daughter, is set for publication on Oct. 1.
The Goldens selected former Hyde Park Supervisor Pompey Delafield as their presenter. Information on the others was not available.
The Goldens "have dedicated themselves to serving the Hyde Park community," The Eleanor Roosevelt Center at Val-Kill said in a release, through various landmark restoration, advocacy and fundraising projects. The organization also noted Gloria Golden "had the honor of spending a good deal of time in Mrs. Roosevelt's company," as her father was a friend of the former first lady who "presided over her funeral."
The Eleanor Roosevelt Center at Val-Kill described Lutoff-Perlo as a "gender equity champion" and philanthropist, who is "responsible for hiring the (cruise) industry's first American female captain."
Salbi, according to her website, founded Women for Women International, a grassroots humanitarian and development organization. As a journalist, she has been featured on PBS, Yahoo News and MSNBC; and in the Huffington Post, according to www.zainabsalbi.com.
In addition to HIllary Clinton, past medal recipients include Gloria Steinem, Pawling resident James Earl Jones, the late Dutchess Junction resident Pete Seeger and Tarana Burke, founder of the "Me Too" movement.
Val-Kill, the only National Park Service site dedicated to a specific first lady, served as Eleanor Roosevelt's retreat and is made up of two buildings, one of which is now a museum. A proud Dutchess County native, Franklin D. Roosevelt served as the nation's 32nd president and was commander-in-chief during World War II.

Nielsen Says More Than 14 Million Tuned In to Debate

Texto completo: More than 14 million people tuned in Thursday for the clash of 10 presidential candidates in Houston on ABC News and Univision, the second-largest audience to date for a Democratic primary debate.
Only the NBC News debate in June, which drew 18.1 million viewers on its second night, outranked it. And total viewership on Thursday was likely far higher, since Nielsen figures do not count online audiences and livestreams.
Broadcasts of primary debates are, foremost, a civic service, offering voters an unexpurgated view of the candidates. But they also serve as tent pole events for the media organizations that sponsor them, a chance to showcase journalism and burnish the brand in front of some of the biggest audiences in news.
Next month, a newcomer is joining the debate game: The New York Times.
The paper said on Friday that it planned to co-host, with CNN, next month's matchup in Westerville, Ohio, the fourth debate of the Democratic nominating contest. A pair of CNN anchors, Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett, will share moderating duties with The Times's national editor, Marc Lacey.
It is not hugely unusual for newspapers to team up with television networks for a debate night: The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, among other print news outlets, co-sponsored events in the 2016 campaign.
[ Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]
But The Times, despite chronicling more than a century's worth of American elections, has abstained in recent years from formally organizing a high-profile forum for candidates. The last time it happened was 2004, when one of its reporters co-moderated a Democratic debate in New York.
With millions of eyeballs comes intense scrutiny, and The Times's entry into the tricky work of organizing a debate comes as the paper is expanding its reach beyond the traditional print product.
"The Weekly," a documentary-style show on FX and Hulu featuring Times journalists, debuted in June. An adaptation of the paper's "Modern Love" column -- starring Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, and other notable actors -- begins streaming on Amazon in October. Its podcast "The Daily" is among the most popular in the country, and a Showtime documentary about the paper's inner workings aired in 2018.
Such efforts are rooted in the paper's journalism. Still, it's a shift for an institution that shied away in the past from self-promotion -- sometimes, its critics argued, to its detriment.
"Our decision to take a leading role in planning and hosting a debate grew out of our mission to cover the major issues and concerns facing voters and the country," the paper's executive editor, Dean Baquet, and its politics editor, Patrick Healy, wrote in a memo on Friday.
The paper is also considering taking part in additional events. "If 2020 Republican primary debates are held, we intend to look into helping plan one of those, as well as a general election debate next year," Mr. Baquet and Mr. Healy wrote.
Mr. Healy said in an email that The Times approached the Democratic National Committee "as a way to understand the process for planning and presenting debates." Soon afterward, the paper began discussing a joint editorial approach with CNN.
Sponsoring news organizations are responsible for the costs of each event, which can be significant. Along with renting a venue and paying a production crew, the sponsoring outlets oversee the construction of a set -- usually festooned by massive and expensive LED screens -- and the logistics of a live television production.
The Times acknowledged on Friday that its debate partnership with CNN includes "a financial component," but declined to discuss specific terms.
CNN is the first television network to secure a repeat sponsorship of a 2020 debate. CBS News is aiming to hold an event closer to the Iowa caucuses early next year. Fox News requested a debate, but was turned down by the Democratic National Committee.
The mid-October event will be the first Democratic primary debate in Ohio since February 2008, when NBC News sponsored one between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in Cleveland. A Republican contest in Cleveland in August 2015, featuring a voluble upstart named Donald J. Trump, retains the record for viewership of a primary debate, with 24 million watching on Fox News.

In Battered Bahamas, Haitians Are Hit Hard With Nowhere to Go

Texto completo: NASSAU, Bahamas -- Kerline Mildor escaped the wreckage of Hurricane Dorian with her three children and the clothes on her back.
Ms. Mildor, 33, an immigrant from Haiti who lived on Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas for 14 years, lacks Bahamian citizenship. Her children, born in the Bahamas, are stateless, among the thousands stuck in immigration limbo with nationality to neither country.
They were sent by plane to Nassau, where they are staying with 80 other people in a makeshift shelter at the Calvary Haitian Baptist Church, where their present is bleak and their future uncertain.
"They brought us here and told us that it was going to be good," she said. "They serve us rotten food and have us sleeping on the floor. Some dogs are living better. I have seen dogs who live better, in very nice cages."
The populations of Abaco and Grand Bahama Islands were evacuated after Dorian killed at least 50 people and left 1,300 unaccounted for. A new tropical storm was threatening to hit the same area on Saturday.
While many Dorian survivors arrived in the nation's capital and stayed at the homes of friends and relatives, more than 2,000 others -- almost all Haitians -- are staying in shelters with nowhere to go, no prospects for work and precarious legal status.
Many more Haitians are feared dead, because they may have stayed behind to ride out the storm in their unsafe squatter settlements, distrustful of government shelters.
An entire community of people who already had a contentious history with the Bahamian government is now homeless and, in some cases, in fear of deportation.
Haitians are notoriously stigmatized in the Bahamas, where they are often blamed for crime and feel that Bahamians discriminate against them. A policy enacted in 2014 requiring all people to have passports was largely seen as a way to crack down on Haitian immigrants and their children.
In an interview with The New York Times, the minister of immigration, Elsworth Johnson, said the government had suspended deportation roundups in areas affected by the storm, and shelters are considered sanctuaries. But while the government is providing services to survivors regardless of their country of origin, the legal status of migrants affected by the storm will not be ignored forever, he said.
He seemed to suggest that the undocumented in the Nassau shelters are particularly at risk if they venture outside.
"Eventually persons will come out of those shelters, and we know that people are leaving those shelters, and if they're not properly documented, then we apply the law," Mr. Johnson said.
The Bahamian government, he said, will not give asylum to storm survivors, because that requires proof of political persecution.
Carl Bethel, the attorney general, said immigrant and Bahamian survivors are treated equally. The children have rights to health care and education, and Haitians and Bahamians stay in the same shelters.
Nonetheless, many shelter inhabitants say that virtually everyone in them is Haitian, and the government has offered little guidance as to what will be done with them.
"I am not looking for answers tomorrow. I need answers today," said Rodney Louis, 52, who is living at the Kendal Isaacs gymnasium with his family. "I have been asking for help since last Thursday and I haven't heard anything. They feed us, but I want a house to live in. I need a job."
Fred R. Smith, a human rights lawyer, said the government should spend the influx of storm-related foreign aid to provide safe and sanitary housing for the thousands of people of Haitian descent who provide low-cost labor in construction and domestic help. Many Haitians have work permits, or are entitled to them, and the government has long ignored their living conditions, he said.
Mr. Smith filed an injunction against the government for its plans to bulldoze Pigeon Peas and the Mudd, the informal settlements on Great Abaco Island where many Haitians lived and were subjected to deportation raids and demolitions, even though many actually paid rent.
Hurricane Dorian, oddly, accomplished the government's plan to raze the shantytowns.
"I made the argument in court that they could not demolish those homes, because they had no place to go," Mr. Smith said. "Now they are homeless. What are they going to do with them?"
Mr. Smith noted that if only 2,000 people are in shelters, many Haitian people are still unaccounted for. "Where are all those people?" he said.
"This is a huge issue that needs to be addressed," Mr. Smith said. "The honeymoon of helping people is going to end very quickly."
Esther Innocent, 13, said children of Haitian descent like her, born in the Bahamas but lacking the right to Bahamian citizenship because their parents are not citizens, are scared they could be deported.
"It's terrifying," Esther, an eighth-grader, said. "I have never been to Haiti."
Esther is staying with her mother and twin brothers at the gym, where she said that although they are grateful for the food and shelter, she notices slights that she attributes to Bahamian xenophobia.
"I notice that the Bahamian people here get juice," she said. "They give us water."
Many Haitians interviewed said that they had no safety net of relatives, because all of them also had lived in the informal settlements obliterated by the storm.
"If I were to make a list of the things I need, I would have to write a book," said Fedline Homere, 27, who moved to the Bahamas from Haiti when she was 12 and has three stateless children.
She said it costs $ 2,000 a year to arrange for work permits, a sum she cannot afford.
"First thing I want is to get out of this country and go somewhere better," she said. "I don't know if the government even knows I exist. You can never feel safe. The shelter is better than staying on Abaco, because I have food. But I need to get out of here."
Several people said they hoped to join relatives in Miami.
President Trump made clear this week that United States immigration authorities would step up vigilance in checking for storm survivors who lacked a valid reason to be in the Bahamas in the first place.
"Everybody needs totally proper documentation because, look, the Bahamas had some tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas that weren't supposed to be there," Mr. Trump said Monday. "I don't want to allow people that weren't supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States, including some very bad people and some very bad gang members, and some very, very bad drug dealers. So we're going to be very, very strong on that."
Karl Henri Chatelier, the first secretary of the Haitian Embassy in Nassau, said his country was not in the position to be making demands of the Bahamian government on behalf of Haitian citizens.
"We cannot say that if they stay, they are going to be persecuted," Mr. Chatelier said Thursday outside one of the shelters. "We want to make sure they are well treated, want to make sure they are in good health. When you are not in your living room, not in your bed, things will be difficult for you."
At the church shelter, some storm survivors got so upset recounting the conditions that uniformed soldiers warned Times journalists doing the interviews against "inciting a riot."
"I think Haitians and Bahamians are being treated the same: bad," said Timothy Rolle, one of the few Bahamians at the shelter, whose furious diatribe contributed to the soldier's admonition.
A few hours later, after a week at the shelter, the survivors were provided air beds.

Texto completo: The Trump administration reached a milestone this week in its plan to open a pristine part of Alaska to oil and gas development with the release of a final report on the environmental impact of the plan.
The report keeps the Interior Department on track to auction leases for the right to drill in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge before the end of the year, a long-stated administration goal. Having drilling rights in the hands of oil companies would make it more difficult to stop development in the refuge should Democrats take either the White House or Senate and keep control of the House in the 2020 elections.
Here's a look at the issues and what has happened so far.
What's at stake?
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the largest remaining expanse of pristine land in the United States, an area the size of South Carolina that is largely devoid of human activity and home to migrating birds, polar bears, caribou and other wildlife.
Under a 1980 law, Congress left the possibility that 1.5 million acres -- about 8 percent of the overall refuge -- along the Arctic Ocean coast could be opened to oil and gas development. But for decades, Democrats, environmentalists and some Republicans derailed efforts to allow oil exploration in the area.
In 2017, with Republicans in control of the White House, the Senate and the House, Congress included a section in a tax bill establishing a plan to sell leases in the coastal plain, billing it as a revenue generator for the federal treasury.
With the passage of the bill in December 2017, the Interior Department began work on the lease-sale plan, largely through one of its agencies, the Bureau of Land Management. The plan calls for two sales of at least 400,000 acres. Owning leases would allow oil companies to begin exploration, but actual production of oil would probably not occur for at least a decade, if at all.

Why drill in the refuge?
Relatively little is known about how much oil lies under the coastal plain. The only seismic studies -- which can give strong clues as to the location and size of oil and gas reservoirs -- were done in the 1980s, when the technology was relatively primitive compared with today. In the late 1990s, using an updated analysis of the seismic data and other research, the United States Geological Survey estimated there could be up to 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the coastal plain, equivalent to about 18 months of consumption in the United States.
The administration, Republicans in Congress and lawmakers in Alaska have used that estimate to argue for opening the refuge, saying the coastal plain could reduce energy imports and that drilling would provide much-needed jobs in Alaska, where oil production has declined since the boom days of the 1970s.
But some oil experts doubt that estimate, pointing out that some oil wells near the refuge have had disappointing results. And a New York Times investigation found evidence that the only well drilled within the refuge boundaries, the KIC-1 well that was completed in the mid-1980s, was also disappointing.
Environmental groups and many Democrats in Congress have argued that opening the refuge to development makes little sense in an era when the world should be reducing its use of fossil fuels to fight climate change, and that exploration and drilling would cause great environmental damage and harm wildlife in the refuge. Especially vulnerable, they say, is the region's population of polar bears, which is already in decline because of sea-ice loss related to climate change, and the large migrating herd of caribou that uses the coastal plain as a calving area.
Environmentalists argue that even exploration work, such as new seismic studies, could cause irreparable damage to the delicate tundra in Arctic Alaska.
Doubts have also been raised as to how much revenue the lease sales would generate. The initial administration estimate was $ 1.8 billion over 10 years; the latest government estimate suggests it would be about half that. A Times analysis of other lease sales in northern Alaska suggested that total revenue could be less than $ 50 million, or about $ 5 million a year.
The KIC-1 well results were a tightly held secret of the oil companies involved in the drilling. Beyond that, there is very little data about what lies beneath the coastal plain.
A proposal for new, more sophisticated seismic studies to begin last winter was delayed in part because of work to determine how it could be done with minimal harm to wildlife. The project was shelved earlier this year, but the Interior Department expects that it will be revived this winter. Another proposal, for aerial studies that would provide some information about conditions below the surface of the coastal plain, went nowhere.
What's the latest?
Under federal environmental protection laws, the Bureau of Land Management had to file an environmental impact statement for the lease-sale plan. It filed a draft last December, and after receiving and reviewing about 1.1 million comments and holding hearings in Alaska and Washington, it released the final statement on Thursday.
The draft report had outlined several possibilities for lease sales, largely involving how much of the coastal plain would be opened to development. The final report recommends the broadest approach, allowing drilling rights for most of the acreage to be sold.
At a news conference Thursday, Chad Padgett, Alaska state director of the Bureau of Land Management, said that a decision on how much acreage would be offered for sale was not yet final. But the recommendation, he said, "presents the best balanced approach both to development and environmental concerns such as resource protection." Mr. Padgett said that it included protections for polar bears, caribou and other wildlife.
Oil industry representatives and members of Alaska's Congressional delegation hailed the report. Environmental groups and some Congressional Democrats immediately objected to it, saying that among other things it ignored most of the potential impacts, including the harm to wildlife. It also did not take into account the future effects of climate change on the region, they said.
Also on Thursday, the Democrat-controlled House approved legislation that would halt the lease-sale plan. But it is not expected to survive the Senate, where Republicans are in the majority.
A 30-day comment period now starts following the release of the environmental impact statement. Once completed, the Interior Department will issue a "record of decision," with the lease sales starting after that, most likely in December, the usual month for oil-leasing activity in Alaska. But the eventual outcome remains uncertain, as environmental groups are expected to file court challenges to the plan. And if leases are sold, exploration or production work will require further environmental reviews.

Texto completo: Once upon a time, romantic comedies promised viewers “happily ever after.” But now, in the thick of a rom-com renaissance, TV series are questioning the sentiment, becoming less interested in fairy-tale endings than the challenges of modern love.
From “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” – about a 1950s housewife-turned-stand-up-comedian – to “Fleabag” – about an irreverent Londoner who falls for a Catholic priest – a number of recent entries in the genre confront that fanciful notion in favor of another, more realistic feeling: uncertainty.
“Traditionally, the stories present a relationship like some sort of destination or achievement, but it’s not my experience of the world,” said Aline Brosh McKenna, who wrote “The Devil Wears Prada” and “27 Dresses” and co-created the CW’s romantic musical comedy “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” which completed its four-season run this year. “When your girlfriend gets engaged, you’re not like, ‘You did it! You won!’ and if they get divorced, you’re not walking around saying, ‘That’s it, you ... up your entire life.’”
“Relationships are wonderful, but there’s a lot that goes into being in a romantic relationship that’s past the ‘Cinderella’ kiss, which just started to really seem like bull ... to people,” she continued. “I think now, people are a little more interested in what happens after that.”
Which means rethinking the “after,” exchanging the widely accepted ideal of children’s stories for the uncomfortable truth that there is no relationship or job that guarantees indefinite bliss. In life as on screen, people are simply doing their best, putting one foot in front of the other and hoping it works out. These rom-coms embrace fickleness, indecision, doubt – an appealing angle for contemporary viewers, especially in the current climate.
TV Land’s series “Younger” has done this with aplomb. For five seasons, Sutton Foster’s Liza – a 40-year-old single mother posing as a 26-year-old to get an entry-level job in publishing – has been romantically bouncing between her young, tattooed boyfriend, Josh (Nico Tortorella), and her age-appropriate, buttoned-up boss, Charles (Peter Hermann), who’s shared many of the same life experiences as she has. In the logic of the series, though, there’s no obvious right answer, no “one true person” with whom she should be. That authentic lack of resolution, season after season, has kept audiences tuned in.
“One thing I think the characters in this show learn is that one person doesn’t check every box,” “Younger” creator Darren Star told The Times. “These men represent two different viable choices for her, but with any one person, you can’t have everything. And I just have to say for the record: These two guys aren’t the only fish in the sea.”
Last season’s climactic finale shattered that love triangle: Liza had left Josh, Charles left his job, and the two confessed their relationship to their friends and colleagues.
Throughout its sixth season, which ends Wednesday, “Younger” has illustrated that choosing to be with a person is not the end of a story – it’s a ripe beginning. Charles and Liza butt heads over professional and personal matters. They have trouble explaining their newly public status. They disagree on fundamental issues. And many times Liza has doubted her decision.
That instability, though terrifying in real life, is a bottomless well for the storytelling in “Younger.” “We took up what we thought of as a basic, and kind of a gimmicky, premise, and we’ve really evolved beyond it,” said Star of Liza’s initial lie. “At this point, everyone knows, and it’s no longer what’s driving the show.
“Ultimately, the show is about a woman who did everything she did because her career is what was important to her. She wasn’t pursuing a man, she was pursuing a job. It’s very much a romantic comedy that has real professional stakes to it. These are all characters who are not prioritizing romance over career.” Indeed, American women’s definition of “happily ever after” appears to be evolving as well. Pew Research Center reports that Americans are staying single longer (the median age at first marriage is 30 years for men and 28 years for women, its highest point on record). They’re also having fewer children: The country’s fertility rate reached a record low in 2018 for the second consecutive year, according to the New York Times.
While there are numerous theories for the rom-com revival – they’re more inclusive across race, gender and sexual orientation; they’re flipping the genre’s tropes on their heads; and they’re an increasingly large component of Netflix’s programming – all share the same fundamental insight: If the romantic comedy is to remain one of pop culture’s dominant forms, it will have to channel the changing priorities of its historically female-skewing audience. (Of course, these shows are about affluent white women, for whom “uncertainty” may not mean what it does to others: Hollywood still has a long way to go before the realistic anxieties of working women and women of color are central to the romantic comedy.)
Amazon Prime’s “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” currently filming its third season, achieves this goal by beginning its adventures where rom-coms traditionally end: after the wedding. Rachel Brosnahan’s exemplary 1950s housewife Miriam (nicknamed Midge) seemed to have “happily ever after” stitched into the fabrics of her New York City apartment, but the facade fell away quickly amid her husband’s insecurities and infidelity. She then discovered a new kind of happiness in stand-up.
Though she’s dated other men since her initial split, a different kind of triangle has emerged: among Midge, her budding career and her ex-husband, Joel (Michael Zegen), to whom she’s occasionally returned over the two seasons. The final frames of the Season 2 finale had the lovebirds rejoicing at their latest reunion, while those who prefer her professional endeavors sighed at the slip-up. Likewise, the ABC comedy “Bless This Mess” stars Lake Bell and Dax Shepard as Rio and Mike, a couple who left New York City life behind for a rural paradise in Nebraska. They initially brag that they’ve been married a year and have never fought but without the constant distractions of city life, they start to see each other a bit more clearly. Farming frustrations and unwelcoming neighbors don’t help.
While TV shows have always poked fun at marriage woes, “Bless This Mess” – which returns for a second season Sept. 24 – has been quietly radical in that their newlywed narratives are not interwoven with kid-centric story lines. The series’ first six episodes zoom in on the tender time after vows are exchanged, when sources of conflict aren’t just tough jobs and overbearing mother-in-laws but also a partner’s isolating pride or paralyzing self-doubt – abstract but still very real adversaries.
And then, of course, there is “Fleabag,” the second and final season of which was released on Amazon this year. Its six episodes did indeed tell “a love story,” as creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s titular lead promises viewers, breaking the fourth wall with a smile. Audiences watched her pursue a fraught relationship with a priest (Andrew Scott) – someone who saw her fully and completely and loved her for it. But he loved God too. “Fleabag” did not end with a freeze frame, in which Waller-Bridge and Scott hugged, kissed and grinned about their shared future together. It ended with a second split: between Fleabag and her audience, as she shook her head, flashed a wry smile and gave us a little wave goodbye. The conclusion was a perfectly executed example of the modern romantic comedy’s approach to endings. The season’s romantic tension doesn’t suffer from the lack of a pat resolution; it benefits from it, because it’s true to the lived experience of love.
“Not every romantic story has to have a happy ending,” Cathy Schulman, executive producer of “The Edge of Seventeen,” told The Times. “We can still do romance with different kinds of endings, endings that are satisfying and still let the characters overcome their obstacles and achieve their goal. But it doesn’t have to mean they jump into a lifelong relationship.
“The genre format has largely been this idea of: girl meets boy, they don’t realize they’re right for each other, they figure it out, boy runs after train to get girl. It’s ridiculous and outdated and not artistic,” she continued. “What we can do is conjoin the romance and the comedy: Romance will always be a part of our lives, and comedy about people is what matters. We just have to find ways to celebrate that without falling into the trap of an outdated genre format that we, as audiences, don’t even want to see.”

Whicker: A trace of drugs adds up to a gallon of doubt for a sport that keeps shooting itself in the hoof

Texto completo: Let’s suspend reality for a nanosecond.
Let’s say that a horse can test positive as soon as he crosses the finish line, and the trainer has no recourse to call for a second test, and the results can flash on the board right then and there.
Justify wins and then is disqualified at the 2018 Santa Anita Derby on April 7, 2018.
Since Justify had only run two races previously, trainer Bob Baffert has to scramble to find a race that allows enough points to qualify for the Kentucky Derby on May 5.
That doesn’t work, and Justify has to wait until the Preakness. He’s able to run there because only eight horses have entered a field that can stretch to 14. He wins the Preakness, then the Belmont.
The stud fees for Justify still don’t project high enough for his many owners. So he returns in 2019. He wins the Pegasus at Gulfstream Park, and he runs away with the Pacific Classic at Del Mar.
By now Justify has built the renown that lures the civilian fan into the seats. In a triumphant return, he dominates the Breeders’ Cup Classic at Santa Anita and is carried into the barn, amid rose petals and trumpets, to denote his early retirement.
But reality is the enemy of thoroughbred racing, as we know. This week brought an asterisk to Justify’s Triple Crown run that can’t be erased from the procreation station, unfairly or not.
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Justify tested positive for scopolamine, which reduces motion sickness in human beings, after he won the Santa Anita Derby by three lengths. The machinery of drug testing did not allow a positive test to return before the Kentucky Derby. Therefore, Justify ran and won and did not test positive there. The same was true of the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.
No one at Churchill Downs knew of the test, but a track spokesman said Justify and the others were tested prior to the race. Baffert, as is his right, asked for another test, and when those results were positive, the California Horse Racing Board basically tabled the issue, and the public never knew until the news was fit to print.
The Times quoted Dr. Rick Sams, the director of LGC Science, a drug testing lab in Lexington, Ky. Sams said that Justify had 300 nanograms per milliliter of scopolamine in his system, five times the legal limit. Such a reading, Sams said, could make Justify’s breathing more efficient and therefore enhance his performance.
Never mind that Justify somehow went unbeaten without this surfeit of nanograms.
The CHRB decided that Justify took in scopolamine through Jimson weed, which sometimes gets into the feed or the straw. It decided Justify did not get the drug through Buscopan, which trainers sometimes use to fend off colic.
Horses in three other barns also ingested scopolamine during this period. Dr. Rick Arthur, the CHRB’s equine medical director, found that Justify and those others had atropine in their system. Buscopan does not contain both atropine and scopolamine, but Jimson weed does.
That means Justify likely suffered “environmental contamination,” similar to Canelo Alvarez’s suspension for eating steroid-riddled steaks. That prompted what the French might call a “spectacle de matieres fecales” in boxing. It dissipated, too.
The CHRB has not disqualified a horse for scopolamine in 12 years. In 1994 five trainers were fined, including Mark Hennig, whose Lady Blessington won the Buena Vista Handicap. An administrative law judge rescinded those fines, but the disqualifications and the forfeiture of the purse stood.
What’s a nanogram? It’s a billionth of a gram. We get numbed by the billions that are thrown around. If one were to log a billion miles by following the equator, one would encircle the earth 40,000 times. If one traveled from the Earth to Saturn when they are closest together, one would have to travel 256 million more miles to reach a billion.
It’s difficult to accept that 240 more billionths of a gram would decide a horse race.
But it’s easier to understand why people think Baffert, the face or at least the hair of the sport, is being coddled.
One rule should pass immediately: No California Horse Racing Board member should have any business connection with anyone in the sport, the way Madeline Auerbach owns a horse with Stronach Group COO Tim Ritvo, the way Chuck Winner had an interest in horses Baffert trained. You don’t need test results for that. It’s California government. Divestiture is the least it should demand.
That would help the sport get from beyond repair to beyond reproach. Granted, it sometimes seems a billion-mile trip.

Leonard Pitts: ‘Respectfully request’ isn’t quite enough

Texto completo: In 1879, on the road leading into Dodge City, there stood a sign. “The Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited,” it said.
As recounted in the book “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America” by Adam Winkler, the gun control ordinance was the first law passed when the city was organized in 1873. Nor was Dodge unique. Many other western towns, Wichita and Tombstone among them, had similar laws.
<img class="size-full wp-image-2657490" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Leonard-Pitts-Color.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="193" />
The statutes don’t seem to have been particularly controversial. Though Dodge City was, by reputation if not always in actual fact, one of the toughest and most lawless places on the frontier, cowboys had no problem walking unarmed into its brothels and saloons. Yet in 2019, many of us feel the need to take guns into Walmart.
Worse, they’re allowed to do so under permissive “open carry” laws which, in most states, give people the right to bear handguns and even long guns in public. But now Walmart is fighting back. Sort of.
Last week, the giant retailer announced that it was “respectfully requesting” that people not bring guns into its stores. This, on the heels of last month’s racist mass shooting — 22 people died — at a Walmart in El Paso. Other companies, including Kroger, CVS and Walgreens, quickly followed suit. The New York Times notes that still more companies — Starbucks, Target and Chipotle among them — already had such policies in place. Most used the same word Walmart did to couch their requests: “respectfully.”
To say “it’s about time” is to understate. Years of living in the shadow of massacres has left us a nation on tenterhooks, 330 million people all sharing the same case of PTSD. One recalls the panicked stampede in Times Square last month when motorcycles backfired. One observes that children are being sent back to school this year with bulletproof backpacks. And one is glad businesses are willing to “respectfully request.”

But they must do more.
The idea of a cowboy walking without his revolver down the wooden sidewalks of Tombstone stands in rather pointed contrast to that of some accountant waiting in line at a suburban Starbucks with an AR-15 slung across his back. One can imagine no more vivid illustration of the absurdist dystopia this country has become as a result of the NRA, its GOP toadies and their conviction that all people must have access to all guns in all places at all times.
If you’re sitting in a movie theater or standing in a checkout line and some stranger walks by carrying a military grade rifle, do you feel safer or do you start looking for the exit? The answer is obvious: this is not a scenario that instills a sense of security.
So it’s good to see American business taking a stand American lawmakers won’t, the marketplace of commerce reaching a consensus the marketplace of ideas can’t. That said, this polite pleading is not enough. Asked about Walmart’s policy, even David Amad, a gun rights activist in Texas, told the Times, “They are ducking the issue.”
Which they are. Walmart and other retailers seek a path of least resistance that will relieve them of the responsibility of taking a stand. But no such path exists: sides must be chosen and lines must be drawn, because this is, quite literally, a matter of life and death. And death and death and death. As a private entity, Walmart, like CVS, Starbucks and Kroger, can simply say, Do not bring guns into our stores. They have that power and they must use it. The majority of us who want gun sanity in this land must require them to. They’ve made their “respectful request.”
We must answer with an impatient demand.

Texto completo: A day after the New York Times reported that 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify tested positive for a banned substance in the run-up to the Kentucky Derby, the Maryland Jockey Club said that the Bob Baffert-trained colt was clean in pre- and post-race drug tests for the 143rd Preakness.
Earlier Thursday, Churchill Downs Racetrack released a similar statement saying that Justify had come up clean on pre- and post-race tests for the 2018 Kentucky Derby.
The Times reported that Justify tested positive for the banned substance Scopolamine after his victory in the Santa Anita Derby on April 7, 2018. If he had been disqualified from that prep race, he would not have qualified for the Kentucky Derby field. The Times reported that the California Horse Racing Board dismissed the case four months later in a closed-door session.
Baffert released a statement Thursday saying he did not give Scopolamine to Justify and blaming the positive test on "environmental contamination" related to jimson weed, "a naturally growing substance in areas where hay and straw are produced in California."
W. Craig Robertson III, an attorney for Baffert, also issued a statement criticizing the Times story as "long on sensationalism, short on facts."
The Maryland Jockey Club statement read: "Justify, as with every horse who raced in the 2018 Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, MD, was subjected to pre-race drug testing by the Maryland Racing Commission. Justify, as the winner of the 143rd Preakness, along with several other horses who competed, also received extensive post-race testing by that same body. The Maryland Jockey Club was informed that all of those tests came back negative for any illicit substance or for the overages of any prohibited medication."
In his fifth race in 90 days, Justify held on by a half-length to win the second leg of the Triple Crown at Pimlico Race Course on May 19, 2018. Justify won the Belmont Stakes three weeks later to become the 13th Triple Crown winner in history. Baffert became the second trainer to win two Triple Crowns, capturing his first with American Pharoah in 2015.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Federal prosecutors recommended seeking criminal charges against Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI and a frequent target of criticism by President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision Thursday.
McCabe was fired from the FBI just before his retirement in March 2018 after the Justice Department's internal watchdog concluded that he improperly authorized a leak about a federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign.
The U.S. attorney in Washington, Jessie Liu, recommended moving forward with unspecified charges against McCabe, according to people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to comment publicly.
Whether McCabe is indicted will be up to a federal grand jury in Washington. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington declined to comment.
The recommendation that McCabe be charged is the latest fallout from the FBI's handling of investigations around the 2016 presidential election, when agents investigated both of the major-party candidates. Those investigations – into Russian meddling to help Trump win the presidency and Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server – inserted the FBI into the center of fraught political controversies.
Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe after a Justice Department Inspector General's report found he misstated his involvement in a leak to The Wall Street Journal days before the election about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation. He was ousted days before he could begin collecting retirement benefits.
McCabe, who became acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017, has been the target of the president's attacks. Trump accused law enforcement officials of partisan investigations of him, his campaign and his administration. Inquiries led to charges against six of Trump's aides and advisers.
The election-year investigations roiled the top ranks of the FBI. Internal investigators faulted McCabe and Comey for violating Justice Department rules in the final months of the campaign. Lower-level staffers were fired or reassigned.
The Justice Department said Aug. 29 that Comey violated bureau policies for keeping private memos about his conversations with Trump, then having a friend describe the contents of one memo to The New York Times. The department didn't charge Comey criminally.
McCabe's firing came after the inspector general investigated the information behind a Wall Street Journal story about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether it was an unauthorized leak and if so, who was the source.
Investigators determined that McCabe, to promote his impartiality, authorized associates to disclose a call Aug. 12 between McCabe and the principal associate deputy attorney general to The Wall Street Journal.
The inspector general found McCabe "lacked candor" when he said he hadn't authorized the disclosure.

CNN tries to blame Trump for Obama administration's leaks The network's Russian spy story leaves out key context about Obama aides' actions. before the spy's exfiltration.

Texto completo: Here's some advice for the media covering President Trump: If you don't want to be accused of reporting fake news, don't report fake news.
Case in point: On Monday, CNN correspondent Jim Sciutto reported that a highly placed U.S. intelligence source inside the Kremlin was pulled "in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy." Sciutto continued, "The decision to carry out the extraction occurred soon after a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump discussed highly classified intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak ... (that) had been provided by Israel."
Sorry, the decision to extract the source was first made before Trump took office, and the reason was mishandling of classified intelligence not by Trump, but by the Obama administration. As The New York Times reports this week, "CIA officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia." What prompted that decision? Leaks about the covert source's reporting that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered and orchestrated Russia's election interference campaign.
The impetus for the extraction decision was a Dec. 14, 2016, NBC News report that "two senior officials with direct access to the information" said that Putin personally directed Russia's election interference and that "the intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies, the officials said." NBC added that this new intelligence showing Putin's direct involvement went much further than the information the U.S. was relying when all 17 intelligence agencies issued a report in October holding Russia responsible for the Democratic National Committee hack, and that "now the U.S has solid information tying Putin to the operation."
This leak exposed the fact that the CIA had a spy in Putin's orbit who was passing on intelligence about the Russian president's decision making. Who leaked the information? Two senior Obama administration officials. The Times reports that Obama CIA Director John Brennan considered the Kremlin source's reporting "so delicate, and the need to protect the source's identity so important," that he kept his reports out of the President's Daily Brief and sent them to Obama in "special sealed envelopes." The Daily Brief is already one of the most restricted U.S. government documents, so the sealed reports were restricted to an even smaller circle of senior Obama aides. Yet the leak, according to NBC, came from officials "with direct access to the information." Which Obama aide leaked it? This much is certain: It was not Donald Trump.
It was after this Obama administration leak that the CIA decided to pull the source. The reason he was not actually pulled at the time is that he initially refused - a decision that The Times reports raised concerns that "the informant had been turned and had become a double agent." Eventually, the source changed his mind. But the decision was made before Trump came to office.
That's not all. CNN falsely reported that the source was pulled after Trump's meeting with Russia officials in which he shared intelligence on Syria that was "provided by Israel." But as I pointed out in May 2017, Trump did not reveal to that Israel was the source of the intelligence. That classified information was revealed to The Times by what the paper described "a current and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information." Any former official familiar with that intelligence was from the Obama administration. Even Brennan, the Obama CIA director and virulent Trump critic, admitted that Trump was not to blame and said that "the real damage to national security is ... what was leaked in the aftermath, what was put in the media."
So, CNN tried to blame Trump for the loss of a Kremlin source, when it was really the Obama administration that was responsible for the leaks that burned him - and did so citing a leak that did not come from Trump at all, but most likely from a former Obama official. Talk about fake news! Yet despite all this, CNN has not pulled its "fake news" story. Indeed, Sciutto still has it proudly pinned at the top of the Twitter feed. What a disgrace.

Texto completo: Think what you like about today's political world, no one is likely to say it suffers from a lack of professional pundits. So why is it we walk out of "Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins" wishing like hell that she was alive to give us her very particular take on the times we live in.
That's because, as depicted in this sprightly, fast-paced documentary directed by Janice Engle, Ivins was a one-of-a-kind commentator who was both smart and savagely funny, using a take-no-prisoners sense of humor to eviscerate those she felt abused the public trust.
Having met Dan Quayle, she tells one interviewer, she found him "dumber than advertised. If you put that man's brain in a bumblebee, it would fly backwards."

Making these kinds of remarks go down easy was Ivins' unmistakable personal style and sense of fun. Six feet tall with a great ear-to-ear grin, Ivins made being unapologetic so much her trademark her first best-selling book was titled simply "Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She?"
A native Texan with the engaging accent to prove it, Ivins was also someone who loved a good time, a big drinker (which eventually proved to be a problem) who could carouse with the best of them and often did.
By far the biggest pleasure of "Raise Hell" is listening to its subject do exactly that. Though she died of breast cancer at age 62 in 2007, footage of Ivins giving speeches and being interviewed on camera is plentiful and always entertaining.
"Holding people to contempt and ridicule is what I do," she proclaims, and she took pride that when the Dallas Times Herald, where she worked for 10 years, took a poll on its best-loved and most-hated columnists, she won both titles.
But "Raise Hell" does more than allow us to bask in Ivins' trademark attitude and humor; it shows us how she got that way and explores the toll that being the public Molly Ivins took on her personal life.
Though she ended up a liberal stalwart, Ivins grew up among the Texas elite in the River Oaks section of Houston, so addicted to nonstop reading in the attic that her family nicknamed her "the mole."
Ivins' father was an autocratic right-wing oil man, and the battles between them, the writer's brother and sister report, were epochal. "My teenage rebellion," Ivins reports tartly, "lasted 35 years."
Journalism caught Ivins' fancy early on as a way, she hoped, "to have fun and do good and raise hell all the time."
She was the first female police reporter at the Minneapolis Tribune, but her career really took off when she was hired to co-edit Austin's iconoclastic Texas Observer.
Because she both knew her home state and had an acerbic eye, Ivins turned out to be a natural at covering Texas politics, where her outsider point of view made an interesting combination with her good-old-boy willingness to hang out with the gang.
One of the friends Ivins made was Ann Richards, who went on to become a formidable governor of Texas, and the clip "Raise Hell" shows of the two of them pitilessly needling each other at a roast is priceless.
Journalism buffs will be especially interested in Ivins' tales of her time at the august New York Times, where she wrote Elvis Presley's obituary and frequently clashed with autocratic editor Abe Rosenthal.
Rosenthal eventually exiled Ivins to Denver where, as she liked to tell it, she was "the Rocky Mountain bureau chief and the bureau."
A carte blanche offer from the Times Herald lured her to Dallas, but it was her books, and her gift for all things Texas, that propelled her to the national stage when George W. Bush, whom she nicknamed "Shrub," became president.
"Raise Hell" is not heavy on Ivins' personal life, but it does talk about her problem with alcohol and the stress that went with, in effect, having to turn herself into a professional Texan.
Above all, it becomes clear, Molly Ivins believed in democracy. She felt this country belonged to all of us, with politicians, even the best, simply "the people we hire to drive the bus."

A leap to the present, via the past

Texto completo: TORONTO - "Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?"
That's a quote from "Joker," which made its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this week. But the quip, uttered by Joaquin Phoenix in a bent, bravura performance as the DC Comics villain in his early years, could easily be a tagline for the festival itself.
A bewildering outside world - and how best to diagnose and deal with it - was the cardinal theme of a festival dominated by filmmakers who, however far-flung and temperamentally disparate, repeatedly attempted to meet a political and cultural moment so confounding that it defies traditional genres and categorizations.
Deeply serious issues weren't just the stuff of sober biopics and staid period pieces but of uproarious comedy. Portraits of male-female relationships and power differentials took he said/she said to new levels of introspection and acute insight.
Most notably, the recent and not-so-recent past was revisited again and again, not to exploit simple nostalgia but to illuminate present-day realities that hovered over nearly every movie - whether fiction or nonfiction, polemic or pure escapism.
Rather than garden-variety revivals, the festival's most spectacular comebacks - from the likes of Renée Zellweger ("Judy"), Jamie Foxx ("Just Mercy") and Eddie Murphy ("Dolemite Is My Name") - felt like exceptionally timely reinventions. Jennifer Lopez doesn't just strut her formidable stuff with disarming brio in the frisky caper flick "Hustlers"; she helps deliver a convincing - and thoroughly entertaining - denunciation of Wall Street malfeasance, misogynist impunity and wealth inequality. In stilettos and a G-string.
Similarly, "Joker," which became Toronto's hottest ticket after winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, plays like more than just another comic book origin story, becoming a gritty urban allegory about the pent-up rage of aggrieved young men that can easily ignite into a destructive, nihilistic movement. "Knives Out," Rian Johnson's witty whodunit featuring a wonderfully game all-star cast, isn't just a delightful update on Agatha Christie but an unveiled critique of President Trump, from his nativist immigration policies to his dubious claims of being "self-made" despite a million-dollar loan from his father. Even "Ford v Ferrari," James Mangold's propulsive drama about a pivotal Le Mans motor race in 1966, had an indie-vs.-corporate subtext, which co-star Matt Damon described at a Q&A as a "one-to-one comparison" with filmmakers battling risk-averse studios.
Noah Baumbach's "Marriage Story," which stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson as a divorcing couple, plays like an uncanny bookend to Norwegian director Maria Sodahl's "Hope," in which the same narrative - of an embittered wife who has sacrificed her creativity on the altar of her husband's career - feels like a continuation of countless recent conversations about thwarted female ambition and uncomprehending male privilege. Even "Judy," in which Zellweger channels a middle-aged Judy Garland with startling ferocity and vulnerability, contains flashbacks of studio chief Louis B. Mayer gaslighting the actress as a young girl, in what can only be described as a proto-#MeToo moment.
The most audacious Toronto premiere by far was also the most divisive. "Jojo Rabbit," a comedy written and directed by Taika Waititi in which he appears as a goofy (yes, goofy) Adolf Hitler during the waning days of World War II, was seen by some critics as crossing the line in its sendup of anti-Semitic tropes at their most ludicrously deranged. But its protagonist, a young German boy who worships the Fuhrer, also serves as a vivid reminder, not just of the dangers of blind devotion to a demagogue, but of the human capacity to reclaim one's moral center.
In both its irreverent tone and sharp satiric eye, "Jojo Rabbit" most closely recalled the work of Armando Iannucci, who debuted a similarly revisionist flight of fancy in the form of "The Personal History of David Copperfield," an exuberantly pluralistic reimagining of the Charles Dickens classic. Just as inventive - and gently meaningful - was "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood," beautifully directed by Marielle Heller to evoke both the imaginative world and deep spiritual work of children's television host Fred Rogers (convincingly played by Tom Hanks).
If those films took their share of formal risks in bringing figures from the past to life, others - such as "Just Mercy," about criminal justice reform leader Bryan Stevenson, and "Harriet," about Underground Railroad conductor Harriet Tubman - played it straight and somber. Edward Norton looked to film noir and the career of the ruthless urban planner Robert Moses as inspiration for his adaptation of "Motherless Brooklyn," while screenwriter Scott Z. Burns addressed different forms of corruption in "The Laundromat" (about the money-laundering schemes revealed in the Panama Papers) and "The Report," about the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation of the CIA's use of torture in the war on terror.
Even though these narratives took place in the past, each one felt pointedly focused on the anxieties and aspirations of today, a fact that Burns - who makes his directorial debut with "The Report" - readily recognized. "We're surrounded by a world that has changed a lot over the last couple of years," he explained during a brief interview at the festival. "The themes of accountability in government and transparency are in both of those movies, and without them, we're going to keep going down this really unjust, corrupt path. I can't say that those were conscious choices, but obviously those are things I've been thinking about."
The state of things was clearly also on the mind of Matt Tyrnauer, whose documentary "Where's My Roy Cohn?" examines the life and career of the notorious attorney as a critical lens on his most famous protege, who now occupies the Oval Office. Introducing "Letter to the Editor," a swiftly moving collage composed of more than 1,700 New York Times photographs, filmmaker Alan Berliner explained that he decided to pay tribute to his cherished hometown newspaper after "struggling to find the role and responsibility of the artist" at a time when daily journalism is undergoing both technological upheaval and political attack.
Even Truman Capote, who died in 1984, had something relevant to say. In the graceful and revelatory documentary "The Capote Tapes," first-time filmmaker Ebs Burnough - who served as deputy social secretary and senior adviser to the first lady during the Obama administration - used hours of interviews recorded by the late George Plimpton to create a hitherto unseen portrait of Capote. The late author emerges as the charismatic talk-show guest and gifted but troubled artist many will recognize, but also as a devoted father figure to Kate Harrington, who lived with Capote during her teenage years.
"It's a story about addiction," Burnough said after "The Capote Tapes" premiere. "It's a story about survival. It's a story about how you can be a very small, gay man born in a Southern town in the 1920s and really become who you want to be. I think so often we get caught up in telling stories that are current, and it's not that those stories aren't important. But we have to go back and learn from our past. I love going back and excavating those bones and those stories, because people have already lived what we're going through. It's not new. They can show us the way."

Texto completo: The documentary "Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins" starts with several colorful, barbed comments delivered by the late political commentator and newspaper columnist, one of which is in answer to a question from talk show host David Letterman. Letterman once asked Ivins what she thought of former vice president Dan Quayle. After recalling that she had traveled with Quayle during his 1988 campaign (where she says she found him "dumber than advertised"), Ivins quips that, "I honestly think if you put that man's brain in a bumblebee, it would fly backwards."
The put-down may not be her funniest, her sharpest or her most countrified zinger in the film - which includes plenty more like that - but it's emblematic of the way this outspoken champion of civil liberties and common sense put things in plain-spoken perspective. "Raise Hell" takes a thorough, if traditional, look at the Texas-born, Smith College-educated writer's life and career - a career that included stints at the New York Times and the Dallas Times Herald - and it includes interviews with her siblings, colleagues, friends and such media celebrities as Dan Rather and Rachel Maddow. But it is when Ivins herself opens her mouth that the film is at its best.
Whenever the movie presents archival clips from old interviews and lectures - or, as read by an actress, diary entries and letters - Ivins, who died in 2007 from breast cancer, comes alive. When she herself is on the screen, Ivins makes for the best company for whom you could wish, and it's easy to understand how the politicians she covered, on both sides of the aisle, liked to spend time with her.
Of course, those times were often spent drinking, and "Raise Hell" doesn't shy away from talking about Ivins's well-known alcoholism, or her belief that there is no such thing as objectivity in journalism, as long as you let the reader know where you stand. Other topics covered include accusations of censorship of the often controversial writer - a progressive in Texas, the reddest of red states. When she worked as a syndicated columnist, for instance, some of the film's interview subjects recall that newspapers would buy her column, preventing competing papers in the same market from doing so, only to withhold it from publication.
It's not hard to see why we might need to be reminded of a voice like Ivins's again. With free speech under attack, and truth-telling seemingly in short supply, "Raise Hell" offers an entertaining and bracing look at one of journalism's least punch-pulling practitioners.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidates at the debate Thursday made a big show about how tough they wanted to get on guns. Beto O'Rourke said he would confiscate thousands of them. Yet not a single one of them admitted the truth about real gun "violence."
The bulk of the violence that involves a gun is suicide.
The New York Times reported on it in 2018, "More people died from firearm injuries in the United States last year than in any other year since at least 1968, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention." The crucial point is this (emphasis added): "There were 39,773 gun deaths in 2017, up by more than 1,000 from the year before. Nearly two-thirds were suicides. It was the largest yearly total on record in the C.D.C.’s electronic database, which goes back 50 years, and reflects the sheer number of lives lost."
Would suicides go down if we took away all guns? Maybe some, or maybe the vast majority will find another way to kill themselves.
Democrats never talk about suicide, though. Because they say guns, not "mental health" are the problem. Numbers say otherwise.

Hong Kong's summer of heroic dissent

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- The masked men who recently tossed firebombs at Jimmy Lai's home targeted one of this city's foremost democracy advocates. Lai, a 71-year-old media billionaire, calls this summer's ongoing protest "a martyrdom movement" and "a last-straw movement." It has an intensity and dynamic that bewilders the protesters' opponents in Beijing and in Hong Kong's Beijing-obedient city administration.
Today's mostly young protesters will be middle-aged in 2047, at the expiration of the 50-year agreement that ostensibly accords Hong Kong protected status as an island of freedom. Beijing attempted to whittle away that status with a proposed 2003 law against "subversion." And by devaluing suffrage by the 2014 requirement that candidates for the chief-executive receive approval from a Beijing-loyal committee. And by this year's extradition bill that would have facilitated sweeping Hong Kongers into the maw of China's opaque criminal-justice system.
Monday's New York Times carried a full-page ad paid for by "the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China." Which means, effectively, by the Chinese Communist Party. The ad said: "We are resolutely committed to 'One Country, Two Systems' which provides the constitutional guarantee for Hong Kong's continued development and success as a free and open society." The ad pledged "dialogue to talk through differences and look for common ground with no preconditions."
But the "one county, two systems" formulation, agreed to in 1997, when British authority ended, as a 50-year framework for Hong Kong's relations with the PRC, is an inherently menacing precondition. And Beijing's consistently sinister behavior reveals a determination, as implacable as it is predictable, to incrementally nullify "one nation, two systems" by reducing Hong Kong to just another jurisdiction wholly subservient to China's deepening tyranny.
For Leninists such as Xi Jinping wielding a party-state, nothing is more important than the party's unchallenged primacy. Another "Tiananmen Square" -- a Hong Kong massacre -- would be calamitous for China's Leninists, but less so than weakening the Communist Party's primacy. The party is, Lai says, "detached from reality" and "will always make the wrong decision" as it tries to become "the most absolute dictatorship in human history."
In 1940, Winston Churchill warned against "a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science." That is China's aspiration with "digital Leninism," an application of science through manipulative technologies that neither Churchill nor his contemporary, George Orwell, anticipated. With a steadily refined repression apparatus, aptly called "cyber-totalitarianism," China's surveillance state is enmeshing everyone in a "social credit" system. Individuals' cumulative commercial and social-media transactions give them a score that determines their access to education, housing, clinics, travel and more, even including pet ownership. Although China's published statistics are as untrustworthy as the regime itself, there are reasons to believe that in this decade China has spent more on "stability maintenance" than on its military. Hong Kong is watching this.
And Hong Kong is reading Ma Jian's dystopian novel "China Dream," which is banned in mainland China but not here. The protagonist is Ma Daode, director of the fictional (so far) China Dream Bureau, which aspires to "replace all private dreams" with one communal dream. Ma Daode hopes to develop "a neural implant," a device whereby "just one click of a button and government directives will be transferred wirelessly into the brains" of the governed. This is not much more Orwellian than China's evolving reality.
In her 1951 "The Origins of Totalitarianism," Hannah Arendt argued that a tyrannical regime, wielding bureaucracy and mass media, could achieve permanence by conscripting the citizenry's consciousness. This echoed Orwell's foreboding: "Imagine a boot stamping on a human face -- forever." In 1956, Arendt thought her theory had been refuted by a fact -- the Hungarian Revolution, which demonstrated that no state can interrupt "all channels of communication." Hong Kong sees Beijing using new technologies in the service of an evil permanence.
"To see what is in front of one's nose," wrote Orwell, "needs a constant struggle." Belatedly, the world is seeing. The Economist recently editorialized: "The West's 25-year bet on China has failed." The wager was that "market totalitarianism" is an oxymoron. Embedding China in the global economy supposedly would open it to the softening effects of commerce, which would be solvents of authoritarianism. The West's tardy but welcome disenchantment is, as the Economist says, "the starkest reversal in modern geopolitics." If Hong Kong's heroic refusal to go gentle into Beijing's dark night is accelerating this disenchantment, the summer of dissent has been this decade's grandest and most important development.

Area fisherman lends helping hand Mills ties flies to assist Dorian victims in Bahamas

Texto completo: It was a simple calculation.
"My ability to tie flies and sell them far outpaces my ability to write big checks," Josh Mills said.
Last week Mills, an avid fly fisherman with a "decent" following on Instagram (3,395 followers) watched as Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas. As of Wednesday, about 2,500 people were still missing, with at minimum 50 deaths. Thousands of homes were destroyed and flooding left the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama Island "nearly uninhabitable," the New York Times reported Wednesday.
Mills has never been to the Bahamas, but the archipelago south of Miami has world-class fly fishing. In fact, angling (and tourism in general) is the backbone of the island nations economy.
"They are not rich people," Mills said.
Mills was compelled to do something. He went to Instagram, writing that he would tie a dozen steelhead bugs and sell them to the highest bidder. All the money would go to relief efforts in the Bahamas.
He tagged it "#dozenfordorian." At first, Mills hoped he could raise $1,000. That quickly proved an unambitious goal.
This is what happened: Some of Mills' friends who work in the fly fishing industry, including well-known photographer Bryan Gregson, shared it with their followers. The entire effort was boosted further when "MeatEater" founder Steven Rinella and others auctioned off flies they tied. Soon, anglers around the country were tying flies and auctioning them off.
By the end of the first day, folks had pledged more than $2,000. As of Wednesday, that had grown to more than $20,000.
"I threw a spark on a bunch of gasoline," Mills said.
The money is going directly to Yellow Dog Community and Conservation Foundation. The YDCCF is the nonprofit arm of the for-profit Yellow Dog Fly-fishing Adventures, a Bozeman-based booking service that has worked in the Bahamas for decades.
Dillon Gruber, associate director of Yellow Dog Adventures, said that YDCCF (the nonprofit) is sending money to fishermen and guides who, in many cases, have lost everything.
"None of the money that we're raising is going to the lodges," said Gruber. "It's going to maybe a guide and his family who maybe lost his house and literally have nothing left."
Because of the nature of the fundraising effort, Mills isn't sure how much money has been pledged. Each evening he scrolls through the #dozenfordorian hashtag and tallies up the totals.
Mills said he's encouraged those who bid on flies to send their money directly to the YDCCF to avoid any "impropriety."
"It helps this community help a community," Mills said of the effort.

Texto completo: Justify failed a drug test one month before the 2018 Kentucky Derby, and the California Horse Racing Board decided to dismiss the case after the colt went on to win the Triple Crown, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
Justify tested positive for scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby in April '18, and qualifying for the Kentucky Derby in the process.
Scopolamine is a banned substance that can enhance performance. Such a result should have resulted in a disqualification, purse forfeiture and the removal of his Kentucky Derby entry. Instead, California regulators waited until April 26, nine days before the Kentucky Derby, to inform Bob Baffert, Justify's Hall of Fame trainer.
Baffert had a second sample tested by an independent lab, and it confirmed the results three days after Justify won the Kentucky Derby.
The board decided that the test results could have come from contaminated food. However, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission's former drug lab chief, Rick Sams, said the amount of scopolamine in Justify's system suggested it "has to come from intentional intervention."
Two months after dismissing the Justify case, the California board changed the penalty for a failed scopolamine test from a DQ to a fine and a possible suspension
Basketball: The U.S. was ousted from medal contention by France at the World Cup, failing to capture gold at a major tournament for the first time since the 2006 world championships. Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 16 rebounds and France beat the U.S. 89-79 in the World Cup quarterfinals in Dongguan, China. The U.S. had won 58 consecutive tournament games in FIBA and Olympic competition. It was bidding to become the first nation to win three consecutive World Cups. The U.S. already had qualified for next summer's Olympics in Tokyo.
College football: Tennessee sophomore CB Bryce Thompson was reinstated and will be allowed to practice. Thompson had been suspended indefinitely after an Aug. 24 arrest on a misdemeanor domestic assault charge.
Golf: Rory McIlroy was voted PGA Tour player of the year after posting the most top-10 finishes and winning the FedEx Cup. It's the third time McIlroy has won the Jack Nicklaus Award.
NHL: The Bruins signed coach Bruce Cassidy, 54, to a multiyear contract extension. Terms of the deal weren't available.

Texto completo: html> President Donald Trump crossed into literal old-man-yells-at-clouds territory with his one-man crusade to retroactively change the weather. For a while, it was all very amusing, in a baffling sort of way. But nobody’s laughing now. Inaccurate weather information can endanger lives. And new reports this week suggest that Trump was not only wrong, he and members of his administration also pressured scientists to back him and undercut the front-line weather forecasters at the National Weather Service.
"Sharpiegate" began with Trump's Sept. 1 tweet that Alabama was in the path of Hurricane Dorian. “In addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!”
Within 20 minutes, the National Weather Service in Birmingham, desperate not to cause unnecessary panic, sent out a tweet correcting the president’s error: “Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. ”
Mistakes like this can happen, especially when you are trying to get a handle on events in real time. The important thing is that those mistakes are corrected, as happened here. Anyone else would have shrugged their shoulders and moved on. Not Trump.
Weather forecasters were correct
A few days later, in a bizarre effort to convince America that Alabama really had been at risk from Hurricane Dorian, Trump appeared in the Oval Office with an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map that had been altered with a felt tip pen.
Even that wasn’t enough. Trump spent the week insisting again and again that he was right. All this culminated last Friday with an unsigned statement from NOAA that said Trump had been right on Sept. 1 and the National Weather Service was wrong. The statement pointed to models showing that, when Trump sent his tweet, there was a less than 10% probability of a tiny sliver of Eastern Alabama seeing winds of at least 39 miles per hour. So National Weather Service forecasters were absolutely correct to publicly contradict Trump’s freelance hurricane warning. It was shameful for NOAA to throw them under the bus because somebody was afraid of Trump. NOAA knows this perfectly well. There’s a reason the statement wasn’t signed.
You would have hoped that if there were one area of government activity immune to improper presidential influence, it would be predicting the weather, but no. In fact, new reports Wednesday in The Washington Post and The New York Times, citing unnamed senior administration officials and people familiar with the events, suggest that Trump himself, directly and indirectly, pressured his staff and appointees to contradict the Birmingham forecasters.
Trump's flagrant disregard for facts
All of this is cause for grave concern.
First, it’s a public display of Trump’s flagrant disregard for expertise and his refusal to admit error under any circumstances. It was amusing to see him show an old weather map hand-corrected with a Sharpie. Will he do the same thing with intelligence data regarding North Korea’s missile program? That wouldn’t be quite so hilarious. Second, Trump’s apparent willingness to force federal agencies like NOAA to publicly bend the truth in support of his favorite version of reality is unlikely to be limited to weather maps. Does anyone really think that he won’t apply the same pressures to the Bureau of Labor Statistics if the unemployment figures start to “contradict” him, or the Bureau of Economic Analysis if growth starts to slow?
Don't fall for it: Dismissing Trump as a crumbling, unfit fool will get us four more years.
Finally, it has become increasingly obvious over the past few weeks that there’s something very, very wrong with the president, and it’s getting worse. His obsession —there’s no other word for it — with convincing people that he was correct about Alabama being in Dorian’s path is deeply unsettling.
Politicization risk rises as 2020 nears
Perhaps most disturbing of all is Trump’s belief that his hand-corrected weather map would somehow be proof of something. This is delusional and pretty strong evidence of an inability to engage in critical thinking. His claim that he had never heard of an actual Category 5 hurricane even though there have been three other Category 5 hurricanes during his presidency is further evidence of serious cognitive dysfunction. Hurricane Michael was still a Category 5 hurricane when it made landfall in Florida. This isn’t the sort of thing a person forgets, especially a person in charge of disaster response.
A nation off-track: I've taught US government for 40 years. Thanks to Trump, I'm doubting the Founders' plan.
In an email to his staff that was later made public, Craig McLean, NOAA's assistant administrator for research, said he is investigating the "very concerning" episode. Beyond that, Sharpiegate gives Congress a perfect opportunity to pry the lid off the problem of improper presidential influence. There’s no classified data involved here, and even Trump can’t claim executive privilege over weather reports or efforts to get them changed after the fact. Trump’s willingness to politicize everything from the Justice Department to the National Weather Service is going to be an increasingly serious problem as we head into the 2020 election. Exposing the details of his efforts to influence NOAA to some congressional sunshine will send a message: There will be accountability, so mind what you do. Congress may not be able to stop Trump from lying. But maybe it can help ordinary federal employees stand up for the truth.

The 10 best new shows coming to TV this fall

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger. In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+. Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show." And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories.
Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny.
"The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons").
Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

Bret Stephens: Thank you, sort of, not really, John Bolton

Texto completo: Though he’ll get little credit and even less sympathy, there is a case to be made that John Bolton deserves the nation’s thanks for helping save us from at least three Trumpian near-disasters. For a man who held the office of national security adviser for just 17 months, this is no mean feat.
Whether it represents an accomplishment is another question.
The first averted disaster would have been an agreement with Kim Jong Un, nearly reached early this year in Hanoi, that would have traded solid U.S. economic and diplomatic concessions for slippery promises of North Korean nuclear disarmament. Presidential sycophants and GOP isolationists would also have cheered the deal, along with more than a few liberals. And Trump would have burnished his self-image as a worthy candidate for a Nobel Peace Prize.
He might have even gotten one. Imagine that.
Yet as with every past North Korean promise of denuclearization, the deal would have been a sham. Bolton stopped it by insisting on the North’s full and complete nuclear disarmament up front, a condition Kim could not accept because his regime cannot survive without its weapons. Bolton called Kim on his bluff and Trump on his illusion — if only for a time. That’s still something.
The second averted disaster would have been a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which Trump abruptly announced in December after a phone call with Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The withdrawal would have been a cynical betrayal of the Kurdish fighters without whom we could not have decimated ISIS. And it would have been an invitation for all the worst players in the region — Iran and its proxies, the Bashar Assad regime, the Erdogan regime, ISIS remnants — to fill the vacuum.
Bolton helped stop this, too, first by flatly contradicting the president, then by slowing the withdrawal of troops, then by maneuvering to get Britain and France to emplace forces of their own. The result is that U.S. forces still provide a tripwire against Assad, Erdogan and Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani while helping to protect the Kurds.
Finally, Bolton fought tooth and nail against the disastrous agreement that Trump came close to striking with the Taliban at a surprise Camp David summit planned for last weekend.
As I reported last month, the agreement — negotiated without the participation of the elected Afghan government — would have set a timetable for U.S. withdrawal to coincide with the U.S. election calendar. Other than a vague promise by the Taliban not to allow Afghanistan to again become a base for global jihad, it did not require the group to renounce its ties to al-Qaida or do much of anything except not attack our forces on the way out.
Avoiding that, too, is something, even if it took the Taliban’s murder of Sgt. First Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz in Kabul to drive Bolton’s point home to Trump. If the sergeant’s death prevents the U.S. from hastily abandoning Afghanistan’s 18 million women to the Taliban’s misogynistic barbarism, it will not have been in vain.
Bolton holds other hawkish views with which I usually agree, including his fervent opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and his thoughts on Vladimir Putin’s Russia. I also like Bolton personally. He has an impish humor, a first-class brain and a principled worldview based on a belief in America as the last best hope of earth.
For all that, I also think Bolton disserved his president, his country and himself.
He disserved the president because he went to work for a man whose core convictions — whether on U.S. commitments to NATO, or overtures to Iran, or relations with Russia — he knew he deeply opposed. Every president is entitled to candid advice. But presidents are also entitled to advisers who devote their energies to advancing the boss’ agenda, not to stymieing it.
He disserved the country by attempting to disguise the truth about the Trump presidency. His bureaucratic maneuvers may have prevented foreign policy fiascoes in North Korea, Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere, at least for the time being. But presidents usually get their way in foreign policy, especially if reelected. By sparing Americans from the consequences of Trump’s impulses, Bolton has made reelection likelier — and, in all likelihood, the very outcomes he labored to prevent.
And he has disserved himself. The manner in which Bolton was dismissed — straight out the door, without even the fig leaf of resignation — is of a piece with the trademark nastiness that has distinguished this president all his life. Bolton could have been under no illusions about the nature of the man he chose to serve. He did so anyway. Now he must be wondering: For what?
“He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas” is an adage at least as old as “Poor Richard’s Almanack.” John Bolton, like so many others before him, has risen up.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Tuesday fired his third national security adviser, John R. Bolton, as their positions on major foreign policy issues clashed, most recently on pursuing a peace plan with the Taliban.
The two men have regularly been at odds over how to take on major foreign policy challenges facing the United States. Mr. Bolton, a longtime national security hawk, held some views that contrasted with Mr. Trump's, favoring sanctions and pre-emptive military action against some countries even as the president pursued diplomacy.
And on Tuesday, the two men also disagreed on the circumstances of Mr. Bolton's ouster.
In a midday Twitter post, just 90 minutes before Mr. Bolton was scheduled to join Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for a briefing for reporters, Mr. Trump wrote that, on Monday night, he asked Mr. Bolton to submit his resignation and that Mr. Bolton complied Tuesday morning. But responding to a question from The New York Times via text, Mr. Bolton said he had offered Mr. Trump his resignation "last night without his asking," and submitted it in the morning.
Here are five countries that prompted policy disagreements between Mr. Trump, who has been reluctant to expand military America's footprint abroad, and Mr. Bolton during his 17 months in the post.
Afghanistan
Most recently, Mr. Bolton was the leading voice against negotiating a peace plan with the Taliban -- an idea supported by Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo with the goal of removing American troops from Afghanistan after almost 18 years of war. Mr. Trump went so far as to schedule negotiations to take place at Camp David over Labor Day weekend.
Mr. Bolton had argued that the United States could withdraw some troops from Afghanistan -- and keep one of the president's campaign promises -- without making a pact with members of a terrorist group.
Mr. Trump ultimately canceled the meeting, but aides in support of the negotiations blamed Mr. Bolton for public leaks about his opposition.
North Korea
Mr. Trump views one of his major foreign policy achievements to be the melting of tensions between the United States and North Korea. While Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he was "not happy" that North Korea chose to conduct weapons tests in May, he has played down their significance and said that the tests did not distill his optimism that the two countries could continue negotiations over American sanctions and the North's denuclearization efforts.
But Mr. Bolton saw no gray area in those tests and declared that they violated United Nations Security Council resolutions.
After Mr. Trump became the first sitting American president to set foot in North Korea when he met with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, in June, Mr. Bolton reacted angrily to a New York Times report about a possible agreement in which the United States would make concessions in exchange for North Korea freezing its nuclear activity. Mr. Bolton had long argued that North Korea should dismantle its entire nuclear program before getting any reward. But others in the administration, including the president, were open to considering a step-by-step process.
Iran
Long before he was Mr. Trump's national security adviser, Mr. Bolton had advocated military action against Iran. Mr. Trump has recently focused on a diplomatic approach to Iran, saying he was willing to meet with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran under the right circumstances. The meeting would be the first of its kind since the Tehran hostage crisis that began in 1979 and ended in 1981.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolton did agree on one major policy decision: withdrawing the United States from the Obama-era nuclear deal in May 2018. Tensions between the two countries have risen due to that decision and the crippling sanctions the United States reimposed on Iran. In June of this year, the president rejected a plan by his advisers, led by Mr. Bolton, to retaliate with military action after Iran shot down an American surveillance drone, saying that such an attack would have been disproportionate.
Venezuela
After the United States and allied countries declared that President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian government was illegitimate and threw their support behind the opposition movement led by Juan Guaidó, Mr. Trump grew frustrated that the efforts to push out Mr. Maduro had not met with immediate success.
The Trump administration learned it had less influence in the region than anticipated, leaving the White House-backed opposition in a stalemate with the Maduro government for months. Mr. Trump has questioned his administration's strategy there, while Mr. Bolton continued to push for more pressure from the United States, and in August said, "now is the time for action."
Russia
As recently as last month, Mr. Bolton assured Ukranians that they would receive support in their conflict with Russian separatists, but the White House has done little to show it backs that promise. In recent days, the White House has delayed a military assistance package for the Ukranian government. And Mr. Trump has privately told aides that he considers Ukraine to have a corrupt government.
Mr. Bolton has also confronted Russia over its election interference, a notoriously touchy subject for Mr. Trump, who sees discussion of it as undermining his legitimacy.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: This Saturday, Sept. 14, I plan to run as fast as I can at the 38th edition of the Run for Sickle Cell 5K.
After all, this race is about helping people deal with living with sickle cell disease and promoting the search for a cure for the disease. You may smirk at my illogical belief that I can impact the timetable for finding a cure for sickle cell anemia by running fast but hear me out.
While Gulf Winds and the Sickle Cell Foundation have always worked together on this race, three years ago the bond became stronger, with the idea that the closer the two organizations worked together the faster the goals of the foundation can be accomplished.
A flat, fast 5K is a huge draw for runners. So, it makes complete sense to me that we do it quickly. And a flat, fast course that produces fast times for participants is even better.
Last year I wrote the following statement for this column:
"There is no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia, but treatments can relieve pain and help prevent problems associated with the disease. And, you won't be surprised to hear me say that a good exercise program will help as well."
It is a diagnosis no one wants to hear: "You have an incurable disease." Whether it is Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or many forms of cancer, "incurable" crashes down on a person in a devastating way.
Unfortunately, that is what patients have heard immediately after being diagnosed with sickle cell disease by their doctors. There were a few exceptions, but historically a diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia meant a life cut short and filled with many painful symptoms.
While scientists generally know what causes sickle cell disease, finding a cure has been a difficult path. Like many diseases, funding is inadequate despite the fact that more than 200,000 people in the United States and 20 million worldwide have the disease and, around the world, millions die each year as a result.
Sickle cell disease is a crippling ailment that generates a lot of suffering. It primarily affects those who have African ancestry, but it can also occur in people who have a Hispanic background. The disease was first described in the U.S. in Chicago in 1910, in a dental student, by Dr. James B. Herrick who coined the term "sickle-shaped" to describe the peculiar appearance of the red blood cells of this patient.
It is hard to say that the "race" to find a cure has been fast, but it has been steady. There have been some very dedicated people trying to unlock the doors to curing people with the disease. There has also been a lot of progress reducing the impact of the disease on patients. And at some point "steady" becomes "breakthrough."
Which is where we seem to be today. And in the last year I think it is fair to say things have moved quickly.
More than once headlines have blasted messages like "Scientist on verge of curing Sickle Cell Disease." There have been headlines about patients cured in clinical trials. The New York Times printed a story about a family that watched the oldest daughter slowly give in to the disease and die. Her younger brother, Brandon Williams, is going now going through gene therapy and seems to be on his way to being cured after suffering 4 strokes before the age of 18.
Because sickle cell disease is the result of a very specific genetic defect, the most promising treatment for curing the disease seems to be gene therapy. It now seems possible to repair or change the gene that causes sickle cell disease to occur. And that is just what seems to be occurring in clinical trials.
Researchers involved in one gene therapy clinical trial were able to make sickle cells switch back to normal.
Another great success has been the use of stem cell transplants. A stem cell transplant replaces the diseased blood-forming stem cells of a patient using healthy stem cells from a donor.
It is all enough to start the body pumping adrenaline. And a runner to try and run fast. Before it gets away from us, let's go close the door on this disease and put in place the mechanisms to eradicate it.
I hope to see you Saturday morning at Jake Gaither Gym.

Why Russia is a top CIA hard target

Texto completo: As CNN and the New York Times reported on Monday, the CIA extracted a high-level Russian government source in 2017. Both publications suggest that the CIA was increasingly concerned the agent was at risk of being compromised.
It's an exciting story that raises many questions.
For my two cents, I note that the 2016-2017 period saw an unusually large number of senior Russian foreign policy officials die. While these deaths were ruled accidental or natural, I've had doubts. The theatrical nature in which Russia described some of the deaths as occurring — falling out of a window and dying while swimming, for example — fit with Russia's particular penchant for theatrical assassinations. Perhaps these Russian officials were suspected of spying for a foreign nation and thus executed. Perhaps not.
Regardless, the question mark itself is a perfect example of why the 2017 extraction is so important. Because in the wilderness of mirrors that defines America's intelligence struggle with Russia, there are many more shadows than certain forms. Still, from the Cold War to the present day, Russia has been a top target for the CIA's human agent recruitment efforts. Today, only China stands as a higher priority target.
That's because Vladimir Putin's Russia is a determined keystone adversary of the United States.
Second, because the Russians are completely paranoid about being caught out by other means of intelligence collection — signal intelligence, especially, i.e. intercepted phone calls, emails, or other digital-electronic communications. The Russians know that the U.S. and its allies, particularly Britain, have exceptional signal intelligence capabilities and they are extremely careful about using signal platforms to discuss the most critical issues. Sometimes they make mistakes, but in equal measure they spread misinformation over encrypted channels in order to trick American ears into false understandings.
That leaves limited other means to understand what Vladimir Putin's inner circle is thinking, planning, and doing. While U.S. satellites and other measurement platforms can detect military activities, they cannot show what people are thinking. That's where human agents play their role.
But the catch here is that Russia is an extremely hard target for human agent recruitment. The Russian FSB intelligence service makes it extremely difficult for CIA officers to move freely in Moscow and other Russian cities, let alone meet and pitch a prospective official to share secrets with the CIA. Russia sometimes engages in particularly aggressive techniques to harass CIA officers.
Russian officials also know the FSB's resources and reach. In turn, they are hesitant to meet U.S. officials even where they would like to. This often applies even where the CIA approaches Russian officials while they're traveling outside of Russia. Thanks to the Russian intelligence community's perpetually paranoid state it often prioritizes tedious surveillance operations of its own people over serious efforts to recruit foreign officials to spy for the Kremlin. Russia also benefits from unreliable U.S. allies in these efforts.
The result?
Only the most talented teams of CIA "targeters" (who identify those might work with the CIA) and operations officers (those who approach, cultivate, and handle the target) can recruit agents inside the Russian government. The best operations officers must also be masters of nuance. Interestingly, current CIA Director Gina Haspel excelled against the Russians here.
But the basic sustaining point here is that the recruitment of Russian agents is dangerous and difficult work. Where, as in the case now reported, a Russian official can operate in place for decades, share intelligence regularly (one mistake and you're doomed) and then escape to America, it is a landmark success. The agent and the CIA officers who handled him will have shared a well-deserved Russian toast: Давайте выпьем за успех нашего дела! To the success of our project!

Republicans don't want Mark Sanford, and his run for president is pointless

Texto completo: Of all the reasons former South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford could have given to run for president, he couldn’t have possibly picked a dumber one than “to further and foster a national debate.”
It’s like he thought to himself, 'How can I outdo my last public embarrassment? Ah-ha! I know! I’ll run for president on a platform of talking about debt!'
The jokes about Sanford and his Argentinian mistress are too easy. What would be truly difficult is coming up with a lamer presidential bid.
Sanford resigned as governor of South Carolina in 2009 after he was caught skipping town and having an overseas affair. Republican voters gave him a second chance in 2013 when they elected him to Congress and, like every good elected Republican, he decided his time was best spent over the last couple years by writing New York Times op-eds criticizing President Trump, his party’s wildly popular leader.
He lost his primary last year.
As remarkable a political career as that may be, someone should tell Sanford that there are plenty of ways to talk about debt and deficits that don’t involve a pointless run for president in a party that doesn’t want him.
He could write more op-eds. He could go on Morning Joe. He could tweet.
Those are all respectable options. But I’m guessing that’s why Sanford isn’t interested in them.

Texto completo: New details about a high-level CIA informant close to the Kremlin cast doubt on President Trump playing a role in the lead-up to the decision to extract the individual from Russia in 2017.
Hours after CNN reported Trump's handling of classified information was the inciting incident leading to this spy's extraction, a follow-up story from the New York Times cited sources who insisted media scrutiny alone is what jeopardized the safety of this source.
The informant, recruited by the CIA decades ago, has been described as a mid-level Russian official who was outside Vladimir Putin's inner circle, and yet saw Putin on a regular basis and was privy to high-level information. This Moscow spy's intel was key to the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Putin himself ordered a Russian interference campaign in the U.S. 2016 election.
The identity of this ex-informant has not been revealed in order protect him or her from Russian reprisal.
CNN's Jim Sciutto reported the informant was extracted in 2017 after Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office in May 2017 and disclosed some classified information about an anti-ISIS operation in Syria. Although CNN mentioned that concerns for the informant's safety dated back to the end of the Obama administration, the report stressed that Trump's actions were the inciting incident to revisit prior conversations.
But the New York Times tells a different story and led to Sciutto to acknowledge there is more than what he initially reported.
The follow-up report said media inquiries about CIA sources, following the U.S. intelligence community's detailed statements blaming Putin for directing the election interference effort, prompted officials to worry about the informant's safety and led to an offer for extraction in 2016. The informant initially refused, citing concerns about family. Some American counterintelligence officials took this as a reason to be skeptical of the source's trustworthiness.
Months later, after Trump's meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak, there was more media scrutiny and the informant accepted another offer for extraction, reassuring U.S. officials who had begun to doubt this individual. Former intelligence officials said "there was no public evidence that Mr. Trump directly endangered the source" and current U.S. officials "insisted that media scrutiny of the agency’s sources alone was the impetus for the extraction," according to the Times.
Another report from the Washington Post said U.S. national security officials were "alarmed" by Trump's disclosure, but also said this was not the reason for the asset's removal.
Even publicly there was talk that CNN's report missed the mark. Former CIA official Philip Mudd, a CNN counterterrorism analyst, took issue with the report's "political angle" involving Trump.
“I question whether this angle of the story about whether the president’s engagement with intelligence was actually a spur in the extraction of the informant," Mudd said Monday on The Lead with Jake Tapper. "I suspect there were other issues here."
About an hour after the Times report was published, Sciutto announced on Twitter that he could report additional information.
"Given NYT has now made details on Russian spy public, I can now report additional info we had withheld. Asset had direct access to Vladimir Putin, including the remarkable ability to take photos of presidential documents, and had served US for more than a decade," he said. "Asset had risen to the highest levels of Russia’s national security infrastructure. US offered extraction months earlier during Obama administration, but asset refused. Asset’s information was crucial to IC assessment that Putin had directed election interference to favor Trump."
Sciutto added that his information is "based on Trump and Obama administration [officials] with direct knowledge."
A spokesperson did immediately return a request for comment on the veracity of Sciutto's initial report, which was updated to mention the initial offer for extraction after the Times broke the story and details about the spy being able to provide images of documents from Putin's desk. CNN's update did not mention the Times' sources disputing that Trump factored into any decisions to offer extraction to the informant a second time.
Earlier in the day Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said, “CNN's reporting is not only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger.”
CIA spokeswoman Brittany Bramell said, "CNN's narrative that the Central Intelligence Agency makes life-or-death decisions based on anything other than objective analysis and sound collection is simply false. Misguided speculation that the President's handling of our nation's most sensitive intelligence — which he has access to each and every day — drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate.”

Texto completo: In April, Sting will star in his musical “The Last Ship” in St. Paul, and he’d really like you to see it.
That’s why Sunday night, the 67-year-old superstar performed a selection of songs from the show at the Ordway Center for Performing Arts for an intimate audience of 150 patrons and media.
It’s exceedingly rare for a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer to host such an event, but “The Last Ship” is a bit of a hard sell. It’s not a feel-good romp like Cyndi Lauper’s “Kinky Boots” nor is it an audience-pleasing jukebox musical a la “Mamma Mia” or “Jersey Boys.” Instead, it’s a serious story about a small British town rocked by the closure of its shipyard.
“It’s fun even though it’s serious,” Sting said Sunday. “And it has some damn good songs.”
When he wrote it, Sting had no intention of starring in it. He said he specifically had British actor Jimmy Nail in mind for the part of Jackie White. And Nail was playing the role when “The Last Ship” opened its brief run in New York in late 2014.
“We got it to Broadway and tickets weren’t doing as well as they should have done. The producer came up and said ‘You’ve got to go in the play,’ ” Sting said with a laugh. “I asked, ‘Which part do I play?’ ‘You have to take Jimmy’s part.’ I said, ‘He’s my friend, I can’t do that. I can’t throw my friend under the bus.’ He said, ‘Kid, it’s Broadway. You’ve got to do it. We’ve got to sell some tickets.’
“Jimmy said, ‘I get it entirely. You’ve got to keep these kids working. I love the play. I’ll be your understudy and give you notes every night.’ Which he did.”
Sting first started working on “The Last Ship” — which he prefers to call a play with songs rather than a musical — in 2011, at a time when he had hit a wall creatively.
“I think of songwriting essentially as therapy,” he explained. “Songwriting is something where I have to go deep into my unconscious, into my history, into my life. I was in a period of what I call writer’s block. You know, what am I going to write about?”
He drew inspiration from his autobiographical 1991 album “The Soul Cages” and his own childhood in Wallsend, Northumberland. His father expected him to take a job in the shipyards, but he said that when the Queen Mother and her brigade visited his hometown, he locked eyes with her and realized he didn’t want to spend his life toiling away. He wanted to be on the Queen Mother’s side of things.
“I was fortunate to have a very rich childhood, rich in symbolism,” he said. “We lived next to a river and at the end of my street was a giant ship. It was kind of mythic, the scale of (how I was) brought up in this industrial, surreal world. It was a very rich environment for a songwriter.
“So going back there, once I began writing, the floodgates opened. I just wrote song after song, couplet after couplet. It’s as if these ideas had been inside me, wanting to come out. It was like projectile vomiting. Out they came and that became the play, which is still evolving.”

Unlike many other musicals from rock stars, the majority of the songs in “The Last Ship” were written specifically for it. Fans got their first listen to some of the numbers on Sting’s 2013 studio album of the same name. The musical does feature four tracks from his back catalog: “Island of Souls” and “All This Time” (from “The Soul Cages”), “When We Dance” (from “Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting 1984–1994”) and “Ghost Story” (from “Brand New Day”).
The first reading of “The Last Ship” took place in Manhattan in October 2011. It premiered in Chicago in the summer of 2014, with previews starting that September on Broadway. It cost around $15 million to stage and, in New York, “The Last Ship” pretty much sank.
It opened to decidedly mixed reviews, although the New York Times called it an “ambitious, earnest musical … (that’s) buoyed by a seductive score that ranks among the best composed by a rock or pop figure for Broadway.”
After weeks of dwindling ticket sales, Sting stepped in to give it a boost. He had previously starred in a version of Bertolt Brecht’s “The Threepenny Opera” in 1989 on Broadway, so it wasn’t a huge stretch for a guy with 17 Grammys, an Emmy and four Oscar nominations.
“I mean, I’m on stage most nights of my life doing my material,” Sting said. “I’m glad I had that experience in the ’80s playing Mack the Knife. I loved it. I just took it with both hands and thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. It’s a different discipline. Learning your lines, learning how to relate to other people, finding nuance, finding levels you hadn’t seen before. It’s a journey of discovery.
“I’d been in all the rehearsals and had written all the songs and lyrics, so I sort of knew it. Once I got my feet wet, I went on and I enjoyed the hell out of it.”
“The Last Ship” was staged, without Sting in the cast, in Salt Lake City in 2016 and in the Finnish shipbuilding city of Turku the following year. Last year, a production of the show – with a new book by director Lorne Campbell – toured the U.K. and Ireland.
The show was presented in Toronto in February, but there was a catch. “It was, well, ‘We want Sting to be in it,’ ” he said. “It’s become a fait accompli.” In addition to St. Paul, Sting will star in the musical in several other cities, including Los Angeles, Detroit and San Francisco.
“I just love singing the songs, so I’m very happy to be in it,” he said. “Even though I have another career that has to go on hold while I’m doing this.” (Sting spent the summer touring Europe in support of his latest album, “My Songs,” and wrapped a 16-date Las Vegas residency last week.)
And Sting made it very clear he looks at “The Last Ship” like he does the rest of his music.
“You learn something every time you perform a song,” he said. “You find something in it that is slightly different. And I learned a lot from the other actors who played this role. I took a lot of information from them, the subtleties, and added my own nuance to it. Your performance is like a football game. The ball is passed to you and you pass it on.
“It’s not a dead thing. I think the play is very much an organic, living, evolving organism. It’s very exciting, it’s changing all the time. I never think of things being locked. In my world, a song is constantly evolving. This play is much the same, unlike a lot of others. They’ll actually say that in the theater, ‘It’s locked.’ This play isn’t locked. I shouldn’t say that, but it isn’t.”

Residents raise Taos Vortex issues

Texto completo: The second annual Taos Vortex, a Meow Wolf-produced music and immersive arts extravaganza in Kit Carson Park -- hailed by the New York Times as one of the top eight music fests in the nation this year -- didn't exactly silence the town's popular event venue.
But residents' complaints about booming late-night noise and camping outside the designated area in the park near downtown Taos prompted town officials to propose big changes to festival rules.
Along with complaints to the city, the issue created a social media uproar and drew letters to the editor at The Taos News. Most critics expressed outrage over the noise levels and raised questions about whether the event brought any financial benefit to the town.
Resident Juanita Lavadie wrote in a letter to the newspaper that she "put up with home windows heavily vibrating for hours. The high decibel level went on and on until midnight. ... This venue did not treat local residents with respect or inclusivity."
While noise concerns about Kit Carson Park performances have been raised in the past, the Vortex was the final straw for many people in the community.
Resident Sam Richardson wrote in a letter to the editor that "tsunamis of noise emanating from Kit Carson Park hammered Taos for three days."
"Some of what was heard during the Meow Wolf Taos Vortex event was recognizable as music," Richardson wrote. "The rest was some sort of pulsating, high-tech, thumping turbulence. ... And it was constant. The babble could be heard and felt for miles around."
Festivalgoers took up most of the parking downtown, he said, possibly affecting galleries and other businesses.
"So who benefited from this carnival?" Richardson wondered. "The first argument is always 'hotels and restaurants.' Some probably did book well, but with so many of the revelers camped in the park and eating food they brought with them, this might not have been the field day service providers had hoped for.
"Events like this disrupt day-to-day life in Taos," he said. "... Where's it all going? Scary to think about it."
Town Manager Rick Bellis, who proposed the new park rules at a recent Town Council meeting, nonetheless downplayed problems during the three-day electronic dance music jam last month.
In an email, Bellis said there were "no arrests, no violence, no DUI's, no public intoxication, no public nudity, no injuries and no emergencies," barring "maybe a dozen total noise complaints for the three days, which is pretty darn good for any event."
And tickets were limited to 5,000, ensuring the crowd wouldn't grow to a dangerous size.
Most of the "community input" on the Taos Vortex centered on constant loud music and tents popping up outside the "glamping" zone, Bellis said.
Other curve balls included toilet troubles, with a portable trailer bathroom malfunction and an undercount of facilities, he said. Initial camping ticket sales were used as a measure for how many toilets were needed, he said, but "there were twice as many people than planned for staying 24/7."
The likely result: No more camping in the park, no more early-morning or late-night music and no more multi-stage affairs.
Bellis said the format for Taos Vortex included two stages and over two dozen DJs who were able to override sound technicians.
"When we agreed to two stages, it never occurred that someone would pay top notch talent to drown each other out and play over each other," Bellis said in the email. "I don't think that worked for the crowd, the DJ's or the neighborhood."
Meow Wolf CEO and co-founder Vince Kadlubek and other representatives of the Santa Fe-based entertainment company did not respond to multiple emails and calls to comment on this year's event or answer questions about how possible park rule changes would affect any plans for a third Vortex.
In the months ahead of the Taos fest, Max Beck-Keller, Meow Wolf's events director, called it the company's "cornerstone event" and said it could serve as a model for more
Meow Wolf-branded outdoor festivals across the nation.
"We're definitely thinking about building on this outside of New Mexico," he said in May, when the company announced the Taos Vortex lineup.
Despite criticisms, Bellis said, Meow Wolf and the town of Taos have worked well together, and the town will continue to host the festival. But it might have to follow new rules if it is again set in Kit Carson. Among the proposed changes:
u No music before noon; performances will have a 10 to
10:30 p.m. cutoff, with exceptions on weekends.
u No camping in the park. (Bellis said the logistics of organizing the makeshift campground caused complications, and conceded camping "just doesn't make financial sense when we are trying to fill hotels.")
u Festivals will be limited to two days; other sites, such as Fred Baca Park to the southwest, might be considered for longer events. (The costs to the town -- such as overtime pay for city workers -- outweigh benefits, Bellis said. "None of our three-day events ever make money on all three days," he wrote in an email. "People seem to have a tolerance that seems to wear out after two days, and they lose interest.")
u Events will be limited to a single stage.
u Noise levels will not go over 100 decibels around the perimeter of the park. (Bellis described a "round-the-clock boom-boom-boom heavy, heavy bass beat" that operated on lower frequencies during Taos Vortex. This was the source of most complaints leveled online and during public comments at meetings. Bellis, who described himself as an EDM fan -- electronic dance music -- said the town didn't anticipate the combination of loud bass and noisy competition between DJs.)
u Each person attending a festival will pay a $5 park use fee to Taos.
Meow Wolf had an agreement with the town for park use that covered any damages, Bellis said, adding that no damage has occurred at Kit Carson for events held in the past three years.
It's a matter of balance -- improving logistics while retaining the impromptu sense of the Vortex experience, he said -- which gets better each time. "It's a weird combination of planning far enough ahead to be able to appear totally spontaneous."

Texto completo: I am a sick man. I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased.
I am one of those fanatics on the alt-right and the alt-left, the ones who make online forums so vicious, the ones who cancel and call out, the minority of online posters who fill the air with hate. I'm one of those radicals whose rage is intertwined with psychological fragility, whose anger at real wrongs is corrupted by my existential panic about myself.
To know anything about me you have to understand the chaos at the core of my innermost being. I was raised without coherent moral frameworks. I was raised amid social fragmentation and division, the permanent flux of liquid modernity.
Adults in my life have not been trustworthy. Friends have not been trustworthy. Women reject me. I passed through school unseen. You have no idea how ill-equipped I am to deal with my pain. I was raised in that coddling way that protects you from every risk except real life.
When I was younger my eyes pleaded: Tell me what adulthood and manhood are supposed to look like! All you said was, "You can be anything you want to be!" How does that help? You told me I was special, but the world goes on as if I don't exist.
I yearn for order. Blunt simplicities. Politics provides the Manichaean binaries I can't find anywhere else, and so I make everything political. Own the libs! Smash the racist right! A war of pure good and pure evil.
I crave the single narrative that will make everything clear: Everything is race. Everything is class. Everything is moral rot caused by godlessness. They say that fundamentalism is rigid and authoritarian. I say to them: Yes! I want fundamentalism. Please wrap me in that rigidity. Otherwise, I have no coherent self.
Catastrophizing is my mindset. Catastrophizing is pure: Society is totally corrupt. The "system" is totally rotten. I am terrified by ambiguity and ambivalence, the idea that the glass might be only half full. I seize on the extreme example of anything and take it to be the typical case. In this way I create my truth. An immigrant committed murders, so immigrants are murderers.
People are not defined by individual traits but by group ones. Individual persons are too complicated, but groups are abstract and easy to stereotype. Every human being gets reduced to some category, preferably the cunning ones I despise: the libs, white males.
I need leaders and spokesmen who will never show uncertainty. I want leaders who tell simple blame stories. It's the bankers! It's the immigrants! I want intellectual put-down artists who will crush the other side and let me vicariously enjoy their triumphs on YouTube again and again.
My moral system is simple, too. Up is evil, and down is good. People above me on the status hierarchy are venal, while those of us in my group are victims of their corruption. The existence of any hierarchy itself is prima facie proof of injustice.
From the abstract vantage point of my computer screen, I see a world in which my opponents are elite oppressors and my kind are oppressed. They have their exclusive cliques, and I am disdained. And here we get to the ultimate injustice: Why are they recognized while I am not? This is the molten core from which my indignation flows. The status quo does not respect me, and therefore I despise it.
So my politics is not really about issues; it's epic wars for recognition. I don't deal with the complexities of economics or foreign affairs. I seize upon the minor missteps made by my opponents in order to discredit their kind. You stumbled? I delight in crushing you! Owning the libs spares me the terrifying ambiguity of actually getting to know one.
I've lost faith in reason. Communication is for condemnation and arousal. Forgiveness has become foreign to me. Sometimes you have to be vicious for justice. If I afflict the comfortable I have served justice. I don't have to worry about comforting the afflicted. If I attack faraway wrongdoers I don't have to worry about tutoring a child.
Online war is a force that gives life meaning. Hatred gives me that delicious simulacrum of power. Did you really think you could raise me on gourmet coffee and yoga pants and I wouldn't find a way to rebel against your relativism and materialism? Didn't you observe the eternal pattern - that if you try to flatten a man to the bourgeois he will rebel by becoming a fanatic?
And yet ... somehow it's not working. Somehow politics doesn't fill my soul, bring me peace or end my existential anxiety. I have helped create a harsh world in which vulnerability is impossible and without vulnerability there can be no relationship. Relationship is the thing that I long for the most and that I make impossible. I have cut myself off from the only thing that can save me.
I am indignant. I am superior. I read Dostoyevsky's "Notes From The Underground." I am alone.

Globe names new editorial page editor
The Boston Globe on Wednesday named Bina Venkataraman as its new editorial page editor. The 39-year-old Somerville resident brings a varied background as a journalist, author, and thinker on environmental and ­science matters to one of the highest-profile jobs at New England's largest media company. In a statement Wednesday, Venkataraman said she wants to see the Globe amplify “diverse voices of our city and better showcase Boston's groundbreaking ideas and knowledge, while holding our leaders and institutions accountable for meeting high ­expectations for public service." “The Globe Opinion section has the opportunity to feature more of the voices and perspectives that hail from the many Bostons that exist today," she said. “We have the chance to reflect the richness of this region's vibrant neighborhoods and cultures, its world-class thinkers and community activists, its history-keepers and technology trailblazers." During a brief phone interview Wednesday evening, Venkataraman spoke of the importance of level-headed editorials at a time when the country is at “perhaps a historic level of political polarization." “There are a lot of opinions in our media environment right now, and a lot of people are able to offer their opinions, so it raises the bar for what we produce," she said. Venkataraman has lectured on science communication, science writing, and the shaping of science policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 2011. She is currently a fellow at the think tank New America, and the director of global policy initiatives at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. She will assume her Globe position in November. A graduate of Brown University and Harvard Kennedy School, Venkataraman has previously covered health and science for the Globe, and had stints as a Globe metro correspondent and on the Globe's editorial board. She also worked on the science desk of The New York Times. In 2013 and 2014, she served as a senior adviser for climate change innovation in the Obama White House. In announcing the hire, the Globe's managing director, Linda Henry, called the paper's editorial board “one of the strongest and most vibrant editorial boards in the country." “We tackle big issues in bold ways as well as subtle and everyday challenges," she said. “We thoughtfully look for ways to advocate, to progress, and to help others use their voices to inform and inspire others. We are thrilled and fortunate to add Bina's perspective and leadership to our board." — DANNY MCDONALD
FOOD
Nestlé plant in Taunton to close; 49 people to be laid off
Nestlé USA plans to close a Taunton plant and lay off 49 employees as part of a nationwide shift in its distribution systems for frozen pizza and ice cream. The company plans to permanently close its facility at 455 John Hancock Road by year's end, according to documents filed with the state's Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development last month. All 49 employees have been notified that they will be laid off, the notice said. They include delivery drivers, retail merchandisers, and sales representatives. Layoffs will begin Oct. 18 and may continue until the site is closed, the notice said. The company's decision to transition to a warehouse model for its pizza and ice cream businesses was announced earlier this year. To save costs, Nestlé wants to ship these products — which include brands such as Dreyer's, Häagen-Dazs, and Skinny Cow — to warehouses instead of directly to stores. — SARAH WU
PHARMACEUTICALS
Vertex to acquire startup that is exploring a cure for type 1 diabetes
Vertex Pharmaceuticals said Tuesday that it plans to acquire an ambitious startup for $950 million, betting the company's early-stage science could lead to a functional cure for type 1 diabetes. The Cambridge company is buying Semma Therapeutics, a nearby firm turning stem cells into insulin factories. Based on the work of Harvard University stem cell scientist Douglas Melton, Semma's approach involves turning moldable stem cells into beta cells, the insulin-producing machinery that is mistakenly attacked by the immune system in type 1 diabetes. If it works — if Semma's lab-grown beta cells can replace those lost to the disease — the company may have invented a permanent solution to a disease that affects more than 1 million people in the United States. Semma's cells would be transplanted directly into the liver or meted out by an implant, freeing patients forever from their insulin injections. But it's early days for Semma's work, which is yet to be tested in a clinical trial. And development has been a longer process than Semma anticipated. In 2015, the company raised $44 million from investors and said that money would fund its work through human trials. As of today, Semma has raised more than $100 million more and has tested its technology only on primates and pigs. — DAMIAN GARDE, STAT

Whether you are a bull or a bear on the US economy, it's best not to get cocky. That's some advice from Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who says that he and his fellow policy makers at the central bank should remain vigilant and ready to act at a time when risks to growth have increased. “In my view, one should not be overconfident that the economy will be just fine or that an economic downturn is inevitable," Rosengren said in a speech Tuesday evening at Stonehill College. Rosengren reiterated his view that the economy should continue to expand at a relatively healthy rate, making calls to lower interest rates premature. He was one of two Fed officials who voted against the rate cut approved at the end of July. Fed chairman Jerome Powell described that reduction, the first in a decade, as insurance against a possible recession. GDP will grow at 2 percent in the second half of the year in the United States, according to the widely followed Blue Chip consensus forecast of economists. While that is down from an average of 2.5 percent in the first six months of 2019, the pace is stronger than in other major countries and above what is called the potential growth rate, which is an estimate of the economy's maximum sustainable output over the long term. “As long as growth remains at 2 percent, I don't see the need for policy action," Rosengren said. President Trump has said the Fed should cut rates by 1 percentage point in the near term. Rosengren pointed to three reasons for increased volatility in financial markets over the summer: economic weakness in China, Japan, and Europe; disruptions in global trade caused by the US tariff war with China; and a sharp drop in long-term US government bond rates that suggests a coming slowdown. “Tariffs are a tax on imported goods and, along with the impact of retaliatory tariffs, they increase the risk that the earnings of firms reliant on foreign trade will be hurt," he said. “The reduction in earnings for these firms could affect asset valuations." — LARRY EDELMAN

Texto completo: The head of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab resigned on Saturday and stepped down from the boards of several organizations following revelations that the lab accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from disgraced multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
The announcement comes a day after the New Yorker reported that Media Lab director Joi Ito and his colleagues worked to conceal the financier's donations and affiliation with the program. Epstein died last month in jail as he faced federal charges of sex trafficking of minors.
Ito, who confirmed his resignation to The Post, notified members of the Media Lab of his departure in an email just after 3 p.m. Saturday.
"I want to apologize again for my errors in judgment," he wrote in the email provided to The Washington Post by a graduate student at the lab. "I have spent the last days and weeks listening to all of you and I want to thank you again for sharing your insights and perspectives with me, and allowing me [to] begin to try to make amends. After giving the matter a great deal of thought, I have chosen to resign as Director of the Media Lab and as a Professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately."
In a letter to the university, MIT President L. Rafael Reif called the allegations "deeply disturbing," adding that the school would hire a law firm to conduct an internal investigation into Epstein's donations.
The professional fallout continued for Ito on Saturday as several organizations confirmed he would step down from their boards. He resigned from the board of trustees of the Knight Foundation, spokesman Andrew Sherry confirmed, as well as the New York Times Co. board of directors, according to a spokeswoman. The MacArthur Foundation announced he had stepped down from its board of directors as well.
The Media Lab studies the application of technology to several fields, including medicine, agriculture, health, media, space exploration and artificial intelligence, according to its website. It has an annual operating budget of $80 million. Ito had served as its director since September 2011.
The Epstein conflagration has swept up the Eastern Seaboard, first in the tony enclaves of Palm Beach, Fla., where the financier was once known to party alongside Donald Trump, before moving on to New York, where Epstein allegedly ran a sex-trafficking ring from his Upper East Side mansion for years. Epstein died by suicide last month while in federal custody.
Now, it has engulfed Cambridge, Mass.
According to the New Yorker, Epstein was listed as a "disqualified" donor in MIT's database, and the Media Lab classified his donations as anonymous and kept his name off Ito's calendar. In a September 2014 email obtained by the New Yorker's Ronan Farrow, Ito asked Epstein to help fund a researcher, writing, "Could you re-up/top-off with another $100K so we can extend his contract another year?"
In a subsequent email with the subject line "Jeffrey Epstein money," Farrow reports, Ito instructed his staff to "make sure this gets accounted for as anonymous." Farrow writes that staff also raised objections to a 2015 visit from Epstein, according to Signe Swenson, a former employee at the lab who resigned in 2016.
These reports go beyond what Ito revealed last month.
On Aug. 15, five days after Epstein's death, Ito disclosed in a blog post that the Lab had accepted money from the financier "through some of the foundations he controlled" and that the donations had been made with his knowledge and permission. Ito also disclosed that he allowed Epstein to "invest in several of my funds which invest in tech start-up companies outside of MIT."
In his blog post, Ito apologized for his dealings with Epstein but insisted that "in all of my interactions with Epstein, I was never involved in, never heard him talk about, and never saw any evidence of the horrific acts that he was accused of."
Ito vowed to raise and donate funds equal to Epstein's contribution to the Media Lab to nonprofits that combat sex trafficking.
MIT received about $800,000 over the course of 20 years from foundations that Epstein controlled, according to an Aug. 22 letter to the university from Reif, MIT's president.
"All of those gifts went either to the MIT Media Lab or to Professor Seth Lloyd," who teaches mechanical engineering and physics, Reif said. He also announced that an internal panel had been convened to look into the donations and to examine the university's policies on such gifts.
The New York Times later reported that Ito took about $1.7 million from Epstein over the past decade.
As a result of the disclosures, two researchers affiliated with the MIT Media Lab, Ethan Zuckerman and J. Nathan Matias, a visiting scholar, resigned in protest in late August, the New York Times reported.
At a meeting on Sept. 4, MIT Media Lab co-founder Nicholas Negroponte, an architect, appeared to defend the program's initial decision to take Epstein's money several years ago, the MIT Technology Review reported. After an outcry, Negroponte said that given what the public now knows about Epstein's behavior, his money would and should not be accepted.
Epstein had tried to use his money to ingratiate himself with the academic elite long before the first accusations against him became public in the mid-2000s. Epstein donated extensively to universities including MIT and Harvard, which said it would not return a $6.5 million donation that the financier made in 2003, before he pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a minor.
After Epstein served a prison sentence, he sought to rebuild his reputation, an effort that may have involved once again establishing his status among the scientific elite. In an Aug. 22 apology to Epstein's victims, Lloyd, the MIT mechanical engineering and physics professor, called his decisions to accept grants from Epstein "professional as well as moral failings."

Administración Trump estudia si reduce aún más el ingreso de refugiados, según reportes

Texto completo: Entre las medidas en tema de políticas de inmigración que la administración del presidente, Donald Trump, evalúa actualmente, también está la posible reducción del número de refugiados que pueden entrar en EEUU.
La decisión del Gobierno se acerca, según reporta The New York Times y confirma The Associated Press. Ambos medios aseguran que funcionarios de la Casa Blanca tienen prevista una reunión de alto nivel sobre este tema para el martes de la semana que viene. El objetivo es discutir a qué cifra anual de refugiados se permitirá el ingreso, explican.
Como ya contó también Noticias Telemundo, el 1 de octubre empieza el nuevo año fiscal, una fecha clave para fijar el cupo de refugiados admisibles en los siguiente 12 meses. La administración Trump tiene intención de fijar el nuevo cupo antes de esa fecha, según AP.
Esta agencia asegura que no se ha llegado todavía a una decisión. Algunos funcionarios de la administración que han hablado bajo la condición de anonimato a esta agencia consideran que el número de refugiados se tendría que reducir debido a que EEUU está bajo presión por el aumento de solicitudes de asilo en la frontera sur y de otros países afectados por guerras o graves desastres naturales.
La jurisdicción prevé una diferencia entre las dos categorías: la primera, el estatus de refugiado, se refiere a personas consideradas bajo graves amenazas que se encuentran fuera de EEUU y que no pueden volver a su país de origen.
La segunda se asocia en cambio a migrantes que ya se encuentran en territorio nacional o en el intento de entrar en el país y que aseguran que estarían en peligro si vuelven a sus países de origen.
El Times afirma que el Gobierno baraja distintas opciones. Según las fuentes consultadas por este periódico, una prevé una limitación del número de refugiados que podría reducirlo a cero. Esta idea ha sido propuesta por un alto oficial de la administración. El primer medio que habló de esta posibilidad fue la revista Politico en julio.
Otra idea, confirmada también por AP, es establecer un máximo de 10,000 ó 15,000 ingresos anuales. El cupo establecido para este año fiscal fue de 30,000 refugiados, 15,000 menos que para 2018. El año fiscal anterior, cuando estaba en vigor la meta fijada bajo la administración de Barack Obama, el total de admisibles era de 110,000.
Ambas ideas harían que EEUU renunciara a su posición de país que más refugiados acoge en el mundo, destaca el rotativo neoyorquino.
La decisión tiene que tomarla el presidente Trump, según afirmó una fuente del Departamento de Estado. Pero la Casa Blanca todavía no ha hecho comentarios oficiales al respecto.
Un actual funcionario de la administración y varios exfuncionarios de la misma dijeron al Times que uno de los que más presionan para reducir ulteriormente el número de refugiados es Stephen Miller, el principal asesor de Trump en materia de inmigración.
Miembros de grupos de defensa del programa de refugiados, activo en EEUU desde 1980, indican que para la puesta en marcha de la medida será clave la posición de Mark T. Esper, secretario de Defensa desde el pasado julio.
Su antecesor, Jim Mattis, se opuso a grandes recortes del número de refugiados admisibles, alegando que estos afectarían los intereses militares de EEUU en el mundo. Un alto funcionario afirmó que la posición de Esper al respecto todavía se desconoce. Militares retirados y grupos de ayuda humanitaria están intentando convencerlo a tomar una postura parecida a la de Matis.
Organismos implicados en la ayuda humanitaria y reasentamiento de refugiados consultados por Noticias Telemundo consideraron que sería un desatino y una “catástrofe” continuar reduciendo el ingreso de refugiados, especialmente debido a la crisis global de 26 millones de refugiados que huyen de la violencia y persecución.
Hans Van de Weerd, vicepresidente del programa para refugiados del “Comité Internacional para Rescates” (IRC, por su sigla en inglés), dijo que si eventualmente la Administración baja a cero el número de refugiados, eso sería algo “catastrófico” para personas que dependen del reasentamiento para sobrevivir.
La decisión pondría en entredicho la credibilidad e influencia de EEUU en el mundo y sería otro “golpe bajo” de una Administración que ya implementó una veda a inmigrantes de países con mayoría musulmana, ha impuesto restricciones al proceso de asilo, ha separado familias en la frontera sur, y mantiene una política de detención de niños migrantes, agregó Van de Weerd.
A la fecha del 6 de septiembre, la cifra de refugiados aceptados a partir del pasado 1 de octubre fue de 28,501, según AP . El año fiscal pasado, se admitieron 22,491. Los latinoamericanos admitidos como refugiados en el año fiscal 2019 fueron poco más de 600, según el Centro de Procesamiento de Refugiados del Departamento de Estado.

Dallas Opera Cancels Plácido Domingo Gala

Texto completo: The Dallas Opera canceled its big-ticket March 2020 gala concert with the opera star Plácido Domingo on Thursday amid new accusations that he had sexually harassed multiple women.
The Dallas company, where the Spanish-born Mr. Domingo made his United States debut in 1961 on his way to opera stardom, became the third major American institution to cut ties with him over the recent allegations, joining the Philadelphia Orchestra and the San Francisco Opera. Mr. Domingo is still scheduled to sing later this month at the Metropolitan Opera in New York; the Met has said it was awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the Los Angeles Opera into the allegations against Mr. Domingo, the company's general director.
Dallas pulled the plug on its gala after The Associated Press, which reported the first round of mostly anonymous allegations against Mr. Domingo last month, published a new report Thursday in which a singer named Angela Turner Wilson went on the record and accused Mr. Domingo of reaching into her robe and grabbing her bare breast during a makeup call when they were appearing together in Massenet's "Le Cid" at the Washington Opera in 1999.
"It hurt," The A.P. quoted Ms. Wilson as saying. "It was not gentle. He groped me hard."
Ms. Wilson won Washington's Artist of the Year award that season but was not rehired, The A.P. reported, saying that she attributed that to her interactions with Mr. Domingo. The news service said that she had told her husband and parents of the groping contemporaneously and written about Mr. Domingo's unwanted attentions in a journal she kept at the time, but that a makeup artist she believed had witnessed what happened said he did not recall it. Ms. Wilson went on to sing elsewhere, including at the Dallas Opera, and to teach. She is one of 11 women who shared their experiences with the news agency after its initial report of allegations against Mr. Domingo.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Domingo, Nancy Seltzer, disputed the allegations.
"The ongoing campaign by The A.P. to denigrate Plácido Domingo is not only inaccurate but unethical," she said in a statement, which was sent to the news agency and then to The New York Times. "These new claims are riddled with inconsistencies and, as with the first story, in many ways, simply incorrect. Due to an ongoing investigation, we will not comment on specifics, but we strongly dispute the misleading picture that The A.P. is attempting to paint of Mr. Domingo."
[Read about how the allegations against Mr. Domingo have divided the opera world.]
The Dallas Opera announced its cancellation on Twitter Thursday, posting a statement in which it said it had decided to cancel the gala "in light of ongoing developments regarding allegations made against Plácido Domingo."
A spokeswoman for the company, Suzanne Calvin, declined to comment on the company's financial expectations for the gala, which is an important fund-raiser, or to say whether it had to pay Mr. Domingo a fee for the canceled performance. His debut in Dallas was in a performance of "Lucia di Lammermoor" starring the great soprano Joan Sutherland.
The cancellation came on the same day that Mr. Domingo began rehearsals at the Met Opera in New York, where he is scheduled to sing the title role in Verdi's "Macbeth" later this month opposite the star soprano Anna Netrebko. The Met said that it had no further comment on Mr. Domingo, and pointed to its statement about awaiting the results of the Los Angeles Opera's inquiry.
The Los Angeles Opera, which Mr. Domingo was instrumental in founding, is the setting for several of the earlier accusations of sexual harassment. The company said last month that it had hired Debra Wong Yang, a partner with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and a former United States Attorney, to conduct what it said would be a "thorough and independent" investigation into the allegations about Mr. Domingo.

Former Trump Aide Is Writing a Book

Texto completo: Sarah Huckabee Sanders, one of the most recognizable faces of the Trump administration, is writing a book that is expected to be published next fall, St. Martin's Press said Thursday.
In a news release, George Witte, the editor in chief of St. Martin's Press, said the book would cover the former White House press secretary's years working for President Trump and offer "a unique perspective on the most important issues, events and both public and behind-the-scenes conversations inside the White House."
The publisher declined to comment further. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.
Ms. Sanders worked on Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and joined the administration when he was elected. She served as his press secretary from July 2017 until she left the White House in June. Mr. Trump praised her loyalty, calling her "a warrior," and encouraged her to run for governor of Arkansas, a position once held by her father, Mike Huckabee. She also became known for her confrontations with reporters, and for doing away with the decades-old tradition of formal daily press briefings, arranging instead for the president to speak and answer questions for himself.
"I'm excited to tell my story about the challenges of being a working mom at the highest level of American politics and my role in the historic fight raging between the Trump administration and its critics for the future of our country," Ms. Sanders said in the release.
The response on Twitter was swift, including mock book titles, barbs about Ms. Sanders's trustworthiness ("Thoughts and prayers for those fact checkers," one user tweeted) as well as dismay that she received a book deal at all. "To reward @SarahHuckabee's daily betrayal of the people with a lucrative book deal is unpatriotic and disgusting," the writer Steven Rowley said in a tweet.
Her book follows many others written by former members of the Trump administration, including "Call Sign Chaos," by former defense secretary Jim Mattis, which came out earlier this week.
Ms. Sanders's predecessor, Sean Spicer, also wrote about his experience, as have former staffers such as Omarosa Manigault Newman and Anthony Scaramucci. St. Martin's Press has published a number of books critical of Mr. Trump as well, including one about foreign interference in the United States presidential election and the challenges the Federal Bureau of Investigation faces under Mr. Trump's administration.

Texto completo: The world according to Jim (aka the ultimate Twitter thread, with everything in 280 characters or less):
• Going into Friday, the Dodgers had slugged an NL-record 250 home runs. The jewelers sponsoring the radio broadcasts give out a free bracelet for each homer. Have they run out of precious metals yet?
• So, when will they install the Dodger Stadium humidor?
• Sad to report that the Giants make their final visit to The Ravine this weekend and Madison Bumgarner isn’t scheduled to pitch. Like him or dislike him, the electricity when he faces the Dodgers is always fun.
• Then again, his favorite foils aren’t there. Max Muncy is hurt and Yasiel Puig is in Cleveland. But trust me: He’d find somebody else to annoy, or more accurately be annoyed by.
• It’s also the final visit to L.A. for Bruce Bochy as Giants manager. He may represent the enemy, Dodger fans, but he deserves your respect as the last of a managerial breed.
• There was angst here in 2017 when the Dodgers lost 11 straight and 16 of 17 and had their division lead shrink from 21 games to 9 in early September. Yet they reached Game 7 of the World Series. Are Dodger fans even more touchy now, fearful of more postseason doom?
• The boos Kenley Jansen hears from the home crowd every time he gives up a hit or walk should be a clue.
• But here’s another reminder: Every fan base in baseball hates its bullpen. (As this week’s Exhibit A, I give you the Mets.)
• Before Dave Roberts opted to skip Hyun-Jin Ryu’s turn next week, I suggested Ryu should come down with another convenient neck inflammation, the Dodgers’ all purpose injured list malady. His fatigue was that evident.
• Come to think of it, isn’t Kenley’s neck a little sore, too? (You know, whiplash from watching the ball fly over the fence.)
• Suggested reading, if you haven’t gotten to it already: “K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches,” by New York Times national baseball writer Tyler Kepner (who was, incidentally, a former Angels beat writer for The Press-Enterprise way back in the day).
• And a tip: When reading it, have a baseball nearby so you can fiddle with the grips he describes.
• Last week’s close USC victory over Fresno State shouldn’t have been that much of a surprise. Fresno State under Jeff Tedford is one of those Group of Five teams that deserves more recognition than it gets.
• They are the kind of program, in other words, that I’ve ranked above name schools as an AP Top 25 voter. (Which is part of why I’m no longer an AP Top 25 voter. I got tired of the weekly whining from fans of Power Five conference schools.)
• But this week it’s serious for the Trojans, and against Stanford we will discover a whole lot more about freshman Kedon Slovis. (It may be a little bit fairer fight with the Cardinal’s KJ Costello out, though replacement Davis Mills is a 20-year-old junior.)
• What was worse last week? The USC students with chests painted to spell “Fight On,” only the “G” was missing when the cameras found them? Or ESPN’s Rod Gilmore using the telestrator to illustrate where the “G” was supposed to go and botching it?
• FIHGT ON, indeed.
• UCLA has enough trouble selling football tickets. I’m not sure it helped that Saturday’s opponent at the Rose Bowl, San Diego State, beat Weber State 6-0 last week. Large multitudes may have decided to skip this one.
• Crowd counts aren’t always an accurate reflection, since college football attendance is down almost everywhere (even the SEC). But with UCLA, a continued lag in wins and customers might call the whole Chip Kelly Experiment into question.
• It was apparent all summer that Melvin Gordon had no leverage in his quest for a contract extension with the Chargers. Does he realize yet he’s tangling with the wrong organization when it comes to stubbornness?
• This, from the Rams’ Eric Weddle the other day about the Jared Goff extension: “It sets the standard that if you do things right on and off the field and you play at a high level, they’re gonna reward you.”
• He didn’t specifically reference Dean Spanos. But to anyone who remembers the events leading to Weddle leaving the Chargers after the 2015 season, the linkage was obvious.
• Remember when Southern California had its own wing of the Broadcasting Hall of Fame? Vin Scully, Chick Hearn, Dick Enberg and Bob Miller were quite a Mt. Rushmore, and Ralph Lawler made it a starting five.
• We could have four from the next generation, too: Joe Davis (Dodgers TV), Alex Faust (Kings TV), J.B. Long (Rams radio) and Brian Sieman (Clippers TV). (Sieman, the Clippers’ radio voice since ’07, would be the elder statesman of the group.)
• Davis and Orel Hershiser are really fun to listen to – but when Orel says “we,” “our,” and “us,” This Space cringes. Even on a (limited distribution) team-controlled channel, homer broadcasts just don’t go over well in the nation’s No. 2 market.
• Bottom line: What would Vin do?
• If you missed it, and you probably did, the Sparks clinched the third seed and a first-round playoff bye Thursday night. There are a lot of things with the WNBA that need fixing, but the quality of basketball absolutely is not one of them.

A rough journey to new music for Jenny Lewis

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Life hasn't been easy for singer Jenny Lewis since the sunnier days when she performed in support of a 2014 album while wearing a rainbow-hued pantsuit and carrying a guitar with similar bright colors.

Her mother died, and a 12-year relationship ended, sending Lewis on a cross-country journey in search of herself. Finally, with a new album, she's had to deal with the uncomfortable story of occasional collaborator Ryan Adams' alleged mistreatment of women.

Spending much of the upcoming year on tour may seem like a relief.

The up-tempo songs "Red Bull & Hennessy" and "Heads Gonna Roll" from her "On the Line" album, with Lewis' unerring sense of tunefulness, will get the initial attention. But the work's emotional core emerges in quieter, more introspective material like "Dogwood," ‘'Rabbit Hole" and "Taffy." Those are the songs that will stick.

Much of the material was written in stolen moments on borrowed pianos, in friends' apartments and hotel lobbies, where she had to keep quiet to avoid making a disturbance.

"I don't think of this record as being a breakup record," she said. "It's more of a rebound record. It's kind of the space in between."

The southern California native relied on a network of friends during her post-breakup travels, staying in musician St. Vincent's New York apartment, for example. She and two friends formed a band and wrote songs in a Manhattan storefront, where pedestrians mistook them for an art installation. She spent

time in Nashville and Minnesota.

Even when she returned to California, Lewis used Airbnb to explore different parts of Los Angeles.

"I ran away," the 43-year-old said. "I really just got back here a couple of months ago. It was a three-year adventure."

How much of an adventure? It's hard not to notice all the references to alcohol and other substances sprinkled throughout the album's lyrics. There's Hennessy, of course. Grenadine. Bourbon. Beaujolais. Red wine (unspecific). Amphetamines. Paxil. A bong. Part of it is a good writer's attention to detail, but still...

"It's relevant," she said.

She brings a bottle to a restaurant in the heart of Hollywood where she talked about her music. Not to drink: it's a gift for a friend, singer Nikki Lane, who's performing later that night nearby. A former child actress who turned to music and was a member of the group Rilo Kiley before going solo, Lewis has a wide circle of friends and admirers in the business.

None of that could have prepared her for the surreal experience she had at Los Angeles' Capitol studio while making "On the Line," however.

Lewis played on the piano that Carole King used to make "Tapestry," which is intimidating enough. Her band included former Tom Petty keyboard player Benmont Tench, record executive and bassist Don Was and the drum duo of Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner.

"That's one of my favorite moments in my whole life," she said. "Standing in the control room and watching Ringo and Jim play together, I was mesmerized. Of course I am thrilled, honored. Shocked, really. I kept thinking, ‘Is someone doing somebody a favor here?'"

She believes it was Was who called in Starr. "I don't know exactly," she said. "He was just there with his drums."

Beck and Adams were two other big names who helped out. Adams, who produced Lewis' 2014 album "Voyager," produced some of the new music, too. The association with Adams became noteworthy when the New York Times reported that he allegedly pursued younger female artists for sex and sometimes became verbally and emotionally abusive when turned down. Adams has denied the accusations.

Lewis was not included in the Times' story, and her interview with The Associated Press took place before the story was published. She declined a follow-up request to talk about it, and tweeted a statement: "I am deeply troubled by Ryan Adams' alleged behavior. Although he and I had a working professional relationship, I stand in solidarity with the women who have come forward."

Lewis subsequently held an online album-release party that doubled as a benefit for the Los Angeles Women's Center, and it raised more than $10,000.

For Adams, the fallout has been swift: a canceled concert tour, an album release put on hold. Could the controversy hurt Lewis by association?

Jason Lipshutz, senior director of music for Billboard magazine, said it might have been an issue if Lewis had publicly defended him or been part of the Times' story. The women's center benefit was a smart strategic move, he said.

"I do think that it is something that people are going to be able to separate from her music," Lipshutz said.

Texto completo: " Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool " delivers a lively, comprehensive primer on the life and career of the legendary trumpet player. Documentarian Stanley Nelson does a masterful job of chronicling Davis's rise from a young prodigy to one of the most influential musical figures of the 20th century - as well as one of the most troubled. He's enlisted a terrific cast of on-screen friends and colleagues to offer their memories and testimonials, none more fabulously scene-stealing than Davis's late ex-wife, Frances Taylor. (Cicely Tyson declined Nelson's invitation to participate in the film, which is a shame.)
An entire movie could be made about Davis's exquisite collaboration with Bill Evans, which was a meeting of mismatched personalities that resulted in a spiritual meeting of souls; but Nelson goes further to give Davis his due as an innovator who continued to search out and break boundaries even after suffering through addiction and illness. Like all great cats, Davis had at least nine lives. Unrated. At AFI Silver. 115 minutes.

In the documentary " Jay Myself ," we watch as photographer Jay Maisel prepares to vacate the six-story, 36,000-square-foot building in Manhattan that he bought in 1966 for $102,000 (and sold in 2014 for $55 million.) The film, by Maisel's former intern Stephen Wilkes, documents the act of divestment - Maisel is something of a hoarder - a process that the New York Times says "is fascinating and looks exhausting." Unrated. At Landmark's West End Cinema. 79 minutes.

" Give Me Liberty " follows the adventures of the young driver of a medical transport van as he encounters various colorful characters. While the movie mostly succeeds, according to Variety, "the overloaded result feels like an ultra-low-budget cross between Martin Scorsese's 'Bringing Out the Dead' and the Safdie brothers' 'Good Time,' minus movie stars or any of the ingredients that made those remotely commercial." Unrated. At the Avalon. 110 minutes.

‘Need for chaos’ theory focuses on a subset of Trump supporters

Texto completo: If you are ready to go to a very weird place in your effort to understand the coalition that supports Trumpism, check out the latest column by the great Thomas Edsall of the New York Times, headlined “The Trump Voters Whose ‘Need for Chaos’ Obliterates Everything Else.”
It troubles me, even scares me, to consider deeply abnormal psychology in trying to explain support for a sitting president. But I do struggle to understand the hold that President Donald Trump seems to have over his followers. Edsall often relies heavily on scholars in his efforts to understand the hard to understand, and this column draws on the work of three scholars, two from Denmark and one from The U.S., who use theories of psychology to probe political behavior, and are working on a phenomenon that they call “a need for chaos” that motivates some people to use strange means in pursuit of strange goals as they engage in politics.
Edsall passes along a research paper by the trio, which just won an award in the “political psychology” division of the American Political Science Association for their work.
Edsall reports that the trio “argues that a segment of the American electorate that was once peripheral is drawn to ‘chaos incitement’ and that this segment has gained decisive influence through the rise of social media. … the authors’ analysis helps explain the intensity of anti-establishment voting that drove Trump’s successful takeover of the Republican Party in the 2016 primaries.”
In their paper, as reported by Esdall: “The three scholars “describe ‘chaos incitement’ as a “strategy of last resort by marginalized status-seekers” willing to adopt disruptive tactics.
“Trump, in turn, has consistently sought to strengthen the perception that America is in chaos, a perception that has enhanced his support while seeming to reinforce his claim that his predecessors, especially President Barack Obama, were failures.”
The scholars are not necessarily describing typical Trump supporters, but a strange group of activists who have a “need for chaos” and “express that need by willingly spreading disinformation” through social media activities “not to advance their own ideology but to undermine political elites” and to “mobilize others against politicians in general.” These disrupters do not “share rumors because they believe them to be true. For the core group, hostile political rumors are simply a tool to create havoc.”
Before the advent of social media, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, these “chaos-seekers were on outer edges of politics, unable to exercise influence,” Edsall explains, relying on the analysis of the scholars. But those and other contemporary social media platforms have “empowered this constituency, providing a bullhorn to disseminate false news, conspiracy theories and allegations of scandal to a broad audience. Examples include the lunacy of the Comet Pizza story (a.k.a. Pizzagate), the various anti-Obama birther conspiracies and Alex Jones’s claim that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left 20 children dead was a ‘complete fake’ staged by the government to promote gun control.”
The three political scientists — Michael Bang Petersen, Mathias Osmundsen and Kevin Arceneaux — sought to measure this “need for chaos”” by conducting surveys in the United States and Denmark that attempted to identify those who are “drawn to chaos” through their affirmative responses to statements like:
* ‘I fantasize about a natural disaster wiping out most of humanity such that a small group of people can start all over.’
* ‘I think society should be burned to the ground;’ and
* ‘Sometimes I just feel like destroying beautiful things.’
In a very creepy ending to a very creepy column, Edsall asks:
“How worried should we be about a fundamental threat to democracy from the apparently large numbers of Americans who embrace chaos as a way of expressing their discontent? Might Trump and his loyal supporters seek to bring down the system if he is defeated in 2020? What about later, if the damage he has inflicted on our customs and norms festers, eroding the invisible structures that underpin everything that actually makes America great?”
This is all way above my pay grade. I can’t assess this theory, although I’m a big Edsall fan, and he respects it enough to write a column about it. Here’s another link to the full Edsall column in the Times.

Texto completo: Labor Day reminds us of the many changes in life. The summer wardrobe is no longer appropriate. The fall clothes we put away months ago are now back in fashion, to hold center stage until the arctic blasts arrive. But these seasonal adjustments are trivial when compared to the impact of technology on American society. A prime example is how technologically sophisticated inventions have affected the cost and availability of health care.
Medical care was simplistic in the days of yore. An enormous breakthrough was the development of anesthesia in 1846. Prior to that time the patient had to attempt to ignore the pain from surgery or the repair of an injury. There was no x-ray to assist with the accurate setting of broken bones until 1895. The more medically sophisticated observation of internal soft tissue problems was not available until the invention of the MRI in 1977.
Many major cities and counties were able to operate public hospitals which provided low cost services for residents. Local taxes financed operating costs. Some religious groups also financed public hospitals. Now the only really public hospitals are operated by the federal government. The extraordinary expense of providing the latest medical technology has forced most public hospitals to become tax exempt corporations dependent on patients' insurance payments and charitable donations.
There has been no way to avoid the rising costs of medical technology. The new inventions would quickly set the required professional standard for treatment. Those who failed to employ the latest medical techniques would risk being considered negligent if their treatment was unsuccessful.
Another medical issue has now emerged. In the old days, those with an exotic ailment would simply perish. But now pharmaceutical companies often assume the task of developing remedies. According to a recent report in the New York Times, about 30 million Americans suffer from one of about 7,000 rare diseases. It is very expensive for a drug company to develop a remedy for any of the so-called "orphan illnesses."
The ultimate problem is that there will be very few patients for any special remedy. As a consequence, each treatment will have an astronomical price. The insurance company that is obligated to pay the medical bill will experience a substantial operating expense.
It now seems that the great cost of quality medical care has tempered the enthusiasm of those in power to provide medical attention for all Americans. Years ago when medical care was little more than TLC (tender loving care), it was less costly to be compassionate. Times have changed.
Nonetheless, other industrialized nations have found a way to care for the health of their citizens. Perhaps there can be another change in America that inspires a greater love for one another. Maybe after 2020.

Texto completo: It’s been a lost summer for the Washington Post.
From Memorial Day to Labor Day, the Post had some pretty embarrassing moments. Whether it was incorrectly stating that presidents do not deliver remarks on the 4th of July, ignoring speeches by Presidents Reagan, Kennedy, and Obama, or being called out for shoddy, politically motivated fact-checking, the Post’s lost summer culminated with a fateful day in August when they were forced to issue 15 corrections to a single article.
But as the summer came to a close, the Post set out to ”report” the president’s summer accomplishments, but reporting is not what the Post does. Two of its writers published an opinion article they claimed was news but that instead pushed their own personal political narrative that President Trump had a “lost summer” of squandered opportunities and few accomplishments.
The truth is, Trump racked up many well-documented victories that directly benefited the American people at home and abroad. When the Post asked, the White House proudly provided it with a detailed list of the administration’s 26 most important successes of the summer. Of those 26 accomplishments, the Post chose to publish just four, which it buried under 11 paragraphs of editorialized critique.
Media bias comes in two forms. It plays a role in deciding what news is, and is not, covered, and also in deciding how that news is covered. In this instance, the Post's “reporters” are guilty of both. It is obvious they had their own predetermined, pre-written narrative, and they simply discarded information that could have challenged that. This is not only a disservice to readers, but it’s also an offensive, egregious affront to true news journalism.
The Post could have written about the president’s directive to ease all federal student loan debt for disabled veterans. They didn’t. They could have written about the first time in history a sitting United States president walked across the DMZ into North Korea. Not a chance. They could have written about the first stage of the president’s historic trade deal with Japan, which will give our American farmers even more access to one of the largest and most promising markets. Of course not. The president even fixed dangerous immigration loopholes to increase border security and make American communities safer, but these two reporters would not deviate from their preset narrative and write about that either.
To be clear, in a “news” article about Trump’s summer accomplishments, the Post not only chose to ignore, but refused to cite 84% of the president’s actual summer accomplishments. Respectable, reputable, responsible news reporters would have listed those, gathered opinions from sources with diverse perspectives, and presented all of this information to their readers so they could develop their own opinions. Doing so would be a valuable, nonpartisan service to all Americans from across the political spectrum.
Sadly, the Washington Post wasn’t alone this summer. It is impossible to trust the media when the executive director of the New York Times is caught on tape outlining plans to transition its coverage from the Russian hoax to another false narrative about Trump and racism. Or when TV networks accused the president of “manufacturing a crisis” at our southern border, only to later flip-flop and blame him for Congress’ refusal to fix that very crisis.
Many in the media jumped on the bandwagon to rip Trump for calling Baltimore “rat infested,” but the media never apologized when a video surfaced of Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh making the exact same complaint. When the president called out the anti-Semitic comments, media posts, and associations by Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib, the press dismissed the Democrats’ bigotry as a mere invitation to dialogue about Jewish influence in the world. There was also a summer’s worth of major outlets openly questioning Trump’s sanity, but the hourly gaffes by Joe Biden are part of what “humanizes him.”
No wonder the national media’s popularity sits somewhere between smallpox and the plague.
As Congress prepares to return from its six-week-long recess, Americans deserve to know that Trump has been hard at work this summer, and every day since he took office, keeping his promises to the American people. After decades of neglect by Washington, our economy, immigration system, trade deals, employment numbers, and prospects of peacefully ending years of war abroad are better than they have ever been.
Despite record-setting accomplishments in record-setting time, data shows the news coverage of Trump has been 92% negative. The most egregious and dangerous forms of this bias thrived this summer at media outlets like the Washington Post, which routinely masquerade opinion as news. Heading into the fall, the Post and others should at the very least pledge to sequester such breathless partisanship, rampant editorializing, and obvious bias to their opinion pages.

Motivating workers to stay in dead-end jobs

Texto completo: I usually read the New York Times to find out what I don't like about its elitist East Coast political opinions. A lot of people in the heartland do that, so nothing new there.
However, a recent business article in the Grey Lady piqued my interest for another reason. It reported on an individual who found happiness shedding a six-figure vice president job and a corner office suite to take a low-level retail job with little possibility of advancement.
Most people have a social clock that rings when life's big events should occur, such as educational attainment, marriage, children, first big job promotion, etc. and use it to keep pace with their contemporaries.
Others seem indifferent to such societal demands and have an internal life compass and march to their own drum beat. Many of these folks create a lifestyle that features work in a low-stress job for a decent wage that gives them the freedom to use their leisure time to find joy and satisfaction in hobbies and avocations of their choice. No all-consuming, pressure-filled, decades-long career climbs for these people.
What approach should an employer take toward an employee with little interest in advancement, when a career with the company is not what the employee seeks? How do you recruit or manage such a person?
Here are some informal observations I've made during my many years of hiring and supervising such employees.
If your company has an up-or-out policy regarding employee advancement, it is important to screen applicants carefully during the recruitment process by checking employment histories, diligently gathering references and reviewing the results of personal interviews. Such an approach helps eliminate potential non-strivers from your employment roster. The applicant's focus on pay and benefits to the exclusion of training and advancement opportunities often was a key indicator for me as a lack career aspirations with the company.
Organizations willing to hire employees content to fill dead-end or limited-growth jobs should identify motivators that will keep those employees working efficiently. Rewards for longevity and loyalty to the company should be adopted. Generous time-off policies will be attractive to this employee group. The availability of training programs designed to equip employees with the skills for lateral transfers to other entry level jobs also should be put in place. I have found that some low-level employees can be excellent trainers for new entry level workers performing similar duties. These long-term employees are ideal for passing on the company's culture and work norms.
The long term, one-job competent employee should be seen in the context of the company's entire workforce and viewed as part of a continuum of employees, each striving for advancement to different levels in the company. There will be those seeking the CEO chair, many others seeking mid-level management positions and others content to hang on to the bottom rung of the career ladder. Organizational chaos would occur if everyone in the workforce saw themselves as future CEOs or were satisfied to remain in low skilled positions.
There are good reasons for hiring and nurturing entry level employees. In addition to the valuable contributions they can make to the enterprise, in my experience they tend to have high job satisfaction levels that lead to reduced absentee and turnover rates and might lessen the use of the company's mental health benefits.

Will Shortz returns home for an evening of puzzles

Texto completo: Name the Crawfordsville native, born and bred, who published his first puzzle at age 14, went on to create his own major at Indiana University and has gone on to be perhaps the best-known personality who specializes in puzzles and games.
The answer, of course, is the one and only Will Shortz, crossword editor of the The New York Times and the Puzzle Master on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition Sunday.
Shortz will be back in his hometown this weekend, as he is one of the featured speakers at Wabash College's President's Distinguished Speaker Series, which is featuring native Hoosiers.
Shortz grew up in Crawfordsville. A self-proclaimed puzzle fanatic, he started writing his own puzzles around age 8 or 9, he said in a phone interview from his home in New York state. He sold his first puzzle at age 14; by 16 he was a paid contributor to Dell magazine.
Dell required two character references, so Shortz approached his high school speech teacher and his family's grocer — on the condition they not reveal his true age.
"I was afraid I'd be taken advantage of," he said. Both said he was actually 18.
After high school, Shortz enrolled at Indiana University, intending to study history, then changing to economics. His fate changed his senior year when he leaned about Indiana's pioneering individualized major program, wherein students can actually create their own unique course of study. Shortz actually created and designed his own major — naturally, puzzles.
"Not surprising, there are not courses at Indiana in puzzles," Shortz said. "I designed every one of my courses."
Shortz wrote and designed his entire curriculum. Given that there are no professors in this particular area, Shortz created a course on the writing of crossword puzzles, working with an English professor. For math puzzles he worked with a math professor; the same was true for logic puzzles, the psychology of solving puzzles and the history of puzzles.
"I'd find a professor who'd work with me," he said. "I'd go into this office and he'd critique my work."
After publishing his senior thesis, "The History of American Word Puzzles Before 1860," Shortz earned a bachelor's degree in enigmatology, the only person in the United States to ever do so — a privilege not lost him.
"I was very lucky," he said.
Shortz has gone on to have a career as a professional in, well, puzzles. In 1978 he was named associate editor at Games magazine, becoming senior editor in 1989, when its circulation was up to 700,000. In 1993, he was named crossword editor of The New York Times, only the fourth in the paper's history. And since 1987, he has been the puzzle master on NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday, since the segment's beginning.
Shortz loves puzzles of all kinds. He is particularly fond of word puzzles, he says, along with logic and number puzzles. He has written several books of sudoku; he likes board games and trivia — he'd even be up for a round of Name That Tune.
"I will turn anything into a game," he said. "I like any sort of challenge."
But jigsaw puzzles? Not so much.
"You know you're going to finish it," he said. "It's just a matter of time."
But lest you think he's a jack of one trade, he has one other obsession: table tennis. He hit a goal for himself earlier this year when he had played table tennis 2,500 days consecutively.
Most people know Shortz for his puzzle-writing expertise, particularly his crossword skills. One of his favorite clues is "It might turn into a different story"; the answer is "spiral staircase." And he wrote one exceedingly clever puzzle on the eve of the presidential election in 1996. The clue was "Lead story in tomorrow's paper," and two possible across answers were correct, either "Bob Dole elected" or "Clinton elected," with all the corresponding down clues supporting either answer.
That is the genius of Will Shortz — crafting word puzzles that require critical thinking, playing with a love of language and logic. And the satisfaction that comes from finding solutions.
"The main reason people solve puzzles, I think, is because as humans we're driven to solve problems. We want to put the world in order," he said. "Most problems we face in life don't have clear-cut solutions. We just muddle through as best we can and move on.
"When you find the solution to a crossword, sudoku or other human-made puzzle, you know you've achieved perfection. You've put a small part of the world in absolute order. That's a wonderful feeling we don't get often in everyday life."
When Shortz speaks at Wabash College Friday night, it will be a night about puzzles and games. He'll talk about crossword puzzles, about how to write them, how to construct them, about what makes a great crossword puzzle.
"First of all, we're going to have fun," he said. But he'll also talk about finding your passion, about how to capitalize on what you love, finding a way to live that passion.
"Find something you love and figure out a way to do that," he said. "There are a lot of boring jobs out there and someone has to do them. You know what you love. Make a career out of it."
And that is, perhaps, the ultimate answer to this puzzle of life, spoken by the puzzle master himself.
If you go Will Shortz will speak at 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 6, in Ball Theater of the Fine Arts Center of Wabash College in Crawfordsville. The event is free, but tickets are required through the Fine Arts Center box office. Visit wabash.edu/boxoffice. The talk is part of the President's Distinguished Speaker Series.

Breaking Barriers in Ballet: Misty Copeland

Texto completo: Headnote Set to Receive Trailblazer Award
Misty Copeland had the world of ballet standing still, when she made history as the first Black female principal dancer to the prestigious American Ballet Theatre (ABT) in 2015, just months after becoming the first Black woman to perform the lead role of "Odette" in ABT's coveted "Black Swan" in the winter of 2014.
Determined to shatter the glass ceiling of the ballet world, on Sep. 11, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) will honor Misty Copeland with their esteemed Trailblazer Award during the CBC's annual "Celebration of the Arts" event-an award that Copeland deemed as not only an honor but also a necessity.
"It's so important for other Black dancers to see a possibility, a future for themselves, in a world that still doesn't include many other Black ballerinas," Copeland said.
"There's definitely still a glass ceiling in the ballet world," Copeland continued. "There's only one Black principal dancer in the American Ballet Theatre in their entire almost 80-year history and a lot of people don't have the understanding that just because it's been done once, doesn't meant that that problem goes away... having one Black president didn't mean that racism didn't exist."
"If I didn't have art in my life, then I wouldn't be the articulate, confident person that I am today. Fields in STEM are important but the arts are also so vital... not every child learns the same way and sometimes the missing link is art."
Growing up as the fourth child of six in underserved areas of San Pedro, California, Copeland spoke to a time where she and her five other siblings found themselves all living in a small motel after her mother's marriage to her fourth husband became abusive - both emotionally and physically - to Co-peland's mother and all of her children.
Despite the economic and social hardships, Copeland said that she was able to find solace and her voice through the world of dance. At the age of 13, the ballet lessons that she began taking at at the local Boys and Girls Club would eventually allow her to move in with her teacher's family and eventually prepare her to make history.
"It's been 25 years now that I've been a part of classical ballet and I still have that same fire," Copeland said. "I think for me it was initially out of my own need, as a 13-year old girl growing up in underprivileged areas, to find structure, something I never had, and dance provided exactly what I needed for that time in my life."
"I represent ballet and any child that needs to see someone persevere," Copeland continued. "What it means to be an underdog and to be mentored and have an amazing support system and represent that American dream."
Since joining the American Ballet Theatre in 2001, Copeland has gone on to be inducted into the Boys & Girls Club National Hall of Fame; serve on the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, under the Obama administration; publish three books, including the New York Times Bestsell-ing memoir, "Life in Motion;" secure her own clothing line with Under Armour; and receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Hartford. All the while Copeland has been an ardent beliver in reminding others that "representation is important."
"I'm still a Black ballerina and a Black woman in this world and that doesn't just disappear with titles," Copeland said. "The more I use my visibility, my platform, my voice, to continue to speak about diversity both in front of the scenes and behind them, the more I'll be able to help change the directory of dance."
"A lot of underserved areas and youth either don't receive access to dance courses or don't receive quality training, which limits their chances of going even further when that time comes," Copeland continued. "My hope, is that with my platform, I can continue this conversation to bring about change, to show younger people how to own their own power, to embrace who they are, to walk in their own path and to be represented."

Texto completo: A marquee writer for the New York Times has written a long article, published on the newspaper's front page, questioning the rationale behind Joe Biden's 2020 presidential run and painting a picture of a disconnected, tetchy, and stumbling candidate who feels he is entitled to the Democratic Party's nomination.
In the article, headlined "Does Joe Biden Want to Be Doing This?", senior political writer Mark Leibovich described Biden, 76, as struggling to explain why he wants to be president — the question that famously tripped up Ted Kennedy in 1979 when it was posed to him by Roger Mudd of CBS News.
"Remarkably, after all this time, Mr. Biden stumbles to come up with a clear answer," Leibovich wrote. In an interview in Prole, Iowa, Biden told him, "I think it's really, really, really important that Donald Trump not be re-elected." Leibovich added, "He then launched into a classic Biden roller derby of verbiage in which he listed all the reasons he found Mr. Trump so distasteful."
Leibovich, 54, is the author of the 2013 best-seller This Town, a widely celebrated book hailed as a series of "mini-masterpieces of politico-anthropological sociology" that dissected the artifice and soullessness of Washington politicians and the media. Now chief national correspondent for the New York Times Magazine, he has won the National Magazine Award for profile writing.
The 2,000-word article could be a sign that the media and political establishment, which Leibovich wrote about so acutely, are turning against Biden after a series of embarrassing mistakes and misstatements over the summer.
Leibovich writes that Anita Dunn, a Biden strategist, expected that "Democrats will gravitate to the familiar and reach for this stitched-up, old teddy bear of a candidate."
He describes Biden's campaign thus far as a "play it safe" attempt to paint himself as electable and inevitable, without exploring the "lingering question about why, exactly, he had decided to jump back into this delirium pen" of a White House campaign after comprehensive failures in 1988 and 2008.
"The former vice president can appear, on some days, like a man longing for the hard-earned retirement he had been enjoying after eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president," Leibovich suggests. "He could have easily strolled off into a warm twilight, possessed of abundant good-will, newfound wealth, time to enjoy his family and space to grieve the death of his son, Beau, to cancer in 2015."
Instead, Leibovich writes, Biden has chosen to spend his later years campaigning against nearly two dozen other candidates through a sweltering summer. "He seemed a bit riled up, and not in a good way," he noted of a schedule-packed afternoon in Iowa. Leibovich goes on to note that Biden became agitated that day with both staff and reporters, asking an aide multiple times, "Where are we going?" The author noted that Biden also snapped at a reporter from Fox News who had inquired about his small crowd sizes.
Leibovich describes Biden's campaign events as "moderately enthusiastic, always polite and certainly appreciative of his visits" but that they "struggled to identify why he was running."
Biden, he says, outlines three priorities while campaigning: "On the stump, Mr. Biden says he is running to achieve three main things, none of them distinguishable from what he might have said when he ran in 1988 and 2008: 1) to lead the “battle for the soul of America,” 2) to restore the middle class and 3) to unite the country."
While Biden alludes to a noble mission, his staff is more blunt. "They tend to dispense with any attempt at a higher purpose beyond dislodging President Trump," he says. "It is not hard to whiff a heavy scent of obligation around Team Biden."
Biden's wife, Jill, talked of him as a "Democratic savior," using almost quasi-religious language at an Idaho fundraiser: "We didn't really intend to be going on this journey. But when it came down to it, too many people were saying 'Joe has to run,' 'Joe has to run.'"
Throughout the piece, Biden's stamina and vitality seem in doubt. "Mr. Biden’s days as a potent and fiery stump speaker seem long past," Leibovich writes. "He can exude a level of weariness certain days. He can be as unfocused, long-winded and prone to misstatement as ever. He has kept up a steady run of blunders and embarrassments."
Calling Biden a "reluctant soldier for normalcy," Leibovich concludes his fiery take on Biden's campaign as an ultimate quest for the White House for the sake of being there. "In other words," he says. "If not now, when? And if there is not a clear reason why, maybe the better question is just why not?"

Texto completo: As he wrapped up a brunch shift at the Australian cafe Two Hands in the Little Italy section of Manhattan, Christopher Mortenson saw his phone light up. All afternoon, he had been waiting for the notification: ABC Cocina, an upscale Latin American restaurant in the Flatiron district, needed a line cook. He had an hour to get there.
When the shift ended, Mortenson started sprinting uptown. On his way to the restaurant, he ducked into a supply store to pick up a white chef’s jacket, which he threw over his T-shirt. He arrived at ABC Cocina just before 5 and spent the evening charring peppers with a blowtorch and stuffing pork into pillowy tortillas.
In December, Mortenson, tired of working 50 hours a week for low pay, quit his job as a cook at a vegetarian restaurant in Manhattan and became a full-time member of the gig economy. Now he races around New York, working shifts at a rotating cast of restaurants that use the hospitality staffing app Pared. So far, he has cooked in more than 70 kitchens, including Osteria Morini in Soho and Riverpark in Kips Bay.
“I have to turn the notifications off at night - I can’t sleep,” said Mortenson, 51, who has worked full time at restaurants in Las Vegas, San Francisco and Austin, Texas. “They send me so many jobs I can’t even look at my app right now without 10 jobs being on there.”
Gig workers are nothing new in the restaurant world. Every day, contractors on bikes and scooters deliver food for Uber Eats and DoorDash. But in a growing number of kitchens, contract workers now make the food, too.
With the restaurant industry facing its worst labor shortage in decades, Pared and a rival app, Instawork, are filling a growing void, as managers who have struggled to recruit permanent employees turn to on-demand services for workers trained as dishwashers, servers, line cooks and even oyster shuckers.
As the apps become more established, some workers are exchanging the stability of traditional hospitality jobs for the flexibility of temporary employment. Others are using the apps to make a quick buck on the side. The development has raised concerns among some labor advocates, who argue that the same pay and equity problems that have emerged in other parts of the gig economy, like ride-hailing and delivery, could come to the restaurant kitchen.

Hero horses and other critters who were there for us in our darkest wartime hours

Texto completo: “I thought, who is this horse and why have I not heard of her?” – Robin Hutton
Sgt. Reckless will be first, which is only right. Without her, there would be no ceremony at the U.S. Capitol to honor animals that have served this country with courage and distinction in war and peace.
The chestnut mare served with the Marines during the Korean War. She had been bred to be a racehorse, but the Marines didn’t need her for speed. They needed her strength and stubborn will to keep fighting no matter how great the danger.
She was wounded twice taking injured Marines from the front lines back to MASH units, and made an incredible 51 trips by herself in one day – up and down steep terrain – carrying hundreds of pounds of heavy artillery shells each trip to resupply frontline units fighting for their lives.
Sgt. Reckless never faltered. She received two Purple Hearts and the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, but, more importantly, she received the love and respect of every Marine who fought beside her.
Cher Ami will be next. He was the last carrier pigeon still alive in an infantry division surrounded by Germans during World War I. All the other pigeon’s sent out for help had been shot out of the sky.
Allied air strikes were keeping the Germans from closing in, but the bombs were landing too close to the troops they were trying to save. The division commander wrote a note with their exact position, asking the strikes be stopped or his men would be killed.
He put the note in a silver canister and tied it to Cher Ami’s leg. The Germans opened fire as the last pigeon rose out of the bushes. Cher Ami was hit and sagged in mid air. On the ground, 200 American troops watched in despair as their last hope was about to plummet to earth.
But Cher Ami, (Dear Friend), didn’t drop from the sky like the others. He flew higher and higher until the bullets could no longer reach him, and he made it 25 miles to his coop, where he collapsed on his back covered in blood with a bullet hole the size of a quarter in his breastbone, and one leg so badly mangled it had to be amputated.
He would never fly again, but the little carrier pigeon got the message through.
Chips, America’s first canine hero of World War II, will be next. It was the morning of the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, and Chips was with his handler when their platoon was fired on by an Italian machine-gun team hidden in a nearby hut.
Everyone hit the ground, but not Chips. He snarled and broke lose from his handler’s leash, charging the hut and propelling himself into the pillbox. Shots were fired inside and his platoon feared the worst.
Suddenly, the hut door opened and four frightened soldiers came out with their hands up, followed by a snarling Chips. Once inside the pillbox, he had grabbed the machine gun by the barrel and pulled it off its mount. Then, he attacked the shooters.
How tough was Chips? When Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower bent over to shake his paw, Chips bit his hand.
Three American animal war heroes who will be honored posthumously with half a dozen others at the U.S. Capitol this Nov. 14 in the first “Animals in War & Peace Medal of Bravery” ceremony.
It would never have happened if not for Sgt. Reckless’ bravery, and a bad case of writers block by the author who would put the horse on the New York Times Best Seller list in 2014.
“I was stuck and looking for some inspiration when I found this wonderful story in ‘Chicken Soup for Horse Lovers’ Souls,’ about a horse named Sgt. Reckless giving birth to a foal named Fearless at Camp Pendleton,” said author Robin Hutton, who lives in Santa Rosa Valley.
“There were maybe three paragraphs on what she had done in the Korean War. Other than that, she had basically vanished from the pages of history.
“I thought this is a travesty and made it my mission to do everything I could to get her story out. It took me seven years to research and write, ‘Sgt. Reckless: America’s War Horse.’ ”
The book garnered many awards, which led to another book last year, “War Animals: The Unsung Heroes of World War II.” A paperback version is due out this October.
While the books were great chronicling the bravery of these animals, they weren’t enough. The British have been honoring their war animals with their own bravery medal since WWII, why wasn’t America doing the same, Hutton wondered?
With the blessing of the Marines and Army, she organized the “Animals in War & Peace Medal of Bravery” ceremony, which she hopes will lead to a future National War Animal’s Museum, which she discusses on her website waranimals.org.
When she died in 1968, Sgt. Reckless was buried at Camp Pendleton with full military honors near a statue erected in her honor.
“She wasn’t a horse, she was a Marine,” Hutton said. “When the Marines got her, they became her herd. She would do anything for them, and she did.”

Texto completo: A Harvard University freshman who was denied entry into the United States at Logan Airport last month has arrived on campus in time for the start of classes Tuesday.
Ismail Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian student who lives in Lebanon, had a valid visa to study in the United States but was put on a flight back home after being questioned by immigration officials at Logan. He was reportedly turned away because of political posts his friends made on social media that were critical of the United States, and the Department of Homeland Security said he was deemed inadmissible and his visa was canceled.
The decision drew immediate backlash amid widespread support for the teenager, who grew up in a refugee camp and received a Hope Fund scholarship from an international education nonprofit called Amideast. He is one of about a dozen freshman receiving the Hope Fund scholarship this year.
In a statement Monday, Ajjawi's family said they were grateful for all the support they've received in Lebanon, Massachusetts, and Washington D.C.
“The last 10 days have been difficult and anxiety-filled, but we are most grateful for the thousands of messages of support and particularly the work of Amideast," they said. “We hope now that everyone can respect our and Ismail's privacy and he can now simply focus on settling into college and his important class work."
The Harvard Crimson first reported that Ajjawi had arrived on campus Monday.
Ajjawi previously told the Crimson that immigration officials at Logan questioned him both about the social media postings and about his own religious beliefs and practices. Officials also took his phone and laptop, Ajjawi said.
Ajjawi's lawyer, Albert Mokhiber, said the case was “one of the most rewarding" of his 35-year career as an immigration lawyer.
“Against all odds a Palestinian refugee who attended UNRWA schools in the camps of Lebanon, earns a full scholarship to Harvard, hits a road block, but is eventually granted entry to the US to pursue his college dream," he said. “It's a classic sad tale with an exceptionally unique happy ending."
Ajjawi hopes to study chemical and physical biology at Harvard, according to a statement from Amideast. He graduated in the spring from Deir Yassin High School in Lebanon, which is run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
A spokeswoman from the agency said he scored the highest in the “life science stream" of the Lebanese baccalaureate exams in the south region and eighth highest in the country.
“Ismail Ajjawi is obviously an extremely talented and determined student and young man, who, despite all odds, has gained a place in one of the most prestigious universities in the world," said Dr. Caroline Pontefract, the agency's director of education. “[Ajjawi] is a beacon of hope for hundreds of thousands of UNRWA students."
Amideast leaders thanked Harvard President Lawrence Bacow and other university officials “for their efforts to ensure that this young man was able to enter the Class of 2023 with his peers."
Bacow and other university leaders have written federal authorities to voice their concerns about delays in processing student visas, as well as some denials.
The US embassy in Beirut had reviewed Ajjawi's case and reissued him a visa, according to Amideast.
“We are pleased that Ismail's Harvard dream will come true after all," said Amideast president Theodore Kattouf. “Ismail is a bright young man whose hard work, intelligence and drive enabled him to overcome the challenges that Palestinian refugee youth continue to face in order to earn a scholarship."

Texto completo: It was known as the "Treaty of Detroit," but it did not end a shooting war. In 1950, Walter Reuther, the legendary leader of the United Auto Workers union, and Charlie Wilson, the CEO of General Motors, agreed to a historic labor contract that bought the automaker five years of labor peace.
After more than a decade of sometimes violent conflict and short-term contracts, Wilson wanted stability so he could expand his company. The result was a trend-setting deal that included not only substantial wage increases but also generous pension and health care coverage. The Washington Post labeled it "a great event in industrial history."
Those were the days. At the peak of its power at the end of World War II, the American labor movement - which had cooperated closely with management and government to create democracy's great arsenal - fundamentally altered the social contract in the United States. Fortune magazine said the Treaty of Detroit "made the worker to an amazing degree a middle class member of a middle class society."
The story of the Reuther-Wilson pact is told in Steven Greenhouse's "Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present and Future of American Labor," an excellent account of how important strong unions were in moving our nation "toward greater economic and social justice," and how their decline has increased "inequality and unfairness."
Greenhouse, who spent 19 years covering labor and workplace issues for The New York Times, is unabashedly pro-labor without ignoring the union movement's warts and shortcomings. His essential point is that, while we can talk all we want about how technological change and the decline of manufacturing work have undercut the living standards of many Americans, the truth is that better wages and benefits are almost always the product of bargaining power. Building that power was the work of tough-minded idealists like Reuther, backed by New Deal-era labor laws rooted in an understanding that mass purchasing power underwritten by decent wages was good for the overall economy.
In the years since the Treaty of Detroit, the negotiating leverage of American workers has been vastly diminished. In the absence of powerful unions, we have yet to find an alternative and sustainable way of representing employees' interests.
We have also lost the sense of solidarity that originally inspired Labor Day. Greenhouse recounts a conversation with his then-86-year-old mother when he was in Wisconsin covering former Republican Gov. Scott Walker's offensive to gut collective bargaining and cut public employee benefits.
"When I was growing up," she told him, "people used to say, 'Look at the good wages and benefits that people in a union have. I want to join a union.' Now people say, 'Look at the good wages and benefits that union members have. They're getting more than I get. That's not fair. Let's take away some of what they have.'"
How did we get to this point? In another must-read book for our moment, "The Economists' Hour: False Prophets, Free Markets and the Fracture of Society," Binyamin Appelbaum argues that the growing role of professional economists since the late 1960s fundamentally altered popular understandings about how the world should work.
We have moved, Appelbaum argues, from a healthy respect for what markets can accomplish in their proper sphere to a "single-minded embrace of markets" that "has come at the expense of economic equality, of the health of liberal democracy, and of future generations."
"In the pursuit of efficiency," Appelbaum writes, "policy makers subsumed the interests of Americans as producers to the interests of Americans as consumers, trading well-paid jobs for low cost electronics."
Appelbaum, who writes about economics and business for The New York Times editorial page, values what economists do, but the ones he respects most are those who understand the limits of a purely material understanding of what matters. He quotes the brilliant Amartya Sen: "Economic growth cannot sensibly be treated as an end in itself. Development has to be more concerned with enhancing the lives we lead and the freedoms we enjoy."
The financial crisis of 2008, as Appelbaum suggests, will be seen historically as dropping the curtain on a period of market supremacy and radical individualism. The transition to the next act is not pretty. The rise of right-wing nationalism is part of the reaction against the earlier era's mistakes. The times call for democratic visionaries of Reuther's stripe who understand that free societies - and, yes, thriving economies - depend on sharing the fruits of our productivity and rebuilding a solidarity that can overcome our fractiousness.

Texto completo: In his sobering new book on the state of organized labor in America, author Steven Greenhouse offers enough examples of the plight of U.S. workers to make this Labor Day feel less like a celebration than a dirge.
Greenhouse, the former labor reporter for the New York Times, writes in "Beaten Down, Worked Up" (Knopf, 397 pages, $27.95) of the fast-food worker in Milwaukee who, after her hour-long bus commute, was told to go home even without her minimum-wage pay because her manager didn't need her for that shift, after all.
Or there are the Uber drivers who work 60 hours a week and can barely make ends meet. Or the chicken processing plants where "the poultry workers say they literally pee in their pants because they're not given time to go to the bathroom," as Greenhouse told me in a recent phone conversation.
Labor unions, which won higher pay and benefits for workers in the 1930s and '40s, were always the champion for working people to resist such oppressive conditions. At mid-20th century, leaders like the legendary Walter Reuther (profiled in an excellent chapter in Greenhouse's book) won historic gains for UAW workers in Detroit that were widely emulated throughout industry and helped create the nation's middle-class prosperity.
But beginning with the failed PATCO strike by air traffic controllers in 1981, when then-President Ronald Reagan broke the controllers' union and fired thousands of its members, conservative forces have waged a relentless and largely successful fight to weaken labor unions through legislation and in the courts.
As a result, not only has union membership in America plummeted from about 20% of of the U.S. workforce in the mid-1980s to barely 10% today, but unions continue to struggle in their fight for a higher minimum wage, equal pay for women, and even basic safety conditions in places like poultry plants.
On this Labor Day weekend, we're now at what may be a new pivot point in that history. As Greenhouse told me, there is a new militancy among workers in many fields, from classrooms to fast-food counters. But whether this translates into a new era of worker power remains very far from clear.
A labor awakening "If you asked me two or three years ago I'd say labor seems half asleep," Greenhouse said. But a number of militant actions, including the "D15" campaign for a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers and the strikes by low-paid teachers in West Virginia and elsewhere, organized labor seemed to be making some serious gains.
Unions "looked dead in the water and all of a sudden we had the biggest (teachers) strike in probably decades," he said. "Not only do we see 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 thousand teachers mobilized in various states but they had huge support from parents and kids. And that signaled a new energy and new wave of support for unions that we really haven't seen in many, many years."
He added, "Successful strikes beget more successful strikes. Successful militancy begets more successful militancy, just as the disaster of the PATCO strike discouraged more such strikes."
But this new militancy doesn't necessarily translate into a new day for unions.
"On one hand, we're seeing militancy in strikes, but we're not seeing huge successes in adding to labor's overall labor rolls," he said. "I don't think we're seeing nearly enough organizing among blue collar workers to say labor is back. But it's much more awake, more vigorous, than it was three or four years ago."
But to what end? Even with such militancy, Greenhouse said unions today don't play anywhere near the role they did at mid-20th century leading broad social change. In his book, Greenhouse includes a chapter on Reuther, who not only built up the UAW as a major force for workers but fought for broader social change.
"In the 1950s and '60s, the late '40s, the unions were the force in society pushing for progressive change, a strong social safety net," Greenhouse said during our talk. "Better health insurance, Social Security. They played a key role in (passing) Medicare. They played a key role in Medicaid and the civil rights legislation. And, more recently, I don't think Obamacare would have been enacted had they not put their all to get enough votes in Congress."
But with conservative Republicans in charge of Congress and the White House, organized labor has been forced onto the defensive.
"I think unions are better at playing defense to stop bad things from happening than they are in making good things happen," he said. "Whereas in the age of Reuther, they really helped make good things happen for workers and the public at large."
What the CEOs said Greenhouse takes a skeptical view of statements by business leaders that they acknowledge their duty to the community at large and not just to their bottom line. Such talk is cheap, he says.
The Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs from the nation's leading firms, issued a new "purpose of a corporation" philosophical statement in mid-August that recognized that all stakeholders, including employees and the community at large, are equally as valuable as the profit motive.
"Each of our stakeholders is essential," the statement from the Roundtable said. "We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country."
In his book, Greenhouse notes that in 1990 the Business Roundtable issued a very similar statement affirming that profits alone were not enough. Corporations also had to focus on the welfare of workers, customers, suppliers and the community, the Roundtable said then.
But just seven years later, after a wave of conservative backlash about the primacy of shareholder value, the Roundtable backtracked, saying in a 1997 statement, "The paramount duty of management and boards of directors is to the corporation's stockholders."
So, Greenhouse said, let's see if the CEOs stick with the latest version of their dogma and live it in practice. If it really means this latest version of its philosophy, Greenhouse quipped on Twitter, the Roundtable would lobby for Congress to repeal the massive recent tax cut for corporations that mostly went to stock buybacks.
"It would be better for the nation if we use that 1 trillion dollars to fight things like the homeless crisis or the affordable housing crisis," he told me.
Looking ahead Reuther used to say that unions had to be active politically or otherwise what they gained at the bargaining table they could lose at the ballot box. With that in mind, unions are focusing on both state and federal elections, including next year's contest where unions will join other progressives trying to oust President Donald Trump.
A victory in 2020 would make life a little easier for organized labor. If nothing else, a Democratic president would get to appoint the majority of members to the National Labor Relations Board. That's the government referee of union-management disputes.
But that won't be enough. The American workplace is more troubled than the top half of society would like to admit, especially for low-wage workers and those not represented by unions
And Greenhouse's disquieting look at the state of labor in "Beaten Down, Worked Up" makes that clear. It will take more than a political win or two to set things right.

Texto completo: The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review on opioid verdicts
The opioid epidemic has been a greedy monster, demanding more and more resources from all levels of government as well as hospitals and insurance companies over the last 20 years. It has eaten lives and devoured communities. In 2013 alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says opioids had a monetary cost of $78.5 billion.
That was six years ago. That was 13 years or so into the deadly dance of prescription opioids leading to heroin leading to synthetic opioids. Take that 2013 number as an average and multiply it by two decades and you get a cost of $1.5 trillion.
The scope of the problem makes the ruling in an Oklahoma court that Johnson & Johnson - yes, the people who make baby shampoo and Tylenol - must pay $572 million to "abate that state's drug problem a little less staggering than it might otherwise seem.
Being told to pay more than half a billion dollars is a hard pill for any company to swallow, but taken as a cost of doing business, it is probably on the level with capital improvements to facilities. It's definitely a lot less than the $4.7 billion verdict rendered last year over asbestos in the company's baby powder.
Johnson & Johnson is just one of the players in the opioid game, and the Oklahoma case is just one of many lawsuits looking to follow in the footsteps of the massive tobacco lawsuit that, coincidentally, struck a blow at the nation's cigarette manufacturers at about the same time the opioid crisis was born.
That 1998 settlement sends $350 million to Pennsylvania annually, and a second settlement Attorney General Josh Shapiro negotiated last year increased that by another $357 million in 2018-19 and $279 million for the ensuing 12 years.
Shapiro is also one of 40 AGs suing Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin, claiming the potent narcotic was pushed despite early signs of addiction.
"While Pennsylvania paid the price, Purdue made more than $35 billion in revenue, he said in May.
And that's the root of the disease. As with any penalty in criminal or civil court, it has to hurt enough to stop the behavior. It has to cost enough to make it unprofitable for a company to churn out poison that local, state or federal government has to pay to cure.
Maybe $572 million will be enough in Oklahoma. Maybe it won't. The real value in that verdict is in being a ground-breaker in the opioid crisis.
The New York Times on the Group of 7, minus one
One of the few concrete pledges to come out of the Group of 7 summit in Biarritz, on France's Atlantic coast, was an aid package of $20 million for Brazil and its neighbors in the Amazon basin to fight fires raging through the rainforest. The sum was a trifle, given the scale of the fires and the size of the economies of the donors (the charity of the actor Leonardo DiCaprio separately pledged $5 million), but it was meant to highlight a more ambitious program of protection and reforestation in the works.
More noteworthy than the token action was the fact that President Trump skipped the session at which it was taken, which happened to be devoted to climate, oceans and biodiversity. Even more noteworthy was that neither French President Emmanuel Macron, the convener of this year's summit and champion of action on the Amazon fires, nor hardly anyone else seemed to find this particularly disturbing.
In fact, they seemed relieved. Other American officials were there, said Mr. Macron, and it had never been his goal to challenge Mr. Trump's climate denialism. In fact, he said he and the American president had a "long, rich and totally positive discussion on the Amazon fires. Maybe they did, but by now Mr. Macron should know better than most that the Trump who likes being agreeable face to face can quickly turn mean at a distance.
That, in fact, was the real theme of the Biarritz summit in the third year of the Trump presidency, as described by Peter Baker of The Times: "Rule 1 at the G7 Meeting? Don't Get You-Know-Who Mad. Mr. Macron cautiously avoided trying to draft a joint communiqu

Texto completo: In the first few months of his presidency, Donald Trump surrounded himself with a certain sort of ramrod military man: John Kelly, Michael Flynn, H.R. McMaster and Jim Mattis. These men had or appeared to have the kind of manly virtues and bearing that Trump likes to see in himself: courage, toughness, combativeness.
But when you look at how someone like, say, Jim Mattis forged his character, you realize that he is actually the exact opposite of Trump. Mattis built strengths and virtues through the steady application of intense effort over decades. Trump is a man who has been progressively hollowed out by the acid of his own self-regard.
Mattis is a man who is intensely loyal to others and attracts loyalty among those around him. Trump is disloyal to others and attracts disloyalty in return.
The contrast between how these two men were forged is so stark that it throws into relief how character is and isn't formed.
Mattis was a mediocre college student. He partied too much and was jailed for underage drinking. But then he discovered the Marine Corps. His new book, "Call Sign Chaos," which he wrote with Bing West and which will be released next week, is purportedly about leadership but really it is a portrait of Mattis' life-defining love for the Marine Corps.
His prose sings when he describes those times when he was out on some battlefield exercise with front-line Marines. When he is stuck away inside the Pentagon or high up commanding NATO, you feel his longing for their presence.
Mattis reads Roman writers like Marcus Aurelius, but he is no stoic. Decade after decade he is touring some front or another, starting a million affectionate conversations. "How's it going?" "Living the dream, sir," is how those conversations begin. He trusts his Marines enough to delegate authority down. He clearly expresses commander's intent in any situation and gives them latitude to adapt to circumstances.
Love is a motivational state. It propels you. You want to make promises to the person or organization you love. Character is forged in the keeping of those promises. If, on the other hand, you are unable to love and be loved, you're never going to be in a position to make commitments or live up to them. You're never going to forge yourself into a person who can be relied upon.
Mattis' drive, born of his devotion to the Corps, is his most telling trait. He works insanely hard, propels himself extremely quickly, making himself, every day, a better Marine. Much of the work is intellectual. He thought the second Iraq War was a crazy idea, but when he was ordered to command part of it, he started reading Xenophon and ancient books about warfare in Mesopotamia.
"If you haven't read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent, because your personal experiences alone aren't broad enough to sustain you," Mattis and West write.
He is also willing to submit himself to an institution. Somebody like Trump is anti-institutional. He thinks every organization is about himself, and every organization's procedures and traditions should bend to his desires.
But a person with an institutional mindset has a deep reverence for the organization he has joined and how it was built by those who came before. He understands that institutions pass down certain habits, practices and standards of excellence.
Mattis asserts that his way of doing warfare is simply the Marine way. In the Marine way, for example, "Amateur performance is anathema, and the Marines are bluntly critical of falling short.  Personal sensitivities are irrelevant." Each mission gives him another body of knowledge, another strength, greater capacity to live execute his devotion to his country.
James Davison Hunter, who wrote, "The Death of Character," once noted that good character does not require religious faith. "But it does require the conviction of truth made sacred, abiding as an authoritative presence within consciousness and life, reinforced by habits institutionalized within a moral community. Character, therefore, resists expedience; it defies hasty acquisition. This is undoubtedly why Søren Kierkegaard spoke of character as engraved,' deeply etched."
In Mattis' career you see something one saw in the great George Marshall's career: that you need to work within a structure to be creative. Both generals were total company men, dedicated to their service, yet they were constantly trying to change its practices to keep up with the times.
Mattis barely mentions Trump in this book and doesn't describe what must have been one of the truly challenging tasks of his life - working under Trump without getting tainted.
He didn't write about Trump because he didn't want to undermine the people still working inside the administration. But, he told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic: "There is a period in which I owe my silence. It's not eternal. It's not going to be forever."
Like Goldberg, I think it would be proper for Mattis to end his silence about Trump before the next election. Voters need his firsthand perspective to make a judgment about the fitness and character of the commander in chief.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — During a recent speech in New Hampshire, President Trump unveiled a new campaign line: “Whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me.” Citing the strong economy, Trump told voters that if he loses, “your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes,” so “you have no choice!” To underscore the point, when he finished speaking the music that came on was the Rolling Stones singing, “You can’t always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, well, you might find, you get what you need.”
Not far away, in Nashua, the Biden campaign rolled out the very same message about its candidate. “I know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that,” Jill Biden told Democratic primary voters. “Your candidate might be better on, I don’t know, health care, than Joe is. But you’ve got to look at who’s going to win this election. And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, ‘Okay, I personally like so and so better,’ but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.”
To put it another way: “Whether you love Joe or hate him, you have got to vote for him.”
Trump and Biden are both running on the same message, but with one crucial difference: Trump is directing his at independent swing voters; Biden is directing that message at his base.
The New York Times reports that, despite his commanding lead in the polls, Biden faces a problem of low enthusiasm. While Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., “have followings rooted in zealous support for their ideas,” Biden’s support is rooted in a belief that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Trump. Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University’s Polling Institute, told the paper that while spending time recently in Iowa “I did not meet one Biden voter who was in any way, shape or form excited about voting for Biden. They feel that they have to vote for Joe Biden as the centrist candidate, to keep somebody from the left who they feel is unelectable from getting the nomination.”
The danger of running on electability is that all it takes is one catastrophic gaffe or debate stumble for Biden’s support to collapse. And even if Biden manages to secure the Democratic nomination, running a campaign built exclusively on ousting the sitting president, rather than enthusiasm for your own ideas, is not a winning strategy. Just ask President Mitt Romney.
Trump, by contrast, has his base wrapped up and energized. The president consistently enjoys nearly 90% support among Republicans (in contrast with Barack Obama, who had just 75% support among Democrats at this stage in 2011, according to Gallup). For Trump, the risk of this strategy is not with his base, but with the swing voters who put him over the top in 2016.
According to Axios, in 2016 “20% of Trump’s voters told exit pollsters they didn’t like him.” These reluctant Trump voters put Trump in the White House and are critical to his keeping it in 2020. Like many Americans, they are exhausted by the chaos of the Trump presidency. Biden is targeting his message directly at these voters, echoing George W. Bush’s 2000 campaign pledge to restore “honor and dignity” to the Oval Office in the wake of the tumultuous Clinton presidency.
Yet, despite their exhaustion with Trump, many of these voters approve of his economic performance in office. Despite recent market turbulence, the U.S. economy remains strong. On Trump’s watch, unemployment has reached a five-decade low, and our biggest economic problem is that we have 1.6 million more job openings than we have unemployed workers to fill them. And a decade after the Great Recession, wages are finally rising, with those at the bottom of the economic ladder benefiting the most.
The problem is that Trump has made virtually no effort to win over these reluctant Trump voters again, much less expand his base by appealing to Americans who did not vote for him but are benefiting from his policies. He is betting that presidents seeking re-election in a full-employment economy don’t tend to lose. The danger is that, if the economy takes a nose dive, his argument for reelection with these voters does as well.
Biden and Trump are giving voters an ultimatum rather than inspiration. They both may find that running on your unlikability is a risky strategy.

Texto completo: [Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's on TV
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. You can't make this stuff up: In the early 1990s, the biographer Lee Israel hit a bump in the road. Her latest book had failed to sell, and her agent told her to find another way of making a living. Then Israel stumbled upon a letter by the vaudeville comedian Fanny Brice and sold it to a bookshop. After learning that such writings would be worth more if they had meatier content, Israel went on to forge and sell roughly 400 missives by dead writers. Her crime spree is retold in this engrossing dramedy, based on Israel's memoir. Melissa McCarthy stars as the crabby, whiskey-guzzling literary forger alongside Richard E. Grant, who plays her free-spirited drinking buddy and accomplice Jack Hock. Both actors earned Oscar nominations for their performances. And though the characters have questionable morals, they're a joy to watch.
COLLEGE FOOTBALL on various networks. College football has officially returned. If you didn't catch the first games of the season, don't fret -- dozens are airing all day Saturday. Watch Florida Atlantic and Ohio State face off at 12 p.m. on Fox. Alabama, last year's runner-up, takes on Duke in Atlanta at 3:30 p.m. on ABC, and at 7:30 p.m., Oregon and Auburn go head-to-head for the first time since the 2011 B.C.S. National Championship.
What's Streaming
THE JUNGLE BOOK (1942) Stream on Amazon or Criterion Channel; rent on iTunes. Rudyard Kipling's classic collection of fables has spawned a growing Disney franchise of animated and live-action adaptations. This movie isn't one of them. An independent feature by the Korda brothers, the adventure centers on the young hero Mowgli (Sabu), a boy who was raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. After he is captured by villagers and reunited with his mother, he tries to give life among human beings a try. That doesn't go too well: Mowgli discovers the greed and violence that comes with civilization, and ultimately decides that he can't live between both worlds. The film was nominated for four Oscars, including best cinematography and music.
PIRATE RADIO (2009) Stream on Amazon; rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. This rowdy comedy from Richard Curtis ("Love Actually") revisits the mid-1960s, when, believe it or not, the British government all but banned rock music from the airwaves. Defying that censorship, a group of pirate D.J.s (led by Bill Nighy and Philip Seymour Hoffman) set up a radio station on an old tanker and broadcast their favorite hits to millions of listeners from the sea. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote: "Stuffed with playful character actors and carpeted with wall-to-wall tunes, the film makes for easy viewing and easier listening."

Texto completo: What should communities do as climate change escalates threats like sea-level rise?
Until now, much of the focus has been on disaster response, with very little discussion of orderly, strategic retreat from areas at risk. After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for example, the New York state governor’s office ran a public service announcement that made clear the focus would be on rebuilding.
But a paper published this month in the journal Science makes a case that, sometimes, retreating from na-ture instead of fighting it can actually open up new opportunities for communities.
“There’s a definite rhetoric of, ‘We’re going to build it back better. We’re going to win. We’re going to beat this. Something technological is going to come and it’s going to save us,’  ” said A.R. Siders, an assistant professor with the disaster research center at the University of Delaware and lead author of the paper. “It’s like, let’s step back and think for a minute. You’re in a fight with the ocean. You’re fighting to hold the ocean in place. Maybe that’s not the battle we want to pick.”
In fact, people have often retreated after catastrophic weather events. New Orleans, for example, lost roughly half of its population after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the city’s population is still only 85 percent of what it was before the storm. But those retreats have generally been ad hoc, not managed, and not necessarily done with broader social interests in mind.
“After major storms, a lot of communities want to relocate,” Siders said.
She noted that in New York after Sandy, a number of communities applied for buyout programs to relocate, but only two of them actually got funding.
That left people in those other communities with limited options, most of them bad.
If they were wealthy, they could walk away from their homes and take the financial loss. But if they had lower income, they often couldn’t make that decision and faced the prospect of remaining in houses they knew were at high risk of flooding. And even if they did manage to sell their homes, they wouldn’t be lessening the risks so much as transferring them to others.
The new paper lays out ways communities could practice managed retreats that would address their broader needs. Lack of access to reliable climate-hazard maps, for example, makes it difficult to make informed choices about risk. Such maps must be improved and updated regularly, the paper said.
“I’m so glad that these kinds of pieces are getting written and that they’re laying out this sort of agenda for research and practice and thinking around these like very inevitably thorny and conflictual questions of retreat,” said Liz Koslov, an assistant professor in the department of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study.
If communities could practice strategic retreats, the study says, doing so would not only reduce the need for people to choose among bad options, but also improve their circumstances.
Siders pointed to Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin, a town of about 500 that, after one too many floods, moved itself out of the flood plain. The community took that challenge and turned it into opportunity, reorienting the business district such that it could take advantage of highway traffic and powering it entirely with solar energy - and they did this in the 1970s.
The article not only stresses the viability of retreat but challenges the idea that retreat is based exclusively on geographical factors like elevation and proximity to the coast.
“Retreat, in practice, depends at least as much on sort of social, economic, cultural geography,” Koslov said.
“It’s not that everywhere should retreat,” Siders said. “It’s that retreat should be an option. It should be a real viable option on the table that some places will need to use.”

Watchdog: Comey violated FBI policies, mishandled memos

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Former FBI Director James Comey violated FBI policies in his handling of memos documenting private conversations with President Donald Trump, the Justice Department's inspector general said Thursday.

The watchdog office said Comey broke bureau rules by giving one memo containing unclassified information to a friend with instructions to share the contents with a reporter. Comey also failed to return his memos to the FBI after he was dismissed in May 2017, retaining copies of some of them in a safe at home, and shared them with his personal lawyers without permission from the FBI, the report said.

"By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees -- and the many thousands more former FBI employees -- who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information," the report said.

The report is the second in as many years to criticize Comey's actions as FBI director, following a separate inspector general rebuke for decisions made during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. It is one of multiple inspector general investigations undertaken in the last three years into the decisions and actions of Comey and other senior FBI leaders.

Trump, who has long regarded Comey as one of his principal antagonists in a law enforcement community he sees as biased against him, cheered the conclusions

Twitter. He wrote: "Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General's Report. He should be ashamed of himself!"

The White House in a separate statement called Comey a "proven liar and leaker."

But the report denied Trump and his supporters, who have repeatedly accused Comey of leaking classified information, total vindication. It found that none of the information shared by him or his attorneys with anyone in the media was classified. The Justice Department has declined to prosecute Comey.

Comey seized on that point in defending himself on Twitter, saying, "I don't need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a ‘sorry we lied about you' would be nice."

He also added: "And to all those who've spent two years talking about me ‘going to jail' or being a ‘liar and a leaker' -- ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president."

At issue in the report are seven memos Comey wrote between January 2017 and April 2017 about conversations with Trump that he found unnerving or unusual.

These include a Trump Tower briefing at which Comey advised the president-elect that there was salacious and unverified information about his ties to Moscow circulating in Washington; a dinner at which Comey says Trump asked him for loyalty and an Oval Office meeting weeks later at which Comey says the president asked him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

One week after he was fired, Comey provided a copy of the memo about Flynn to Dan Richman, his personal lawyer and a close friend, and instructed him to share the contents with a specific reporter from The New York Times.

Comey has said he wanted to make details of that conversation public to prompt the appointment of a special counsel to lead the FBI's investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel one day after the story broke.

The inspector general's office found Comey's rationale lacking.

"In a country built on the rule of law, it is of utmost importance that all FBI employees adhere to Department and FBI policies, particularly when confronted by what appear to be extraordinary circumstances or compelling personal convictions. Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a Special Counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure," the report says.

"What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome," it adds.

After Comey's firing, the FBI determined that four of the memos contained information classified at either the "secret" or "confidential" level. The memo about the Flynn interaction that Comey sent to Richman did not contain any classified information, the report said.

Comey said he considered his memos to be personal rather than government documents, and that it never would've occurred to him to give them back to the FBI after he was fired. The inspector general's office disagreed, citing policy that FBI employees must give up all documents containing FBI information once they leave the bureau.

FBI agents retrieved four of Comey's memos from his house weeks after he was fired.

The office of Inspector General Michael Horowitz also is investigating the FBI's Russia investigation and expected to wrap up soon.

Last year, the watchdog office concluded that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had misrepresented under oath his involvement in a news media disclosure, and referred him for possible prosecution. That matter remains open with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington.

Plan to deport sick children stirs outcry

Texto completo: A new Trump administration policy to deport families of seriously ill children receiving treatment in the United States provoked fresh outrage this week, as health care providers feared for their patients, elected officials demanded oversight, and advocates planned lawsuits to stop the action.
Senators Edward J. Markey and Elizabeth Warren and Representative Ayanna Pressley said Thursday that they will send a letter to the administration demanding internal documents on its decision to suddenly end what's known as “deferred action" — a policy that allows some immigrants to remain in the United States legally while they receive medical care for complex conditions.
Lawyers for some of the immigrants said Monday that US Citizenship and Immigration Services has begun informing families that it no longer considers requests for deferred action, and that the families must leave the country within 33 days. The change applies to children and adults with cancer, cystic fibrosis, HIV, epilepsy, and other diseases.
The policy change came as a surprise to patients, caregivers, lawmakers, and some federal officials, with no formal announcement.
“It is absolutely immoral to be deporting children with cancer," Markey said Thursday. “We cannot and will not allow this to stand."
Critics called the decision a new low for an administration that has aggressively targeted immigrants.
“Deportation from the United States with this type of medical condition is a death sentence," Pressley said.
She and Representative Judy Chu of California also called for congressional oversight of the administration's decision.
Massachusetts' prestigious hospitals draw many patients from around the globe. Immigration lawyers estimate that at least 40 families in the state are vulnerable to the change in policy — with thousands affected nationally, said Mahsa Khanbabai,who chairs the New England chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
Nationwide, about 1,000 people per year request deferred action for medical and other humanitarian reasons, according to the association.
Meanwhile, the change appeared to stir confusion among federal agencies. Officials at US Citizenship and Immigration Service, which has been notifying affected families, said the responsibility now falls to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Neither agency responded to requests for comment Thursday, but according to published reports and immigration attorneys, ICE officials appeared blindsided by the move.
“The agencies haven't talked to each other," Khanbabai said. “This is a haphazard attempt to try to create more fear and confusion."
It's unclear if the families told to leave the country would even be able to do so. Khanbabai said she has two clients who are in no position to return to their home countries: one young man is hospitalized for a mental illness, and the other, a 14-year-old girl, needs ongoing treatment at Boston Children's Hospital for a complex heart condition.
The change in the deferred action program is one of many steps the Trump administration has taken to tighten immigration. The New York Times reported that in a separate action, the administration was clamping down on a special protective visa, known as the U visa, that allows crime victims who have helped law enforcement authorities with investigations to stay in the United States.
The policy change for sick immigrants drew a rebuke from Democratic candidates for president, including Warren, who called it “heartless," and former vice president Joe Biden.
“There is no national security justification for further traumatizing sick kids at their most vulnerable," Biden said on Twitter. “Like all bullies, Trump is purposefully targeting the little guys — but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer and cystic fibrosis were off-limits."
Markey tweeted that ICE officials told his staff they would force the affected families to go through deportation proceedings before deciding their fate, which he called “dehumanizing," while immigration lawyers called it a grueling and unworkable option for people receiving medical treatment.
Legal groups are considering litigation to try to halt the policy change.
“The ACLU will fight to protect these sick children and their families, and to hold this administration to account. Every option is on the table, and we're currently exploring litigation options," Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement Thursday.
Children's Hospital officials said in a statement that they are deeply concerned about the policy change.
“We are encouraged by the visibility that has been generated by the many advocates who share our concern," hospital officials said. “We are hopeful that their advocacy on behalf of children will result in a reversal of this policy."
Boston Medical Center officials said in a statement that they “oppose any actions that could prevent people from accessing the health care they need."
Dr. Fiona Danaher, a pediatrician at Mass. General's clinic in Chelsea, said 33 days is not nearly enough to plan the transfer of a patient overseas. And for some children, the treatment or equipment they need — such as breathing and feeding tubes — may not be available in their home countries.
“This administration has been taking many steps to undermine the health of immigrant children, and this is just the latest," she said. “It's appalling."

Texto completo: Democrats foolishly wasted the first two years of Trump's presidency waiting for Republicans to see the light. They hoped for a savior from behind enemy lines, cheering in turn as new candidates for the role came along: Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, the anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed article about dysfunction in the White House.
But what the Democrats have failed to understand is that just because someone is an enemy of their enemy, he isn't necessarily a friend. They keep hoping for that "reasonable" Republican who can save bipartisanship and the fate of the country. But there will be no such miracles. Where the Republican Party is concerned, what you see is what you get.
Yes, Trump has caused some Republicans to abandon the GOP, including Iowa's longest-serving Republican lawmaker, Andy McKean. Others, including right-wing radio host Joe Walsh, have broken with the president but not the party. The importance Democrats have attributed to these defections is as crazy as it is seductive. Liberals infer the turncoats are sure signs that the GOP establishment secretly opposes Trump and that the Republican Party is cracking. Trump is an outlier, they conclude; a crazy figure, a cancer on Republican politics.

But that's nonsense. In fact, poll after poll has found that more than 80% of Republicans nationwide approve of Trump's performance in office.
And if you're thinking an alternative Republican would fix everything, let's consider Walsh, the latest disaffected conservative to repudiate Trump, announcing that he will mount a primary challenge to the president. As recently as 2017, Walsh tweeted that President Obama "was held to a lower standard cuz he was black." When declaring his candidacy to ABC's George Stephanopoulos, Walsh expressed regret for his role pushing the long-discredited racist conspiracy that Obama is Muslim and born in Kenya, as well as his sexist and racist 2017 tweets against Sen. Kamala Harris: "If you're black and a woman, you can say dumb things. Lowered bar." And of course there is also Walsh's long-standing trickle-down, tea party worldview.
Many of the prominent Trump-rejecting conservatives are speaking out from comfortable perches in the mainstream media -- Ana Navarro, David Brooks, Meghan McCain, Joe Scarborough. It's debatable whether their opposition is more likely to change unsettled minds or reinforce support for Trump. The Republican never-Trumpers are far smaller in number and more impotent in political influence than their large bullhorns suggest. The Trump turncoats and defections from the Republican Party make for dramatic news but they are simply political aberrations with outsize visibility and little political consequence.
Dangerously, Democrats cling to the myth that Trump is an affront to Republican values and that he represents a cult figure who is singularly yanking the party rightward to insanity. Trump is not deviating from current conservative values; he uses his hateful, scurrilous persona in service of advancing those political values.
In fact, Trump is the unsurprising, direct byproduct of years of Republican policies and politics. He is cut from the same cloth as his Republican predecessors, pushing tax cuts for the wealthy, suppressing the black vote, defunding climate science, fighting reproductive rights, and denigrating facts and expertise to make our politics more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright lies. He is from the same party that insisted there were "weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq to initiate an ill-advised war, the party that brought us birtherism.
Trump has marched in lockstep with the party's goals, opposing living wages and slashing corporate taxes. He has doggedly pushed to limit healthcare access, expand government assistance for millionaires and guarantee the right of billionaires to pollute our air and water. Yes, Trump may be cruder and more duplicitous than his predecessors, but he is cast from the same mold. That's why no one should have been surprised that Dick Cheney co-hosted a recent fundraiser benefiting both Trump's reelection effort and the national GOP.
The liberal fantasy holds that ship-jumpers like Walsh can help peel votes from Trump in a general matchup. If anything, the president's Republican opponents are his useful idiots. He can turn them into handy, willing foils, holding them up as misguided, self-serving jesters whose late-coming, dubious political conversions ultimately highlight Trump's steadfast conservatism. The truth is, the never-Trumpers can't truly change their spots without denouncing the bulk of Republican values.

Pay TV titan AT&amp;T continues its scorched earth ways

Texto completo: DISCLAIMER: The views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not represent those of the New York Amsterdam News. We continue to publish a variety of viewpoints so that we may know the opinions of others that may differ from our own.
In early June 2019, in an opinion piece for the television industry trade magazine BROADCASTING & CABLE, I expressed my displeasure and befuddlement at AT&T/DirecTV discontinuing retransmission consent negotiations that had been underway for months with my Howard StirkHoldings' stations. I thought the Pay TV titan was wrongfully (and selfishly) using its monopolistic and gatekeeping power against my local free-to-the-home TV stations. As one of the very few African American TV owners in the country, I also thought AT&T/DirecTV was impacting diversity by truncating my market access, limiting viewer choices, and trenching upon cherished First Amendment values which hold that more voices are better than fewer. I urged AT&T/DirecTV to return to negotiations.
To my chagrin, however, the response I and several other similarly situated small station operators who use a joint negotiating agent got was the filing of a complaint at the FCC by AT&T/DirecTV. The complaint did not claim that we had violated the FCC rule specifically governing joint negotiations. That rule (47 CFR § 76.65(b)(l)(viii)) prohibits only joint negotiations among independent broadcasters "in the same local market," and none of the targeted stations share a local market. Moreover, many of the stations had used the same joint agent in successfully completing agreements with AT&T/DirecTV during the 2016 RTC negotiations round. Instead, the gravamen of AT&T/DirecTV's complaint is that we are not negotiating in "good faith" by having a joint agent.
AT&T/DirecTV's complaint is a naked effort to achieve through an adjudicatory proceeding the type of blanket prohibition on joint RTC negotiations that it has been unable to achieve through the FCC's rulemaking process or its expensive and extensive lobbying efforts in Congress. Indeed, if AT&T/DirecTV truly believed that this group of small stations had violated their good faith obligation in renegotiating RTC agreements it would have brought its complaint following the exact same process in 2016. It did not, and it should not have done so in 2019.
To be sure, the FCC has considered rulemaking proposals-including in 2011 and 2015-that would have prohibited joint negotiations among broadcasters altogether. AT&T /DirecTV enthusiastically supported those proposals, but the FCC decided on a narrower approach and prohibited only joint negotiations among broadcasters in the same local market. Having failed twice to get its desired prohibition adopted by the FCC, AT&T/ DirecTV cannot now reasonably argue that the prohibition exists nonetheless and using a joint negotiating agent violates the rule when it doesn't.
In an effort to nevertheless claim that even if having a joint agent is not a per se violation of the rule, because AT&T/DirecTV also had a nondisclosure agreement in place with the joint negotiating agent in 2016, the "totality of the circumstances" establish a failure to negotiate in good faith. Hog wash! The 2016 NDA was in place when AT&T/DirecTV and many of the same parties involved now successfully completed their RTC negotiations. Clearly it was not an issue, then or now. In addition, throughout the 2019 RTC negotiations, AT&T/DirecTV was engaged in active negotiations with the same joint agent without issue. It wasn't until AT&T/DirecTV started to pull out of its negotiations that it even raised the 2016 NDA as an issue, and even after filing its complaint AT&T/DirecTV has continued to acknowledge and engage with the joint agent for the involved stations.
To add further smoke but no light, AT&T/DirecTV also made unsupported allegations against Sinclair Broadcast Group (Sinclair who I partner with in JSA's & SSA's agreements for my Myrtle Beach and Flint, Michigan stations), the broadcaster the Pay TV industry loves to hate, suggesting it must be behind the failure to conclude successful RTC negotiations this year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it did not actually seek any relief or FCC action against Sinclair related to those allegations. Obviously, those allegations were simply designed to attract media attention for its complaint. In any event, the totality of the actual circumstances demonstrates that the stations involved in negotiating for RTC with AT&T/DirecTV have acted in good faith throughout the entire course of the joint negotiations, both now and in 2016.
Nonetheless, AT&T/DirecTV's objective in filing its complaint against my HSH stations is obvious: seek government intervention in private negotiations to divide and conquer small, secondary market stations by forcing them to negotiate separately and lose their skillful private negotiator. Even though AT&T/DirecTV is the largest MVPD in the country, it apparently believes that its negotiating position would be improved by an FCC order declaring joint RTC negotiations off-limits for broadcast stations. But it is absurd on its face that AT&T/DirecTV needs the government's help in private negotiations with my HSH stations and the eight other small broadcast station groups it has targeted.
Meanwhile, as reported by The New York Times July 20, 2019, and MULTICHANNEL NEWS magazine July 5, 2019, in just the past six weeks alone, AT&T/DirecTV has leveraged its market power to force the blackout of 120 Nexstar stations in 97 markets and the loss of CBS-programming for 6.5 million customers. This is apparently part of a broader strategy to isolate broadcasters and manufacture controversy while it continues to vigorously lobby Congress to renew STELAR and seek more favorable terms to the MVPD industry.
Neither the FCC or the public should condone AT&T/DirecTV's bullying tactics, let alone allow it to dictate the outcome of marketplace negotiations by depriving a handful of small station groups of a critical tool in their retransmission consent negotiations with the nation's largest MVPD, the right to continue using joint negotiating agents for stations in separate markets.
AT&T/DirecTV should instead focus on serving its customers and advancing the public interest, which means fairly negotiating and paying for the unique and popular programming local, free-to-the home television provides. I earnestly pray they will do so, and will return to the negotiating table in good faith.

Trump attacks Fox News, but the network remains silent

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- The one constant with President Donald Trump's increasingly frequent attacks on Fox News has been the network's refusal to respond, even as the president complains that "Fox isn't working for us anymore."
In recent days, however, some Fox personalities like Bret Baier, Juan Williams and Brit Hume have ceased looking the other way.
Fox is stocked with pro-Trump commentators like Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and Laura Ingraham, and the president is a frequent viewer. He speaks up when he sees things that displease him, with news anchor Shepard Smith, chief White House correspondent John Roberts, commentator Williams, contributor Donna Brazile and network pollsters all targeted this summer. He groused Wednesday that news anchor Sandra Smith offered "zero pushback" in an interview with Democratic communications director Xochitl Hinojosa.
One tweet Wednesday cut to the very heart of the network's existence.
"The new Fox News is letting millions of great people down," he wrote. "We have to start looking for a new News outlet. Fox isn't working for us anymore."
Fox's official response? There was none.
Current Fox executives declined comment for this story. They're not necessarily alone; NBC News doesn't respond to tweets, either. Some who've heard the president's complaints liken it to a basketball coach "working the refs," and the best stand stoically while getting an earful. There's a concern that responding just gives Trump's commentary more attention, and that Twitter attacks are simply the white noise of this administration.
The calculus is also different at Fox because that's where many Trump supporters gravitate. If their favorite politician is perceived as being under attack by their favorite network, how would those viewers react? Trump didn't like questions posed by Fox's Megyn Kelly during a 2015 debate, and boos rained down upon her when she later appeared before a live audience gathered for a Hannity telecast.
"I don't think Fox cares about Trump's attacks," said Alex Conant, a Republican communications consultant who heads Firehouse Strategies. "They just care about their audience."
Still, Trump's contention that Fox is "working for us" is damaging for a network when that perception has made it more difficult to cover the Democratic presidential campaign. Trump hasn't distinguished between Fox's opinion and news employees, which the network has long done to counter the argument that its purpose is to advance one point of view.
"That's so scary that the president of the United States thinks that a media organization is his," said Williams, the commentator called on to give a liberal point of view, on a Fox radio program. "You know, that's not good."
Fox's elder statesman Hume tweeted in response to Trump on Wednesday : "Fox News isn't supposed to work for you."
It's worth noting that even as Trump has attacked Fox, he still seeks its audience more than any other outlet. He gave an interview Thursday to Fox's Brian Kilmeade.
Fox News is routinely the most watched cable network, with an average of 2.33 million viewers in prime time last week.
Williams is among the few at Fox to directly answer a Trump attack through a column he wrote this week for The Hill . Trump last week called Williams "pathetic," "nasty" and "wrong," yet "he couldn't be nicer as he asked to take a picture of him and me for his family."
Williams said that when Trump was a candidate, he and Fox's Ed Henry ran into him in the lobby of the network's Manhattan headquarters. A Fox maintenance man asked if he could get a picture with Trump, and Williams took it. The man then offered to reciprocate by taking a picture of Williams and Trump; Williams said he never asked for it or brought his family into the conversation.
When he was a Washington Post reporter covering Mayor Marion Barry's administration, Williams' house was broken into and his wife found a butcher knife left on their bed. He was fired by National Public Radio for a commentary after Sept. 11, 2001 when he said he was nervous about getting on planes with Muslims.
"Those attacks are a step down from the blitz" launched by Trump's supporters after the president's tweet, he said.
Baier, on his show last week, defended Fox's pollsters from attacks. "Fox has not changed," Baier said. "We have a news side and an opinion side."
After one hostile tweet, Smith addressed one viewer Wednesday by looking at the camera and saying, "Good afternoon, Mr. President. It's nice to have you with us."
To a certain degree, responses like Baier's make a network comment unnecessary, Conant said. Fox can also perversely benefit from certain Trump attacks -- they make the point that there's more to the network than Hannity's unabashed love, he said.
"This could be an opportunity for Fox to boast," said Carl Cameron, a longtime Fox News Washington reporter who's left the network. It would help the morale of its remaining news reporters if Fox took out an ad highlighting times that news reporters had gotten under the president's skin. "That's what news divisions are supposed to do," he said.
Silence sends a message of its own, Cameron said.
CNN and The New York Times, two news organizations that are frequent Trump targets, ignore many attacks but respond to some. The Times tends to be strictly informational. The Times has countered Trump's nickname of the "failing" newspaper by tweeting statistics that show "business is thriving." When Trump cast doubt on a story about North Korea building missile sites, the Times noted that it was "based on satellite imagery analyzed by experts."
CNN has been more combative, noting in November 2017 that "it's not CNN's job to represent the U.S. to the world. That's yours. Ours is to report the news."
After a verbal confrontation between Trump and Jim Acosta last November, CNN tweeted that "the president's ongoing attacks on the press has gone too far. They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American."

Texto completo: Law enforcement are searching for a couple, believed to be armed and dangerous, who managed to overpower guards and escape from a transport van in Utah.
Blane and Susan Barksdale, aged 56 and 59, were being extradited from New York to Pima County, Arizona, on first-degree murder charges when officials say the duo somehow managed to overtake the van they were being transported in and escape Monday evening.
Since then, the couple has thus far managed to avoid capture. The United States Marshals Service is offering a $10,000 reward, per fugitive, for information leading to their arrest.
The Barksdales are wanted for the April murder of 72-year-old Frank Bligh, of Tucson, Arizona. After fleeing Arizona, the two, accused of murder, as well as first-degree burglary, arson, and other charges, were arrested a month later in Rochester, New York.
Along with Blane Barksdale’s nephew, Brent Mallard, 31, the couple is believed to have burglarized Bligh’s home and set it on fire, causing an explosion. The home wasn’t occupied during the fire, and police later determined that Bligh, last seen at a Tucson bar, had been murdered. Brent Mallard is being held at a jail in Arizona on arson and second-degree burglary charges.
Authorities warn that about 100 firearms were stolen from Bligh’s house and worry that the Barksdales might have accessed the hidden cache of stolen weapons.
“With their original case, the person that they allegedly murdered, they also stole close to 100 firearms,” Michael Adams, a deputy U.S. marshal in Tucson, told the New York Times Wednesday. “We have to assume that they somehow made their way back to that weapons cache.”
It is still unclear how the two managed to overpower and escape the transport van. David Gonzalez, a U.S. marshal for the District of Arizona, said in a Thursday interview with KTAR News that the couple had an eight-hour head start on authorities.
“When they took advantage of these two, basically, security guards … they tied them up, left in them in the middle of nowhere," Gonzalez said, noting that it took the guards two or three hours to break out of the van.
Gonzalez said that the duo were able to get a vehicle from an acquaintance in northern Arizona. He also said that this was not the first time the Barksdales had fled law enforcement.
“We were kind of shocked because we initially arrested them back in May for the murder in Tucson,” Gonzalez said. “They were on the run, and we tracked them to western New York, and then we knew it’d just be a matter of time before they got back to Tucson to face charges.”
Tucson police, the Pima County Sheriff’s Office, the Apache County Sheriff’s Office, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the FBI are all assisting with the investigation.
The couple was last seen driving a red GMC Sierra truck with Arizona plates. Officials said that they have information that the Barksdales might be traveling through Arizona.

Texto completo: Imagine that a time machine transports you back 1,500 years to a forest road in what is now Croatia. You get up, dust yourself off, and look around. You're in the Early Middle Ages.
A local inhabitant approaches you, and you see something you didn't expect. You're immediately struck by the shape of their head. It's extremely elongated toward the back, resulting in an egg shape.
As a curious crowd gathers, you see that there are other people in the crowd whose heads are deformed in a different way. Their foreheads have been flattened, and their skulls have grown upward higher than normal.
Researchers, after looking at evidence from skeletons in a mysterious burial pit found in 2013 near the town of Osijek in eastern Croatia, say people who practiced artificial cranial deformation appear to have lived in the area at the time.
But the reason they changed the shape of their heads is still a matter of speculation.
“The impetus behind why these things were done can't really be deciphered by the kind of data we have," said Kendra Sirak, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School in the Reich Lab of Medical and Population Genetics. Sirak was one of the lead authors on a new paper on the skeletons, which was published last week in the journal PLOS One.
“We think it could be some sort of visual indicator of group membership," she said. The people who did it may have thought, she said, that “it sets us apart. It makes us unique. It allows us to identify other members of my same group."
Practiced for some 5,500 years by cultures around the world, artificial cranial deformation involves binding the growing heads of infants and children with bandages, planks, boards, or bricks. As the skull grows under constant pressure, it becomes misshapen, resulting in oblong heads and other unusual shapes. Anthropologists have documented this practice on every inhabited continent, but it isn't common. Today it continues in only a few remote tribes.
Skulls unearthed in the burial pit near Osijek were the first with artificial cranial deformation found in Croatia.
The pit contained three sets of human bones, as well as animal skeletons and broken pottery. Two of the skulls were deformed, but in different ways — one resembled an elongated egg, and the other had a flattened forehead, causing the cranium to grow higher.
Researchers, led by Mario Novak, an archeologist at the Institute for Anthropological Research in Croatia and Ron Pinhasi of the University of Vienna, examined the bones, scanned and reconstructed the skulls, and analyzed their DNA.
The findings suggested that between the fifth and sixth centuries, during the Migration Period, people of starkly different cultural backgrounds may have interacted more than previously thought. The study also provides the earliest genetic evidence of the presence of people from East Asia in Europe.
The Migration Period was the time in Western European history around and after the fall of the Roman Empire. It was marked by frequent warfare, a virtual disappearance of urban life, and the movement of so-called barbarian peoples into what had been the Western Roman Empire, according to britannica.com.
The researchers found that the skulls belonged to three malnourished males, between the ages of 14 and 16, who had lived between A.D. 415 and 560. There were no signs of violent death.
DNA testing deepened the mystery. It revealed the flat-foreheaded skull belonged to someone from somewhere in the Middle East, northern Africa, or southeastern Europe. The egg-shaped skull belonged to someone from East Asia. The unaltered skull likely came from a person of West Eurasian ancestry. Their genes were relatively unmixed, suggesting they had moved from these places or their parents had.
“Based on the presented data, it seems that different types of ACD [artificial cranial deformation] (or the lack thereof) might be associated with affiliation with a particular cultural group (at least in the case of Osijek), leading us to consider that populations with different ancestries and potentially different cultures were interacting intimately" in the area at the time, the study said.
Novak speculated to The New York Times that the youths may have died as part of a ritual sacrifice, because the contents of the pit were similar to those found in other cases of sacrifice from the same period.
Sirak said researchers don't know what technique was used to deform the youths' skulls, but the effects were obvious.
“We can definitely see the direction in which they were deforming the skull even if we don't know exactly what they were using to do so," she said.
Researchers looking at the remains in the pit “found something that was unexpected," she said.
She said they were puzzled by the similarities among the three and the differences. The youths were buried in the same pit, were around the same age, and had the same history of nutritional deficiency, for example. But at the same time, they had different ancestral backgrounds and had different forms of cranial modifications.
“There was something more going on there that we really don't understand," she said.

Lamenting the last of Calhoun's sweet peaches [Corrected 08/31/2019]

Texto completo: I suppose most of you -- and my editors -- would rather I focus on the big issues of the day than offer my absurd lamentations on the last of the Calhoun County peaches.
But I say screw it. I really couldn't give two figs. I love those white Tom Ringhausen peaches, dammit.
And we just finished the last of them, brought to me by two kindly retired Chicago police officers. They, too, are peach freaks. The rains and floods had washed away Tom's peach stand on the Illinois River. They found him in a tavern.
I paid them $35 for a half bushel and bought breakfast at Harvey's on 31st for their trouble. They're old-school coppers and didn't want to be identified.
"Put me in the paper?" he asked. "Hell no."
"In the paper? No way," she said.
Still, we had a good breakfast, and it was nice to be in the 11th Ward not wondering if I'd run into a short-shanked Daley.
Yet the peaches are gone now. There should still be some more growing on the trees down there, and I might drive down and get some. But now, today, without them, I'm a bit malevolent in my peachlessness.
If you're upset that I'm writing about my Calhoun County peach desires, do what others do, send an email, or tweet at me, calling me a (deleted) bedbug or whatever the insect of the week is now.
Or you may join the mob and say you wish I were (deleted) dead, my (deleted) sightless eyes staring into the (deleted) void from the (deleted) pike upon which my ripening (deleted) head is pinned.
Or hiss at me for ignoring that idiotic franchise chicken sandwich debate.
Yes, it's idiotic. If it's from a franchise, then it's crap and you know it. Crap is the base element in any franchise business model: crap consistency. The crap chicken, or burger, you get in Seattle is the same you'll eat at 96th and Commercial or on Long Island. Franchise chicken sandwiches? Please. It's all crap, my friends. Eat and enjoy.
You may also hate on me for being a (deleted) peach-eating Chicago Fire fan. We actually hate ourselves now.
I won't mock you in return. Insulting people on Twitter over their fruit of choice while wearing a fuzzy pink hat and a false identity, perhaps even a ridiculous cartoon head, is as common as nihilism.
And what is a peach, anyway, but a piece of fruit?
But this was a white peach from Tom Ringhausen's orchards in Calhoun County, Illinois, grown on the high limestone bluffs between the Illinois and Mississippi rivers.
We had a big basket on the kitchen counter, but the last of the peaches are gone. To eat them by hand without ruining yet another polo shirt, you've got to do the lean, the way you eat a good Italian beef sandwich or a succulent drenched goat meat taco from Birrieria Zaragoza on 48th and Pulaski. Those peaches are so sweet that your jawbones will crack from the sensation and joy.
My friend Jeff Carlin, the WGN radio producer and a baker of some renown, loves them, but says they're far too juicy to make a pie. That's what I like. A peach as large as a softball, ripe and firm and juicy. And for those about to accuse me of food porn, take your mind out of the gutter. Ringhausen peaches taste as pure as the voices of angels. I can no longer hear them sing.
There are other important topics, yes, but who cares now that the Ringhausen peaches are done?
The New York Times and angry left-leaning journalists everywhere (is there any other kind?) are upset that stupid stuff they post on Twitter may be quoted by President Donald Trump and his friends, and used against them to demonstrate their political bias.
Isn't that exactly what we do to politicians, plumbing their social media -- even old high school yearbooks -- hoping to unearth weapons against them in our woke-a-thon culture wars? And isn't that exactly what advocate groups on the left do to conservatives?
But that jabbering isn't a Ringhausen peach, is it? No. That's just a bunch of self-important people who once thought they'd grow up to become heroic iconoclasts but instead found they'd become Kemalists of the Washington Way, protecting the establishment. Now they seek to become a protected class.
Reporters quote politicians. But politicians can't quote us? What's next, Newspeak? Ah, but Newspeak is already here, isn't it?
Locally, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx wants to erase all pot convictions in a desperate grab for positive spin, given her bungling of the Jussie Smollett hate hoax case. I'd much rather that she vows she won't invoke the Fifth Amendment if questioned under oath by the special prosecutor.
But that is merely the dry, bitter fruits of what passes for Cook County justice. It is not a Ringhausen peach. Now that the white Ringhausen peaches are gone, I threatened them at work that I'd write a rhyming poem about them and touch my inner W.S. Merwin.
Instead, let me just say that Tom Ringhausen called with the bad news that the spring floods had washed out the bridges and roads down there, and growers had trouble bringing their produce to market.
He said some have lost 40 percent of their crop. That's devastating. And depressing. But he's a tough old jarhead Marine, determined to fight, and he will.
He's got to. Without those Tom Ringhausen peaches, what's a summer for?

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand dropped her bid for president Wednesday after she failed to qualify for the next Democratic debate.
Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, posted a video message to her supporters confirming her decision, making her the latest Democrat to drop out of the crowded field looking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump next year.
A 10-year veteran of the Senate, Gillibrand campaigned heavily throughout Iowa and New Hampshire in the months after launching her campaign in January.
But she struggled to raise campaign funds and generate support in the key public-opinion polls used to determine the field for the primary debates, leaving her out of next month's ABC News/Univision debate in Houston.
In a video posted to her social media accounts, Gillibrand vowed to continue to work to defeat Trump and flip the Senate into Democratic hands.
"I know this isn't the result we wanted," Gillibrand said. "We wanted to win this race. But it's important to know when it's not your time and to know how you can best serve your community and country."
Gillibrand, of Brunswick, Rensselaer County, made family-related issues a centerpiece of her campaign, often highlighting her experiences as a mother as she pushed for a national paid family leave policy.
She was also outspoken on abortion issues, vowing only to appoint Supreme Court justices who support Roe v. Wade abortion rights.
Gillibrand, 52, was re-elected to a six-year term in the Senate last November. Within days of her re-election, she confirmed interest in a 2020 presidential bid despite previously vowing to serve a full Senate term.
She has been in the Senate since 2009, when she was appointed to succeed Hillary Clinton, who had gone on to become secretary of state.
Prior to that, Gillibrand served in the House of Representatives, representing a conservative-leaning district north of Albany.
Gillibrand based her presidential campaign in Troy, not far from her upstate New York home.
This week, she was officially eliminated from the upcoming Sept. 12 debate when she failed to meet the Democratic National Committee's polling threshold, which required candidates to garner 2% support in at least four qualified polls and have at least 130,000 individual donors to make the debate stage.
In an interview with The New York Times, Gillibrand said she would endorse a Democratic candidate in the race but has not yet decided who.
She also vowed to support the eventual Democratic nominee.
Gillibrand did qualify for the first two Democratic primary debates, enjoying a viral moment in the second one when asked what her first act as president would be.
"The first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand said to big applause.
In a tweet, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, called Gillibrand a "great talent, a rising star in the Democratic Party & a good friend."
"The people of NY are fortunate to have her back full time," Cuomo tweeted.
Gillibrand's exit leaves two New York Democrats vying for their party's presidential nomination: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Andrew Yang, a New York City entrepreneur who was born in Schenectady.
Yang qualified for the next debate; de Blasio did not.

'Factory' offers peek at Obamas' mission

Texto completo: If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way from former President Barack and former first lady Michelle Obama's new production company.
The Obamas launched Higher Ground Productions last spring in partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would "harness the power of storytelling" and touch on "issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more."
"American Factory," the first title from Higher Ground, is available now on the streaming service. It manages to make good on the Obamas' pledge, which is a promising sign for what's to come.
The documentary, which won a directing award this year at the Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of a Chinese billionaire who opens a glass factory in a former General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, and hires both American and Chinese workers. The film looks at how their cultures clash (with the Chinese workers getting lessons in how Americans are overconfident and need to be praised), how the workers are taken advantage of by management (they're convinced not to join a union for the security of their jobs) and how automation could take many of their jobs.
Through the emotional stories of some of the workers, and even the billionaire chairman himself, the documentary winds up being funny, shocking, upsetting and eye-opening. The film works well without a central narrator, allowing the people themselves to tell their stories. There also plenty of How did they get that?! insider footage, courtesy of Dayton-based co-filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar.
At almost two hours, the documentary doesn't drag. Instead, it sets an impressive precedent for the Obamas' forthcoming projects.
What else does Higher Ground have in the works?
Here's what's planned so far:
A drama series about the fashion world: "Bloom" will show the struggles faced by women of color in post-World War II New York. It's written and produced by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri ("Thelma & Louise").
A biopic about Frederick Douglass: Higher Ground plans to adapt the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom" into a movie about the abolitionist and statesman who was born into slavery.
An anthology series about unnoticed deaths: "Overlooked" will be a scripted show adapted from The New York Times' column of the same name that looks to correct the issue of obituaries primarily being written about white men.
A traveling kids' food show: "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents" is a half-hour preschool series from creators Jeremy Konner ("Drunk History") and Erika Thormahlen that will tell the story of food.
A Michael Lewis nonfiction series: The show will be based on "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," the book by the best-selling "Moneyball" and "The Big Short" writer about everyday heroes safeguarding the nation.
A documentary about camp for disabled teenagers: "Crip Camp" will tell the story of how a ramshackle summer camp down the road from Woodstock transformed young lives in the early '70s.

The real story about the rise from slavery

Resumen: Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine wrote the lead article, "America Wasn’t a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One." Instead of a democracy, the Constitution’s Article IV, Section 4, declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government." In addition to not understanding our Constitution, Hannah-Jones’ article, like in most discussions of black history, fails to acknowledge that black Americans have made the greatest gains, over some of the highest hurdles in the shortest span of time than any other racial group in mankind’s history.

Texto completo: The New York Times has begun a major initiative, the "1619 Project," to observe the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It aims to reframe American history so that slavery and the contributions of black Americans explain who we are as a nation.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine wrote the lead article, "America Wasn’t a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One." She writes, "Without the idealistic, strenuous and patriotic efforts of black Americans, our democracy today would most likely look very different — it might not be a democracy at all." There are several challenges one can make about Hannah-Jones’ article, but I’m going to focus on the article’s most serious error, namely that the nation’s founders intended for us to be a democracy. That error is shared by too many Americans. The word democracy appears nowhere in the two most fundamental founding documents of our nation — the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Instead of a democracy, the Constitution’s Article IV, Section 4, declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government."
The founders had utter contempt for democracy. James Madison, the acknowledged father of the Constitution, wrote in Federalist Paper No. 10, that in a pure democracy "there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual." At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, delegate Edmund Randolph said, "that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy."
The U.S. Constitution is replete with anti-majority rule, undemocratic provisions. One provision, heavily criticized, is the Electoral College. In their wisdom, the framers gave us the Electoral College so that in presidential elections, heavily populated states could not run roughshod over sparsely populated states. In order to amend the Constitution, it requires a two-thirds vote of both Houses, or two-thirds of state legislatures, to propose an amendment, and requires three-fourths of state legislatures for ratification.
In addition to not understanding our Constitution, Hannah-Jones’ article, like in most discussions of black history, fails to acknowledge that black Americans have made the greatest gains, over some of the highest hurdles in the shortest span of time than any other racial group in mankind’s history. The evidence: If black Americans were thought of as a nation with our own gross domestic product, we’d rank among the 20 wealthiest nations. It was a black American, Gen. Colin Powell, who headed the world’s mightiest military. A few black Americans are among the world’s wealthiest. Black Americans are among the world’s most famous personalities.
In 1865, neither a slave nor a slave owner would have believed that such progress would be possible in less than a century and a half, if ever. As such, it speaks to the intestinal fortitude of a people. Just as importantly, it speaks to the greatness of a nation within which such progress was possible, progress that would have been impossible anywhere else. The challenge before us is how those gains can be extended to a large percentage of black people for whom they appear elusive.

Kirsten Gillibrand drops out of 2020 presidential race

Texto completo: Kirsten Gillibrand has ended her campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
The two-term senator for New York told the New York Times in an interview she would endorse another Democratic candidate, but she hasn't yet decided. Gillibrand took to the trail with an anti-Trump message, calling the White House incumbent a "coward" during her launch in March outside Trump Tower in Manhattan. She also pushed women's issues as part of her "Brave Wins" agenda, including abortion access and affordable child care.
The 52-year-old, however, failed to register above the low single-digits in the polls. She outpaced in opinion surveys and fundraising even by fringe candidates such as entrepreneur Andrew Yang and self-help author Marianne Williamson.
Gillibrand ended her campaign after failing to qualify for the September round of Democratic presidential primary debates. She had not met the 130,000 donor threshold or the polling threshold.
Tweet
"It's important to know when it's not your time, and to know how you can best serve your community and country," Gillibrand said in a video announcing the end of her candidacy. "I believe I can best serve by helping to unite us to beat Donald Trump in 2020."
In 2017, the former congresswoman became one of the first senators to call for the resignation of Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat popular with the Democratic Party's Left, after sexual misconduct allegations.
Languishing in the polls and under pressure to drop out, Gillibrand said earlier this month she would “of course" accept an offer to become the eventual nominee's running mate. She added, “I will do public service in all its forms."

Conservatives have every right to scrooten journalists [Corrected 08/28/2019]

Texto completo: If the right-wing sleuths now mining social media and other venues looking for dirt on journalists critical of President Donald Trump find regrettable, offensive or embarrassing statements in my past, allow me in advance to say this:
It was satire. ... I was hacked. ... You're taking my words totally out of context. ... I was young then and those sentiments do not reflect my current thinking. ... Those are just notes for a novel. ... (and for screengrabs or photos) You're looking at digitally-altered deepfakes!
Might it be necessary for me to pull out one or more of these excuses/explanations/misdirections?
I'm honestly not sure. I've been posting, without a filter and sometimes rashly, on Facebook, Twitter and blog platforms for more than 15 years, tangling with critics and floating notions too half-baked even for a column.
But I'm lucky enough to have come of age well before the era when it was possible to share every fleeting thought with the world. By the time these platforms opened up I was aware of their power and relative permanence. No digital record was ever made of the stupid stuff I might have said in high school and college.
Tom Wright-Piersanti wasn't so lucky. Wright-Piersanti, a political editor for The New York Times, was reportedly demoted last week after Breitbart published a series of offensive, and in some cases anti-Semitic, tweets he'd posted when he was in his early 20s, long before he began working for the paper, and that he described in his apology as "lame attempts at edgy humor."
The tweets had been unearthed by what a Times news story a few days later described as "a loose network of conservative operatives allied with the White House" that is busily compiling "dossiers of potentially embarrassing social media posts and other public statements by hundreds of people who work at some of the country's most prominent news organizations" in order to "discredit news organizations deemed hostile to President Trump."
This network has already targeted several other media members, and its goal is clear: "To silence critics and undermine the public's faith in independent journalism," as Times Publisher A.G. Sulzberger put it in a message to his staff.
Ominous, yes.
But unfair? Media organizations will have a serious goose/gander problem if they complain about searches of the public record for "gotcha!" moments and evidence of hypocrisy. Reporters routinely rummage through the pasts of celebrities, star athletes and titans of business as well as political figures looking for information that ostensibly reflects on their present-day character.

They have no persuasive claim to immunity, which is what former Mayor Richard M. Daley had in mind when he told reporters to go scrutinize themselves because he got "scrootened every day."
With luck, this mean-spirited effort will hasten a conversion to a culture of perspective and forgiveness when it comes to certain errors of the past. That conversion is increasingly urgent as oversharing, impetuous children of the internet grow up and assume the roles of responsible adults -- and digital archives steal from us the memory-erasing mercies of the sands of time.
With luck, the effort also will help us remember our humanity.
Yes, news flash, Trump's critics are themselves flawed people. So, I suspect, are those in the "loose network of conservative operatives" now sifting through online data streams for vintage nuggets of bigotry, inanity and indecency.
What they find shouldn't and won't diminish the impact of factual analysis of Trump's contemporary bigotry, inanity and indecency.
To fight back, media organizations seeking to reassure their journalists should establish an informal statute of limitations on what constitutes punishable offenses on social media for all but the most noxious content. And everyone should use stories like this to remind themselves, their friends and their children that today's "edgy" quip intended for a private audience can turn into tomorrow's reputation-shattering scandal.
Meanwhile, our social media platforms should give users the option of automatically deleting or privately archiving posts after a certain length of time, since in most cases they are meant to be ephemeral -- and the only people reading them after a certain point are snoops.
For the past year I've used a third-party app -- TweetDelete.net -- that gets rid of all my tweets and retweets after a month. To date, Dame Posterity has not called to complain.
Whatever mortifying material remains in any venue, just remember it doesn't reflect the person who I am today and was merely intended to be funny if it is indeed genuine, which it probably isn't.

New laws target race, high maternal, baby deaths

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD  Illinois is taking steps to combat troubling maternal and infant mortality statistics after one lawmaker was moved to action by a series of reports which showcased the states and countrys maternal health shortcomings, particularly among African-American women.
The lawmaker is Chicago Democrat Mary Flowers. The troubling statistics: Pregnancy-related complications kill more mothers in the United States than in any other developed country, and African-American mothers die at three to four times the rate of white mothers.
What is happening and what has been happening is truly unacceptable, Flowers said. I can only go back to the articles that I read about the unconscious bias and untreated conditions and unrecognized factors that lead to poor outcomes when it comes down to African-American women and women of childbearing age. Its unacceptable.
Last week, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the last bills from a package of new laws to create new maternal legal rights and a task force to study the high death rate among African-American mothers and babies, to force hospitals to collect more accurate data on maternal mortality and be better equipped to treat pregnant women, and to mandate proper training for medical staff that are likely to treat pregnant women.
The U.S. weakness in maternal health care was detailed in a 2017 study by National Public Radio and ProPublica which showed 26.4 of each 100,000 mothers in the U.S. died from pregnancy-related complications in 2015, while the next closest developed country was the United Kingdom with 9.2 per 100,000.
The racial disparities are driven home in a report by the Illinois Department of Public Health which said an average of 73 women in Illinois died each year from 2008 to 2016 within one year of pregnancy, and African-American women were six times more likely to die of a pregnancy-related condition during that span. According to the report, 72 percent of those deaths and 93 percent of violent pregnancy-associated deaths were preventable.
State Sen. Jacqueline Collins, a Chicago Democrat and Senate sponsor of several of Flowers maternal health care measures, said the disparities existed across income and education levels.
We found that a lot of highly educated black women in high paying careers are more likely to die as a consequence of childbirth than a white woman without even a high school diploma, she said.
Flowers said a 2018 New York Times Magazine article which also caught her attention detailed that, in the U.S., African-American infants were more than twice as likely to die than white infants, at 11.3 deaths per 1,000 babies and 4.9 deaths per 1,000 babies, respectively.

Texto completo: In the century that it has grown into the nation's most-watched sport, the NFL has expected players to act like warriors willing to suck up the pain and sacrifice their bodies for the good of the team, and to be grateful they are paid handsomely to do it.
Yet even as awareness of the physical toll of the sport rises, the sudden retirement just two weeks before the start of the season by Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck at age 29 still provided a jolt.
Luck, a former first overall draft pick and one of the league's brightest stars over the past seven seasons, said Saturday he could no longer take the years of pain and rehabilitation from a host of cringe-worthy injuries: a lacerated kidney, injured ribs, at least one concussion, torn cartilage in his throwing shoulder and, most recently, a calf and ankle injury.
It was not the first time a young player had stepped away supposedly in the prime of his or her career - several have done so in recent years - but it was one of the more vivid examples of the changing dynamics of a league striving to portray the game as safer than ever while its players increasingly weigh the consequences of continuing a career where the long-term physical issues only build as the seasons pile up.
Unlike in earlier eras, when players had to grind out a decade or more to maintain a high standard of living, the financial arrangements of today's top players often make it easier to retire comfortably before they hit 30.
"There's an immense amount of pressure for a No. 1 draft pick to be out there," said Chris Borland, who shocked the football world when he retired from the San Francisco 49ers in 2015 after one standout season. "But you're seeing more players prioritize their health over money."
The minimum salary for rookies today is approaching $500,000. First-round draft picks receive signing bonuses worth millions of dollars more before they have taken a snap. (Luck's first bonus was $14.5 million.)
In years past, the third contract was pay dirt. Getting a second contract is now the goal, and Luck did. He signed a five-year contract worth up to $122 million in 2016. Even though he is leaving about half that money on the table, Luck has already been paid $97 million.
Of course, Luck is not really young in football years. By the time most NFL players reach his age, they have been playing tackle football for two decades or more.
Living with pain and overcoming injuries is a central feature of their lives, and many are trapped in a cycle of injuries and rehabilitation that wear on them mentally as well as physically. It is a toll that carries on long after they retire.
"I feel tired, and not just in the physical sense," Luck said Saturday. "The lack of progress just builds up and you turn the corner and run into another stumbling block."
Last season, Matt Hasselbeck, a former NFL quarterback - and a former teammate of Luck - who is now a television analyst, recalled a conversation he had with Luck before Luck had surgery on his shoulder that kept him off the field for the 2017 season. Hasselbeck warned Luck that the year of rehabilitation was "going to be the worst year of his career. It's no fun, football's not fun, life's not fun."
Hasselbeck said Luck admitted he had not considered the psychic pain that goes with surgery and rehabilitation.
"Everything's harder, everything's miserable and you're going to ask yourself, 'How long do I want to do this?'" Hasselbeck said.
Luck responded to the year of hard work with a throwback season in 2018. He played all 16 games, passing for 4,593 yards and 39 touchdowns, both of which were the second-best marks of his career. With a 10-6 record, Luck led the Colts back to the playoffs after a three-year absence.
The future once again looked bright for Luck, the son of a well-known football executive, who after a standout career at Stanford stepped in to replace Peyton Manning as the face of the Colts.
Still, though Luck said Saturday that a weight had been lifted from his shoulders with his decision to retire, some fans could not abide his decision. A round of boos greeted him as he left the field of a preseason game Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis as news outlets began reporting his decision.
Randy Grimes, a former player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers who struggled with injuries and now helps athletes overcome addiction to painkillers, said he was not surprised. In his view, little has changed since he last played in 1992.
Players are competitive, coaches are competitive, owners want a return on their investment and fans just want to watch football. The confluence often conspires to force players to make decisions that are not in the best interest of their long-term health.
"It's always being in the training room and being part of practice," Grimes said. "That in itself forces you into a place of isolation and on an island even when you're in the middle of it but alone."
Some players - including Grimes during his career - have coped with the injuries and isolation by taking addictive painkillers that numb the pain but leave them with dangerous addictions. Other players grapple with the depression that comes from being in constant pain.
Then there is the ongoing issue of potential cognitive decline caused by repeated head hits. The NFL has changed many rules of the game to reduce the number of dangerous plays, placed independent neurologists on the sidelines during games and strengthened its return-to-play protocols. Even so, many retired players struggle with memory loss, impulse control issues and in some cases, suicidal thoughts.
On Saturday, Luck told reporters he wavered about whether to stop playing. But over time he recognized that he spent the past four years on a never-ending cycle of trying to get healthy, and that he needed to break that loop.
Two weeks ago, he said, he decided to jump off the NFL train and focus on himself.
"I've come to the proverbial fork in the road," he said Saturday, "and I made a vow to myself if I ever did again, I would choose me in a sense."

Texto completo: MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell says he has a source who told him Russian oligarchs signed off loans given to President Trump by Deutsche Bank.
Lawyers for the German lender told a federal appeals court Tuesday that the bank has documents sought by Democrat-led House committees, which subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and Capital One for financial records related to Trump, his family, and businesses, but declined to reveal if they have Trump's tax returns.
While the New York Times reports that Deutsche Bank, which has done business with Trump for two decades, does have some of Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, O'Donnell told colleague Rachel Maddow in the hand-off between their shows Tuesday evening he can go a bit further.
"This single source close to Deutsche Bank has told me that the Trump — Donald Trump's loan documents there show that he has co-signers. That's how he was able to obtain those loans. And that the co-signers are Russian oligarchs," he said.
A shocked Maddow replied, "What? Really?"
"That would explain, it seems to me, every kind word Donald Trump has ever said about Russia and Vladimir Putin, if true, and I stress the 'if true' part of this," O'Donnell added.

O'Donnell later said this source told him that Trump's tax returns reveal "he pays little to no income tax in some years."
He added that his source said Trump, a longtime real estate businessman, would not have been able to obtain his loans with Deutsche Bank without these co-signers he described as "Russian billionaires close to Vladimir Putin."
"If true," O'Donnell said, "that would be a significant factor in Vladimir Putin's publicly stated preference for presidential candidate Donald Trump over presidential candidate Hillary Clinton."

Texto completo: As a government official in World War II, Hamilton Warren was outraged to learn that a black colleague made half as much as his white peers. So, after the war, the wealthy Harvard graduate and his wife Barbara pitched up a tent in a remote corner of northern Arizona. Working together with the Hopi people, they built a school open to every race, creed, orientation, and nationality, and dedicated to values of environmental stewardship, physical labor and cultural understanding.
Verde Valley School was and remains among the most genuinely progressive boarding schools anywhere. It believed in an identity that was forged, not just inherited; in the possibility of transcending differences, not reinforcing them; in making a break from the past, not remaining fixated by it.
So it is with so much in the United States, which makes it so different from nearly everywhere else. When Hernán Cortés and his men landed on the coast of Mexico, in 1519, they encountered a world of utter barbarity: incessant warfare, endemic slavery, and human sacrifice on an immense scale. They, in turn, inflicted their own barbarities: massacres, epidemics, forced labor and religious intolerance.
The Conquistadors and their successors also imported millions of African slaves. Seen in the overall context of the Western Hemisphere — or, for that matter, most of the pre-modern world — the arrival of more than 20 slaves in Virginia a century later was abominable, but not unique.
Yet something else came to America: the idea of liberty. Unlike the taste for plunder, which is nearly universal, the idea of liberty isn’t. It emerges from a distinctive intellectual tradition that, within a limited sphere, emphasized the claims of individual conscience, a disintermediated relationship with God, and a skeptical view of state power.
It also emerged from a unique historical circumstance. Cortés was a soldier acting in the name of the Spanish crown and the Catholic Church. Among those who came to North America, many were religious dissenters and political refugees, starting with the Huguenots in Canada and the Mayflower Pilgrims. They could be tyrants and bigots, violent and superstitious. But they also saw themselves, if sometimes self-servingly, as nonconformists and victims of political persecution.
It was this self-conception that encouraged successive generations of religious dissenters, movement starters, and freethinkers to go their own way. As importantly, it also made it untenable, over the long haul, for those in positions of authority to oppose them. This is the thought that I’d like to contribute to The Times’s 1619 Project.
In America, the argument against liberty has been the argument of hypocrites. To deny freedom to others inevitably means subverting the principle through which one can claim freedom for oneself.
That’s why every significant liberation movement in the U.S., from abolition to suffrage to civil rights to marriage equality, has made its case by appealing to foundational principles, not rejecting them.
This is a beautiful country, especially amid red rocks under vast skies. But as people like Hamilton Warren knew, the real beauty of America has less to do with the outer vistas than the inner ones — the ever-renewing possibility of being “more perfect” according to ideals that remain our starting point and destination.

John Kerry’s son cut business ties with Hunter Biden over Ukrainian oil deal

Texto completo: John Kerry’s stepson rushed to play damage control at the State Department after his business partner Hunter Biden cut a deal with an oligarch-owned Ukrainian gas company in 2014, according to internal State Department correspondence obtained by the Washington Examiner.
The correspondence adds to the questions about Biden's business activities, which have dogged the 2020 Democratic primary campaign of his father Joe. Hunter Biden's long history of drug and alcohol abuse, which contributed to his divorce and his dismissal from the Navy Reserve, has also attracted unwelcome publicity for the Democratic front-runner.
An email released to the Washington Examiner shows that Biden’s decision to join the board of Ukraine’s Burisma Holdings sparked immediate concern within his inner circle about the political optics. Biden’s father Joe — now vying for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination — was then vice president and overseeing the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy.

At the time, Hunter Biden, now 49, and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of then-Secretary of State John Kerry, co-owned Rosemont Seneca Partners, a $2.4 billion private equity firm. Heinz’s college roommate, Devon Archer, was managing partner in the firm. In the spring of 2014, Biden and Archer joined the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company that was at the center of a U.K. money laundering probe. Over the next year, Burisma reportedly paid Biden and Archer’s companies over $3 million.

Hours after Biden’s board appointment went public on May 13, 2014, Heinz emailed Matt Summers and David Wade, two of his stepfather’s top aides at the State Department.

“Apparently Devon and Hunter both joined the board of Burisma and a press release went out today,” wrote Heinz. “I cant speak why they decided to, but there was no investment by our firm in their company.”
The email was obtained through a public information request filed by the conservative nonprofit group Citizens United. The organization said the email raises questions about why Heinz was in touch with the State Department about Biden’s business dealings.

“This email raises a lot of questions. Why would Chris Heinz distance himself from Hunter Biden’s decision to join Burisma’s board in an email to John Kerry’s senior staff at the State Department?” said Citizens United President David N. Bossie in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “It’s time for Joe Biden to answer questions about his family’s business in the Ukraine and what his own role was in those dealings.”
“These are questions that congressional oversight committees should be demanding answers to,” he added.

Heinz’s spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that he was not involved in the Burisma deal and has not been invested in Rosemont Seneca Partners since 2015.

“Chris Heinz was involved in Rosemont Capital. Through Rosemont Capital, Mr. Heinz owned a minority interest in Rosemont Seneca Partners until 2015,” said Heinz’s spokesperson Chris Bastardi. “Neither Mr. Heinz, nor any business in which he had an interest, was involved in Burisma.”

Heinz was troubled by his partners’ decision to join the Burisma board and immediately took steps to end his business relationship with Biden and Archer, according to a source familiar with the situation.

In 2014 and 2015, Burisma paid $3.4 million to a company called Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, according to the New York Times. That company paid Biden up to $50,000 a month, according to the report. During the same time period, Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire its lead prosecutor who was investigating wrongdoing at Burisma, raising questions from critics about whether this was related to his son’s position at the gas company.

Biden stepped down from the Burisma board this year, before his father announced his presidential run. Archer was convicted for his role in an unrelated Ponzi scheme last November, but was recently granted a new trial.

Journalists trust, but don't verify, Iran and its front groups

Texto completo: There’s a bizarre phenomenon common among American journalists whereby they approach U.S. politicians and policymakers with the utmost cynicism, as they should, but take foreign adversaries such as Iran and its proxies at their word. The polarization of national security and U.S. foreign policy in the wake of 9/11 has only exacerbated this concerning trend.
In the aftermath of President George W. Bush’s “Axis of Evil” speech, for example, New York Times’ correspondent Neil MacFarquhar wrote that a million people attended an anti-United States rally in Iran, and reported:
'Any time we face international problems, democracy stops,' said Ali Reza Haghighi, a political science professor. 'Now all the discourse must be against the Americans.' Mr. Khatami worked to keep his reformist agenda alive 'The stress on democracy is the soul of the Islamic Revolution.'
The only problem?
The 1 million figure was an Iranian government estimate, however, Iranians who attended the rally estimated that no more than 200,000 were present, many of whom were state workers forced to attend.
MacFarquhar also obscured the true affiliation of his source: Haghighi was actually a government official as well as a professor. Thus, rather than report honestly or critically on Iran, MacFarquhar allowed the Iranian government to use him to amplify its official propaganda line.
This kind of coverage, unfortunately, is no outlier. The Western press regularly treats Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif with the same credibility. Zarif’s word is reported as trustworthy, even though his track record dating back decades suggests he is an unrepentant liar.
In 2003, for example, it was Zarif — then Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations — who negotiated secretly with senior State Department and National Security Council officials. The group reached a deal in which Iran agreed not to infiltrate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iraq as the U.S. invaded the country.
The details are summarized here, and covered in greater depth in Dancing with the Devil, a history of U.S. diplomacy with Iran and other “rogue regimes.” Suffice it to say that Zarif lied, even by the admission of the Iranian press. He saw his promises as a means to lull and distract, rather than a commitment to actually implement.
This was not the only time Zarif publicly and clearly lied.
At the height of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s murderous campaign against not only Syrian opposition activists, but also Syria’s majority Sunni Arab population, Zarif swore repeatedly that Iran had no military role in Syria. Even the Iranian press regularly contradicted the spin Zarif peddled to credulous American officials and journalists. And, yet, despite having played U.S. journalists for fools several times, Zarif remains a go-to Iranian celebrity whose words and statements are passed along uncritically and without context.
Journalists’ embrace of Zarif is likely rooted in the liberal media’s animosity to the Trump administration and, more broadly, the Republican foreign policy establishment. Certainly, Trump lies, and lies repeatedly, something the press constantly highlights. Rightfully so, as to shine a light on or otherwise call out the president’s lies is the job of the press.
The only question is why they do not embrace the same standard for Zarif, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, or Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
This brings us to the alleged Aug. 25 crash of Israeli drones in Beirut. The New York Times openly sourced its report on the drone’s origins to Hezbollah sources without mentioning that terrorist group’s past unreliability.
Indeed, Hezbollah initially said it shot down the drones before other sources said they crashed on their own. More broadly, while Israel has acknowledged strikes in Syria and while the U.S. government has confirmed Israeli strikes in Iraq, both the Israelis and the U.S. remain mum on what happened in Beirut. Hezbollah, too, wants foreign journalists to trust but not verify. Rather than simply secure the wreckage, Hezbollah rushed to quarantine it.
Imagery and other evidence could easily have established the origin and make of the drones, and journalists should have demanded to see them. Perhaps the drones were Israeli, but they also may very well have contradicted the Hezbollah and New York Times’ narrative (locals in Beirut suggest they had Iranian markings).
Given how both Iran and Hezbollah have used Lebanon as a forward operating base and have bragged previously about suicide drones (not usually Israel’s modus operandi), the possibility that events in Beirut may have been a ‘work place’ incident should at least be considered in initial reports.
New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger has said that his paper will not back down on its reporting about Trump. It should not.
But the New York Times and other papers should hold all politicians — regardless of party, nationality, or ideology — to the same standard, including foreign regimes. The fact that Islamic Republic regime fixers, its senior officials, and even designated terror groups get a freer pass on press scrutiny than U.S. politicians suggests the journalistic method is deeply broken.

Texto completo: NEWTON — A crush of television cameras was waiting outside the Newton Fire Department headquarters on Tuesday. The mayor was there, too.
But when Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III arrived, he said he wasn't ready to light the match that would set the Massachusetts political world on fire. At least not yet.
“I'm here visiting the fire chief at the fire station," Kennedy insisted, as shutters clicked and reporters closed in. “It's an important institution for my district, right down the street from where I live. And I want to make sure if my house burns down, they're going to respond quickly."
Of course, this wasn't just a routine firehouse visit by a congressman concerned about public safety. It was the latest step in Kennedy's rollout of his potential primary campaign against Senator Edward J. Markey in 2020.
On Monday, Kennedy filed paperwork for a statewide campaign and wrote a Facebook post acknowledging his interest in the Senate seat. On Wednesday, he is scheduled to visit Worcester Technical High School, traveling to a vote-rich city far outside his district, which runs from Brookline to Fall River.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Kennedy insisted he has not made a final decision about whether to run against Markey, but sketched out the reasons why he is thinking about it.
The Democratic Party, he said, needs to focus not only on battling President Trump but also on “addressing the failures and fissures in how our society, our government, has been broken long before Donald Trump got in office."
“If we are solely focused on what Trump does, and not healing those wounds and making our country stronger, then shame on us — and I think that is the challenge for a new generation," Kennedy said.
“Senator Markey is a good man," Kennedy added. “I think I've got new ideas and a new approach, and if I get into this race, that's what this race will be about."
He did not say what those new ideas or new approaches would be.
But he rejected the notion that he would merely offer a fresh face, as the 38-year-old scion of a famous political dynasty running against a 73-year-old liberal stalwart who has served in Congress since 1976.
“This is not an issue about age," Kennedy said, naming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 79, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, 70, as two lawmakers he admires. “And, again, Senator Markey is a good man."
Markey, for his part, has been taking the prospect of a Kennedy challenge seriously.
On Tuesday, he released a list of 116 Massachusetts state senators and representatives who have endorsed his reelection bid, including Senate President Karen Spilka and House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo.
The list represents a majority of the 200-seat Legislature, where Markey served from 1973 to 1976.
“I am humbled to have the support of so many friends and colleagues across Massachusetts for re-election, and I pledge to fight for them and all communities in the Commonwealth every day," Markey said in a statement. “The people of Massachusetts have always been at the forefront of the challenges of our time — universal health care, same-sex marriage, earned sick time, equal rights — and I want to continue leading those fights in the United States Senate."
In recent months, Markey has been working to shore up his left flank, teaming up with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, to sponsor the Green New Deal, a sweeping proposal to combat climate change that has galvanized progressive activists.
He has also beefed up his political operation, hiring John Walsh, a former chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, to help guide his reelection bid.
The prospect of a Kennedy-Markey race has drawn comparisons to another intraparty showdown, between Representative Ayanna Pressley, the former Boston city councilor who ousted a 10-term incumbent, Michael Capuano, last year.
On Tuesday, Kennedy rejected the comparison, and Pressley made clear she is steering clear of the brewing fight, for now.
“Is there a race?" Pressley said. “I'm just trying to keep up with all the developments, just like you. But again, what I'm focused on is doing what the people of the Massachusetts 7th sent me to do, as I said, and to not forget the plot, and the plot is the people, and so I'm here in the community and in Washington legislating. That's what I'm focused on."
Kennedy's entrance into the race would make him the third primary challenger to Markey, overshadowing two lesser-known candidates, labor attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan and businessman Steve Pemberton, who have been running for months.
In an attempt to grab a bit of the Kennedy spotlight, Pemberton invited the news media to speak to him immediately following Kennedy's event on Tuesday. He came to Newton Centre Green, just 200 yards from the Newton Fire Department.
Pemberton said he'd bring valuable life experience to the Senate, as a former foster child raised in New Bedford who lost his mother to alcoholism and his father to gun violence.
“The torch does get passed to new generations, but with lived experience," Pemberton said, borrowing a famous phrase from Kennedy's great-uncle, President John F. Kennedy. “I'm fighting for the unseen, the forgotten, and the unchosen who are all around us."
In his Facebook post on Monday, Kennedy rejected the notion that he should wait for an open seat. He exapnded on the theme on Tuesday.
“I don't think there's anybody out there that would think today's environment, what we see across the country today, is the best this country can do, and the best that we can be," Kennedy said. “And so, yeah, I think we can do better."

It's not a wise idea for firms to look beyond investors There are better ways for companies to pursue social responsibility.

Texto completo: You might have seen news of the Business Roundtable's pledge, issued to much fanfare last Monday. "Each of our stakeholders is essential," said the signers, the chief executives of major public firms. "We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country." Perhaps you were a bit surprised, possibly quite pleased, to see executives finally taking their social responsibilities seriously and abandoning their single-minded focus on increasing shareholder value. It's hard to argue with an aspiration to serve a cause greater than mere shareholder returns.
Nonetheless, let me try. Or, rather, let me highlight the answer that Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, offered in The New York Times in 1970, when corporate social responsibility was much in vogue.
"In a free-enterprise, private-property system," Friedman argued, "a corporate executive is an employe (sic) of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his employers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom."
As you can imagine, the intervening decades have seen much bitter debate about Friedman's essay and the broader topic of "shareholder" vs. "stakeholder" capitalism. The stakeholder advocates point out, correctly, that corporate behavior affects many people beyond shareholders. Why, then, should CEOs put the needs of shareholders first?
The shareholder-capitalism advocates answer by echoing Friedman: because business leaders have no right to do charity on someone else's dime.
You might admire plumbers who donate fixtures to needy families, but not if they donated the fixtures you'd purchased for your own bathroom. That is essentially what stakeholder capitalists are demanding of chief executives: Take the money and power that shareholders have entrusted to you and divert those resources to benefit someone else.
I'm not talking about the kind of ineffectual "corporate social responsibility" that ultimately benefits shareholders. Treating employees decently often means lower turnover and higher profits; investing in community schools might lead to a better-trained workforce; and strategically supporting social causes might be good public relations. But if those steps benefit shareholders, moralistic appeals aren't necessary to justify them, nor are pledges to ensure that the CEOs follow through.
So if "stakeholder capitalism" means anything, it must mean companies doing things that make shareholders at least somewhat worse off. Maybe you're fine with that because most shareholders are relatively affluent. But the United States already has an effective way to divert money from the affluent to the needy. It's called the progressive tax code.
Unlike corporate social responsibility efforts, the tax code actually targets the affluent, rather than anyone who happens to own shares in a company - which, if you have a pension, or a 401(k), or a life insurance policy, includes you. Also, unlike corporate social responsibility initiatives, redistribution through the tax code is democratically accountable.
Corporate social responsibility, by contrast, can be even less accountable than good old-fashioned shareholder capitalism. Money is relatively easy to measure: Shareholders have more of it at the end of the quarter, or they don't, and either way you know how the boss is doing. But if the chief executive pours that cash into better-upholstered offices, more-generous fringe benefits and a slew of charitable causes, who's to say whether the company's goals are being met? Probably not the shareholders, who have time to monitor their own accounts but not a bunch of altruistic micro-initiatives.
The very impossibility of rendering a conclusive judgment means that corporate altruism might even be a net loss to society. As Harvard health care economist Amitabh Chandra noted on Twitter after the Business Roundtable's announcement, "appealing to an amorphous 'social mission' " has allowed nonprofit hospitals "to foil regulators, acquire their competition, and increase market power." Beware of any proposal that might make the rest of the economy look more like the health care sector.
Society has a valid interest in curbing the negative externalities of corporate behavior, such as environmental damage, unsafe products and systemic risk-taking. But taxing pollution and regulating risk are much more effective ways to do that than extracting a CEO promise to be extra good. We also have better ways of pursuing positive goods such as social justice - as long as we care enough to actually put our own money and effort on the line, rather than asking CEOs to appropriate the necessary resources from anyone unlucky enough to own their company's stock.

Russian agency says radioactive isotopes were found after mysterious explosion

Texto completo: Russian state officials admitted Monday that radioactive gases with isotopes of barium, strontium and lanthanum were found in test samples following an explosion at a military test site but insisted there was no danger in the area.
The blast earlier this month killed at least five state nuclear scientists and caused a brief spike in radiation around the area. Few and conflicting details emerged immediately following the blast, sparking speculation on the extent of its effects.
The Aug. 8 explosion on a platform in the White Sea off Nyonoksa caused a reported brief spike in radiation in nearby Severodvinsk, but Russians have said it posed no risk to the region.
Russia’s state weather and environmental monitoring agency said Monday that no trace of the radioactive gases has been found in the area since Aug. 8.
At least 5 killed: Deadly explosion at Russian test site involved nuclear power source, reports say
According to Reuters, the isotopes were Strontium-91, Barium-139, Barium-140 and Lanthanum-140, which have half-lives of 9. 3 hours, 83 minutes, 12. 8 days and 40 hours, respectively.
On Friday, a Norwegian monitoring institute said it believes the radiation spike was caused by a second explosion that occurred a few hours after the first blast, Reuters reported.
The Arkhangelsk regional government, however, denied that report from Norway’s Seismic Array and said it had no information about a second blast, TASS reported.
Conflicting information: Town told to evacuate, then stay, after Russian rocket explosion: Here's what we know now
Severodvinsk experienced a radiation increase four to 16 times above normal background levels, Russian weather service Rosgidromet said earlier this month.
The the city's civil defense department had said that radiation peaked at only three times above normal levels immediately following the incident. That's still less radiation than a normal X-ray of someone's digestive tract, according to TASS.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has also since admitted the accident occurred during a test of a weapons system, Reuters reported.
Nuclear experts had speculated that Russians were testing SSC-X-9 Skyfall, a prototype cruise missile that could reach any corner of the world with a nuclear reactor as its power source, the New York Times reported.
President Donald Trump tweeted days after the blast, "that the "United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia. "
"We have similar, though more advanced, technology. The Russian 'Skyfall' explosion has people worried about the air around the facility, and far beyond. Not good!" Trump added at the time.

How to balance your back-to-school budget

Texto completo: I remember as I was growing up, I always thought school was free. I mean, I understood that private school costs money, but I went to public school, and I didn't think a whole lot about the expenses associated with it.
Now that I'm older, I realize how much parents actually spend on their kids when they go back to school. In fact, the National Retail Federation reports parents plan to spend $696 on back-to-school supplies this year. Isn't that crazy?
There are the obvious school supplies like notebooks, markers (my favorite!), and backpacks. And as a kid, I always needed new clothes and shoes. But there's not-so-obvious ones that nickel-and-dime you to death.
One of my coworkers told me that he had to buy football gear for his son that totaled $260. Understandably, it gave him a bit of sticker shock. There's nothing wrong with paying for this kind of thing if you have the money, but you still need to have a plan for how you're going to pay for it.
As the school year is gearing back up, it's important to make a list of things you need to budget for. So, think about these categories and come up with a dollar amount you plan to spend in each one:
School supplies
Uniforms
Sports equipment
Fall clothes and shoes
Meal plans
Fees for clubs, sports, band, and other extracurricular activities
I'd like to point out that this is a great time of year to teach your kids that money isn't in infinite supply. Teach them the value of working within a budget! They don't need the trendy name-brand shoes, or the flashy notebook that costs more. You're setting your kids up to win when they understand money can – and often does – run out.
Now, if you've already busted your back-to-school budget, here's what you can do:
Get your budget back on track. Where can you cut back this month to make up for the overspending? Is there anything lying around the house you can sell? Can you pick up some extra hours at work?
Plan for future school expenses. Once school is back in session, there will be other costs that come up. School pictures, yearbooks, field trips and more extracurricular activities are just around the corner. And now you know how to get ahead of them.
I know paying for all these school expenses can feel overwhelming, but if you plan ahead and pay with cash, you'll feel a lot better when September rolls around.

Texto completo: Like it or not, Google is most people's portal to the internet. And when you're searching for something simple -- like the latest news about Iran -- Google will usually get you what you want on the first try. But if you're trying to find something a bit more niche, you may need to do some digging. Here are a few tricks to keep up your sleeve that will make life easier.
Use quotation marks to find a specific phrase
It's one thing to search for a couple of words, like Sony HT-Z9F soundbar, and find the product(s) you're seeking. But let's say you need more specific information -- like the dimensions of the speaker drivers inside that soundbar. Searching for HT-Z9F soundbar driver diameter does not return any pages that list that particular spec, nor does including the word inches. Instead, we need to think about how this would exactly be phrased on the page, and use quotation marks to narrow our search.
When you put quotation marks around a collection of words, it tells Google to look for the words only in that order. So, sony HT-Z9F inch drivers (don't worry, capitalization doesn't matter) will search for any page that has the words "inch" and "drivers" on it -- but not necessarily together. Searching HT-Z9F soundbar "inch drivers" on the other hand, narrows our search considerably, producing a result right at the top that lists the exact spec we're looking for: 2.5-inch drivers. (If you can't find the terms you searched for on the resulting page, press Ctrl+F on your keyboard -- Command+F on a Mac -- to locate your words on that page.)
Bonus tip: If you're looking for a specific page but aren't sure the exact words it uses, you can put an asterisk in those quotes to symbolize any word. For example, if you forgot the title of Taylor Swift's dance-pop single from "1989," you could search taylor swift "* it off" and find the "Shake It Off" lyrics you're hunting down.
Exclude words with the minus sign
It's frustrating when a search returns oodles of results that have nothing to do with what you're looking for. This is especially common with homonyms -- words that are spelled and pronounced the same but have different meanings. For example, let's say you're searching for a music group to play at your wedding. Searching for wedding bands brings up a ton of results, but most are for wedding rings -- often called bands -- not musicians that play at wedding receptions.
The minus sign is your friend here. Think of a word that would appear on all the irrelevant pages -- in this case, "jewelry" or "jeweler" is probably a good bet -- and include it with a minus sign in your search: wedding bands -jewelry. Just like that, you've got yourself a bunch of sites that review wedding bands across the country.
I also use this often for products with similarly-named siblings -- say, Apple's MacBook line, which includes the MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro. Getting too many results for the Air and Pro? Just eliminate them from your search with macbook -air -pro and you'll get more relevant results.
Narrow your search to a specific time period
If your head is spinning after that last one, here's an easy tip for you. Occasionally, search results will consist of older articles that have ranked on a given topic, but haven't been updated to include recent changes. If you encounter this problem, you can put a date restriction on the results by clicking the Tools button under Google's search bar, and then clicking the "Any Time" drop-down. You can narrow your results to the previous week, month, year, or a custom time frame.
Search your favorite sites with the "site:" operator
If you're looking for an article you read a while back, but can't find now -- or if you specifically want to see what one of your most trusted sites has to say about a topic -- you can use the site: operator to limit your search to that specific publication. (This is especially useful for sites that don't have a search function -- though it's often better than a site's built-in search bar, too.)
Let's say I want to read about the Iran nuclear deal, but I prefer coverage from The New York Times. Instead of just Googling US iran deal for the latest news, I can search site:nytimes.com iran deal to see coverage only from The Times. This also allows me to see everything The Times has done on the topic going back weeks or months, rather than my results getting cluttered with versions of today's news from other publications.
Add search shortcuts to your browser's address bar
Ready for a more advanced lesson? Tricks like the site: operator are great, but they take a while to type out -- especially if you search for Times content regularly. You can save yourself precious seconds on every search by creating a short keyword for bits of text you search regularly, if your browser supports it, and most do. That way, instead of typing site:nytimes.com every time, you can just type nyt in your browser's address bar, add your search terms, and get right to the good stuff.
To do this, perform an example search on Google, then copy the URL from the address bar. Using the above example, my URL is:
https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anytimes.com+iran+deal
This is what we'll use to create our shortcut. In Chrome, right-click the address bar, choose "Edit Search Engines," and click "Add" to create a new one with nyt as the keyword. In Firefox, right-click the Bookmarks Bar and create a new bookmark instead with nyt as the keyword.
Paste the search URL you copied earlier into the "Search Engine" or "Location" box, and replace your search terms with %s (making sure to leave in any terms you want to keep as part of the keyword). So, since I want my nyt shortcut to search site:nytimes.com and whatever search terms I add, my URL would look like this:
https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anytimes.com+%s
See how I replaced iran+deal with %s in the URL? Now, whenever I type nyt into the address bar, I can search The New York Times for any terms I want.
I use this for all kinds of common searches: sites I like (nyt searches site:nytimes %s), authors I trust (jk searches Jolie Kerr %s), or -- if you want to get really advanced -- other URL tricks, like getting driving directions from Google Maps (http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=from+123+main+street+to+%s).
Find the source of a photo with reverse image search
Finally, not all searches are made up of words. Sometimes, it can be handy to know where a certain photo came from, or to find a larger version of it. You probably know you can type a few words to find a photo with Google's Image Search, but you might not have realized it works in the other direction too: Drag an image into Image Search and Google will find other versions of that photo for you.
A few years ago, I was searching for an apartment, and found one that looked great -- it had the number of bedrooms I needed, in the part of town I wanted to be in, and the photos looked nice. But I found it on one of those "members only" apartment listing sites, so I had to pay a monthly subscription in order to get the name, address and contact info of the complex. Not to be outdone, I dragged the building's photo to my desktop, then dragged it into Google Images. Google immediately found another site that had used that photo: the building's official website, where I could call or email and ask directly about open units for rent.
Google isn't the only site that has this feature, either. TinEye is a similar tool with a few more options, if you're trying to find where the image first appeared. EBay's iPhone and Android apps also let you search by image, which is useful if you're trying to find a rare piece of china with no markings, or something like that. It doesn't always work, but when you're in a bind, it's worth a shot -- and if nothing else, it may give you another clue to add to your search terms.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

India holds thousands of Kashmiris after mass arrests

Texto completo: NEW DELHI - On Aug. 5, at 1:15 a.m., Asifa Mubeen was woken up by the sound of barking dogs as police officers began pouring into her yard.
Her husband, Mubeen Shah, a wealthy Kashmiri merchant, stepped out onto their bedroom balcony in the night air. The officers shouted that he was under arrest. When he asked to see a warrant, his wife said, the officers told him there wouldn't be one.
"This is different," they said. "We have orders."
It was the start of one of the biggest mass arrests of civilian leaders in decades carried out by India, a close U.S. partner that bills itself as one of the world's leading democracies.
Local officials say that at least 2,000 Kashmiris - including business leaders, human rights defenders, elected representatives, teachers, and students as young as 14 - were rounded up by the federal security forces in the days right before and after the Indian government unilaterally stripped away Kashmir's autonomy.
The detainees have not been able to communicate with their families or meet with lawyers. Their whereabouts remains unknown. Most were taken in the middle of the night, witnesses said.
Critics say that even under India's tough public safety laws this is illegal, and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is bending the Indian legal system to cut off any possible criticism in Kashmir and go after anyone with a voice - be that a successful merchant like Mubeen Shah, a politician or a professor.
"Kashmir is silent as a graveyard," said Vrinda Grover, a human rights lawyer.
The Indian government isn't sharing what charges the detainees face or how long they will be held. Some were reported to have been flown on secret air force flights to jails in Lucknow, Varanasi and Agra.
On Thursday, the United Nations Human Rights Office said it was "gravely concerned."
Political analysts say the mass roundup was the final piece of a detailed plan that Modi's government set into motion last year. This included postponing state elections in Kashmir to create a gap in local leadership. Indian officials then changed India's Constitution and moved to erase Kashmir's autonomy and statehood without any input from Kashmiris - though many lawyers have said that might not be legal, either.
Bringing Kashmir to heel has been a Hindu-nationalist dream. It was India's only Muslim-majority state (it is now to become two federally administered territories) and a place where Pakistan, India's archrival, enjoys some support. Kashmir was an obvious sore for the nationalist political movement that has flourished among India's Hindu majority, powering Modi's stunning rise.
For decades, Kashmir has been racked by militancy, oppression and unrest. Kashmiris are feeling especially demoralized and cornered now. The fear is that the area is about to ignite; even with phone lines cut, leaders in jail and soldiers on every street, protests are erupting. Some are peaceful. Others descend into stone-pelting clashes.
But the fury is there, always.
"There is only one solution!" the crowds cheer. "Gun solution! Gun solution!"
Modi's move instantly raised tensions with Pakistan, a Muslim-majority nation that also claims part of Kashmir. Its prime minister, Imran Khan, harshly criticized Modi on Wednesday, saying he had rebuffed Khan's requests to talk.
Large numbers of troops have been moving on both sides of the border, fortifying positions in the Himalayan mountains, according to Western intelligence officials.
Both nations are armed with nuclear weapons, and President Donald Trump has urged them to reduce tensions and to avoid tipping the crisis over into war.
But Modi seems intent on digging in, and he has the Indian public firmly behind him. Many Indians see Kashmir as an integral part of India, and this move has stirred up jingoist feelings. Indian news channels have referred to the detainees being flown out of Kashmir as "Pakistani terrorists" or "separatist leaders," toeing the government line.
The Indian Home Ministry will not answer questions about the mass arrests, including how many people have been taken into custody. The Foreign Ministry won't say why foreign journalists continue to be blocked from setting foot in Kashmir, even when government officials insist the situation is returning to normal.

Texto completo: I have no fewer than five former residents of my house who still receive their mail here. I’d be annoyed at all the extra paper, if I hadn’t had my share of mail mishaps, ranging from bothersome to embarrassing. And I mean for the people on the receiving end.
When I used to run a blog, I hosted an event called “Free Book Friday.” It took place on Thursdays and the prizes were magazines. Kidding of course. I am referencing my complete lack of creativity in the name I chose.
I would run contests, and the winners would receive a book of their choosing. Then I would go to Amazon, pick the book and mail it to the winner.
What I didn’t realize was my husband (at the time), while considering certain purchases, would leave them in the shopping cart.
My first Free Book Friday winner was a woman named Jennie. She requested a book, which I ordered and sent, but when she got the package, the book was there, along with a box of electronic doorknobs with keypads.
All told, the book was worth about eight bucks and the doorknobs were $200.
We didn’t even realize what had happened, but Jennie was nice enough to alert me to my mistake.
“How could you leave electronic doorknobs in the shopping cart?” I said to my then husband.
“How could you not notice that one book cost $210?” he said.
The divorce was in motion.
I jest.
When I was single again, and smarter — or so I thought — I was dating a man, and I thought I’d send him a Valentine’s present. Not to be too explicit, but it was going to be something I would wear and he would enjoy.
But, I didn’t realize I had my kids’ back-to-school boxer-briefs in the shopping cart as well. So, my boyfriend received a sexy present… and a child’s underthings.
It was definitely not the romantic message I had intended to send.
I asked a few friends if they’d had experiences like this. One had a good one, but I promised her complete anonymity. And a promise is a promise.
My friend, let’s call her Gladys, bought these nifty little things called pee-proof underwear. (OK, let’s just all admit that these kinds of things can be very necessary when two people love each other very much and one of them delivers a new person into the world. Can I get a fist bump, ladies?)
So, she made the purchase, but the package never arrived. She checked her shipping address history and realized — to her horror — that she had sent it to her previous employer at an undisclosed university, where she had been a professor.
She called the school, and they said that misdirected packages were kept in the mailroom. However, by the time she made it to the school, she learned the package had been sent to the dean’s office, opened, and then sent back to the mailroom, still open.
And when you open the package, this is what you see:
And then you see this:
But all of this embarrassment does have a happy ending. Besides the fact that my friend can now comfortably sneeze, the original blog post book winner happened to need electronic door knobs and paid us for them. As for the sexy lingerie, I never ended up wearing it. And that should make everyone happy.
Here’s to accurate shipping in the future.

Former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh announces he will challenge Trump in Republican primary

Resumen: Former GOP Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois said officially announced his primary challenge to Donald Trump on Sunday. He said Trump is "unfit" to be president.

Texto completo: Former U. S. Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Illinois, announced Sunday that he will run against Donald Trump in the Republican primary for president.
The conservative talk show host said during ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos" that he's running because Trump is "unfit" and "somebody needs to step up. "
This comes after an op-ed in The New York Times in which Walsh said a Republican should challenge Trump “from the right. ” He said Trump “can’t be trusted. ”
“The fact is, Mr. Trump is a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base and advance his electoral prospects,” Walsh wrote.
Walsh, who notably was backed by the Tea Party during his run for office, floated the idea of taking on Trump last week, saying he was “strongly, strongly considering it. ”

Walsh has outspokenly opposed Trump, and in the past criticized his relationship with Russia. More recently, he denounced Trump after he tweeted that Democratic congresswomen of color should "go back" to their countries of origin, which prompted chants of "send her back" at a Trump rally.
Calling Trump “a child,” Walsh said Sunday that the country is sick of Trump's lies.
“Look at what’s happened this week. The president of the United States is tweeting us into a recession," Walsh said.
Walsh claimed that most of his Republican colleagues privately agree with his opinions of Trump, but are too afraid to speak out against him.

“And it stuns me that nobody stepped up, nobody in the Republican Party stepped up, because I’ll tell you what, George, everybody believes, in the Republican Party, everybody believes that he’s unfit," Walsh said.
Walsh announced his campaign on Twitter Sunday morning, saying “It won’t be easy, but bravery is never easy. ”
ABC News’ Jonathan Carl said on the show that the Trump campaign’s only response thus far to Walsh’s challenge is one word: “Whatever. ”
Walsh joins former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, whom Walsh wrote is challenging Trump “from the center,” in the primary against Trump.

Texto completo: President Trump is upset that Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called his interest in purchasing Greenland "absurd." Her dismissive response should have come as no surprise. In 1946, when President Harry Truman tried to purchase Greenland, Secretary of State James Byrnes wrote that the proposal "seemed to come as a shock" and an insult to Danish officials, who turned it down.
That was a big mistake. As part of his deal, Truman had offered to trade parts of the Point Barrow district of Alaska, including the rights to any oil discovered there, to Denmark, in exchange for parts of Greenland. The Danes dismissed the idea just as they did Trump's proposal. In 1967, the richest oil strike in U.S. history was made in the Point Barrow area. Bad move, Denmark! Sad!
With that blunder in their rear-view mirror, you would think that Danish leaders would at least hear Trump out. The president's idea of buying Greenland is far from absurd. Today we have a military base in Greenland, so there is no need to buy it for that purpose. But Greenland has enormous unexplored stores of natural resources, including zinc, lead, gold, iron ore, diamonds, copper and uranium, that Denmark has been unable or unwilling to exploit.
It also has large, untapped stores of rare-earth elements, such as praseodymium or dysprosium, that are critical to the production of everything from electric cars to smartphones and lasers. Today, the United States gets many of these rare-earth elements from China, which makes Americans dependent on Beijing. The Wall Street Journal reports that Beijing may cut off access to those minerals in its trade dispute with Washington, and China is also trying to corner the market for rare-earth elements in Greenland. Buying Greenland would put those strategically valuable minerals in U.S. hands.
But what makes Greenland particularly valuable to the United States is global warming. The unavoidable receding of Arctic sea ice will open a new sea route in the Arctic that can be used for both commercial and military vessels. In May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered an address at the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Finland in which he pointed out that "steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade. This could potentially slash the time it takes to travel between Asia and the West by as much as 20 days." He added that the emerging "Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st-century Suez and Panama canals."
He's right. A recent report in the New York Times notes that as sea ice melts and "Arctic routes become more direct, voyage times could fall to less than three weeks in some cases, making Arctic shipping potentially more attractive than the southern routes in coming decades."
The United States and its allies have a major interest in not allowing these Arctic sea lanes to fall under Russian or Chinese control. "Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a New South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?" Pompeo asked in Finland. Purchasing Greenland would help the United States to better secure these emerging strategic passageways.
In 1946, the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Truman that Greenland was "completely worthless to Denmark." Today, Denmark may not feel that way. But rather than getting offended, Copenhagen should entertain Trump's offer. After all, it would not be the first time Denmark sold the United States one of its overseas possessions. In 1916, it sold the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands) to President Woodrow Wilson. So, we've long ago established that parts of Denmark are for sale; there's no harm haggling over the price.
Indeed, a Greenland purchase would be in keeping with a long history of presidential land acquisitions. In 1803, Thomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana territory from France. In 1819, President James Monroe bought Florida from Spain. In 1854, President Franklin Pierce, in the Gadsden Purchase, bought part of New Mexico and Arizona from Mexico. In 1867, President Andrew Johnson bought Alaska from Russia. In 1898, President William McKinley bought the Philippines from Spain. And in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt rented the Panama Canal Zone from Panama and Guantanamo Bay from Cuba. If Denmark won't sell Greenland, maybe we can rent it!
On Monday, Trump tweeted a picture of a gleaming Trump high-rise amid small huts on the Greenland coast and declared, "I promise not to do this to Greenland!" But the idea of buying Greenland is no joke. It actually makes a lot of strategic and economic sense.

Texto completo: "Mean Girls" is the crowd pleaser and "Come From Away" is the critics' darling in the 2019-20 Broadway Across America season at ASU Gammage. Based on the hit film written by Tina Fey, "Mean Girls" is one of several shows making a first run in Tempe, including "Come From Away," "Anastasia" and "Summer: The Donna Summer Musical."
Season packages are on sale now, along with single tickets for "Miss Saigon." 480-965-3434,
asugammage.com.
'Miss Saigon' (Sept. 24-29) From the creators of "Les Misérables," this 1989 megamusical was inspired by "Madama Butterfly" and stars a floating helicopter. It launched the career of Lea Salonga, playing a Vietnamese peasant in love with a G.I., but it also sparked an early battle in the war over "yellowface" after producers cast Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce in the role the half-Vietnamese villain dubbed the Engineer. Later productions have featured far more Asian-Americans onstage.
The reviews: Critics were diffident from the beginning, for some of the same reasons audiences loved it. The 2017 revival sparked a wider range of political interpretation, from "more relevant today" (from a critic emphasizing the dangers of interventionist wars) to this headline from the Daily Beast: "Sexism, Race and the Mess of 'Miss Saigon' on Broadway."
'Anastasia' (Oct. 29-Nov. 3) From the creative team behind the ambitious historical musical "Ragtime," this 2017 show is about an orphan who discovers she might be the only surviving child of Tsar Nicholas II (executed by the Bolsheviks).
The reviews: Some praise for the craftsmanship and the tunesmithing, but not a lot of enthusiasm overall. The Chicago Tribune called it a "musical that works quite delightfully when the star is center stage, and struggles mightily when she is off in the wings."
'Summer: The Donna Summer Musical' (Jan. 7-12, 2020) Jukebox musicals are now a steady part of the diet on Broadway. This one, developed by the prolific La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, celebrates the life and songs of the disco diva who scored hits with "Hot Stuff" and "She Works Hard for the Money."
The reviews: Brutal. The New York Times' Jesse Green called the jukebox genre "the cockroach of Broadway" and this example a "blight" that glosses over the most dramatic parts of Summer's life, from her experience being sexually abused by a pastor to her rocky relationship with the gay community: "You could learn more (and more authentically) by reading a thoughtful obituary while listening to her hits."
'Fiddler on the Roof' (Jan. 28-Feb. 2, 2020) One of the great masterpieces of musical theater, it combines unforgettable melodies and genuine joie de vivre with an affecting story of a hardworking Jewish family caught up in Russian pogroms around the turn of the 20th century. The latest revival is directed by Bartlett Sher, famed for his ability to breathe new life into old warhorses such as "South Pacific" and "My Fair Lady." He also directed Aaron Sorkin's new adaptation of "To Kill a Mockingbird."
The reviews: Raves across the board for Sher's revival. The Hollywood Reporter praised its "galvanizing life force and vivid sense of Jewish identity" as well as "the explosive, loose-limbed movement of Israeli modern dance choreographer Hofesh Schecter."
'Once on This Island' (March 3-8, 2020) "Ragtime" songwriters Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty are represented again with this 1990 musical, which combines a fable about Caribbean gods with a contemporary love story set in a culture with powerful racial taboos. It's the kind of show that doesn't have a lot of brand recognition but is beloved by hardcore musical buffs. Long before "Hamilton," it also was a pioneer in expanding acting opportunities for people of color.
The reviews: Widespread praise for the revival's inventive set and staging and for the performances, including one by a live goat. No word yet on whether Sparky, or one of his bearded buddies, will be on the road. (Theater nerds: No "Sylvia" jokes, please.)
'Mean Girls' (April 21-26, 2020) Resistance is futile when it comes to hit movies getting the Broadway treatment. And really, why not? "Legally Blonde" certainly made a fun musical, and "Mean Girls" could be even better. Tina Fey adapted the book from her screenplay about high-school social politics, complete with updates such as a new clique of "woke seniors" in the cafeteria.
The reviews: Generally positive, even from the "snooty" New York Times ("likeable but seriously over-padded"). The Chicago Tribune had a nice analysis of the efforts to retune the show for today's youth: "Fey still writes funnier, smarter, sharper satire than most anyone else in the business."
'Come From Away' (May 26-31, 2020) In this critically acclaimed musical, a small town in Newfoundland welcomes 7,000 unexpected guests when 38 planes are forced to land there during the 9/11 attacks. Based on a true story, it was the surprise hit of 2017.
The reviews: Consistently strong. Reviewing the national touring production, Entertainment Weekly called it "that rare and wondrous thing: a true ensemble piece, one that allows every member of its dozen-strong cast a chance to shine, while also being utterly dependent on the sum of its moving parts to drive home its glorious, life-affirming message."
SEASON OPTIONS
These shows are not included in subscription packages.
Blue Man Group (Nov. 15-17) The unclassifiable theater/dance troupe creates surreal worlds that comment on the strangeness of our own. Founded in 1987, the company came to fame after playing off-Broadway in 1991 and has been touring the world ever since.
'Beautiful — The Carole King Musical' (Feb. 21-23, 2020) One of the best biographical musicals of recent years, this 2014 Broadway hit makes its second stop at Gammage. In addition to highlighting King-penned hits such as "So Far Away" and "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman," it explores her friendship with the songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil ("You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling").
The reviews: Unanimously positive. Yours truly, reviewing the national tour at Gammage in 2016: "While 'Beautiful' certainly plays to audience nostalgia, it's not all fluff ... It's genuinely moving to see the emergence of a true artist writing for the first time in her own voice."
'The Lion King' (June 17-July 12, 2020) Disney and director Julie Taymor raised the bar for Broadway spectacle with this adaptation of the animated classic, thanks to thrilling life-size animal puppets and a stampede set piece that leaves audiences breathless. It's the third longest-running musical in Broadway history.
The reviews: Mostly rapturous, although you can find the odd curmudgeon who thinks that when it comes to Elton John scores, "Billy Elliot" is the real king. (Yeah, that's yours truly again.)
"Mean Girls" runs April 21-26, 2020, as part of ASU Gammage's Broadway Across America season.

Texto completo: If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way from former President Barack and former first lady Michelle Obama's new production company.
The Obamas launched Higher Ground Productions last spring in partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would "harness the power of storytelling" and touch on "issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more."
"American Factory," the first title from Higher Ground, is available now on the streaming service. It manages to make good on the Obamas' pledge, which is a promising sign for what's to come.
The documentary, which won a directing award this year at the Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of a Chinese billionaire who opens a glass factory in a former General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, and hires both American and Chinese workers. The film looks at how their cultures clash (with the Chinese workers getting lessons in how Americans are overconfident and need to be praised), how the workers are taken advantage of by management (they're convinced not to join a union for the security of their jobs) and how automation could take many of their jobs.
Through the emotional stories of some of the workers, and even the billionaire chairman himself, the documentary winds up being funny, shocking, upsetting and eye-opening. The film works well without a central narrator, allowing the people themselves to tell their stories. There also plenty of How did they get that?! insider footage, courtesy of Dayton-based co-filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar.
At almost two hours, the documentary doesn't drag. Instead, it sets an impressive precedent for the Obamas' forthcoming projects.
What else does Higher Ground have in the works?
Here's what's planned so far:
A drama series about the fashion world: "Bloom" will show the struggles faced by women of color in post-World War II New York. It's written and produced by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri ("Thelma & Louise").
A biopic about Frederick Douglass: Higher Ground plans to adapt the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom" into a movie about the abolitionist and statesman who was born into slavery.
An anthology series about unnoticed deaths: "Overlooked" will be a scripted show adapted from The New York Times' column of the same name that looks to correct the issue of obituaries primarily being written about white men.
A traveling kids' food show: "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents" is a half-hour preschool series from creators Jeremy Konner ("Drunk History") and Erika Thormahlen that will tell the story of food.
A Michael Lewis nonfiction series: The show will be based on "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," the book by the best-selling "Moneyball" and "The Big Short" writer about everyday heroes safeguarding the nation.

Gun control is not the solution you think

Texto completo: Gun control is not the answer to America's gun violence.
In the recent mass shootings, the shooters purchased their weapons legally. Likewise, the policies promoted by gun control activists would not impact mass shootings. Last year, the RAND Corp. conducted a survey of academic research and did not find any of the policies they looked at would reduce mass shootings: "We found no qualifying studies showing that any of the 13 policies we investigated decreased mass shootings."
As usual with so many of these killers, there was nothing too outstanding about them (though as of late they do seem motivated by some horrendous white nationalist beliefs — sadly, protected by the First Amendment). After all, being young and alienated is not unusual in America.
Preventing the sale or ownership of so-called assault rifles, a term for which there is no technical definition, will not end these mass shootings.
Why is it only recently that semi-automatic firearms have become an issue in American society even though they come in all shapes and sizes? It's no coincidence that the semi-automatic firearms that seem to be favored by shooters, and descriptions of the killer's video in Christchurch, New Zealand, look like it could be in a video game.
Moreover, trying to limit assault rifles does violate the Second Amendment. Justice John Paul Stevens — like many lawyers, legal analysts, scholars and others — had believed that the Second Amendment truly applied only to civilians having guns to use in a militia. This had been based on a reading and interpretation of the 1939 U.S. v. Miller decision, in which sawed-off shotguns were seen as having no military purpose and thus could be restricted.
More recent Supreme Court decisions concluding that the Second Amendment allows personal possession of guns for personal defense nullified this militia interpretation, both legally and historically. Justice Stevens admitted this in a New York Times essay, in which he concluded that the Second Amendment would have to be rewritten in order for it to explain his stance.
If the response to any mass shooting is flight, hide or fight, why not make sure that the fighting aspect of it works? Armed combat is more effective than unarmed combat. Businesses, despite their qualms, should allow legal concealed carry on their premises and should allow their employees to carry as well.
Louis Haas is a professor of history at Middle Tennessee State University. This column originally appeared in the Nashville Tennessean.
What others are saying Harvey Rosenthal, USA TODAY: "So many people with mental illness have shared with me the great distress and anger they feel about how we are being portrayed and treated, and the identification we feel with other marginalized groups who have been similarly targeted. It's time to stop defaming and blaming us and to get serious about addressing the growing climate of fear, prejudice, anger and violence in our country. To get there, we'll need inspirational leadership that unites us rather than separates us from each other. It's leadership of this kind that will indeed make us all safer."
Bob Barnes, Florida Today: "Of all the (constitutional) amendments ... only the Second Amendment comes under pressure for obliteration or change. What you may not know is that fighting against the Second Amendment is only a 20th century phenomenon. At some point, even the most ardent of people opposed to guns are going to have to ask the most logical question: 'Why are there such well-organized and well-funded groups opposing the Second Amendment?' ... Challenge anything relating to the Second Amendment, gun control or 'doing something.' But base that challenge on facts, not hyperbole or misleading information."
Andrew P. Napolitano, Fox News: "A person willing to kill innocents and be killed by the police while doing so surely would have no qualms about violating a state or federal law that prohibited the general ownership of the weapon. ... With all of this as background, and the country anguishing over the mass deaths of innocents, the feds and the states face a choice between a knee-jerk but popular restriction of some form of gun ownership and the rational and sound realization that more guns in the hands of those properly trained means less crime and more safety. Can the government constitutionally outlaw the types of rifles used by the El Paso and Dayton killers? In a word: No."

Texto completo: Two hot dogs.
That's what The Fumbler had Tuesday night.
The one in his left hand was topped with ketchup. The one attached to the leash in his right hand was sweating while watching the Pirates game at Pup Night at PNC Park.
Hey, they're called the dog days of summer for a reason, right?
The Fumbler is a dog lover, and not just the furry ones. He's a big fan of underdogs, particularly when it comes to high school football.
The 2019 season kicks off Friday in stadiums throughout Western Pennsylvania. Which underdog stories will step to the forefront this fall?
How great would it be if Southmoreland ends its 40-year playoff drought, the longest in the WPIAL? The Scotties last appeared in the postseason in November of 1979. A month earlier, the Pirates won the World Series.
Carrick is easy to root for. The Raiders forfeited their final two games last season due to having such a thin roster. They're back this season playing an independent schedule. With a new coach trying to build excitement - and depth - might the Raiders become a feel-good story?
At 22 games, Uniontown owns the longest losing streak in the WPIAL. It would be a pretty big deal if the Red Raiders upset Connellsville on Friday.
All this dog talk reminds The Fumbler that he has a question for you.
Why did the Dalmatian always hide from people? Because he didn't want to be spotted.
Here are his thoughts on this weekend's top games:
Penn Hills at Pine-Richland, 7 Friday - On a scale of 1 to 10, this Week 0 game might be a 9 or 10. It's rare for two defending WPIAL champions to square off, so this should be a treat. Penn Hills did one-up Pine-Richland last season, though. The Indians also claimed a PIAA title. But that was the past. Let's talk about the present and near future. Both teams are good again this season. But with more talent returning, including running back Luke Meckler and quarterback Cole Spencer, reigning Class 6A champs will be better Friday. Winner: Pine-Richland.
Mt. Lebanon at Gateway, 7 Friday - "We got Palko'd." That's what Gateway coach Don Holl said about his team's upset loss to Bob Palko-led West Allegheny in last year's WPIAL Class 5A semifinals. Gateway doesn't play West Allegheny to begin this season, but as it turns out, the Gators can't get away from Palko. This is the first game of the Palko era at Mt. Lebanon. It says here that the Blue Devils will be one of the best teams in Class 6A. They're still a work in progress, though. Friday, Gateway star Derrick Davis will work them. Winner: Gateway.
Upper St. Clair at South Fayette, 7 Friday - Jim Render picked up his 399th career win when USC edged South Fayette, 34-33, in last year's opener. He won No. 400 the following week. A year later, Render is now retired, and South Fayette is the reigning WPIAL Class 4A champion. The Lions saw their 57-game regular-season winning streak end with that loss to USC last season. No problem. They started a new win streak the following week. It now stands at nine. How will Mike Junko do in his debut as USC's coach? Winner: South Fayette.
Aliquippa at Clairton, 6 Saturday - Clairton 52, Aliquippa 16. That was the final score when these perennial powers met in a much-anticipated showdown at Clairton's Neil C. Brown Stadium three years ago. Lamont Wade rushed for about 3,972 yards and 39 touchdowns. Aliquippa got some payback the following season, making this the rubber match. Both teams are ranked No. 1 in their respective classes. They have both had lots of great skill players in recent years, but line play will be the difference in this one. The super-sized Quips will prevail. Winner: Aliquippa.

Texto completo: As a popular art, movies inevitably enrich our lexicon with their titles -- "Dirty Harry" is a term for rogue cop and "Star Wars" a moniker for a missile defense system.
Sometimes a title becomes a verb: To "gump," from "Forrest Gump," is to insert a fictional character into a historical situation. The verb "to gaslight," voted by the American Dialect Society in 2016 as the word most useful/likely to succeed, and defined as "to psychologically manipulate a person into questioning their own sanity," derives from MGM's 1944 movie, directed by George Cukor.
"Gaslight," in which a diabolical husband plans to drive his wife mad through a campaign of false accusations, fabricated memories and bland denials of his previous statements, had two successful iterations before the Cukor film. A British adaptation of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 play, released in 1940 as "Gaslight," cast the Austrian émigré Anton Walbrook as its duplicitous villain; the following year Hamilton's play opened on Broadway with Vincent Price as the smooth-talking husband and ran for 1,295 performances.
Although featuring a major star as the villain, Charles Boyer, cast against type, Cukor's film differed from previous productions. It strengthened the part of the abused wife -- largely overshadowed by actors playing the abusive husband -- by giving the role to a great actress: Ingrid Bergman.
Traumatized by the murder of her aunt, a well-known opera singer, Paula Alquist (Bergman) is inveigled by her new husband, Gregory Anton (Boyer), a fortune seeker, to taking up residence in the abandoned house where the killing occurred. There, for reasons that become obvious to the audience long before Paula is able to grasp them, he convinces her that, as she puts it, she does "senseless, meaningless things." He also proceeds to frighten her out of her wits, in part by dimming the gaslights in the house and blaming it on her imagination.
Reviewing "Gaslight" in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther equated the husband's mind games with the director's. The movie, he wrote, "has pulled such a ticklish assortment of melodramatic camera tricks that the audience was giggling with anxiety." Among the many tactics used to unnerve Paula was the hiring of an insolent Cockney housemaid (18-year-old Angela Lansbury in her first movie role).
Where the play was confined to a single claustrophobic set, the movie is opened up to include scenes in Italy and the Tower of London. (Cukor also employed a third star, Joseph Cotten, as a sympathetic, if unlikely, representative of Scotland Yard.) Mainly, however, the movie gives Bergman full rein. Girlishly trusting, passionately in love, tragically confused, hysterically terrified and implacably vengeful by turns, she runs a strenuous gamut of emotions to play her final scene as though it were a Shakespearean tragedy.
More than anything, "Gaslight" is a testament to Bergman's acting skills. It's remarkable that, as robust a presence as she is, she convincingly plays a timorous victim. Hollywood rewarded her with an Oscar and Alfred Hitchcock, who had made two analogous gothic thrillers, "Rebecca" (1940) and "Suspicion" (1941), in which Joan Fontaine coped with a sketchy spouse, cast Bergman in two upcoming pictures, "Spellbound" (1945) and "Notorious" (1946).
For its part, MGM undertook to gaslight audiences by pretending that the British movie never existed. The studio tried to destroy all prints; that the first "Gaslight" survived at all may be credited to the director Thorold Dickinson's foresight in making a personal copy.
Like the movie's horrible husband, MGM had a reason. Bergman's bravura performance aside, the Dickinson film is superior to the Hollywood version in nearly every way: more economical (running half an hour shorter), more brutal (opening with the murder of an elderly woman and the killer ransacking her flat), and a lot nastier. Walbrook malevolently lords over his pathetic wife (Diana Wynyard). Unctuously pious, he's clearly unhinged as well as openly predatory in making the housemaid his mistress. (Cathleen Cordell is a lot tawdrier than Lansbury as well.) There's a terrific bit of business where the pair go off to the music hall to catch some French cancan dancers.
More than a tough little thriller, the 1940 "Gaslight" is a sardonic portrait of a bad marriage between a couple that turns out to not even be married. Still, when the film finally made its tardy way to the United States in 1952, Crowther found it inferior to the Cukor version: "The street sets are plainly artificial, the atmosphere seems laboriously contrived and the direction of Thorold Dickinson is perceptibly casual and slow."
By then, the plot became overly familiar. In addition to Hitchcock's two kindred gothics, other versions of this female noir included Joseph H. Lewis's "My Name is Julia Ross" (1945), Vincente Minnelli's "Undercurrent" (1946) and two Anatole Litvak 1948 melodramas, the Barbara Stanwyck vehicle "Sorry Wrong Number" and Olivia de Havilland in "The Snake Pit." "Gaslight" was dramatized on the radio and satirized on TV. By the time Robert Aldrich made "Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte" (1964) in which Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland conspire to undermine Bette Davis's sanity, the verb "to gaslight" had made its way into both popular culture (used in sitcoms as early as 1952) and psychoanalytic discourse.
Maureen Dowd may have been the first to apply the "gaslight" to politics. Her 1995 op-ed piece, "The Gaslight Strategy" playfully described the Clinton administration's attempt to provoke the speaker of the house, Newt Gingrich, into making irrational outbursts. In Gingrich's case, she thought such a scheme was unnecessary: "You can't Gaslight someone who is already a little lit." True or not, we'll see if this term, so commonly used in the last presidential election, continues to have relevance in the next.
The 1944 version of "Gaslight" can be streamed via Amazon Prime , Vudu and YouTube ; the 1940 version is available from Amazon Prime , iTunes , and Vudu .

Above, Charles Boyer plays Bergman's villainous husband, and Angela Lansbury made her film debut as the couple's saucy maid. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY WARNER BROS. HOME ENTERTAINMENT)

Texto completo: Barack Obama gave the internet a glimpse into his post-White House life Saturday when he took to Twitter to list his top summer jams. The 44th president of the United States shared a 44-song summer playlist packed with new and old hits.
In a tweet, he said the songs are a sampling of what he and wife Michelle Obama have been listening to as the summer winds down.
The power couple gets down to oldies like "I've got you under my skin," by Frank Sinatra and "Brown eyed girl" by Van Morrison, while also keeping up with their Gen Z daughters, with nods to "Señorita" by Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes, "Old Town Road," by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus, and "Juice" by Lizzo. The pop-filled playlist also features Drake and Rihanna, Ella Fitzgerald and The Black Keys.
Obama also included several hopeful anthems, including "Hold On (Change is Coming)" by Sounds of Blackness, and "I'll Be Around" by The Spinners.
His tweet drew responses from supporters who praised his mainstream musical tastes. Several recording artists highlighted by the the former president also weighed in.
"WE’RE FRIENDS NOW I DONT MAKE THE RULES!!!" Lizzo tweeted to Obama.
GoldLink, an underground rapper from Washington, D. C. , tweeted, "Thank You, Mr. President. "
Lizzo seems to be popular among several 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls — Kirsten Gillibrand has used "Good As Hell" as her walkout song at some rallies, and shared a video of her dancing to the song on her campaign bus. The popular song also makes an appearance on Cory Booker's campaign rally playlist, according to a musical analysis from The New York Times.
Obama's playlist features other artists that can also be heard at various campaign rallies — he appears to share a fondness for Stevie Wonder with California Sen. Kamala Harris, and a love for The Rolling Stones with Beto O'Rourke of Texas and President Donald Trump.

Texto completo: Have you ever made a paper doll out of your college self? Or a microaggressions-themed bingo board? What about charting the dos and don'ts of being Egyptian, Filipino and American?
In her graphic memoir, "I Was Their American Dream," Malaka Gharib introduces readers to her identity as a first-generation, Filipino-Egyptian-American woman. The story begins with her parents, who immigrated to the United States from Egypt and the Philippines, and continues with her childhood in California and adult years on the East Coast. Gharib, 33, uses her writing and illustrations to show the internal conflicts she has grappled with over the years, from navigating mostly white spaces, to struggling with her Catholic-Muslim practices, to recognizing the guilt that comes with leaving her family.
Along the lines of graphic memoirs such as Mira Jacob's "Good Talk" and GB Tran's "Vietnamerica," "I Was Their American Dream," which came out in the spring, explores how individuality and cultural identity can sometimes be at odds, while other times they fuel inspiration.
"The Filipino and the Egyptian in me is the lens in which I see the entire world," Gharib said in an interview. "It's baked into my wiring of being. It's this sense of familial connection that I otherwise would not have had I not grown up the way that I did."
Throughout the book, Gharib, an editor and digital strategist at NPR in Washington, gives readers glimpses into her do-it-yourself sensibility. In a chapter about a childhood beach vacation in Egypt, she pauses for a tutorial on how to build "evil" sand traps ("1. Dig a hole large enough for a foot"). Later, chronicling her alienated teenage years, she gives instructions on how to make a mini-zine, illustrated with excerpts from her childhood journal. She talked to me about her process and, with some visual assistance from her Instagram account, provided tips that can help you break out of a creative rut.
Set an Extremely Tight Deadline
Gharib often forces herself to make a zine in five minutes, and she used that same approach when creating chapters for her book. "The challenge and the beauty of the [comics and zines] format is practicing extreme restraint," she said. "I had to condense down what I was trying to say in a set of words and meaningful images."
You can practice extreme restraint by giving yourself a deadline in the form of a time limit or a word count. If you're overwhelmed at the prospect of writing a novel or shooting a film, try starting with a tiny project to get the creative juices flowing.
Take Advantage of How Little Time You Have
You're busy. We get it. But you can use small pockets of time to create. Gharib, for example, molded omelets and other foods out of leftover clay during work meetings. "If I don't have any art materials and I get bored, I try to interact with whatever I have on me in the space I am in," she said. "Sometimes I pick flowers and leave them places, or tear tiny bits of receipts or trash in my purse and write tiny messages on them and leave them around the city for people to find."
When You Don't Know Where to Start, Look Around
If your problem is a lack of ideas, look at the people and objects around you. Try drawing or writing about them and don't worry about whether this is what you envision as your big creative project. "I am fascinated by the cultural norms of a place and the little things that make that place unique. So I draw to remember," Gharib said. "Sitting there with my sketchbook, I like the challenge of trying to suss out the most interesting details within my line of sight. Reality can be so much more magical and surreal than fiction, if you take the time to really look."
Draw On Your Memories (Or Just Draw Your Memories)
Gharib sketched this image of her father drinking Nescafe in Egypt, something she remembered from when she was 12.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday thanked a conspiracy theorist for saying Jews in Israel love the president “like he's the king of Israel" and doubled down on his efforts to pit American Jews against one another, accusing Jewish voters of disloyalty if they voted for Democrats.
It was the second day in a row that Trump addressed Jews and loyalty, a theme evoking an anti-Semitic trope that Jews have a “dual loyalty" and are often more loyal to Israel than to their own countries.
“If you want to vote Democrat, you are being very disloyal to Jewish people and very disloyal to Israel," Trump said Wednesday at the White House.
Speaking to reporters as he left the White House, Trump said his remarks were not anti-Semitic.
Earlier Wednesday, Trump thanked conservative radio host Wayne Allyn Root for lavishing praise on Trump for his successful diplomacy with Israel. Root is a one-time vice-presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party who now hosts a radio show on Newsmax TV and often promotes conspiracy theories.
Trump quoted Root calling the president "the best president for Israel in the history of the world" and claiming Jewish people in Israel love Trump "like he's the king of Israel. They love him like he's the second coming of God."
Trump drew immediate accusations that he was fanning anti-Semitic views.
“It is the height of hypocrisy to use Christian theology to bully Jews and to push out some messianic complex — literally, it's hard to think of something less kosher than telling the Jewish people you're the king of Israel, and therefore, we should have some fidelity to you for that reason," Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the Anti-Defamation League, said Wednesday on CNN.
Last week, lawmakers were outraged that Israel, with Trump's approval, barred two Muslim members of Congress from making an official visit because of their support for the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement
Trump has tried to make the two Democratic lawmakers, Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, the face of the Democratic Party after they made comments this year that were critical of US support of Israel.
Winning over Jewish voters would be a significant shift for Trump, as nearly 80 percent of Jewish Americans voted for Democrats during the 2018 midterm elections, according to the Pew Research Center.
The messianic imagery from his interview with Root may have stuck in Trump's head. Later in the day, as the president was defending his trade war with China, he cast himself as a reluctant warrior. Somebody had to do it and he was the one, he told reporters.
"I am the chosen one," he said, turning and looking up to the sky. "Somebody had to do it."

Inslee becomes third Democrat to drop out of race
OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington Governor Jay Inslee, who made fighting climate change the central theme of his presidential campaign, announced Wednesday night that he is ending his bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
Inslee said that he was confident Democrats would select a nominee who would champion climate change issues but that it had become clear that he wouldn't be the person selected.
Inslee said he was not endorsing anyone but would support whoever is the nominee.
"I believe we're going to have a candidate to fight this battle," he said on MSNBC. "I'm inspired by the people I've met across the country. I'm not going to carry the ball but we're going to make sure somebody is."
Two people close to Inslee said he planned to announce in an e-mail to supporters Thursday that he would be seeking a third term as governor.
Inslee, 68, became the third Democrat to end his presidential bid after Representative Eric Swalwell of California pulled out of the primary last month followed by former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper last week.
While Inslee had qualified for the first two presidential debates this summer, he struggled to gain traction in the crowded Democratic field and was falling short of the requirements needed to appear on two high-profile stages next month: the third DNC debate in Houston and a CNN town hall focused on climate change, Inslee's key issue.

Schilling has eye on specific Arizona congressional seat
PHOENIX — If former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling runs for Congress in Arizona, he said it might be for Democratic Representative Tom O'Halleran's seat.
Schilling announced last week that he's thinking about a bid for a House seat, and he has reached out to the Arizona Republican Party, the Arizona Republic reported Wednesday.
"Am I going to run? I don't know yet," Schilling said during a livestream on Facebook. "I honestly don't know yet. It's still an ongoing discussion in our home."
Schilling, who lives in Massachusetts, said he's interested in O'Halleran's district. But he's still planning out what he wants to do.
O'Halleran said Schilling has name recognition, but he's not too concerned about a possible faceoff for the mostly rural district in eastern Arizona.
"If I were in a primary with him, I'd probably be a little more worried about him than I would be in a general election," O'Halleran said.
O'Halleran is serving his second term.
Democrats have won the seat five out of six times since 2008.
Schilling helped the Arizona Diamondbacks win the World Series in 2001 and the Red Sox do the same in 2004.

Commentary: A giant volcano could end human life on Earth as we know it

Texto completo: If you’re planning to visit Yellowstone National Park this Labor Day weekend, I have good news: It is very, very, very unlikely that the supervolcano beneath it will erupt while you’re there.
The Yellowstone supervolcano — an 8 out of 8 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index — has erupted three times over the past 2.1 million years, most recently 640,000 years ago. A Yellowstone eruption would be like nothing humanity has ever experienced.
First would come increasingly intense earthquakes, a sign that magma beneath Yellowstone was rushing toward the surface. Then magma would burst through the ground in a titanic eruption, discharging the toxic innards of the earth to the air. It would continue for days, burying Yellowstone in lava within a 40-mile radius.
A bad day at the park. But the devastation around Yellowstone would be just the beginning. Volcanologists believe a Yellowstone supereruption would bury large swaths of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah in up to three feet of toxic volcanic ash. Depending on the weather patterns, much of the Midwest would receive a few inches, too, plunging the region into darkness. Even the coasts — where a majority of Americans live — would most likely see a dusting as the ash cloud spread. Crops would be destroyed; pastureland would be contaminated. Power lines and electrical transformers would be ruined, potentially knocking out much of the grid.
That’s just the United States. Modeling by meteorologists has found that the aerosols released could spread globally if the eruption occurred during the summer. Over the short term, as the toxic cloud blocked sunlight, global average temperatures could plunge significantly — and not return to normal for several years. Rainfall would decline sharply. That might be enough to trigger a die-off of tropical rain forests. Farming could collapse, beginning with the Midwest. It would be, as a group of researchers wrote in a 2015 report on extreme geohazards for the European Science Foundation, “the greatest catastrophe since the dawn of civilization.”
Supervolcanoes like Yellowstone represent what are known as existential risks — ultra-catastrophes that could lead to global devastation, even human extinction. They can be natural, like supereruptions or a major asteroid impact of the scale that helped kill off the dinosaurs, or they can be human-made, like nuclear war or an engineered virus. They are, by definition, worse than the worst things humanity has ever experienced. What they are not, however, is common — and that presents a major psychological and political challenge.
Though asteroids get the press and the Michael Bay movies, existential risk experts largely agree that supervolcanoes — of which there are 20 scattered around the planet — are the natural threat that poses the highest probability of human extinction. But that’s not the same thing as high. The probability of a supereruption at Yellowstone in any given year is 1 in 730,000.
But extremely unlikely isn’t the same thing as impossible, even though it’s human nature to conflate the two. What sets existential risks apart from everyday dangers isn’t likelihood but consequence.
Let’s say, as scientists have modeled, that a supereruption might kill 10 percent of the global population. Even if such eruptions occur roughly every 714,000 years — the low end of the frequency range — the death toll of that catastrophe equates to the expected loss of over 1,000 people annually, averaged out between now and when that supervolcano finally blows. If they occur roughly every 45,000 years — the high end of the range — that annual expected death toll jumps to some 17,000.
A bit of comparison helps here. Aviation accidents around the world caused 556 deaths in 2018. The Federal Aviation Administration alone spends more than $7 billion a year on aviation safety. Yet the United States spends only about $22 million annually on its volcano hazard programs — even though supervolcanoes, viewed over the longest of the long term, will kill far more people than plane crashes.
The difference, of course, is that aviation poses a risk that is relatively constant and known. There will probably never be a year in which no one dies in an aviation accident, but there will definitely never be a year in which 10 percent of the global population dies in a single plane crash. Yet that could happen with a supervolcano, an asteroid strike or a nuclear war.
We can reduce these existential risks. NASA has budgeted $150 million a year on planetary defense and could invest in space-based telescopes that might catch the asteroids we’re missing now. It would cost about $370 million a year to bring the rest of the world up to the same level of volcanic monitoring that the United States has, which would lessen the chance of being surprised by a supereruption and thus reduce the potential death toll. Human-made existential risks like nuclear war or even artificial intelligence are, of course, well within our ability to prevent. Our species faces greater existential peril than we ever have before, but unlike through most of our existence, we now have the ability to protect ourselves.
What has happened before can and will happen again, eventually — but because we remain confined to the brief human time horizons of our own experience, we treat them as unreal. In doing so, we leave ourselves vulnerable to what we can’t imagine.

MIT president says school received about $800k from Jeffrey Epstein foundations

Texto completo: MIT's president on Thursday disclosed that the school had received about $800,000 from foundations controlled by Jeffrey Epstein, the deceased financier who was charged with sex trafficking dozens of minors, and offered a “profound and humble" apology to Epstein's victims on behalf of the university.
In a letter to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology community, school president L. Rafael Reif said, “With hindsight, we recognize with shame and distress that we allowed MIT to contribute to the elevation of his reputation, which in turn served to distract from his horrifying acts. No apology can undo that."
Reif said he has asked for a group to be formed to look at “the facts around the Epstein donations and identify any lessons for the future, to review our current processes and to advise me on appropriate ways we might improve them." He also pledged to commit a monetary amount equal to the funds MIT received from Epstein's foundations to a charity that benefits Epstein's victims or other victims of sexual abuse.
The statement — released Thursday night — follows days of controversy over Epstein's donations to the MIT Media Lab. Two researchers said recently that they were severing their ties to the lab because of the donations.
Epstein, who was convicted in 2008 of procuring an underage girl for prostitution, was found dead this month in his cell at a federal detention facility in Manhattan, where he was held on newly filed charges of sex trafficking of minors. A medical examiner ruled his death a suicide by hanging.
For decades, Epstein nurtured a reputation as a “science philanthropist" and gathered a coterie of biologists, mathematicians, physicists, and artificial intelligence researchers around him. He feted them on his private island and in his lavish homes, and funded their research.
The scientists were among the most prominent people in their fields and included professors at Harvard and MIT.
The decisions of MIT faculty regarding monetary gifts are “always subject to longstanding Institute processes and principles," according to Reif's letter.
“To my great regret despite following the processes that have served MIT well for many years, in this instance we have made a mistake of judgment," he said.
Reif indicated that all of the monetary gifts from Epstein occurred over the span of about 20 years and went either to the MIT Media Lab or mechanical engineering professor Seth Lloyd.
Last week, Joi Ito, the media lab's director, apologized for his connections to Epstein and on Thursday, Lloyd also apologized.
In a post on Medium, Lloyd said he met Epstein at a dinner for scientists and their supporters in 2004 and discussed scientific questions during Epstein's visits to Harvard University “over the next few years." Epstein's foundation, he said, gave him a grant to support his research.
Earlier this summer, federal prosecutors charged Epstein, 66, with sexually abusing dozens of girls between 2002 and 2005. The indictment renewed attention on how Epstein had escaped severe punishment in an investigation of sexual abuse more than a decade ago in Florida.
Epstein had avoided federal criminal charges in 2008 after prosecutors brokered a widely criticized deal that allowed him to plead guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution from a minor and serve 13 months in jail.
Lloyd, the MIT professor, said he visited Epstein during his prison term in Florida and that after his release, he resumed attending discussions Epstein convened with other scientists and accepted two grants from his foundation, one in 2012 and another in 2017.
“These were professional as well as moral failings," Lloyd said in his apology. “The job of a scientist is to look for the truth, and the job of a teacher is to help people to empower themselves. I failed to do my job on both counts."
Ito, the MIT Media Lab director, has acknowledged that he had invited Epstein to the Media Lab, traveled to the financier's homes, and accepted money from him for the research center and Ito's own investments after Epstein's conviction.
Last week, Ito said he met Epstein in 2013 through a trusted business friend.
The media lab is known for developing robotic prosthetics to mimic the human gait and launching the online news giant Buzzfeed, among other initiatives.
Amid the fallout from the lab's connections to Epstein, two researchers have cut ties with the research center. J. Nathan Matias, a visiting scholar at the lab, said in a Wednesday statement that he was “profoundly disappointed in the decisions that Joi made, and that the Lab somehow allowed to happen."
That statement came after Ethan Zuckerman, director of the lab's Center for Civic Media, told MIT officials of his plans to resign in protest over the lab's ties to Epstein.
“I am ashamed of my institution today and starting the hard work of figuring out how to leave the Lab while taking care of my students and staff," Zuckerman wrote in a note that was obtained by the Globe.
Reif said members of the MIT community were struggling with the fact some researchers had accepted money from Epstein.
“Because the accusations against Jeffrey Epstein are so shocking, it can be difficult to maintain a fair understanding about what individuals at MIT could have been expected to know at the time, but I hope we can offer these members of our community the reassurance of our compassionate understanding," Reif said.
Thursday night, BethAnn McLaughlin, the founder of the nonprofit MeTooSTEM, said MIT still needs to address the culture that allowed the relationships with Epstein to develop.
McLaughlin, who won last year's Disobedience Award from the Media Lab for her work on sexual harassment in science, said her organization plans to come to MIT in the coming weeks to talk to those affected by such issues.
“I don't see anyone fired," McLaughlin said. “I see them saying 'we have a system in place.' They have a failed system."

What new payroll tax cuts would mean for you

Texto completo: President Donald Trump on Tuesday morning acknowledged that his aggressive trade policies may result in economic hardship for some Americans. Regardless, he said he does not fear a recession but is considering new tax cuts to promote economic growth.
"Payroll tax is something we think about, and a lot of people would like to see that, and that very much affects the workers of our country," Trump told reporters at the White House. "I've been thinking about payroll taxes for a long time."
The possibility of a temporary payroll tax cut would put more money in the hands of consumers in order to bolster spending and stave off a possible recession.
The last payroll tax cut came during the Obama administration in 2011 and was intended to kick-start the economy following the 2008 recession. Congress renewed the temporary cuts again in 2012.
Here's what a payroll tax cut would probably mean for the average American today:
What are payroll taxes and how are they listed on my paycheck?
Payroll taxes are taken directly from the paychecks of American workers and used to finance federal safety net programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
While few details have been shared regarding a potential payroll tax cut this year, it's likely it would target Social Security, experts say. That has renewed interest on Google for the question, "How is Social Security listed on my paycheck?"
The official name for Social Security is the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance. It's listed on your pay stub or pay slip as OASDI or FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act). It accounts for 6.2% of your wages overall, which your employer collects and remits to the government.
So a payroll tax cut will give me a bigger paycheck?
Yes, payroll tax cuts would result in more take-home pay immediately. But a reduction of 2% won't exactly have you rolling in the dough.
Why is that?
Social Security taxes are subject to a wage cap (or an amount you pay until you hit a certain threshold). After that, no more tax. This year, that number is $132,900. An individual earning wages equal to or larger than that sum contributes $8,239.80 to the OASDI program, and his or her employer contributes the same amount.
For Americans making a midrange salary, they contribute much less to Social Security than top earners and so there's less money to consider getting back.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers were $908 in the second quarter of 2019. At least 2% back in what that worker pays into Social Security would not be a substantial amount even if the cuts last 12 months.
But overall, the amount you'd get back would depend on the size of the cut and the duration.
Would that kind of money really stimulate the economy?
According to reports, some prominent economists don't appear to be optimistic and believe the majority of people may tuck the money away if recession fears grow deeper.
In addition, the same economists believe a lift to the GDP growth would be minimal and the bump to the federal deficit substantial.
According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, enacting the same policy of a 2% cut from 2011-2012 would cost the government nearly $300 billion before interest.
Is Trump considering any other economic adjustments?
The president also told reporters he's thinking about unilaterally reducing capital gains taxes without going through Congress. That would reduce the amount of taxes owed on profitable sales of stocks, bonds and other investments.
Economists say it's basically cutting taxes for the rich, which The New York Times says could be potentially problematic for Trump before his 2020 re-election campaign. The Democratic National Committee on Tuesday said 97% of the benefits would go the wealthiest 10% of people in the country, including nearly everyone in Trump's Cabinet.

Texto completo: It was supposed to be a fun joke. Create an event on Facebook that was so absurd, everyone would have a laugh, share a meme and then move on with their lives.
Instead, Matty Roberts got a visit from the FBI, the Air Force has warned it is ready for anything and rural Lincoln County, Nev., is preparing to declare a state of emergency.
In late June, Roberts, a 20-year-old from Bakersfield, posted his Facebook event: "Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us."

The idea was simple. Overwhelm the top-secret Nevada military site with people -- a mass of humanity that would storm the gates in pursuit of long-hidden truths that have long fueled conspiracy theories and television shows including "The X-Files."
It would all happen on Sept. 20. Finally, alien autopsies, UFOs in hangars and other off-the-books government research would be exposed. Vindication, Mulder and Scully!
The post got little attention at first, but a few days later it started to go viral, and by mid-July more than 1 million people said on Facebook they were planning to attend.
"We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry," wrote a video game streamer with the handle SmyleeKun. "If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets."
Naruto run is a reference to anime ninja Naruto Uzumaki, who runs with body and head leaning forward while keeping his arms straight behind his back.
Good luck with that.
The authorities soon heard about the plan and, unsurprising, weren't amused. It wasn't long before Roberts began backpedaling.
Interviewed by ABC News, he had a simple message for those who planned to carry out a raid on Area 51: "Please don't."
But it was too late. As of Wednesday, more than 2 million people were signed up to attend.
Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews issued a statement to The Times on Tuesday suggesting any attempt to rush Area 51 would be an ill-fated endeavor.
"The United States Air Force is aware of the Facebook post. The Nevada Test and Training Range is an area where the Air Force tests and trains combat aircraft," she said.
"As a matter of practice, we do not discuss specific security measures, but any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous."
Not to worry. Roberts told the "Today" show this month that the event is no longer a wholesale raid on Area 51 but instead a gathering dubbed "Alienstock."
A website for the event describes it as a festival "aiming to establish something unique here, a meeting place for all the believers ... a place to freely discuss Aliens & the Unknown!"
It would take place in the 50-person town of Rachel, pending a permit approval by the Lincoln County Commission on Sept. 3. The application came from a local inn owner, who estimated the crowd would number between 5,000 and 30,000. Humans, that is.
Lincoln County has a population of about 5,000 and covers 10,000 square miles of high-desert mountain landscape.
Commissioner Bevan Lister said the county gets its biggest crowds for the Pioche Labor Day Weekend Celebration, when he said about 1,400 people come for food, games and festivities.
He said for that event, they staff up on volunteers to help coordinate the heavy traffic that comes via two-lane state highways.
The county, he believed, could deal with 30,000 visitors. But 50,000? Or 100,000? Or more?
"There will be some serious challenges," Lister said.
The governor's office is aware of the situation and has been monitoring it, according to a spokesman.
If the county follows through with its plan to declare an emergency, the state would help with the costs of resources used to maintain order during the event.
The National Guard could be deployed, if needed, but Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said his department had already contacted law enforcement in Reno to assist with large crowds.
The town of Rachel is already gearing up for large numbers to arrive.
The city's only lodging -- the Little A'Le'Inn -- is booked, according to its website. There is no gas station in town. No grocery stores either.
The town put on its website a caution to those planning to arrive anyway.
"If you plan on attending the event you must be experienced in camping, hiking and surviving in a harsh desert environment and have a vehicle in good shape," the website reads. "You must be prepared to be completely on your own for food, water, gas etc. We expect cell service and the internet in Rachel to be offline. Credit card processing will not work, so bring enough cash."
Then came this ominous warning: "Law enforcement will be overwhelmed and local residents will step up to protect their property. It will get ugly."
The town website also urged people to attend a different event scheduled for the same day a few hours away in Nye County: Peacestock 51.
Tickets are advertised for $51, with 18 bands scheduled to perform in the town of Amargosa.
Or at least they were. The country commissioners voted Tuesday to deny a permit. An organizer said in an email that he is "still trying to save the event in one form or another."
Area 51 is a base that is primarily used for testing military aircraft and has been cloaked in secrecy for decades going back to the 1950s. One of the more notable aircraft to be first tested there was the U-2 spy plane.
It has been the subject of many conspiracy theories. In 2017, the New York Times and Politico revealed the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which the Pentagon ran to study unidentified flying objects and unexplained phenomena.
It was also revealed that former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had helped push through $22 million in funding for studying UFOs. In 2017, after the publication of the stories about the Pentagon's studies, he tweeted: "The truth is out there."
This year, responding to a Freedom of Information Act request by the Federation of American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, the Pentagon declassified documents showing it funded projects that examined wormholes and alternate dimensions.
The big questions now are how many people will show up in the Nevada desert and what will they do.
The Facebook event page has remained active, with a steady stream of posts that remain mostly sarcastic.
"Has anyone consulted Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum about this?" said one post, referencing the 1996 blockbuster "Independence Day." "I feel they are the Leading experts for Area 51."
Art Frasik, who signed up to attend, said in a Facebook message that he had been interested in aliens since he was a kid and saw "Independence Day."
Frasik, a 33-year-old real estate investor from Ohio, said he was looking for transportation to get to Area 51 for the storming event and that he believes the site contains "extraterrestrial related stuff."
"There's more people who are serious about it than what you think," he wrote.
"We understand that there is more power in numbers and the only way this is going to work is to show up."
Grant Fielder, a delivery truck driver in Arkansas who posted that he wanted to storm the mysterious site, said in an interview that he believed Americans had a right to know what is going on at the base.
"There is something out there," he said.
But the 24-year-old said he wouldn't be able to make it for a more terrestrial reason.
"I have to work," he said.

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published.
Four years ago, ProPublica started two programs that have become key components in our strategy to increase the diversity of our newsroom and our industry. One is the Data Institute, a two-week workshop that teaches journalists skills in data, coding and design. The other is our Diversity Scholarship program, which sends journalists from underrepresented groups to conferences such as NAHJ, NABJ and AAJA.
Nearly 100 journalists and journalism students have gone through these programs. Recently, we sent around a questionnaire to see where the Data Institute alumni and scholarship recipients are now. Many pointed to their experience with ProPublica as a turning point in their lives and careers.
------------
Data Institute
The Data Institute has taught 36 journalists since the first class of 2016. The students have ranged from midcareer journalists to journalism educators to J-school students. The Data Institute is a two-week, intensive workshop meant to expose people to a wide range of skills and techniques, including basic statistical analysis, programming, web scraping, data visualization and web design. The program is taught by ProPublica journalists, with visiting instructors and speakers from The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Marshall Project, Buzzfeed, WNYC and more.
Originally funded by the Knight Institute, since 2018 we’ve partnered with the Ida B. Wells Society, which funds the program and helps select each year’s students. For the past two years, OpenNews has provided logistical support.
Some Data Institute alumni told us that the skills they learned at the workshop enabled them to do stories that they wouldn’t have been able to do otherwise. Some credited the institute with helping them land a job.
What follows are lightly edited responses to our alumni survey:
Kayleigh Skinner, Data Institute 2018
Since attending the Data Institute, I’ve been able to use data and numbers in my stories a lot more seamlessly and, more important, understand what they mean. In the past, a huge spreadsheet would have intimidated me, but now thanks to the training I’ve received I feel comfortable cleaning it up and using it for projects.
I am an education and politics reporter at Mississippi Today in Jackson. One of my favorite projects I’ve done this year is an interactive data visualization with a colleague called “Do your lawmakers look like you?” I spent weeks collecting the birthdates, race, sex, district, party, etc. of every lawmaker in the Legislature to build my own database, and my colleague Alex Rozier and I used it to create an interactive that readers can use to see if the people in charge of making laws for the state reflect their electorate. I would not have even known where to begin on a project like this were it not for the Data Institute training.
In my day to day, I’ve also been able to create my own graphics using Datawrapper and do my own analysis on the large datasets I frequently have to mine as an education reporter. Knowing how to sort, use pivot tables and create formulas to decipher what I need to know from a dataset has been truly invaluable.
Laura Moscoso, Data Institute 2018
I’m still working at the Center for Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico, now as the data and multimedia editor. I continue to work on the everyday investigations, and since January I’ve also been working on a new project that’s following the money around the reconstruction of PR after Hurricane Maria.
I must mention our #RickyLeaks series, which started with the July 13 publication of a scandalous Telegram chat between the then-governor, Ricardo Rosselló, and his closest advisers. The publication resulted in the resignation of Rosselló on July 24 (effective Aug. 2). For the series, I mostly analyzed contracts with the government and other databases in order to build a power/relationship map using the tool Kumu that could describe a pillage of public funds during the Rosselló administration.
The institute has helped me enormously, and I apply most of what I learned in my day-to-day work. I think the biggest takeaway for me was not being afraid to dig into code even if I’m not “fluent” in it. I’m also more confident and creative when I’m proposing ideas and designs to my colleagues and editor. I think a lot about interviewing databases, cleaning with a journalistic instinct and rigorously fact checking my work and my colleagues’ work.
Samantha Smylie, Data Institute 2018
After the Data Institute, I immediately started freelancing for a few news organizations in Chicago. In February, I was hired as a staff writer at the Hyde Park Herald, a hyperlocal news organization on the South Side of Chicago that focuses on the Kenwood and Hyde Park neighborhoods. I cover education, housing, retail and development. The Data Institute gave me the confidence I needed to pursue a staff job. Also, I use my skills to read academic studies and understand the methodologies used to get a result. In the future, I will continue to seek training in data journalism and use it for education and housing reporting.
April Joyner, Data Institute 2017
I’m a markets correspondent at Reuters, where I write about U.S. stocks. I joined the company in fall 2017 not too long after my participation in the Data Institute. The Excel and data skills I learned at the Data Institute have come in handy as a business reporter. It gave me strategies to find story ideas and to ensure that the data I have really does support the story I’m pursuing. On a personal note, it gave me a confidence boost: I was freelancing at the time and ready to get back into a staff position, and being able to talk about a new skill was quite helpful as I was interviewing.
Ellis Simani, Data Institute 2017
Last month, I began a yearlong fellowship as a data reporter at ProPublica, two years after participating in the 2017 Data Institute. Prior to joining ProPublica, I worked for the LA Times on the graphics desk. There, I covered a variety of topics ranging from visualizing environmental issues along California’s coast, to investigating the shortcomings of the Census Bureau’s racial categories. I contributed data analysis on a series of stories focused on exploring the political and economic challenges facing California’s next governor. The project was a finalist for various print and online journalism awards. The biggest lesson I took from my time at the Data Institute was to be skeptical and untrusting when working with data. Though I have spent most of my time at fast-paced daily papers since leaving the Data Institute, I have always put an emphasis on taking the time to vet and question any data that I come across, and not placing more trust in numbers than I would any other source I work with as a reporter.
Julieta Rodrigo, Data Institute 2017
I am so thankful for the Data Institute. The work I completed in those weeks changed the course of my career. I started at the institute with an idea that I wanted to focus on journalism related specifically to foreign affairs, but the skills I learned during the program led me to a career in environmental science. The more I learned about climate change, the more I realized it was a threat multiplier for all the issues I already cared about, such as national security, immigration and the economy. I still want to be a journalist, but I want to add a lens of environmental science over every story.
Lakeidra Chavis, Data Institute 2016
I’m currently a reporting fellow at ProPublica Illinois in Chicago. In late 2016, after I attended the first Data Institute, I moved to Chicago to work for WBEZ, the local NPR station. At that time, shootings in the city were at a record high. I tracked all of the fatal shootings in real time in an in-house database. This helped to add context and substance to our often daily coverage of the issue without chasing other news outlets for the details. I couldn’t have done that without the tools I learned at the institute.
The skills I learned at the institute helped me stand apart in the newsrooms I worked in. I was able to do more accountability-focused reporting while having to report in a demanding, daily schedule. I was also able to pursue more enterprise stories since I had a better understanding of datasets, how to use them, how to spot errors and how to design my stories in a way that’s visually appealing.
Marquita Brown, Data Institute 2016
A month ago, I started a new job as the managing editor of EdTech Magazine: Focus on K-12. I was a daily newspaper reporter covering education when I attended ProPublica’s Data Institute in 2016. My job involves writing and publishing content in print and online. It requires a good bit of understanding of technology and how technology is used in education, specifically elementary and secondary schools. I know the exposure I received through ProPublica, particularly learning the basics of coding and design, as well as data analysis training, helped get me to where I am today. I learned some intangible lessons from ProPublica that now are just part of my default modus operandi: Don’t be afraid of failure. Never stop learning. I really honed my critical thinking skills during the Institute. Just learning about the possibilities of coding, design and data analysis was life changing.
Wendi Thomas, Data Institute 2016
I’m the editor and publisher of MLK50: Justice Through Journalism, a nonprofit newsroom in Memphis, Tennessee. Since the institute, I launched MLK50. We publish original content weekly on poverty, power and public policy. I have a small team of part-time editors and a visuals editor as well as a roster of freelance writers. We’re in our third year. Also since then, I was chosen for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network. My first set of stories published in late June on the aggressive debt collection practices of a nonprofit hospital in Memphis. In 2018, I was named Journalist of the Year by the Journalism and Women Symposium (JAWS). In August, I received NABJ’s Best Practices Award for MLK50. At the NABJ 2019 convention in Florida, I spoke on two panels about investigative journalism.
I can’t say that I use Ruby every day in my work, but I still follow the data hygiene principles I learned. The institute made me familiar with Excel and spreadsheets, and being a part of the LRN gave me an opportunity to practice daily. And the institute gave me an opportunity to meet lots of ProPublicans, which helped give me the confidence to apply for the LRN. ProPublica is a model of what being intentional about diversity and inclusion look like. I am proud to be even tangentially associated with y’all!

Diversity Scholarship Recipients
ProPublica has sent more than 50 students to a journalism conference that they otherwise would not have been able to attend. Some told us that attending the conference led to their first job. Others let us know that connections they made resulted in a job or fellowship a year or two later.
Andy Tsubasa Field, Diversity Scholarship 2018
I am currently driving to North Dakota where I will start my first job as the local government reporter for The Bismarck Tribune. The ProPublica Diversity Scholarship has had a tremendous impact on my career. The financial help from the scholarship helped increase my involvement in the AAJA community. I made valuable connections at the 2018 conference. Most important, attending the AAJA conference helped me find out about the AAJA Mentor Match program. I now have a mentor who helped give me advice during my job search. He was actually the one who emailed me about The Bismarck Tribune opening. So, I think it’s safe to say that without your scholarship, I might not be on a 21-hour drive to Bismarck right now for my first job!
Lynda Gonzalez, Diversity Scholarship 2018
I’m excited to share that I’ve been hired as a staff photojournalist at The Dallas Morning News for the next year through a Poynter-partnered fellowship program. Since receiving the ProPublica scholarship, I’ve graduated from my dual master’s program in journalism and Latin American studies in May 2019. Additionally, I was selected from hundreds of applicants to participate in the competitive The New York Times Student Journalism Institute this May. There, I produced a photo essay about one teenage boy’s coming-of-age story as a Guatamalan asylum-seeker in New York City. This opportunity was made possible directly because of the ProPublica scholarship — I connected with the institute’s program director at the NAHJ conference in Miami last summer, and I kept in touch with him during the application process. I’m endlessly thankful to ProPublica for investing in journalists from diverse backgrounds!
Isabeth Mendoza, Diversity Scholarship 2018
I am freelancing in Los Angeles as a podcast producer and radio reporter/producer. Since the scholarship, I completed an internship with NPR (in Los Angeles) on the national desk and was accepted in the inaugural cohort for the International Women’s Media Foundation — Gwen Ifill Fellows mentorship program. The scholarship by ProPublica was instrumental in attending NAHJ conference, where I gained the confidence, emotional support and resources to shift my career to journalism. In between the workshops and events, I networked with amazing journalists who wholeheartedly cared about mentorship, giving advice and seeing more Latinx journalists. I have felt inspired to continue working independently and return to the promises I made to myself a year ago, which includes carving out space in the audio world for health equity.
Andrew Jones, Diversity Scholarship 2018
I’m immensely grateful to ProPublica, and I feel like being a scholarship winner has opened all the doors in my journalism path. Without it, I honestly don’t think that all I’ve done would have been possible.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump promised he’d get rid of bad rules.
“Remove the anchor dragging us down!” he said when campaigning for president. “We’re going to cancel every needless job-killing regulation!”
Trump was a developer, so he knew that the thicket of rules government imposes often makes it impossible to get things done.
But would he keep his deregulation promise? I was skeptical.
Republicans often talk deregulation but then add rules. People called President George W. Bush an “anti-regulator.” But once he was president, he hired 90,000 new regulators!
Trump has been different.
When he took office, he hired regulation skeptics. He told government agencies: Get rid of two regulations for every new one you add.
I think his anti-regulation attitude is why stock prices rose and unemployment dropped. Trump sent a message to business: Government will no longer try to crush you. Businesses then started hiring.
Of course, the media wasn’t happy. Reporters love regulation.
They call Trump’s moves “an attack on the environment” and on “workers’ health.” The New York Times ran the headline “Donald Trump Is Trying to Kill You!”
What the media don’t get is that regulations have unintended side effects that often outweigh the good they’re intended to do.
Cars built smaller to comply with President Obama’s rules that require doubling of gas mileage cause increased deaths because smaller cars provide less protection.
“Should the government tell you what kind of car to buy?” asks Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in my new video about Trump.
Norquist says that Trump has largely kept his deregulation promise, and that’s been great for America.
For example, Trump repealed the Obama-era plan to classify franchise businesses like McDonald’s as one single business. Why?
“The trial lawyers want to be able to sue all of McDonald’s, not just the local McDonald’s, if they spill coffee on themselves,” says Norquist. “And the labor unions want to unionize all McDonald’s, not just the one store. That would have been a disaster.”
Trump’s FCC repealed Obama’s “net neutrality” rule, which would have limited internet providers’ freedom to charge different prices.
Democrats and other regulation-lovers predicted repeal would mean that rich people would dominate the internet. Bernie Sanders even tweeted that repeal would mean “the end of the internet as we know it.”
Of course, none of those things happened. Or as Norquist puts it: “None of it! None of it!”
But some Obama regulations sounded so important.
Norquist laughs at that. “The names for these regulations are written by regulators. They’re advertisements for themselves.”
Of course, unlike advertisers, regulators don’t list side effects of their rules, which Norquist says should read: “May cause unemployment, may reduce wages, may raise the cost of energy, may make your car not drivable.”
Trump’s deregulation record would be better were he not so eager to add regulations, such as tariffs, at the same time.
“There is a challenge. Trump is a protectionist in many ways,” says Norquist, sadly. “Tariffs are taxes, and regulations on the border are regulations on consumers.”
So are Trump’s “buy American” rules.
“That sounds like a good idea, but it’s a dumb idea, and I wish he hadn’t done it,” says Norquist. “That is not deregulation. The good news is that the vast majority of the acts have been deregulatory and tremendously helpful.”
Recently, Trump announced, “We have cut 22 regulations for every new regulation!”
He exaggerated, as he often does. The real number is about five. But that’s still pretty good. Better than Ronald Reagan did.
I wish Trump would do more.
I wish he’d remove his tariffs and agricultural subsidies and kill the Export-Import Bank, drug prohibition and the onerous rules that encourage illegal immigration by making it almost impossible for foreigners to work here legally.
Keep your promise, President Trump! Repeal 22 regulations for every new one!
Nevertheless, so far, mostly good.
Every excessive rule repealed is a step in the right direction: toward freedom.

Texto completo: Something is rotten in President Trump canceling his trip to Denmark.
In yet another example of Trump's undiplomatic rudeness, the bumptious billionaire has canceled an already scheduled state visit to Denmark, apparently upset that the tiny, friendly nation won’t jump at his command.
Invited to Copenhagen by Queen Margrethe II, Trump specifically had said that the visit was not dependent on Denmark’s level of interest in his idea of buying the vast island of Greenland from the Danes. Once both Danish premier Kim Kielsen and prime minister Mette Frederiksen said there is no chance of them selling Greenland, though, Trump gave the lie to his own earlier words by abruptly canceling the trip and specifically citing Greenland as the reason.
To say Trump’s behavior here is childish is to insult children. Or at least, the worst of spoiled brats now have a new role model.
Small though it is, Denmark is a valuable and longstanding ally. It allows the U.S. to operate the Thule Air Base on Greenland, which is of great strategic significance, on terms extremely generous to the U.S. Denmark stands with its larger ally when most other nations don’t, including in joining Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Denmark has no obvious direct interest in the Middle East, but it provides troops when asked — 43 of whom have lost their lives in American-led missions in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. (In terms of percentage of population, that would be the equivalent of U.S. losses of some 2,500 personnel.)
Trump’s idea of buying Greenland might well be mutually beneficial to Americans and Danes, but it obviously came out of proverbial left field as far as the Danes were concerned. Obviously, nobody in the Trump administration had bothered telling them of Trump’s interest. It would be unreasonable to expect them to immediately comply, or even to comply at all. Even if Denmark decides it makes sense to sell, there are the desires of Greenland’s 56,000 inhabitants to consider. Because this state visit was arranged without any signal that a purchase of Greenland was on the agenda, much less even being considered, it is a nasty trick indeed to kill the trip just because Denmark isn’t jumping at the chance to relinquish its largest territory.
Naturally and correctly, the people of Denmark and Greenland find Trump’s crude power play “deeply insulting,” in the words of former prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. “Total chaos,” former finance minister Kristian Jensen wrote. “This has gone from a great opportunity for a strengthened dialogue between allies to a diplomatic crisis.” (Quotes from the New York Times.)
The rotten smell to all this is emanating not from the state of Denmark, but from the current state of the Oval Office. The president’s diplomatic hygiene is abominable.

Defiant Steve King vows to run for reelection 'unless I'm dead'

Texto completo: SPENCER, Iowa — Rep. Steve King vowed nothing would keep him from seeking reelection in 2020 as he blamed Republican leaders, Democrats, and the media for the political peril he faces in an otherwise solidly conservative House seat.
In an interview with the Washington Examiner following a town hall meeting for constituents in this farming community in the heart of his northwest Iowa congressional district, King reframed his narrow 2018 reelection victory as a triumph over the opposition of turncoat Republican leaders and an energized Left. He said he expected to win a 10th term next year on the strength of grassroots support that he claims has not wavered.
“Thirteen days out we were up 18 points. Then, Republican leadership turned on me and Steve Stivers attacked me a week out and raised a million-and-a-half dollars for my opponent,” King said, referring to Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers, who last cycle was chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP campaign arm.
“Even with that, and millions of dollars of media that was poured against me, some of it strategized, some of it organic, I don’t think anybody has faced such a nearly perfect storm as I have faced,” King added. Asked if there was any possibility he might fulfill the wishes of GOP leaders in Washington and Iowa and retire in 2020 rather than seek a 10th term, King said: “No. Unless I’m dead. That’s the only circumstance.”
That is likely to satisfy King loyalists, who appreciate a politician they describe as refreshingly blunt, like President Trump, who won the district three years ago with 61% of the vote.
“Steve King is about as straightforward a shooter as you can get — no sugar coating. He reminds me of Donald Trump in a lot of ways,” said Phil Carlson, 57, a farmer who was clad in a Trump campaign “Keep America Great” hat. “We like him here; we’re glad he’s in Congress.”
King, 70, has a habit of irritating fellow Republicans with comments on hot-button issues such as immigration and abortion that some have described as racist and insensitive. But the firebrand congressman rejected those accusations, insisting that his words have been twisted, distorted, and taken out of context by the Democrats and a compliant liberal media. Republican leaders in Iowa and on Capitol Hill, King said, have fallen for it.
“Even the liberals don’t know what they’re supposed to be angry at until they’re told, often by the liberal press. I’ve watched it spring out of CNN and MSNBC, if they express indignation into a story, it’s picked up across the country,” King said. “None of my language was offensive.”
Last year, Stivers cut King loose ahead of the midterm elections over unhappiness with how the Iowan expressed his opposition to immigration and for questioning the value of ethnic diversity, and for appearing to lend support to figures who harbored racist and anti-Semitic views.
Earlier this year, the New York Times quoted King in an interview, saying: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" King at first apologized, although it was not enough to satisfy House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who along with his leadership team decided to eject the congressman from his committees. The move had potentially disastrous political consequences in a largely rural, agricultural seat such as Iowa’s 4th Congressional District.
Then recently, King appeared to dismiss the trauma of rape and incest as he defended his position on the issue. King opposes abortion rights, even in the case of rape and incest.
Regarding his reported defense of white nationalism, King said flatly that he never uttered the quote attributed to him by the New York Times. He told the Washington Examiner that he refers to white nationalism as an “odious ideology” that he completely opposes. Regarding the controversy he stirred with his comments on abortion, King did not deny the veracity of the quotes, but said he was being taken out of context.
“The New York Times quote is wrong, it’s a misquote, I don’t know if it’s willful or whether it’s just accidental,” King said. Of his abortion comments, he added: “I don’t want to stigmatize the survivors of rape and incest. Those babies that are born are as sacred as … as my grandchildren, that we should not execute those innocent little babies almost always because of the sins of the father.”
King, who has generally cruised to reelection since winning his first congressional race in 2002, barely survived last fall, winning with 50.4% of the vote. He is bracing for a rematch with Democrat J.D. Scholten, but must first get past the GOP primary against state Sen. Randy Feenstra, as well as other challengers. Democrats, about a dozen of whom showed up in Spencer to protest King during his town hall meeting, are optimistic that his number is finally up, even though Trump is positioned to win Iowa and the 4th District again next year.
Why are Democrats nonetheless optimistic of picking off King after he went unscathed for years?
“His rhetoric has stepped up since Trump has become president,” said Anne Slattery, the Democratic activist who organized the King protest. “I feel like he’s emboldened to speak his mind. He’s never spoken his mind like this before, saying the things he’s said. And, I think people are taking notice.”

John Sullivan: An excellent choice for Moscow ambassador

Texto completo: The New York Times reports that Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan will be nominated U.S. ambassador to Moscow. It's a good choice. Sullivan is smart, calm, and experienced: three crucial ingredients in leading the U.S. mission to Russia.
If Sullivan is confirmed by the Senate, he'll lead a team of hundreds of diplomats and Russian employees. He'll also face his fair share of challenges. His upcoming job isn't for the faint of heart.
The Russian FSB intelligence service loves to play games of varying degrees with U.S. diplomats on Russian soil. Reflecting that concern, the U.S. deputy chief of mission in Moscow has great experience in diplomatic security. And while an ambassador is better shielded from these antics than other diplomats, they are not insulated entirely. Sullivan can expect the Russians to disrupt certain of his events and to cause aggravation for his senior leadership team.
That said, Sullivan's experience should set him up to work effectively wherever possible. Popular at the State Department as a true professional and patriot, Sullivan has the chops to earn Democratic and Republican support on the Hill. And that matters for reasons other than simple confirmation.
The Russians value U.S. diplomats who stand up for themselves, get to the nuts and bolts of an issue, and who have influence in Washington. Which is why, for example, they respect national security adviser John Bolton even though he is hawkish on Russia. With his experience at the top of the State Department and his close relationship with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Sullivan should gain at least some engagement from the Russians.
We shouldn't expect too much, however. Russian President Vladimir Putin is a determined and highly capable U.S. adversary. He does not want to be friends with America, he wants to damage America. There are a few areas of possible compromise for Sullivan to embrace, but not many.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump slammed the Ford Motor Company on Wednesday for reaching an agreement with California to lower emission standards, even as his administration has sought to relax federal rules around pollution from cars.
"Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesn’t work as well, because execs don’t want to fight California regulators," Trump wrote in a tweet.
He continued: "Car companies should know that when this Administration’s alternative is no longer available, California will squeeze them to a point of business ruin. Only reason California is now talking to them is because the Feds are giving a far better alternative, which is much better for consumers!
And in the same tweetstorm: "The Legendary Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan, the Founders of Ford Motor Company and General Motors, are “rolling over” at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good, and cost $3,000 more to consumers. Crazy!"
Trump's tweets follow a recent report in the New York Times that the White House was blindsided by an agreement between California and four large automakers and that the administration summoned companies to the White House to press them on the issue.
Last year, the Trump administration proposed freezing mile-per-gallon standards for cars and light trucks after the 2020 model year, saying it would keep prices lower for consumers and improve safety. Trump has also taken aim at California's more stringent standards, which the federal government historically allowed under a special exemption.

Trump has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Detroit, at once crediting his policies with helping to revive the auto industry while also blasting company officials when they announce autoworker layoffs. Trump got into a spat with General Motors last fall after the company announced layoffs and plant closures in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland.
AP Fact Check: Trump's false claims on fuel economy rules
Trump is misrepresenting the facts about his proposal to freeze Obama-era fuel economy requirements at 2021 levels.
In a tweet earlier Wednesday, Trump blasted auto executives as “foolish” and accused the companies of being “politically correct” for resisting the plan, which two of his agencies are putting together in a final regulation.
A look at Trump’s claims and reality:
TRUMP: “My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!”
THE FACTS: Trump is inflating the projected savings to consumers, minimizing the potential environmental harm and may be exaggerating the safety benefits.
His own administration, in documents proposing to freeze the standards, puts the cost of meeting the Obama-era requirements at around $2,700 per vehicle. It claims buyers would save that much by 2025, over standards in place in 2016. But that number is disputed by environmental groups and is more than double the estimates from the Obama administration.
Trump’s tweet also is ignoring money that consumers would save at the gas pump if cars get better mileage. A study released Aug. 7 by Consumer Reports found that the owner of a 2026 vehicle will pay over $3,300 more for gasoline during the life of a vehicle if the standards are frozen at 2021 levels. The administration’s proposed freeze would hold the average fuel economy for the new-vehicle fleet at 29. 1 mpg in real-world driving, while the Obama-era standards would raise it to 37. 5 mpg by 2026, according to Consumer Reports.
A White House spokesman had no immediate comment on how Trump came up with his claims.
In regards to the environment, Trump claims his proposal would cause little harm, but documents from his own administration say that U. S. fuel consumption would increase by about 500,000 barrels per day, a 2% to 3% increase. Environmental groups predict even more fuel consumed, resulting in higher pollution.
Trump’s statement that cars would be substantially safer also is in dispute. His administration argues that lower-cost vehicles would allow more people to buy new ones that are safer, cutting roadway deaths by 12,700 lives through the 2029 model year. But Consumer Reports says any safety impact from changes in gas mileage standards are small and won’t vary much from zero.
There’s little basis for Trump’s claim that engines would run more smoothly. Early versions of cars with more fuel-efficient transmissions, turbochargers and technology that stops engines at red lights were rough, but those have been refined.
“The automakers have figured out how to use this technology and make the cars smoother driving, too,” said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports director of auto testing.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- There are some physicians who forbid their patients from going online to type in their symptoms, fearing they'll get incorrect information or become more anxious. Lisa Sanders is not among them.

Sanders, whose monthly "Diagnosis" column in The New York Times magazine inspired the hit Fox TV series "House," has a more practical -- and democratic approach -- to so-called Dr. Google.

"I actually think that no matter what doctors said or when they said it, patients have been discussing their illnesses as the first symptoms happen," she said.

"By the time a patient brings their story to me as their primary care doctor, they've already run it by their best friend, their spouse, their mom, their kids -- they've told their story to everybody. It turns out that the internet is now just one more everybody you tell your story to. I don't think that's a bad thing."

Sanders doesn't just think crowdsourcing isn't bad, she's harnessing the internet and social media in her work diagnosing unusual cases. This month, she's showing off that approach to a whole new crowd -- Nexflix users.

The new seven-part documentary series "Diagnosis" piggybacks on her Times columns by profiling seven patients as they track down a diagnosis, from a Gulf War veteran in New Mexico to a girl with seizures in New York City.

"The show is about diagnosis as a process that doctors go through but it's also a show about diagnosis as a process that patients go through, too. And I think both ends have to be treated with respect and honored," Sanders said.

In the series, Sanders consults as the patients and their doctors seek various treatments, go down blind alleys and seek advice on social media, from patients and doctors alike. More voices in the mix mean more dizzying options but some lead to unexpected solutions.

The little girl in New York with seizures is told by one doctor that an operation to remove half her brain as the "gold standard." But her parents decide to keep looking and instead choose to have a less invasive brain implant, an option they found out about through feedback.

"Never in human history has medicine been able to do and know as much as we do and know right now," said Sanders. "Never before have we been able to make as many diagnoses as we can now."

Jonathan Chinn, an executive producer alongside Scott Rudin and his cousin, Simon Chinn, said the series highlights the benefits of technology -- in this case to connect a global village of experts.

"We focus a lot on the negatives of technology -- spying and a lack of privacy -- but this is an example of a way that technology, if harnessed the right way and responsibly curated, can actually save lives and make peoples' lives tangibly better," he said.

While there's a lot of misinformation online, Sanders thinks patients are becoming more critical about where they get their information.

She thinks the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health have excellent information, and even Wikipedia can be helpful so long as the entries are edited by "people who have skin in the game."

"We are getting to be savvier consumers," she said. "I hope that people have enough sense to understand that when money is guiding your message, that maybe the message isn't the best."

Texto completo: Thus if I now know which whites demand non-chlorine bleach, how much detergent to add, when to apply spray-on booster cleanser and where to stash the sweatshirts — the fitted sheet sneers at me. You?
Some years ago my wife and I had one of those – conversations. A mini-confrontation, initiated by her. Some spousal assertiveness, by a woman never reluctant to assert herself.
It seemed to her that since we lived beneath the same roof, and since she had a career to tend to just as I had, I should share in household duties. It made sense, seemed fair and still does, even if the burden of such duties seems to have steadily shifted toward me.
Laundry, for one. There was a learning curve. It was pointed out to me that certain whites should not be washed with bleach lest they acquire an undesirable pinkish hue, or wear thin too quickly. Colors: cold water, though some items need to be segregated by color. Delicates, or most of them, should be removed from the drier and hung (not on wire hangers!) before they are completely crisp; others should be spread and smoothed and allowed to dry naturally. Oh – fabric softener: not with towels, as she read somewhere that the stuff hampers their absorbency.
I've become fairly adept at it, haven't ruined any garments or linens since unintentionally tie-dying two of my beloved's linen blouses: One pink, the other blue, both new; and when I volunteered that they looked pretty chic, her stare was response sufficient. Washing and drying is but half the job, however; there remains the folding and putting away. And at that I've become suitably proficient as well. With one exception.
I would wager that folding a fitted sheet, the kind with elastic at the corners that secure it to the mattress, is a domestic riddle yet to be solved by tens of thousands of my fellow Arkansans, male and female.
When I confessed bewilderment at the task, my bride demonstrated to me her technique, as taught her by her mother, and the outcome was more or less satisfactory in that the end product was a two-inch thick rectangle. Rumpled, with some bulges, and lacking the symmetry of the perfectly folded top sheet. But it got the job done. "It's really not complicated," she said.
Yes, it is. Find the first two corners, which aren't really "corners," and tuck one into the other, then find the other two without dropping the first two, then tuck them, then raise all four without dropping the entire thing, then...
To the rescue comes the nation's newspaper of record, the mighty New York Times. While most usually recognized (and sometimes vilified) for its world and national news coverage, it publishes a lot of feature material that's good for boosting and maintaining circulation among readers who don't care that much about budget deficits and North Korean rocket launches. (This newspaper's editors and publisher are nodding.)
I care about those kind of things, but I was scrolling down its website in search of the weekly Book Review when I chanced upon a story, a video, in the "Smarter Living" section, that promised a live-enhancing read: "Yes You Can: Fold a Fitted Sheet."
Oh yeah? Click on the image and up pops the first sentence, actually a warning: "Take a deep breath." That ought to tell you something. And that's not even Step One, though it should be.
In the Times video procedural there are four steps, with a supposedly soothing "See? This isn't so hard" message at the midway point. As an example, and at the risk of copyright violation, Step Two: "Fold the corner on your right hand over your left. Use your free hand to straighten the edges and put your left hand into the opposite corner pockets connecting the two remaining edges."
It gets worse. And the young lady who demonstrates the technique surely had a couple drinks before undertaking the assignment, though it ended in perfection. I tried all four steps and they ended in imperfection.
I envy perfection in most everything but never achieve it in anything save sloth. Thus if I now know which whites demand non-chlorine bleach, how much detergent to add, when to apply spray-on booster cleanser and where to stash the sweatshirts — the fitted sheet sneers at me. You?
I recommend the four-step Steve Sheet approach:
Step One: Wash.
Step Two: Dry.
Step Three: Remove from drier, roll sheet into wad approximating size of a child's sleeping bag.
Step Four: Stuff in drawer.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has no regrets over calling on Al Franken to quit the Senate, but says there's room for forgiveness.
In an interview broadcast Monday, she addressed recent statements from other senators who say they now regret calling for Franken's head in January 2018 amid sexual harassment and misconduct allegations from eight women.
"It represents a struggle a lot of people are having right now with this idea of redemption and this idea of forgiveness," Gillibrand said of colleagues who have changed their minds.
Gillibrand said forgiveness is "there for anyone who wants it.
"It just is a matter of having the humility and grace to take responsibility, to know that you need to say you're sorry and move on," she told the New York Times' "The Daily" podcast.
Franken now says he regrets his decision to resign. The comment came in a New Yorker article that pointed out flaws in the account from his first accuser, conservative talk radio host Leeann Tweeden.
Gillibrand has struggled to break out of the bottom of the pack of Democratic presidential contenders. Some major donors reportedly have shunned her for her stance on Franken.
"I don't think the Al Franken thing has helped," she said. "I think it's hurt when it comes to Democratic donors. ... But I could have told anybody at the time that there is literally no reward for standing up to powerful men who are good at their day job."

A New Tool to Track What's Tracking You

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook has built an extensive network of tracking technology outside of its core social network to bolster its targeted advertising business. That has allowed the company to collect information about its users' browsing habits, even when they were not using the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it was changing its practices related to that data -- kind of.
The company introduced a new tool that lets people better see and control the information that Facebook has gathered about their browsing habits outside the social network.
The tool, Off-Facebook Activity, allows users to view the hundreds of sites and apps that share data and customer information with Facebook. They can disconnect the data from their account if they want.
"This is another way to give people more transparency and control on Facebook," the company said in a blog post. It added that people generally had more than 80 apps on their phones and used about half of them every month, making it difficult to know which ones had collected personal information and how the data was being used.
The introduction of the new tool is Facebook's latest response to criticism over how it safeguards users' privacy. The issue exploded last year after The New York Times and other outlets reported on how a British consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had harvested the personal information of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission.
Facebook has been trying since then to contain the fallout, attracting scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. Last month, the company reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations, agreeing to pay a $ 5 billion fine and to change how it handled users' data.
Amid the backlash over Facebook's approach to privacy issues, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, has said the company would develop a technological solution that would give people the ability to clear their browsing histories.
Facebook said it initially hoped to provide an option that would let users delete the entire repository of data that the company collected from other sites to improve its targeting of ads. But Facebook said its research showed that people did not want such an all-or-nothing option. Instead, Facebook said, users frequently asked for better visibility into which sites were providing browsing-habit data to the company, and for more control over how the information was shared.
The new tool will not be a cure-all for those concerned about privacy on Facebook. The company will continue to retain all browsing data of users on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.
Yet by giving people the option of wiping clean their browsing history outside Facebook and its apps, the company is taking a risk because of its partial dependence on such information for targeting ads at users. The company said it was prepared for the consequences of users' deciding to exercise greater control over their privacy by using the tool.
"If this were widely adopted, it would mean less overall revenue for Facebook," David Baser, a director of product management at the company, said in an interview. "And that's O.K."
The new tool can be found in the settings menu of the Facebook app. Once people click on it, they can look into an itemized history of the outside apps and websites they have visited that have shared data with the social network. They can also see the types of data the apps and sites have shared.
A user might see that a site for a clothing retailer had one of Facebook's tracking cookies installed on its web page. If a customer browsed a pair of pants on the site and then returned to Facebook, the social network's tracking technology may have shown that user an ad for the same pair of pants inside the Facebook app.
Beyond having access to the itemized browsing history, people can also use the tool to disconnect the historical browsing data from their accounts entirely, or to remove data from individual sites and apps. The tool also lets people turn off data-sharing from all sites and apps off Facebook.
Facebook said that the new tool would be rolled out gradually in the coming months, beginning on Tuesday in Ireland, South Korea and Spain.

What the Rally Playlists Say About the Candidates

Texto completo: Song playlists at campaign rallies tell you a lot about presidential candidates. The music is selected to reflect their values, their political messages, their "real" selves. The songs also say something about the candidates' target audiences -- whether they're young or old, straight or L.G.B.T.Q., into country, disco or hip-hop.
The music booms as people enter the rallies, and then candidates take the stage to a "walk-up" song that can become associated with their platforms. The New York Times analyzed playlists used by nine Democratic candidates and President Trump to see how they help set the tone for each campaign.
Kamala Harris
Senator from California, 54
Ms. Harris has the most viable candidacy of any black woman ever to run for president.
Her path to the nomination would almost certainly depend on winning a sizable amount of black voters, and her 41-track playlist is dominated by black and Latino artists.
Ms. Harris's first rally was held in her Oakland, Calif., hometown, where she walked up to "Work That," an empowerment anthem by Mary J. Blige that stresses authenticity and confidence.
OUR CRITICS SAY
More than half of Ms. Harris's playlist is filled with funk classics, exuberant classic soul and modern-day gospel-pop, from Aretha to Prince to Pharrell.
But Ms. Harris is far and away the most hip-hop-minded of all the candidates, and she's keen to show off her range -- Biggie and Pac, Cardi and Chance, Tribe and Migos, Kendrick and Hov, Nicki and Lauryn.
That said, had the senator not included music with northern California connections like E-40, she might not have been allowed back in the Bay Area. -- JON CARAMANICA
Beto O'Rourke
Former congressman from Texas, 46
Mr. O'Rourke was a national political phenomenon last year when he ran against Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and narrowly lost. His political style is largely defined by his use of social media and his go-it-alone style.
Mr. O'Rourke's playlist, which his staff noted he curated himself, reflects his long history with rock music, which has been part of his journey from a wandering youth to an outspoken candidate.
By contrast, Ms. Harris's playlist doesn't include a single rock song.
When he held his first rally in his El Paso hometown, Mr. O'Rourke walked up to "Clampdown" by the Clash, a political song about the struggles of the working class.
OUR CRITICS SAY
Mr. O'Rourke's extensive playlist runs like an old iPod set on shuffle, hopping around its owner's past and present. He's from Texas, so there are Texas-rooted performers.
He played in a punk band, so there are punks.
And now he has crowds to pump up, with upbeat songs from Joan Jett, the Who and the Rolling Stones. It feels casual, like riffling through a music fan's collection. -- JON PARELES
Elizabeth Warren
Senator from Massachusetts, 70
Ms. Warren has been introducing policy ideas at a blistering pace, focusing on ways to remake the American economy.
Ms. Warren turned 70 in June, making her among the oldest candidates in the race. Most of the songs in her playlist date from the 1990s and earlier.
Ms. Warren's ideas and campaign themes aimed at working-class voters are reflected in her walk-up song, Dolly Parton's "9 to 5."
OUR CRITICS SAY
Ms. Warren's playlist is equal parts policy and uplift. The policy is concern for workers: the "Everyday People" who deserve "Respect" for "Takin' Care of Business" "Under Pressure" from "9 to 5." Bruce Springsteen's Obamacare anthem, "We Take Care of Our Own," is also in the mix.
But the list balances this earnestness with euphoria. Feel-good songs like "Walking on Sunshine" and "Dog Days Are Over" insist on optimism, undergirded by determination. -- JON PARELES
Kirsten Gillibrand
Senator from New York, 52
Ms. Gillibrand, who has struggled to break out of the 2020 pack, has been clear about her intention to focus on women in her campaign, emphasizing issues like gender discrimination, abortion rights and paid family leave.
Ms. Gillibrand's playlist likewise reflects her desire to appeal to female voters; nearly three-quarters of the artists are women.
She leads the field by a wide margin in this respect.
At her first event, she walked up to Lizzo's "Good as Hell," a song about a woman breaking free of life's stressors and becoming her best self. Ms. Gillibrand even released a video of herself dancing to the track on her campaign bus.
OUR CRITICS SAY
On the one hand, Ms. Gillibrand includes a track by Le Tigre, the underground feminist dance-punk band that Kathleen Hanna founded not long after the riot grrrl icons Bikini Kill split.
On the other hand, a misstep: There are several hundred Lil Wayne songs that could have appeared on Ms. Gillibrand's playlist to include contemporary hip-hop. But the selected song is from a "Spider-Man" movie soundtrack, and it features XXXTentacion, who, before he was killed last year, had been accused of assaulting his pregnant girlfriend. (The campaign says it removed the song in the spring.) -- JON CARAMANICA
Bernie Sanders
Senator from Vermont, 77
Mr. Sanders is famous for his renegade style and liberal policy proposals. Though he's the race's oldest candidate, Mr. Sanders enjoys wide support from younger voters, and has been a darling of the online left since his 2016 run.
In 2016, Mr. Sanders faced criticism that his campaign was too male-driven. Though the campaign has sought to bring in new voices this year, all but one song on his 2020 rally playlist is led by male performers.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. O'Rourke set themselves apart in this respect.
Some of his allies say Mr. Sanders needs to do more storytelling about himself to win over larger numbers of voters. At his kickoff rally, he walked up to Jay-Z's "Brooklyn Go Hard," a nod to Mr. Sanders's roots there.
OUR CRITICS SAY
The musical styles in Mr. Sanders's playlist range all over the place, from the wistful Simon & Garfunkel song "America" (returning from his 2016 campaign) to disco, country, R&B, punk and reggae. But the message is single-minded.
Three songs have revolution in the title; then there are "Make a Change," "Power to the People," "Uprising" and "Takin' It to the Streets." Point made. -- JON PARELES
Cory Booker
Senator from New Jersey, 50
Mr. Booker has staked his candidacy on retail campaigning and a message of love and community meant to cut through the partisan politics of the current moment.
His playlist projects this uplifting tone while also reflecting the diverse voter coalition he seeks to build -- and spreading his message of love.
Mr. Booker's first rally was in his Newark hometown. His walk-up song is "Lovely Day," a 1977 track by the soul singer Bill Withers about how love can help you find the bright side.
OUR CRITICS SAY
The relentlessness of the inspiration on Mr. Booker's playlist is exhausting. His Chicken Soup for the Candidate Soul features the ecstatic yelps of Stevie Wonder, the ecstatic yelps of Florence + the Machine, the ecstatic yelps of Bon Jovi and, yes, the ecstatic yelps of Demi Lovato. -- JON CARAMANICA
Julián Castro
Former housing secretary, 44
Mr. Castro is the race's only Latino candidate. He has made his presence felt on the debate stage and by speaking up about several contentious policy issues, including reparations for black Americans and immigration reform.
Even with a very short playlist, Mr. Castro's includes three songs with Spanish lyrics.
Mr. Castro's playlist shows his focus on Latinos, as other candidates have largely neglected Spanish-language music.
Over the course of the campaign, Mr. Castro has begun to lean even more into his personal story, and his walk-up song has reflected that shift: He began with "High Hopes" by Panic! at the Disco but has since changed to "Baila Esta Cumbia" by Selena.
OUR CRITICS SAY
Mr. Castro's choices reflect the studious dullness of someone who learns about new records from supermarket speakers. Arena-rock bros Imagine Dragons? Check. Something from the "Hamilton" ecosystem? Yup. Lenny Kravitz? Obviously.
Sure, there are three songs in Spanish -- Calle 13's "Latinoamérica," Selena's "Baila Esta Cumbia," Gloria Estefan's "Mi Tierra." Two of them are even good. But there's also a song that was originally written for a Nike commercial to promote women's athletics in India -- noble cause, clunky rhythm, odd fit. -- JON CARAMANICA
Pete Buttigieg
Mayor of South Bend, Ind., 37
Mr. Buttigieg often places his relative youth at the forefront of his message of generational change, arguing that he understands politics in a new way because of his recent political formation. Mr. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay president.
Mr. Buttigieg's playlist, like his campaign rhetoric, is a catchall -- a well-balanced mix. Almost a third of the songs also make appearances on other candidates' playlists.
The song he uses to enter the stage, "High Hopes" by Panic! at the Disco, used to be Julián Castro's walk-up song.
OUR CRITICS SAY
Asked about the difference in musical taste between him and his husband, Mr. Buttigieg averred, "He's into more poppy stuff and more musicals -- I'm into more of the brooding stuff." But the mayor doesn't want his rallies to be downers. His playlist has uplifting rock and zippy soul tempered with wistful country.
Mr. Buttigieg also notably includes several L.G.B.T.Q. artists and allies. -- JON CARAMANICA
Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Former vice president, 76
Mr. Biden is currently the Democratic front-runner, helped by his high name recognition after decades in public life, and the perception that he's best suited to win back some voters who supported Mr. Trump in 2016.
Biden is making a broad bid for voters, and his playlist is almost perfectly divided between black and white artists.
"Middle-class Joe," as Mr. Biden is sometimes called, turned to a workingman's hero -- Bruce Springsteen -- for his walk-up song: "We Take Care of Our Own."
OUR CRITICS SAY
Lady Gaga, Bleachers and the 1975 were not hitmakers that Mr. Biden, 76, grew up on. His playlist leans on the current decade while occasionally dipping back to soul oldies. The message in the songs, old and recent, is momentum and redemption.
Its finale, Darius Rucker's "Learn to Live," is an arena-country tribute to a grandpa who advised, "You got to live and learn, you got to crash and burn/You got to make some stances and take some chances." -- JON PARELES
Donald Trump
President of the United States, 73
Mr. Trump is a showman. And at his political rallies, music is vitally important, blasted at a striking decibel level that turns up even louder when he arrives and exits. Since rallygoers gather for hours before the event begins, it also keeps the crowd engaged with singalongs.
Mr. Trump's rally music is overwhelmingly performed by white artists or majority-white bands.
Mr. Trump had the largest share of songs from the previous century, beating Ms. Warren.
Mr. Trump's entrance is one of the key moments at his rallies. He walks up to the country singer Lee Greenwood's anthem "God Bless the USA." (He walks off to "You Can't Always Get What You Want" by the Rolling Stones.)
OUR CRITICS SAY
Pugnacity, high drama, self-congratulation and Top 10 familiarity -- preferably all at once -- are clear requirements for the playlist at Mr. Trump's rallies. They're oldies with a swagger ...
... including, surprisingly, gay swagger. The default sentiment is combative self-confidence; the default sound is a martial blare. -- JON PARELES
Methodology
The New York Times reached out to each candidate's campaign team for his or her full playlist. For the ones who did not provide the playlist -- President Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Bernie Sanders -- Times reporters went to each candidates' rallies to obtain the list of songs using an online application that helps instantly identify music.
The Times then analyzed a total of 306 songs on the candidates' playlists. The pop music editor determined the genre of the songs. For race and gender of an artist or band, The Times took into account only the lead singer. For gender analysis, if there was no lead performer and the group features both male and female members, a separate category was created. For the word frequency chart, The Times analyzed the lyrics in each song, leaving out filler words like "the," "yeah," and "bam."
Walk-up songs can change, and the order of the songs on each playlist doesn't reflect the actual sequence played at rallies.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: In 2014, Peter Pomerantsev, a British journalist born in the Soviet Union, published “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible,” which drew on his years working in Russian television to describe a society in giddy, hysterical flight from enlightenment empiricism. He wrote of how state-controlled Russian broadcasting “became ever more twisted, the need to incite panic and fear ever more urgent; rationality was tuned out, and Kremlin-friendly cults and hatemongers were put on prime time.”
Since 2016, the book has enjoyed a new life among people struggling to make sense of the dual shocks of Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory. Both catastrophes demonstrated the triumph of xenophobic post-truth politics, and both were assisted by Russian information warfare. Pomerantsev’s book about Russia suddenly seemed prophetic about the rest of the world.
Now, he’s written a penetrating follow-up, “This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality,” that is partly an effort to make sense of how the disorienting phenomena he observed in Russia went global. The child of exiled Soviet dissidents, Pomerantsev juxtaposes his family’s story — unfolding at a time when ideas, art and information seemed to challenge tyranny — with a present in which truth scarcely appears to matter.
“During glasnost, it seemed that the truth would set everybody free,” he writes. “Facts seemed possessed of power; dictators seemed so afraid of facts that they suppressed them. But something has gone drastically wrong: We have access to more information and evidence than ever, but facts seem to have lost their power.”
Why? Social media, which enables the rapid spread of misinformation, is clearly one reason. But Pomerantsev’s most intriguing insight is about how a post-fact society emerges from despair and cynicism about the future.
Throughout the Cold War, he writes, “both sides were engaged in what had begun as a debate about which system — democratic capitalism or communism — would deliver a rosier future for all mankind. The only way to prove you were achieving this future was to provide evidence.” Obviously, this didn’t mean regimes told the truth, only that they were invested in being seen as truthful. That’s why facts that revealed their deceptions could endanger them.
But today, few leaders claim to have an ideological map to a better world. The march of history has been replaced by the will to power. Pomerantsev contrasts Soviet propaganda, which tried, however crudely, to be convincing to outsiders, with modern Russia disinformation, which just aims to confuse. You could make a similar comparison between Ronald Reagan’s rhetoric and Trump’s. One way of communicating points forward, the other, back. Pomerantsev quotes Russian-American Harvard professor Svetlana Boym, who wrote, “The 20th century began with Utopia and ended with nostalgia.”
Reading that, I thought of a feeling I’ve had since 2016 that the orderly progression of time has given way to something chaotic and hallucinatory. I don’t think I’m alone in this; it’s common to hear liberals talk about the “dark timeline” we’re all trapped in.
So much of the culture feels stuck. Social media creates a sense of eternal present; things that happened two weeks ago feel like half-forgotten history. Internet technology, once imbued with futuristic idealism, has become a source of destruction and dread. Fashion has turned back to the 1990s, which was itself a time of nostalgia for the 1970s. Cinemas are full of remakes. At least when the Sex Pistols screamed “No future,” they were sublimating nihilism into art. But now?
“It’s like we went too far. We imagined too much,” says a character in the recent TV series “Years and Years,” a dystopian drama coproduced by HBO and the BBC that takes place just a few years in the future. “We sent all those probes into space, and we went to the very edge of the solar system, built the hadron collider and the internet, and we painted all those paintings and we wrote all those great songs, and then, pop. Whatever we had, we punctured it. And now it’s all collapsing.”
In “This Is Not Propaganda,” Pomerantsev quotes Gleb Pavlovsky, a political strategist who was once an influential adviser to Vladimir Putin, and who recognized, early on, how the end of universalist visions of progress would lead to amoral relativism. “The image of a common mankind is impossible, and no alternative has emerged,” Pavlovsky said. “Everyone invents their own ‘normal’ humanity, their own ‘right’ history.”
To move beyond this horrible moment, we’ll need to reform the algorithms that turn YouTube into a machine for radicalization and make Facebook an accessory to ethnic cleansing. But the bigger challenge may be to create belief in a future that doesn’t seem nightmarish, to restore faith in a rational path forward, to give people a sense of control over their destiny. “The need for facts is predicated on the notion of an evidence-based future,” writes Pomerantsev.
A society invested in real, tangible common projects needs objective truths. One organized around a desperate longing for a mythologized past does not. Pomerantsev’s book suggests that the authoritarian darkness that’s descended on so much of the globe is a hangover from the so-called end of history after the Cold War. If that’s true, perhaps one way to dispel it is to get history moving again.

Paul Krugman: The world economy has a Germany problem

Texto completo: You might think that recent events — market turmoil, weakening growth, declining manufacturing production — must be producing some soul-searching in the White House, particularly over Donald Trump’s view that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” That is, you might think that if you haven’t paid any attention to Trump’s past behavior.
What he’s actually doing, of course, is attributing the economy’s troubles to a vast conspiracy of people out to get him. And his recent remarks suggest, if anything, that he’s preparing to open a new front in the trade war, this time against the European Union, which he says “treats us horribly: barriers, tariffs, taxes.”
The funny thing is that there are some aspects of European policy, especially German economic policy, that do hurt the world economy and deserve condemnation. But Trump is going after the wrong thing. Europe does not, in fact, treat us badly; its markets are about as open to U.S. products as ours are to Europe’s. (We export about three times as much to the EU as we do to China.)
The problem, instead, is that the Europeans, and the Germans in particular, treat themselves badly, with a ruinous obsession over public debt. And the costs of that obsession are spilling over to the world as a whole.
Some background: Around 2010, politicians and pundits on both sides of the Atlantic caught a bad case of austerity fever. Somehow they lost interest in fighting unemployment, even though it remained catastrophically high, and demanded spending cuts instead. And these spending cuts, unprecedented in a weak economy, slowed the recovery and delayed the return to full employment.
While debt alarmism ruled both here and in Europe, however, it eventually became clear that there was a crucial difference in underlying motivation. Our deficit hawks were, in fact, hypocrites, who suddenly lost all interest in debt as soon as a Republican was in the White House. The Germans, on the other hand, really meant it.
True, Germany forced debt-troubled nations in southern Europe into punishing, society-destroying spending cuts; but it also imposed a lot of austerity on itself. Textbook economics says that governments should run deficits in times of high unemployment, but Germany basically eliminated its deficit in 2012, when euro-area unemployment was more than 11%, and then began to run ever-growing surpluses.
Why is this a problem? Europe suffers from a chronic shortfall in private demand: Consumers and corporations don’t seem to want to spend enough to maintain full employment. The causes of this shortfall are the subject of a lot of debate, although the most likely culprit is demography: low fertility has left Europe with a declining number of adults in their prime working years, which translates into low demand for new housing, office buildings, and so on.
The European Central Bank, Europe’s counterpart to the Federal Reserve, has tried to fight this chronic weakness with extremely low interest rates — in fact, it has pushed rates below zero, which economists used to think was impossible. And bond investors clearly expect these extreme policies to last for a very long time. In Germany, even long-term bonds — all the way out to 30 years! — pay negative interest rates.
Some analysts think that these negative interest rates hurt the functioning of the financial sector. I’m agnostic on that point, but what’s clear is that with monetary policy stretched to its limits, Europe has no way to respond when things go wrong. Indeed, much of Europe may well already be in recession, and there’s little if anything the central bank can do.
There is, however, an obvious solution: European governments, and Germany in particular, should stimulate their economies by borrowing and increasing spending. The bond market is effectively begging them to do that; in fact, it’s willing to pay Germany to borrow, by lending at negative interest. And there’s no lack of things to spend on: Germany, like America, has crumbling infrastructure desperately in need of repair. But spend they won’t.
Most of the costs of German fiscal obstinacy fall on Germany and its neighbors, but there are some spillovers to the rest of us. Europe’s problems have contributed to a weak euro, which makes U.S. products less competitive and is one reason American manufacturing is sliding. But characterizing this as a situation in which Europe is taking advantage of America gets it all wrong, and is not helpful.
What would be helpful? Realistically, America has no ability to pressure Germany into changing its domestic policies. We might be able to provide a little moral suasion if our own leadership had any intellectual or policy credibility, but, of course, it doesn’t. There’s a sense in which the whole world has a Germany problem, but it’s up to the Germans themselves to solve it.
One thing is for sure: Starting a trade war with Europe would truly be a lose-lose proposition, even more so than our trade war with China. It’s the last thing either America or Europe needs. Which means that Trump is probably going to do it.

Trump-Miller, la mancuerna del mal

Texto completo: Durante el fin de semana, dos de los principales diarios de Estados Unidos, The New York Times y The Washington Post, dedicaron artículos de primera plana a la polémica figura del asesor presidencial, Stephen Miller, el principal arquitecto de la política antiinmigrante del gobierno de Donald Trump.
Nada de lo descrito sorprende a quienes abogamos por los derechos de los inmigrantes, pues el siniestro Miller ya había dejado su marca cuando trabajó para legisladores republicanos en el Congreso, particularmente para el exsenador de Alabama y venido a menos exsecretario de Justicia, Jeff Sessions, otra de las figuras más antiinmigrantes del Partido Republicano.
Miller es uno de los funcionarios que ha sobrevivido en el gobierno de Trump, cuando otros no han corrido la misma suerte. Y es muy probable que se deba a que comparte con el presidente el mismo desdén contra las minorías étnicas, particularmente los hispanos aunque sean ciudadanos, contra los inmigrantes, con o sin documentos, y una particular aversión hacia los refugiados.
Porque queda claro que la retórica antiinmigrante de Trump, la política pública resultante y los proyectos impulsados están dirigidos a minorías, inmigrantes y refugiados de color. Nunca hemos oído a Trump o a Miller despotricar contra indocumentados blancos.
Sus intenciones de “blanquear” una nación que ellos ven amenazada por los cambios demográficos, que nos llevan aceleradamente a ser un país donde las minorías serán mayorías, se sustentan en el racismo y en la falsa idea de que esas minorías suponen una amenaza para su existencia y supervivencia.
Y digo falsa, porque en todos los indicadores los anglosajones siguen gozando de una situación privilegiada; sin ignorar, claro está, que, como en todos los grupos étnicos, hay sectores blancos golpeados por el desempleo, los bajos salarios, la falta de seguro médico y problemas sociales. De todos modos, ser blancos les sigue suponiendo una ventaja, ante los obstáculos que enfrentan las minorías menos privilegiadas.
Pero en lugar de tener un debate sincero sobre las causas de las desigualdades —provocadas incluso por las mismas políticas que impulsa Trump, por ejemplo, una reducción tributaria que en realidad solo beneficia a ricos, y ofensivas contra el Obamacare que dejaría sin seguro médico a millones—, lo más sencillo es buscar un chivo expiatorio. Y esos son los inmigrantes y las minorías de color.
Pero es más truculento porque la agenda que impulsan Trump y Miller es la misma de los supremacistas blancos que ven en la inmigración y en el crecimiento de las minorías una amenaza a su supervivencia.
Los mecanismos no importan, así sea separar familias, enjaular niños y bebés, privarlos de sus padres, no proveerle a esos menores los productos más básicos como jabón, pasta de dientes o una cobija para dormir. O extraviar a esos menores en la madeja burocrática. O como se reportó este pasado fin de semana, explorar la idea de negar la educación a niños indocumentados, lo cual iría en contra de un fallo de 1982 de la Corte Suprema que garantiza el acceso de indocumentados al sistema de educación pública.
Miller es también el artífice de la regla sobre “carga pública” y de todas las políticas antiinmigrantes de Trump, comenzando con el veto musulmán.
Es sabido que el Partido Republicano es cómplice de Trump y de Miller por su silencio. Trump no enfrenta ninguna resistencia interna, porque mientras los republicanos coloquen a los jueces conservadores que quieren y mientras la economía los favorezca, poco importa lo que diga o haga el presidente.
La pregunta es si la estrategia antiinmigrante y racista funcionará en la elección general de 2020. No fue el caso de los comicios intermedios de 2018, cuando los demócratas ganaron la mayoría en la Cámara Baja y varias gubernaturas en distritos y estados que en 2016 favorecieron a Trump. Diversos sondeos señalan que la retórica y las políticas prejuiciosas de Trump no gozan del apoyo de la mayoría de los estadounidenses.
Pero los demócratas todavía no cuentan con un abanderado o abanderada, y eso también definirá el curso de las elecciones presidenciales.
Lo que sí es evidente es que el Partido Republicano que conocíamos ya no existe. El último presidente republicano en impulsar una reforma migratoria y en tratar de hacer más incluyente a esa colectividad fue George W. Bush, quien ocupó la Casa Blanca hasta el 20 de enero de 2009, cuando Barack Obama juramentó su primer mandato.
Los sectores republicanos más antiinimigrantes se consideraban marginales en esa época, pero en solo una década se han colocado a la cabeza del partido, al grado que es comandado por Trump, la figura republicana más divisiva y racista en la historia reciente, y su copiloto Miller. Peor aún, Trump tiene el apoyo de 90% del Partido Republicano.
No sé si los conservadores más moderados buscarán refugio temporal con los demócratas o los independientes; si fundarán otra colectividad ahora que la suya ha sido secuestrada por los antiinmigrantes; o si ya el Partido Republicano rebasó el punto donde no hay retorno.
Lo que sí queda claro es que Trump y Miller, la mancuerna del mal, todavía tienen año y medio para seguir haciendo daño, con la posibilidad de cuatro años más, si Trump es reelecto.

Donald Trump and the economic plot against America

Texto completo: “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function." So wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald.
“This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life," he added, “when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the 'impossible,' come true."
It also fits on President Trump, though, for the moment, let's limit the “first-rate" label to his political instincts.
How else to explain a pair of Trump tweets on Monday that declared “Our Economy is very strong" and called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by a full percentage point.
A reduction that drastic would be warranted only if the economy were collapsing, as it was at the end of 2008. With the country in the full throes of the financial crisis in December of that year, the Fed slashed rates from 1 percent to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent.
With a growth rate this year of about 2 percent, the economy isn't “very strong," but it remains in good shape. So good that many economists — and two voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee — believe that the Fed's quarter-point rate cut last month was unnecessary.
Fed chairman Jerome Powell justified the move as a kind of insurance policy against the impact on the United­ States of slowdowns in China and Europe, and the president's tariff-happy trade strategy.
Trump's incessant jawboning for lower rates and criticism of Powell — on Monday, he decried “the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed" — is the president's own insurance against a recession hitting before the 2020 elections. While there is zero chance the Fed lowers rates by a percentage point “over a short period of time," as called for by Trump, the Fed is truly worried about the fallout from Trump's trade war.
Investors put the odds at more than 90 percent in favor of a quarter-point move at the Fed's next meeting, on Sept. 17-18. That's a reduction of a half percentage point this year that may not have ever happened if Trump hadn't gone after the Fed.
Like I said, first-rate political strategy. But there's more.
At this stage in the 2020 campaign, Trump is no doubt confident he can beat any of the candidates leading the Democratic pack. If the economy and financial markets don't go south.
In a survey released Monday by the National Association of Business Economists, 38 percent of respond-ents said they expected a downturn in 2020, down from 42 percent in the group's survey in February.
Also on Monday, Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and one of the dissenters in last month's rate vote, told Bloomberg TVpolicy makers have “plenty of things to be worried about." But he expects a resilient American consumer will continue to drive the economy forward.
All that is decent news for the president, but he's not taking any chances. In a sign of the level of concern, several senior White House officials are considering a temporary payroll tax cut as a way to buttress the economy, The Washington Post reported. And Trump has recently begun talking about a conspiracy to croak the economy as a way to defeat him.
It's not just Powell and the Fed he's implicating in this Plot Against America. “He has said other countries, including allies, are working to hurt American economic interests," New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wrote over the weekend. “He has accused the news media of trying to create a recession."
If the economy does sour before the election, it won't be the president's fault. His campaign rallies will be one long tirade against colluding immigrants, Muslims, socialists, gun haters, the fake news media, and . . . the Fed! Only he'll be able to save us.
“You have no choice but to vote for me because your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes. So whether you love me or hate me, you've got to vote for me," he told a crowd in New Hampshire last week.
“Show me a hero," Fitzgerald said, “and I'll write you a tragedy."

Michelle Goldberg: With Trump as president, the world is spiraling into chaos

Texto completo: Earlier this week, Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, visited The New York Times editorial board, and I asked him about the threat of armed conflict between his country and India over Kashmir. India and Pakistan have already fought two wars over the Himalayan territory, which both countries claim, and which is mostly divided between them. India recently revoked the constitutionally guaranteed autonomy of the part of Kashmir it controls and put nearly seven million people there under virtual house arrest. Pakistan’s prime minister compared India’s leaders to Nazis and warned that they’ll target Pakistan next. It seems like there’s potential for humanitarian and geopolitical horror.
Khan’s answer was not comforting. “We are two big countries with very large militaries with nuclear capability and a history of conflict,” he said. “So I would not like to burden your imagination on that one, but obviously if things get worse, then things get worse.”
All over the world, things are getting worse. China appears to be weighing a Tiananmen Square-like crackdown in Hong Kong. After I spoke to Khan, hostilities between India and Pakistan ratcheted up further; on Thursday, fighting across the border in Kashmir left three Pakistani soldiers dead. (Pakistan also claimed that five Indian soldiers were killed, but India denied it.) Turkey is threatening to invade Northeast Syria to go after America’s Kurdish allies there, and it’s not clear if an American agreement meant to prevent such an incursion will hold.
North Korea’s nuclear program and ballistic missile testing continue apace. The prospect of a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine is more remote than it’s been in decades. Tensions between America and Iran keep escalating. Relations between Japan and South Korea have broken down. A Pentagon report warns that ISIS is “re-surging” in Syria. The U.K. could see food shortages if the country’s Trumpish prime minister, Boris Johnson, follows through on his promise to crash out of the European Union without an agreement in place for the aftermath. Oh, and the globe may be lurching toward recession.
In a world spiraling towards chaos, we can begin to see the fruits of Donald Trump’s erratic, amoral and incompetent foreign policy, his systematic undermining of alliances and hollowing out of America’s diplomatic and national security architecture. Over the last 2 1/2 years, Trump has been playing Jenga with the world order, pulling out once piece after another. For a while, things more or less held up. But now the whole structure is teetering.
To be sure, most of these crises have causes other than Trump. Even competent American administrations can’t dictate policy to other countries, particularly powerful ones like India and China. But in one flashpoint after another, the Trump administration has either failed to act appropriately, or acted in ways that have made things worse. “Almost everything they do is the wrong move,” said Susan Thornton, who until last year was the acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, America’s top diplomat for Asia.
Consider Trump’s role in the Kashmir crisis. In July, during a White House visit by Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Trump offered to mediate India and Pakistan’s long-running conflict over Kashmir, even suggesting that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked him to do so. Modi’s government quickly denied this, and Trump’s words reportedly alarmed India, which has long resisted outside involvement in Kashmir. Two weeks later, India sent troops to lock Kashmir down, then stripped it of its autonomy.
Americans have grown used to ignoring Trump’s casual lies and verbal incontinence, but people in other countries have not. Thornton thinks the president’s comments were a “precipitating factor” in Modi’s decision to annex Kashmir. By blundering into the conflict, she suggested, Trump put the Indian prime minister on the defensive before his Hindu nationalist constituency. “He might not have had to do that,” she said of Modi’s Kashmir takeover, “but he would have had to do something. And this was the thing he was looking to do anyway.”
At the same time, Modi can be confident that Trump, unlike previous American presidents, won’t even pretend to care about democratic backsliding or human rights abuses, particularly against Muslims. “There’s a cost-benefit analysis that any political leader makes,” said Ben Rhodes, a former top Obama national security aide. “If the leader of India felt like he was going to face public criticism, potential scrutiny at the United Nations,” or damage to the bilateral relationship with the United States, “that might affect his cost-benefit analysis.” Trump’s instinctive sympathy for authoritarian leaders empowers them diplomatically.
Obviously, India and Pakistan still have every interest in avoiding a nuclear holocaust. China may show restraint on Hong Kong. Wary of starting a war before the 2020 election, Trump might make a deal with Iran, though probably a worse one than the Obama agreement that he jettisoned. The global economy could slow down but not seize up. We could get through the next 17 months with a world that still looks basically recognizable.
Even then, America will emerge with a desiccated diplomatic corps, strained alliances, and a tattered reputation. It will never again play the same leadership role internationally that it did before Trump.
And that’s the best-case scenario. The most powerful country in the world is being run by a sundowning demagogue whose oceanic ignorance is matched only by his gargantuan ego. The United States has been lucky that things have hung together as much as they have, save the odd government shutdown or white nationalist terrorist attack. But now, in foreign affairs as in the economy, the consequences of not having a functioning American administration are coming into focus. “No U.S. leadership is leaving a vacuum,” said Thornton. We’ll see what gets sucked into it.

I've treated suicidal prisoners — Jeffrey Epstein's death is a medical, security disgrace

Texto completo: As a physician who has worked with prisoners as well as suicidal patients, I was shocked by the strange circumstances surrounding sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein’s death by apparent hanging in his cell. We may never know for sure all the details of what happened, though I expect further review of the autopsy results to determine once and for all whether this death was self-inflicted.
Earlier in my career, I worked on both a psychiatric ward and a prison ward. In both places, the regular surveillance was sufficient (at least every 15 minutes on the psych ward) so that suicide was almost impossible. For someone who, like Epstein, had apparently made a suicide attempt less than three weeks before, it is almost inconceivable to me that he could possibly be without diligent, frequent observation and without surveillance cameras constantly monitoring him.
How could he be placed in a cell, according to the New York Post's unnamed source, with a bunk bed to hang himself on and a strong enough bed sheet to do it with? If one cellmate was transferred, as sources told The New York Times, why wasn’t he immediately replaced with another?
'Serious irregularities' raise eyebrows
It's true that suicide is the leading cause of death in jails and, in 2014, hit a 15-year high in federal and state prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. But although accused sexual offenders are particularly at risk for both suicides and homicides, the Metropolitan Correctional Center where Epstein was imprisoned has had only one reported suicide over the past 40 years, the gangster Louis Turra, 21 years ago.
Money talks: Harvard drops #MeToo image when donations are at risk
Despite its reputation for squalor and overcrowding, the corrections center is not known for suicide.
What is most disturbing to me, as a physician, is the way Epstein went from being on suicide watch starting July 23 to going for long periods without being observed just six days later, sources told The Times. Having treated depression for many years, I know suicidal ideation doesn’t turn on and off like a switch. A person does not want to end it all one day — staring down news as bleak as Epstein faced — and then six days later you are suddenly stable and out of danger. Whoever took Epstein off this watch made a very poor judgment at the very least. And the latest reports by sources of The Times that guards fell asleep for possibly hours while on watch and then falsified records is simply inexcusable.
I am not a conspiracy theorist, though it is conceivable to me that the “serious irregularities” Attorney General William Barr is concerned about could possibly turn out to reveal that Epstein’s was not a simple suicide, that there were other actors in this tragedy. Time, along with the final autopsy report, will tell. It is clear that there were many victims in Epstein's life who loathed him for legitimate reasons, and many others who stood to lose more by his survival than by his death.
Doctors try to save everyone
But no matter what happened inside Epstein’s cell, both the medical personnel and the prison authorities who were involved had the obligation to bring him to a safer place, whether that meant more enhanced psychiatric observation inside the prison, or transferring him with enhanced security to an inpatient psychiatric facility. There was plenty of warning that this could happen.
Children deserve more than we give them: I lost a student to sex trafficking and murder. We woefully fail to protect our children.
After all, we don’t judge our patients, no matter how repulsive their actions or the allegations against them are. Doctors and nurses are simply assigned to try to keep them alive. I have taken care of a perpetrator of assault chained to a stretcher in the emergency room right next to his victim suffering from a gunshot wound, and I have had to do my best to save both without hesitation.
The prison officials who took Jeffrey Epstein off his suicide watch prematurely, relegating him to almost certain death, did not do the prison system and how it handles mental health emergencies any favors.

Texto completo: A few years ago, I took a call at the nature center about a big snake in Tekakwitha Woods Forest Preserve. The caller was pretty rattled, and she wanted someone to "do something."
We naturalists are pretty used to snake calls. I calmly suggested, "It could be a fox snake. Not at all dangerous." As I began to launch into the benefits of native snakes, she interrupted. "No! It’s really big!"
One of our rangers had received a similar call and was already out looking for the suspect serpent. He spotted some kids clustered around a tree with mouths agape and easily homed in on the problem.
There, coiled on a branch, was a REALLY big snake. It was a four-foot ball python. The source of the exotic reptile could only be a pet owner who didn’t want it anymore.
Castoff critters are a local and a worldwide ecological problem. In the case of the Tekakwitha Woods python, no harm was done (that we know of). An animal control expert captured the snake, which was put up for adoption with a more responsible owner. But untold numbers of pets released in natural areas are not retrieved. Scads of them reproduce and wreak ecological and economic havoc.
Take Chance the Snapper, the headline-grabbing gator in Chicago who held media attention last July. An anonymous pet owner released it in Humboldt Park. A coldblooded creature, Chance would have little chance of survival in our brutal winter, but he could do significant damage to wildlife, people and property in the meantime.
Chance evaded capture for a week. Finally, the city of Chicago brought in the big guns, hiring a gator-trapper from Florida with a price-tag upward of $30,000.
Less ominous than an alligator or a python on the loose is the common goldfish. Yes, the tiny orange fish that you brought home from the pet store in a plastic bag can become a 10-pound monster in the wild.
"Goldfish are one of the world’s worst invasive aquatic species," according to an article in The New York Times. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources reported that goldfish are present in almost all waterways of Illinois.
What makes little Swimmy so pernicious in the wild? Goldfish are omnivorous and fecund — in other words, they’ll eat anything in their path and make tons of babies. They roil up the stream bed and muddy the waters for native species that need clear streams. They also carry diseases that are easily transmitted to native fish.
Other animals frequently let loose in natural areas are frogs, birds, and turtles. Lots of turtles. I once watched a woman release an unwanted red-eared slider in the salt marsh where I worked in the San Francisco Bay Area. I couldn’t stop her in time. This eastern, freshwater turtle wasn’t long for the world in the salt marsh.
The best turtle release story can be traced to Al Capone. The Chicago Tribune reported, "In November 1930, a ‘deluge’ of box turtles was ‘mysteriously let loose’ on South Michigan Avenue ... The owner of those turtles … was none other than Al Capone. Capone had attempted to cash in on the increasingly popular sport of turtle racing, hoping to feature it at his speak-easies. … The legendary mobster had an underling purchase 5,000 turtles in Oklahoma. When the venture didn’t pan out, a frustrated Capone had his henchmen dump the turtles, which was how 2,000 of them turned up on Michigan Avenue, and another 3,000 or so surfaced in Cicero."
Scarface’s motives aside, why do people release pets in the wild? Boredom, perhaps? Kids easily tire of sedentary pets. (Box turtles are famously unexciting.) Parents don’t want to clean or feed them. There’s also the expense. Keeping pets costs money, and resentment grows along with the dollars spent on the darn critter.
Like the turtle in the tank, a pet owner finds himself between a rock and a hard place. The animal’s gotta go, but what are the options? Euthanizing the pet seems barbaric and heartless. (And what would you tell the kids?) That leaves the Free Willy solution. Return the animal to the wild and watch it swim/fly/crawl into the sunset.
Hold on a minute. Releasing a pet may seem like a gesture of love, but, in reality, it’s cruel. It’s also illegal in natural areas. The wild is no ecological nirvana for an animal born and raised in captivity.
"The fallout can be catastrophic," according to a July 2019 National Geographic article. "If the animal doesn’t die as a result of predation, exposure, or starvation, it may find a mate, proliferate, and become an invasive species."
What’s the solution? Naturalist Pam Otto with the St. Charles Park District has solid advice.
"First and foremost, realize what you’re getting into before you ever bring the critter home," Otto says. "Budgies, goldfish and rabbits live upward of 10 years; snakes and salamanders over 20 years; turtles anywhere from 30 to 80-plus years, depending on species. Getting an animal when it’s young means you’re signing up for (a long) period of caretaking and responsibility. Instead of getting a hatchling snake, adopt one that’s 15 years old. It will still have 5 to 10 good years left. Boom! You’ve cut your time commitment in half."
If you must part with your pet, Otto says, "Rescue groups are an option. Besides the Chicago Herpetological Society, we’ve worked with Friends of Scales, Fur Angels and the Greater Chicago Caged Bird Club. These are all-volunteer organizations that house homeless pets in foster homes and adopt out via application."
Sometimes pet stores will take healthy, older pets as display animals, she added.
In our heart of hearts, most of us want to do right by the animal. Remember, most pets are not equipped to survive in the wild. Those that do become pests in no time. Say goodbye in a way that respects your pet and the natural environment.

Texto completo: The lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein announced they are not "satisfied" with the medical examiner's conclusion that the alleged sex trafficker died by suicide.
Epstein, 66, was found unconscious in his cell Aug. 10 and later pronounced dead after an apparent suicide attempt. The New York City medical examiner confirmed Friday that he hanged himself.
Chief medical examiner in New York City, Dr. Barbara Sampson, ruled out foul play, saying that after a “careful review of all investigative information,” she had determined Epstein’s death was via “hanging” and the manner was “suicide.”
Three of Epstein's lawyers challenged Sampson's findings after they were announced.
Martin G. Weinberg, Reid Weingarten, and Michael Miller said they were "not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical examiner," according to the New York Times. “We will have a more complete response in the coming days.”
“The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein’s death, including, if necessary, legal action to view the pivotal videos — if they exist as they should — of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein’s cell during the time period leading to his death,” the lawyers said.
The lawyers hired a private pathologist to observe the autopsy.
Prior to his death, Epstein had pleaded not guilty and been denied bail. He was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of underage girl at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, between 2002 and 2005. He was already a registered sex offender from an earlier case.

What else Trump gets wrong about the 'Bla-goya-vick' case

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's ignorance was on display Thursday when reporters asked him whether he was still considering offering some form of executive clemency to the imprisoned former governor of Illinois.
"I floated it and I wanted to see where the Democrats stood, where the Republicans stood," he said. "People feel very strongly about Rod Blagojevich and his sentence."
It was bad that he pronounced it "Bla-goya-vick" instead of the correct "Bla-goya-vitch," thus revealing yet again his lack of familiarity with the facts of the case. But it was worse that he framed the clemency decision as a political matter -- as a response driven by legislative and public opinion -- when it should be anything but.
The powers of presidents and governors to issue pardons and commute sentences are a vestige of the divine rights of kings, and they exist to "soften the rigor of general law," as noted 18th-century jurist William Blackstone wrote. They allow for extrajudicial applications of mercy, compassion and proportion, even and especially when such applications are unpopular.
Blagojevich has served more than seven years in federal prison following his 2011 conviction on multiple corruption charges, and he's not scheduled to be released until May 2024. Several times, most recently on Aug. 7, Trump has hinted strongly that he believes the legal system has treated Blagojevich unfairly, and that he should be freed now, perhaps with the grant of a full pardon.
The New York Times reports that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, has advised the president that pardoning Blagojevich, a Democrat, would help him with Democratic voters.
I don't think this is true.
Though several prominent Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, have expressed support for shortening Blagojevich's sentence, others, including Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, have said Blagojevich should stay behind bars. Democrats in the General Assembly acted with near unanimity in 2009 when they impeached and removed Blagojevich, and many on the left are still smarting at his betrayal of the trust they placed in him and at the greasy way he squandered his considerable political gifts.
If Trump frees Blagojevich, Democrats here and around the country are likely to see it as just one swampy, self-dealing narcissist taking care of another.
As for where the Republicans stand, GOP officials have spoken with practically one voice in urging Trump to keep Blagojevich in prison.
All of that shouldn't matter.
A president or governor who puts a moistened finger to the wind before granting clemency is doing it wrong.
Popular opinion is sometimes aligned with the demands of capital-J Justice. But sometimes it's not. And implicit in the power to commute sentences or issue pardons is that the executive will exercise independent, morally sound judgment.
"No man has the right to allow his ambition to stand in the way of the performance of a simple act of justice." So said Illinois Gov. John Peter Altgeld in 1893 shortly after issuing pardons to the three surviving men convicted in sham trials following the violent eruption at Chicago's Haymarket Square in 1886.
The move provoked widespread outrage and doomed Altgeld's chances for reelection. But when asked why he made the decision, he didn't say that he'd taken the pulse of other politicians or that he thought it was what the voters wanted.
Instead he simply pounded his desk and said, "It is right!"
If it's Trump's sincere, desk-pounding belief that freeing Blagojevich is right and to heck with what anyone else thinks, well, OK. That's why he has the power.
But -- and I never tire of pointing this out to those whose hearts bleed for the man and his family -- when weighing what's right here, Trump shouldn't forget that when Blagojevich was governor, he routinely ignored requests for commutations and pardons. It got so bad that the Cabrini Green Legal Aid Clinic sued him in federal court for ducking his responsibility to act. He won that suit and continued to dawdle. And by the time he was removed from office in early 2009, the Illinois Prisoner Review Board estimated the number of petitions piled up on his desk at more than 3,000 -- by far the largest such backlog in the nation.
Most of these people had families too.

When he goes low, let's go lower!
An online petition to rename the one block of New York City's Fifth Avenue for former President Barack Obama has more than 365,000 signatures. That block is home to Trump Tower, so renaming the street would require a change of address that would certainly pique Trump, whose irrational animus for all things Obama is well documented.
Chicago should get in on this. The address of Trump International Hotel & Tower here is 401 N. Wabash Ave. The street runs in broken segments from Delaware Place on the Near North Side down to south suburban Glenwood and is named for the Wabash River, a waterway that creates part of the border between Illinois and Indiana but never comes within 100 miles of the city.
It wouldn't hurt anyone but Trump to rename the downtown part of Wabash Avenue -- or at least the 400 North block -- for Obama, now, would it? Making such a change would be the sort of petty trolling and juvenile chain-yanking that Trump himself, even in a rage, surely would be able to appreciate.

Endangered Species Act itself is now endangered

Texto completo: Capt. Bill Sheehan, the Hackensack riverkeeper, has seen firsthand the effects of forward-thinking conservation policies such as the Endangered Species Act, from the time when he was growing up in the Meadowlands. He recalls then rarely seeing a bald eagle, America's symbol, except when one might fly by heading elsewhere.
Now, Sheehan told me Monday, there are at least two breeding bald eagle nests in the Meadowlands, including an unlikely pair of eagles at Kearny Point. Indeed, there are, the riverkeeper says, "as many as 10 eagles' nests and 20 osprey nests in our neighborhood."
No doubt, the bald eagle is a resilient specimen, one reason it remains part of our national seal, and why its image is still part of our coins and institutions.
It was once our universal symbol of strength, pride and endurance. Now, if President Donald Trump and his cronies have their way, it could become one more symbol of our national disgrace.
If the full force of the federal Endangered Species Act is rolled back, as Trump seems hellbent on doing, we can say goodbye to bald eagles in the Meadowlands, and possibly other national lands as well.
The Trump administration announced Monday a major overhaul to the act, a Nixon-era initiative passed with bipartisan support and signed into law in 1973. This rollback, fully implemented, would, shall we say, make it more "business-friendly."
"The best way to uphold the Endangered Species Act is to do everything we can to ensure it remains effective in achieving its ultimate goal — recovery of our rarest species," U.S. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt said. "The act's effectiveness rests on clear, consistent and efficient implementation."
Those who love our natural beauty and appreciate its majesty know what this means.
Regulations that now give protections to the bald eagle, the osprey and other birds of prey in the Meadowlands, along with their essential habitat, will be rolled away and more animals and plants will be pushed to extinction. It would allow federal authorities for the first time to consider the "economic cost" of protecting a particular species.
This is a Trojan horse if ever there was one. We might as well change the name — from the Endangered Species Act to, say, the "Endangered Big Corporations Act," as if these folks, already gifted huge tax cuts under Trump, needed more protection. Indeed, The New York Times reported that the changes could clear the way for "new mining, oil and gas drilling."
The Endangered Species Act now protects more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories, including the northern harrier, also spotted in the Meadowlands, as well as the California condor and the grizzly bear.
According to Sheehan, before the Endangered Species Act was enacted, the "bald eagle was nearly extinct."
You might call the bald eagle's resurgence a miracle, or you could call it a result of sound public policy, pushed for and maintained by enlightened individuals who have fought the good fight for conserving our ground, air and precious marshland — at home and in the halls of our government.
"When all these [environmental acts] were passed, they were passed with bipartisan support," Sheehan said. "In fact, on the Clean Water Act, Congress overcame a Nixon veto."
Fighting for environmental protections "has never been easy," Sheehan said, "but until now we always had the law on our side.
"I fear we're in a very dark place," he added. "This desire to do away with all our regulations is deeply disturbing."
The Endangered Species Act, so long a stalwart standing guard over America's emblematic plants and animals, is now itself endangered.

Texto completo: Peter Fonda, the tall, lanky actor who became a star and a counterculture sex symbol in the film “Easy Rider,” carrying on the Hollywood dynasty begun by his father, Henry Fonda, died Friday in Los Angeles. He was 79.
The death was confirmed by his family, who said the cause was respiratory failure because of lung cancer.
During his acting and filmmaking career, Fonda earned two Oscar nominations, almost three decades apart. He shared, along with Dennis Hopper and Terry Southern, a best original screenplay nomination for “Easy Rider,” the story of two hippie bikers on a cross-country trip fueled by drugs and the thrill of youthful freedom.
Some may have been surprised by the film’s success, but Fonda believed that its enthusiastic reception made perfect sense, because of the very vocal generation coming of age at the time. “It was a market that had never been played to,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 2018. “Nobody had sung their song to them.”
From the time Fonda made his first Broadway and television appearances in the early 1960s, his looks and style — piercing blue eyes, firm jaw and imposing frame — were inevitably compared to his father’s, and it seemed that he might be the breakout star of his generation. But his career cooled — while that of his sister, Jane Fonda, flourished — and his next appearance on the list of Oscar nominees was in 1997 for “Ulee’s Gold.” He was nominated for best actor for his role as a widowed beekeeper with grandchildren.
“Peter is all deep sweetness, kind and sensitive to his core,” Jane Fonda wrote in “My Life So Far,” her 2005 memoir. “He would never intentionally harm anything or anyone. In fact, he once argued with me that vegetables had souls. It was the ’60s.”
Peter Henry Fonda was born on Feb. 23, 1940, in Manhattan, the younger of two children of film star Henry Fonda and Florence Seymour (Brokaw) Fonda, a New York socialite. His mother committed suicide in 1950, when he was 10 and Jane was 13.
Less than a year later, Fonda shot himself in the stomach with a pistol. Interviewed by The New York Times decades later, he insisted that it was an accident, not a suicide attempt or even a warning. “You shoot yourself in the hand or foot if you want attention,” he said, “not the way I did.”
Years later, he talked about the experience with John Lennon, who was reportedly inspired to write the line “I know what it’s like to be dead” in the Beatles’ song “She Said She Said.”
After attending the University of Nebraska, in his father’s home state, Fonda began his theater career the old-fashioned way, in regional theater. In 1960 he starred in “The Golden Fleece” at the Omaha Community Playhouse. His Broadway debut, only a year later, was in “Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole,” an Army comedy for which he won a New York Drama Critics’ Circle Award. He made his television debut in a 1962 episode of “Naked City.”
Hollywood saw him as a sort of male ingénue at first, casting him as a boyish, clean-cut physician in “Tammy and the Doctor” (1963), opposite Sandra Dee. He starred with Warren Beatty and Jean Seberg in “Lilith” (1964), a drama set at a psychiatric hospital. But it was a very different genre in which he seemed to find his true persona.
In 1967, Roger Corman, then the king of low-budget movies, directed “The Trip” from a script by an up-and-coming actor, Jack Nicholson. Alongside Bruce Dern, Dennis Hopper and Susan Strasberg, Fonda starred as a mild-mannered television commercial director who uses LSD for the first time and makes the most of it. “Easy Rider,” which he also produced, came two years later.
Decades later, The Times asked him about his personal experience with the drug. “For me, it solved a great deal,” he said. “However, I didn’t take it and go out running through the city looking at lights. I was very circumspect and lay down on a couch.” Luckily, he added, “I don’t have an addictive character, and nothing except pot stayed with me.”
That period was the height of Fonda’s fame, but he maintained a busy screen career over the next 50 years. He starred in television movies, including “The Passion of Ayn Rand” (1999) and “Back When We Were Grown-Ups” (2004). His films included “Futureworld” (1976), Steven Soderbergh’s crime drama “The Limey” (1999) and the 2007 remake of “3:10 to Yuma.” His final film appearance was in “The Last Full Measure,” a war drama, scheduled to be released in October.
And he had no interest in retirement. “Shoot, I can do this until I’m in my 80s at least,” he said in a 2008 interview with The San Luis Obispo Tribune. “What if I can’t walk? Well, Lionel Barrymore did it all in a wheelchair.”
He had two children with his first wife, Susan Brewer, whom he married in 1961. They were divorced in 1974, and the following year he married Portia Rebecca Crockett. They were divorced in 2011, the same year he married Margaret DeVogelaere.
In addition to his wife and his sister, his survivors include a daughter, actress Bridget Fonda; a son, Justin Fonda; two stepsons, Thomas McGuane and Wills DeVogelaere; a stepdaughter, Lexi DeVogelaere; and one grandson.
Fonda appeared never to abandon his 1960s attitudes and openness, even as he prepared for the 50th anniversary this fall of “Easy Rider,” which will include a Radio City Music Hall screening. The “about” section of his current website includes this thought:
“I believe that one is only truly free when learning, and one can only learn when one is free.”

D.C. Memo: Fair comparisons

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington, President Trump contradicted his press secretary, a lot of Israel-Minnesota news and a quick-hit piece of news about hemp. Let’s get on with this.
Israel bars Omar, Tlaib
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prohibited Reps. Ilhan Omar (of Minnesota’s Fifth District) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) from visiting the country on Thursday (on Friday, Israeli officials changed their stance somewhat and said Tlaib could visit the region to see her grandmother only if she avoided talking about boycotting Israel).
On Saturday, Axios reported that President Donald Trump told his advisors he thinks Netanyahu should use Israel’s anti-boycott law to bar Rep. Omar and Tlaib, the first Muslim women in Congress, from entering Israel.
At around 9 a.m. on Thursday, the president’s press secretary told reporters that reports of Trump suggesting to Netanyahu that the two congresswomen should be barred are “inaccurate.” Less than an hour later, the president made clear that was false, publicly endorsing the move to block the two Muslim legislators from entering the country and leaning on Islamophobic rhetoric to do so.
“It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit,” he said in part. You can read his full statement here.
All of this comes a few days after a bipartisan congressional delegation, including CD8’s Rep. Pete Stauber , visited Israel.
Speaking of Israel, Congress’ strongest critic of Israeli policy is actually from Minnesota. She has spent years talking about putting an end to human rights abuses around the world, including looking at human rights violations in Israel. But her name is Rep. Betty McCollum , not Ilhan Omar.
McCollum has legislation that would stop U.S. dollars from being used to detain Palestinian children, a human rights crisis that non-profits in the region and even the U.S. State Department have reported on several times. Read more at MinnPost.
McCollum responded Thursday morning to the president’s statement about Omar, saying “Trump & Netanyahu are afraid to have” Tlaib and Omar “witness first-hand the brutality & dehumanization Israel’s occupation inflicts on the Palestinian people. This bigoted president is working to extend his Muslim travel ban to Members of Congress.”
Rad job
This week, Joe Radinovich announced he would not run again in the Eighth District, leaving incumbent Stauber without a clear challenger in 2020. What’s Radinovich up to instead? He will lead a hemp industry trade organization.
The President next door
What does Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s record on judicial appointments look like? In the 115th Congress, when compared to the other Democrats in the field, she voted for more Trump nominees than anyone (apart from Colorado Senator Michael Bennet). Read more at Minnpost.
Klobuchar just finished up a long stretch in Iowa, including visits to the Iowa State Fair. Klobuchar is polling at around 3 percent in the state. On Thursday, she was in Little Rock, Arkansas.
A bit off the trail, Jeff Barker at The Baltimore Sun has a profile on John Bessler, a University of Baltimore law professor, author, ardent death penalty opponent, writing coach, dad and informal adviser — and Klobuchar’s husband.
Some other news from the bunch
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who led in the only poll conducted of Minnesota’s presidential primary voters so far, is hosting a town hall on Monday, August 19 at the Leonard Center Fieldhouse at Macalester College in St. Paul .
Following soon after, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is also coming to Minnesota sometime this month. The details have yet to be worked out.
In other news
* John Hickenlooper , the former Colorado governor, announced the end of his presidential campaign on Thursday.
* Jonathan Weisman, a deputy Washington editor of The New York Times, has been demoted following a string of tweets that were dismissive and offensive, including a tweet where he suggested Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis is not actually from the Midwest.
* The Chinese government said on Thursday that it would enact countermeasures if President Trump moved forward with the tariffs set for Sept. 1.

Quote of the week

“There have been a lot of comparisons between the Iowa State Fair and the Minnesota State Fair. I’m not going to say which one is better,” Klobuchar said at the Iowa State Fair.
What I’m reading
Mukhtar M. Ibrahim: Editor’s Note: Welcome To Sahan Journal!
Sahan Journal, a non-profit news site dedicated to covering Minnesota’s refugee and immigrant communities, launched this week. If you have a quick moment or a long while, I highly recommend it. There’s already some great stories up, including this personal story from Haji Yussuf, who attended college and raised a family in St. Cloud , and now is leaving after a spate of Islamophobic incidents.
Molly Hensley-Clancy in Buzzfeed: Elizabeth Warren Took On Obama Over Student Debt Forgiveness. How She Won Is Central To Her 2020 Campaign
A closer look at how Warren might push for change, should she be elected President, can be found in how she has already pushed for change: behind the scenes, with public pressure behind her.

'Diagnosis' column leans to Netflix

Texto completo: NEW YORK - There are some physicians who forbid their patients from going online to type in their symptoms, fearing they'll get incorrect information or become more anxious. Dr. Lisa Sanders is not among them.
Sanders, whose monthly "Diagnosis" column in The New York Times magazine inspired the hit Fox TV series "House," has a more practical - and democratic approach - to so-called Dr. Google.
"I actually think that no matter what doctors said or when they said it, patients have been discussing their illnesses as the first symptoms happen," she said.
"By the time a patient brings their story to me as their primary care doctor, they've already run it by their best friend, their spouse, their mom, their kids - they've told their story to everybody. It turns out that the internet is now just one more everybody you tell your story to. I don't think that's a bad thing."
Sanders doesn't just think crowdsourcing isn't bad, she's harnessing the internet and social media in her work diagnosing unusual cases. This month, she's showing off that approach to a whole new crowd - Nexflix users.
The new seven-part documentary series "Diagnosis" piggybacks on her Times columns by profiling seven patients as they track down a diagnosis, from a Gulf War veteran in New Mexico to a girl with seizures in New York City.
"The show is about diagnosis as a process that doctors go through but it's also a show about diagnosis as a process that patients go through, too. And I think both ends have to be treated with respect and honored," Sanders said.
In the series, Sanders consults as the patients and their doctors seek various treatments, go down blind alleys and seek advice on social media, from patients and doctors alike. More voices in the mix mean more dizzying options but some lead to unexpected solutions.
The little girl in New York with seizures is told by one doctor that an operation to remove half her brain as the "gold standard." But her parents decide to keep looking and instead choose to have a less invasive brain implant, an option they found out about through feedback.
"Never in human history has medicine been able to do and know as much as we do and know right now," said Sanders. "Never before have we been able to make as many diagnoses as we can now."
Jonathan Chinn, an executive producer alongside Scott Rudin and his cousin, Simon Chinn, said the series highlights the benefits of technology - in this case to connect a global village of experts.
"We focus a lot on the negatives of technology - spying and a lack of privacy - but this is an example of a way that technology, if harnessed the right way and responsibly curated, can actually save lives and make peoples' lives tangibly better," he said.
While there's a lot of misinformation online, Sanders thinks patients are becoming more critical about where they get their information. She thinks the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health have excellent information, and even Wikipedia can be helpful so long as the entries are edited by "people who have skin in the game."
"We are getting to be savvier consumers," she said. "I hope that people have enough sense to understand that when money is guiding your message, that maybe the message isn't the best."
Chinn said the series struck home in a personal way. Not long before prolific producer Rudin brought the project to him, his son was hospitalized with a mysterious intestinal problem whose cause was never known. Doctors in white coats just shrugged.
"It was interesting as a parent in that situation - not as a producer - the frustration of knowing that somewhere out in the world there probably was an answer to what was wrong with my son but there was no way to get it," he said.
As the series shows, Sanders is a champion of patient-centered care. If in the past doctors were liable to dismiss or downplay their patients' experiences, those days must come to an end, she thinks.
"The way I see a medical interaction is it's a conference between two experts. I am the expert on bodies, how bodies work, how bodies don't work and what we can do about it. What the patient is the expert on is that body and how that body feels," she said. "There is no one who can tell you how the patient feels except the patient."
Sanders, a professor at Yale, said she hopes doctors in particular tune into "Diagnosis," in part to better understand what their patients go through. They often see a patient for 20 minutes, but the sick have to live with private suffering for weeks or months or years.
"I think one of the things that doctors will take away from this is how hard it is for patients to live with this kind of uncertainty," she said. "This is an opportunity to remind doctors of how frightening it is to be alone out there."

Ross Douthat: Jeffrey Epstein and when to take conspiracies seriously

Texto completo: The challenge in thinking about a case like the suspicious suicide of Jeffrey Epstein, the supposed “billionaire” who spent his life acquiring sex slaves and serving as a procurer to the ruling class, can be summed up in two sentences. Most conspiracy theories are false. But often some of the things they’re trying to explain are real.
Conspiracy theories are usually false because the people who come up with them are outsiders to power, trying to impose narrative order on a world they don’t fully understand — which leads them to imagine implausible scenarios and impossible plots, to settle on ideologically convenient villains and assume the absolute worst about their motives, and to imagine an omnicompetence among the corrupt and conniving that doesn’t actually exist.
Or they are false because the people who come up with them are insiders trying to deflect blame for their own failings, by blaming a malign enemy within or an evil-genius rival for problems that their own blunders helped create.
Or they are false because the people pushing them are cynical manipulators and attention-seekers trying to build a following who don’t care a whit about the truth.
For all these reasons serious truth-seekers are predisposed to disbelieve conspiracy theories on principle, and journalists especially are predisposed to quote Richard Hofstadter on the “paranoid style” whenever they encounter one — an instinct only sharpened by the rise of Donald Trump, the cynical conspiracist par excellence.
But this dismissiveness can itself become an intellectual mistake, a way to sneer at speculation while ignoring an underlying reality that deserves attention or investigation. Sometimes that reality is a conspiracy in full, a secret effort to pursue a shared objective or conceal something important from the public. Sometimes it’s a kind of unconscious connivance, in which institutions and actors behave in seemingly concerted ways because of shared assumptions and self-interest. But in either case, an admirable desire to reject bad or wicked theories can lead to a blindness about something important that these theories are trying to explain.
Here are some diverse examples. Start with UFO theories, a reliable hotbed of the first kind of conspiracizing — implausible popular stories about hidden elite machinations.
It is simple wisdom to assume that any conspiratorial Fox Mulder-level master narrative about little gray men or lizard people is rubbish. Yet at the same time it is a simple fact that the UFO era began, in Roswell, New Mexico, with a government lie intended to conceal secret military experiments; it is also a simple fact, lately reported in this very newspaper, that the military has been conducting secret studies of unidentified-flying-object incidents that continue to defy obvious explanations.
So the correct attitude toward UFOs cannot be a simple Hofstadterian dismissiveness about the paranoia of the cranks. Instead, you have to be able to reject outlandish theories and acknowledge a pattern of government lies and secrecy around a weird, persistent, unexplained feature of human experience — which we know about in part because the UFO conspiracy theorists keep banging on about their subject. The wild theories are false; even so, the secrets and mysteries are real.
Another example: The current elite anxiety about Russia’s hand in the West’s populist disturbances, which reached a particularly hysterical pitch with the pre-Mueller report collusion coverage, is a classic example of how conspiracy theories find a purchase in the supposedly sensible center — in this case, because their narrative conveniently explains a cascade of elite failures by blaming populism on Russian hackers, moneymen and bots.
And yet: Every conservative who rolls her or his eyes at the “Russia hoax” is in danger of dismissing the reality that there is a Russian plot against the West — an organized effort to use hacks, bots and rubles to sow discord in the United States and Western Europe. This effort is far weaker and less consequential than the paranoid center believes, it doesn’t involve fanciful “Trump has been a Russian asset since the ’80s” machinations … but it also isn’t something that Rachel Maddow just made up. The hysteria is overdrawn and paranoid; even so, the Russian conspiracy is real.
A third example: Marianne Williamson’s long-shot candidacy for the Democratic nomination has elevated the holistic-crunchy critique of modern medicine, which often shades into a conspiratorial view that a dark corporate alliance is actively conspiring against American health, that the medical establishment is consciously lying to patients about what might make them well or sick. Because this narrative has given anti-vaccine fervor a huge boost, there’s understandable desire among anti-conspiracists to hold the line against anything that seems like a crankish or quackish criticism of the medical consensus.
But if you aren’t somewhat paranoid about how often corporations cover up the dangers of their products, and somewhat paranoid about how drug companies in particular influence the medical consensus and encourage overprescription — well, then I have an opioid crisis you might be interested in reading about. You don’t need the centralized conspiracy to get a big medical wrong turn; all it takes is the right convergence of financial incentives with institutional groupthink. Which makes it important to keep an open mind about medical issues that are genuinely unsettled, even if the people raising questions seem prone to conspiracy-think. The medical consensus is generally a better guide than crankishness; even so, the tendency of cranks to predict medical scandals before they’re recognized is real.
Finally, a fourth example, circling back to Epstein: the conspiracy theories about networks of powerful pedophiles, which have proliferated with the internet and peaked, for now, with the QAnon fantasy among Trump supporters.
I say fantasy because the details of the QAnon narrative are plainly false: Donald Trump is not personally supervising an operation against “deep state” child sex traffickers any more than my 3-year-old is captaining a pirate ship.
But the premise of the QAnon fantasia, that certain elite networks of influence, complicity and blackmail have enabled sexual predators to exploit victims on an extraordinary scale — well, that isn’t a conspiracy theory, is it? That seems to just be true.
And not only true of Epstein and his pals. As I’ve written before, when I was starting my career as a journalist I sometimes brushed up against people peddling a story about a network of predators in the Catholic hierarchy — not just pedophile priests, but a self-protecting cabal above them — that seemed like a classic case of the paranoid style, a wild overstatement of the scandal’s scope. I dismissed them then as conspiracy theorists, and indeed they had many of conspiracism’s vices — above all, a desire to believe that the scandal they were describing could be laid entirely at the door of their theological enemies, liberal or traditional.
But on many important points and important names, they were simply right .
Likewise with the secular world’s predators. Imagine being told the scope of Harvey Weinstein’s alleged operation before it all came crashing down — not just the ex-Mossad black ops element but the possibility that his entire production company also acted as a procurement-and-protection operation for one of its founders. A conspiracy theory, surely! Imagine being told all we know about the late, unlamented Epstein — that he wasn’t just a louche billionaire (wasn’t, indeed, a proper billionaire at all) but a man mysteriously made and mysteriously protected who ran a pedophile island with a temple to an unknown god and plotted his own “Boys From Brazil” endgame in plain sight of his Harvard-D.C.-House of Windsor pals. Too wild to be believed!
And yet.
Where networks of predation and blackmail are concerned, then, the distinction I’m drawing between conspiracy theories and underlying realities weakens just a bit. No, you still don’t want to listen to QAnon, or to our disgraceful president when he retweets rants about the #ClintonBodyCount. But just as Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s network of clerical allies and enablers hasn’t been rolled up, and the fall of Bryan Singer probably didn’t get us near the rancid depths of Hollywood’s youth-exploitation racket, we clearly haven’t gotten to the bottom of what was going on with Epstein.
So to worry too much about online paranoia outracing reality is to miss the most important journalistic task, which is the further unraveling of scandals that would have seemed, until now, too implausible to be believed.
Yes, by all means, resist the tendency toward unfounded speculation and cynical partisan manipulation. But also recognize that in the case of Jeffrey Epstein and his circle, the conspiracy was real.

Texto completo: Cambridge author Karen M. McManus describes “One of Us Is Lying," her best-selling mystery novel, as “'The Breakfast Club' with murder."
It's an intriguing pitch, one that originally sold Delacorte Press, which published the book back in May 2017. It proceeded to spend more than a year on The New York Times bestseller list.
Now, McManus's novel is shaping up to become the next “Pretty Little Liars"-size TV hit, with news that NBCUniversal is ordering a pilot episode of “One of Us Is Lying" as it weighs possible series to premiere on its upcoming streaming service (set to arrive in April).
The story centers on five students who walk into detention, only for one of them to wind up dead. The remaining students, all with something to hide, become suspects in his murder, especially once it's learned the victim — the creator of a notorious school gossip app — had planned to distribute dirt on all four the following day.
“It's really exciting to be taking this next step," said McManus by phone Friday. “The tricky thing about [having a series] in development is that there are lots of things you can't talk about. So, for readers, it can feel like nothing's happening, even when it is."
Once her book reached bestseller status, McManus — who's lived in Cambridge for more than 20 years — found herself courted by multiple teams with an interest in adapting the story. She ultimately went with Universal Content Productions (UCP), in part because of its interest in working with McManus to preserve the story's tone and heart.
“They're really committed to a collaborative process," she said. “Everyone involved really cares about these characters the way I do." With what she calls “four really distinct personalities driving the plot," that was essential.
McManus, who graduated from Northeastern University with a journalism degree, feels it's best to ground stories, especially whodunits, in realistically drawn characters.
“I find [journalism] to be such a good background for writers," she said. “It also teaches you to look for holes in your story, which is really important when you're writing a mystery."
NBCUniversal's streaming service is entering a crowded marketplace, competing directly with Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime along with forthcoming services by Disney, Apple, and HBO. As it attempts to stand out, bingeworthy shows will be essential.
“I think it's a really good fit [for streaming]," she said. “When I wrote the book, one of the things I tried to do at the end of every chapter was make a mini-cliffhanger that would make it hard for people to stop reading."
Should NBCUniversal order a full season of the series, McManus expects it to air sometime next year — though she'd be surprised if its premiere coincided with the streaming service's launch in April.
McManus has other irons in the fire, too. PictureStart — a media company started this past May by ex-Lionsgate president Erik Feig — has acquired the rights to adapt “Two Can Keep a Secret," a standalone suspense novel she published in January.
And to ring in next year, she'll publish a direct sequel, “One of Us Is Next," which picks up a year after “Lying" with a new cast of characters. “It's not necessarily a season two," she warned. All the same, discussions are underway with UCP that could lead to it being adapted in some form.
“You look at something like [Netflix's] “To All the Boys I Loved Before,"' said McManus. “It started as a movie, but now there will be two more [films], because people loved it. Or [Netflix's] '13 Reasons Why,' you weren't sure there was going to be more, and it got three seasons."
Whatever happens, McManus is content for the time being to enjoy her success as a best-selling — and now full-time — novelist. After “One of Us Is Lying" broke big, Delacorte offered her a two-book contract, and with Hollywood calling, McManus left her previous job, at Monotype in Woburn.
“There was too much work, and something had to give," she said. “It wasn't going to be the dream job."

Medical Examiner Rules Epstein Death A Suicide By Hanging

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Jeffrey Epstein’s prison death has been ruled a suicide by hanging, the medical examiner’s office said Friday.
Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on Aug. 10, touching off outrage and disbelief over how such a high-profile prisoner, known for socializing with powerful people including presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, could have gone unwatched.
The Bureau of Prisons said Epstein had apparently killed himself, but that didn’t squelch conspiracy theories about his death.
Epstein, who was charged with sexually abusing numerous underage girls over several years, had been placed on suicide watch last month after he was found on his cell floor on July 23 with bruising on his neck.
But multiple people familiar with operations at the jail say he was taken off the watch after about a week and put back in a high-security housing unit where he was less closely monitored, but still supposed to be checked on every 30 minutes.
Attorney General William Barr says officials have uncovered “serious irregularities” at the jail. The FBI and the Justice Department’s inspector general are both investigating Epstein’s death.
Jail guards on duty the night of Epstein’s death are suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates every half-hour as required, according to several people familiar with the matter.
A guard in Epstein’s unit was working a fifth straight day of overtime and another guard was working mandatory overtime, the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the lacked authorization to publicly discuss the investigation.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who is in charge of the criminal case against Epstein, asked the jail’s warden this week for answers about the earlier episode, writing in a letter Monday that it had “never been definitively explained.”
The warden replied that an internal investigation was completed but that he couldn’t provide information because the findings were being incorporated into investigations into Epstein’s death.
The Associated Press often does not report details of suicide methods, but has made an exception because Epstein’s cause of death is pertinent to the ongoing investigations.
The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the autopsy revealed that several bones in Epstein’s neck had been broken, leading to speculation his death was a homicide.
Chief Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson issued a statement Thursday in response to those articles, saying: “In all forensic investigations, all information must be synthesized to determine the cause and manner of death. Everything must be consistent; no single finding can be evaluated in a vacuum.”
The medical examiner’s ruling came a day after two more women sued Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, saying he sexually abused them.
The suit, filed Thursday in a federal court in New York, claims the women were working as hostesses at a popular Manhattan restaurant in 2004 when they were recruited to give Epstein massages.
One was 18 at the time. The other was 20.
The lawsuit says an unidentified female recruiter offered the hostesses hundreds of dollars to provide massages to Epstein, saying he “liked young, pretty girls to massage him,” and wouldn’t engage in any unwanted touching. The women say Epstein groped them anyway.
One plaintiff now lives in Japan, the other in Baltimore. They seek $100 million in damages, citing depression, anxiety, anger and flashbacks.
Other lawsuits, filed over many years by other women, accused him of hiring girls as young as 14 or 15 to give him massages, then subjecting them to sex acts.

rise of the romance novel

Texto completo: The romance section at Porter Square Books keeps moving.
First the titles were scattered around general fiction. Then the section became a few shelves near mystery. Now it spans several bookcases at the front of the store — a place of honor.
Over the past few years, independent bookstores have begun accommodating more romance novels, finally giving due respect to a genre that has long been a top seller for the industry.
Last year, Brookline Booksmith rebuilt its dismantled romance section and An Unlikely Story in Plainville created its first romance section (the books had previously been shelved around the store). In June 2018, Harvard Book Store hosted its first romance event, for Jasmine Guillory's debut, “The Wedding Date," a contemporary tale about two people who arrange a fake date that, of course, leads to more.In February, Acton bookshop Silver Unicorn hosted an all-romance pop-up store in Somerville's Bow Market.
On Saturday,13 Massachusetts bookstoreswill have special displays, sales, and events as part of the first-ever national Bookstore Romance Day, billed by organizers as a way “to strengthen the relationships between bookstores and the romance community."
What took so long for romance to be embraced by indies and even some readers? Brookline Booksmith buyer Amy Brabenec has a theory.
“The misogyny in the world," she said. “This is a female-led genre. It's a genre that centers onwomen's pleasure."
According to the nonprofit Romance Writers of America — which commissions studies on the market — romance was the second-best-selling fiction category in 2016, with 23 percent of overall US fiction market sales, just behind general fiction at 27 percent and just ahead of suspense and thrillers. Still, some stores have written off romance, even as they've devoted space to other genre categories like mystery and science fiction.
Paul Swydan, who's on the Bookstore Romance Day board, admitted that when he first opened Silver Unicorn in 2018, he didn't even know what romance was. He asked Stacie Williams of Ingram Publisher Services why his section was unsuccessful and learned that the books he'd shelved weren't part of the genre. (No, he learned, Nicholas Sparks was not a romance author.)
What does count as a romance novel? The Romance Writers of America says it's defined by two principles: “a central love story and an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending." Subgenres include paranormal, historical, and young adult. “Fifty Shades of Grey" falls under “erotic," but the RWA makes clear on its website that romance books, in general, may have “varying levels of sensuality — ranging from sweet to extremely hot."
Swydan got help from Williams, who advised him to carry authors such as contemporary and historical writer Alyssa Cole, historical romance writer (and Harvard and Smith College grad) Sarah MacLean, and legendary romance author Beverly Jenkins, who received the 2017 Romance Writers of America Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award and is known for her African-American historical romance fiction.
“I've had a couple customers tell me that we have the largest romance section they've seen in the region," a proud Swydan said.
HelenKay Dimon, president of the Romance Writers of America, says there's a greater need for indies to carry romance now that chains such as Borders and Waldenbooks have closed. She said many bookstore owners like Swydan have turned to romance connoisseurs such as Williams to help them stock their stores. Dimon herself was asked to curate romance shelves for one of her local bookshops, Mysterious Galaxy, in San Diego. Guillory, a Wellesley College grad who's now a New York Times bestseller, said she was asked by East Bay Booksellers in Oakland, Calif., where she launches her titles, to assemble a “recommended by Jasmine" list for display. Guillory, whose forthcoming novel, “Royal Holiday," is inspired by Meghan Markle's mother (Doria Ragland), will become the first romance author to headline the now 11-year-old Boston Book Festival in October.
Dimon said romance authors have been happy to help these stores, which learn quickly that romance readers are prolific readers of all genres.
“They buy in bulk," she said. “They read an extraordinary amount of books at a time."
Porter Square Books manager Sarah Rettger noted that stores also see benefits from publishers supporting a wider range of authors who appeal to new readers.
“There's increasing diversity and consciousness in the writing," Rettger said. “You can be a romance fan and get stuff that's not going to make you cringe, and LGBT representation."
April Poole, one of the store's booksellers, is a fan of “Red, White & Royal Blue," a new queer romance novel from Casey McQuiston that tells the love story of Alex Claremont-Diaz, fictional first son of fictional US President Ellen Claremont, who falls in love with Prince Henry of Wales.
Cindy Hwang, vice president and editorial director at Berkley — who's responsible for a string of recent bestsellers, including Guillory's — said publishers have also been thoughtful about how the books look in stores. Not every novel needs a “clinch cover" (two people embracing). Guillory's books are released as trade paperbacks (as opposed to the tiny mass-market size), and have covers that reflect the rom-com spirit of her stories. They're very Instagram-able.
“I think that one of the barriers was the packaging," she said, explaining that younger readers want unique covers that don't look like “something their mom would read."
Dimon notes that indie stores have also been influenced by big media outlets that began paying attention to the genre. The New York Times hired Jaime Green as its romance reviewer in 2018. MacLean, whose latest historical romance is “Brazen and the Beast," covers romance for The Washington Post.
Podcaster and Harvard Divinity School graduate Vanessa Zoltan, who launched the Cambridge-based romance novel-focused podcast “Hot & Bothered" in July (its mission: to “encourage people to write romance novels as a sacred practice"), said publishers, stores, and the writers themselves can all be credited for a new attitude about romance. But she cites another reason for the genre getting more attention — and respect.
“It's [President] Trump," she said. “Trump got elected and then Harvey Weinstein and #MeToo. I think the demand came from women needing positive stories about men."
Swydan put it this way:
“Basically, so many awful things happen every day and we find out via social media way more than we used to, which is probably not great for mental health, but a book that promises a happy ending really just makes you feel better," Swydan said. “. . . And romance books, more than any other books, provide that."

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
'THE COCOANUTS' at Symphony Space (Aug. 18, 2 p.m.). This first Marx Brothers feature brought their hit Broadway show to the screen; it was also notable for how it contended with early sound technology. Of Groucho, Mordaunt Hall wrote in his review for The New York Times in 1929, "He and the microphone get along well." He added that "Chico and Zeppo also succeed in their utterance, and, so far as the fourth Marx" -- Harpo -- "is concerned, it matters little to him whether pictures talk or not." Symphony Space is showing the movie as part of a Marx Brothers series. "Horse Feathers" (1932) follows on Aug. 25.

EARLY FILMS BY PHIL SOLOMON at Light Industry (Aug. 17, 7 p.m.). In later years, Solomon, who died in April, made movies that repurposed imagery from the video game Grand Theft Auto, using it as the raw material to create a sort of found-film noir. But this tribute program salutes the experimental filmmaker's early celluloid work, in which he manipulated the physical medium to explore the possibilities of abstraction. The five-film program, spanning the 1980s and early '90s, begins with "Nocturne," which takes its rhythms from electrical storms and World War II bombings in order to, in Solomon's words, construct the war at home. All titles will screen on 16 millimeter.

MARTY AND JAY'S DOUBLE FEATURES at Film Forum (Aug. 16-Sept. 5). Watching movies back-to-back at Film Forum is one of the fastest ways to become cinematically literate. But that experience gains something extra at this year's edition of the theater's annual late-summer series: It has been programmed by Martin Scorsese and his friend and frequent screenwriter Jay Cocks, who have sought to emulate the spirit of the double bills they grew up watching. "Sometimes the pairings made sense, sometimes you'd wonder why they were being shown together," the theater quotes Scorsese as saying. To that end, you can ponder very different takes on guilt and innocence in Robert Bresson's "Pickpocket" and Alfred Hitchcock's "The Wrong Man" (on Friday) or puzzle over how Laurence Olivier's "Richard III" complements Roger Corman's Edgar Allan Poe adaptation "The Tomb of Ligeia" (on Saturday), starring Vincent Price. Even the most voracious cinephiles will have trouble finding a program in which they've already seen both titles.
212-727-8110, filmforum.org
MINNELLI WIDESCREEN at the Metrograph (Aug. 16-22). Vincente Minnelli's career was largely split between melodramas and musicals, but maybe the more salient divide is between his early features, shot in the squarish Academy ratio ("Meet Me in St. Louis," "The Bad and the Beautiful"), and his later CinemaScope efforts. The expanded, proscenium-filling frame allowed the director to heighten the jagged emotions and dramatic angles of "Some Came Running" (on Friday), with Frank Sinatra as a returning soldier whose baggage weighs down his outwardly wholesome Indiana hometown, and of the masterly "The Cobweb" (on Monday and Tuesday), with Richard Widmark as a caring psychiatrist who presides over an institution filled with the suicidal, the agoraphobic and the lonely. Seeing the series's 12 wide-screen-era Minnelli features in a theater is the only way to do them justice.
212-660-0312, metrograph.com
'WOODSTOCK' at Nitehawk Cinema Prospect Park (Aug. 17-18, 10 a.m.). Seeing this film at Nitehawk is just like being on Max Yasgur's farm in August 1969 -- except instead of four days in the sun and rain with music and dope, you'll be at a dine-in theater at brunchtime. Michael Wadleigh's Oscar-winning documentary is screening this weekend to mark the music festival's 50th anniversary.

Texto completo: Saturday morning shooting rampage in El Paso, Texas on August 3 took the lives of 22 people, and seriously injured more than two dozen others. Reportedly, the alleged shooter wanted to kill as many Mexicans as he could. Armed with safety glasses, ear coverings and an assault-style rifle, the shooter entered a Walmart store during a back-to-school sale.
"Saturday's attack on El Paso was an attack on the Mexican heritage of millions of Americans - and also part of a history of White supremacist and nativist acts in Texas across three centuries," wrote Hector Tobar, in a recent New York Times op-ed. Tobar, an associate professor at the University of California at Irvine is also a published author.
Later that day during evening hours and nearly 1,600 miles away in Dayton, Ohio, another gunman's attack left 9 people dead and 27 injured in that city's Oregon district. Like the Texas shooter, Ohio's shooter was heavily armed but was shot by police before he could enter a nightclub where he could have killed far more. The victims of this shooting reflected the city's diversity and included Blacks, Latinos, and Whites.
How in a span of only 24-hours, could two cities in different states and regions suffer mass shootings - one in a city only a few miles from the nation's southern border, and the other, a former Midwestern manufacturing hub?
Despite the shock of two unprovoked attacks, family and community members in both cities must somehow cope through their grief while preparing funeral arrangements. These two communities are also challenging governmental officials at both the state and federal levels to take actions to prevent further fatalities.
Nationally, a profusion of prayers and condolences from the nation together signaled that a tragic moment may yet be transformed into a groundswell movement that reckons with the American conscience. The profusion of assault weapons combined with easy access is a gripping issue that confronts us all.
In response to these and other tragedies, a diverse coalition of leaders held a noon rally on August 6 in the nation's capital. In a joint statement, the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights was joined by key partners including but not limited to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Voto Latino, the Center for Community SelfHelp and the Center for Responsible Lending.
"None of this is acceptable," said the leaders in a written statement. "None of this is normal. Our organizations are united in saying that Members of Congress can no longer look away as communities of color are murdered with impunity. We must all unite and demand accountability."
The NAACP and the National Urban League additionally called for the passage of the bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. Passed on a bipartisan House vote of 240-190 on February 27, the bill has yet to be taken up by the Senate. It would address both background check requirements for firearms, and firearm transfers between private individuals.
Beyond congressional actions, however, other spheres of influence can also take an active role in curbing violence. For example, corporate leaders could publicly condemn efforts to demonize immigrants, people of color or other groups targeted for hate crimes and violence. In pulpits across the country, pastors should preach about the moral dilemma the nation faces and call upon congregants to live their faith every day. Community-based organizations can call upon state and local officials to also speak out against senseless acts of violence and White supremacists.
Now is also a time to remember that regardless of race or ethnicity, our history chronicles the range of hate crimes that have taken the lives of Latinos as well as Native Americans, Blacks, Jews, and the LGBTQ community. The terror now facing America's Latinos resurrects these horrors, particularly how Blacks encountered racial hatred for more than a century during Jim Crow era and later during the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s.
Too many times in recent years, our unique Black American experience we remain at risk as a people. In 1998 the body of James Byrd, a Black, 49-year old Jasper, Texas man was ripped to pieces as it was drug over a mile and a half by Whites driving a pick-up truck. Other and more recent heinous hate crimes remind us of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice - just to name a few.
According to Rutgers University, Black men today are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be victims of violence. From 2013 to 2017, 11,456 fatal encounters with police and members of the public were reported.
At the same time, the emergence of hate groups has been on the rise, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).
"The total number of hate groups rose to 1,020 in 2018, up about 7 percent from 2017," wrote Heidi Beirich, who leads SPLC's Intelligence Project and its award-winning publication, The Intelligence Report.
Its report released this February found that white nationalist groups grew from 100 in 2017 to 148 the following year, 2018 - a 50% growth. Other hate groups - anti-Semitic, anti-LGBTQ, and antiMuslim - also grew during these same years from 233 to 264. While the Ku Klux Klan dominated hate groups in the Jim Crow and civil rights eras, its presence across the country now appears to have been eclipsed by the growth of neo-Nazis, White nationalists, and skin head organizations.
SPLC's Hate Map by State shows that the largest number of statewide hate groups are located in California (83), Florida (75), and Texas (73). At the local level, additional hate organizations currently operate in Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Tallahassee. Beyond these three states, hate groups can also be found in 45 other states and in more metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Sacramento, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
Just as the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. prompted the enactment of major civil rights legislation, now is another time for our nation to stand up to the many forms of domestic terrorism that plague the nation. People of conscience and principle have a duty to stand up, speak out for the fullness of our "inalienable

Texto completo: "Oppressive language does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge. Whether it is obscuring state language or the faux-language of mindless media; whether it is the proud but calcified language of the academy or the commodity driven language of science; whether it is the malign language of law-with-out-ethics, or language designed for the estrangement of minorities, hiding its racist plunder in its literary cheek - it must be rejected, altered and exposed. It is the language that drinks blood, laps vulnerabilities, tucks its fascist boots under crinolines of respectability and patriotism as it moves relentlessly toward the bottom line and the bottomed-out mind." - Toni Morrison, Nobel Lecture, 1993
A few years after being awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, for a body of work known for centering the Black American experience, Toni Morrison was asked by a white reporter when she would "incorporate white lives" into her books "in a substantial way."
"You can't understand how powerfully racist that question is, can you?" she asked. "You could never ask a white author, 'When are you going to write about Black people?' Whether he did or not, or she did or not. Even the inquiry comes from a position of being in the center."
Morrison likened herself to a Russian author, writing in Russian, about Russia. "The fact that it gets translated and read by other people is a benefit, it's a plus, but he's not obliged to ever consider writing about French people, or Americans, or anybody."
Morrison's death this week, at the age of 88, is a loss not only to the literary world, but to the cause of racial justice and civil rights. And it comes at a time when her unique voice is especially relevant.
Shortly after the election of Donald Trump in 2016, she published an essay entitled "Make America White Again," in which she argued that white America's loss of "the conviction of their natural superiority" had led to its debasement. The slaughter of unarmed men and women of color at the hands of police and racially-motivated mass murder, the bombing of Black churches - and white America's apparent tolerance for all of it - she asserted, were part of the death knell of white superiority.
"If it weren't so ignorant and pitiful, one could mourn this collapse of dignity in service to an evil cause," she wrote. It is telling that what the interviewer noticed most about Morrison's work was the absence of white characters; white privilege can be like air or light, notable only when it is absent. And according to Morrison, white voters were beginning to feel it ebb away.
"Toni Morrison" may have been as much a creation as her novels; she said she regretted using the nickname, derived from her chosen confirmation name, Anthony, and always thought of as Chloe, her given name. She grew up in the integrated town of Lorain, Ohio, and was disillusioned by what she saw as rampant colorism when she arrived at Howard University in 1949. Unlike classmates who had grown up in the south, she experienced legal segregation for the first time in Washington, D.C., but could not believe it was real.
"I think it's a theatrical thing," she told the New York Times. "I always felt that everything else was the theater. They didn't really mean that. How could they? It was too stupid."
When Morrison won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, it had been more than 30 years since an American-born author had won, but her status as the first Black woman honored overshadowed her Americanness.
And while she had complained that her work was more likely to be taught in women's studies or African-American studies classes than in English classes, she hoped her work "fit first into African-American traditions and, second of all, this whole thing called literature."
Today, even high-school students across the country are familiar with her work, reading her alongside Nathanial Hawthorne and Mark Twain. She has staked out the African-American experience as part of the broader American experience.
As politicians seek to divide us and racial violence swirls around us, it is this lesson - that Black America is America, that we must keep firmly in our hearts.

Sandmann v. Washington Post: Discomfort is not libel

Texto completo: Welcome to Journalism 101, class.
Today's lessons come from the court ruling in Sandmann v. Washington Post on July 26, when a federal judge dismissed a young man's libel claim against a big newspaper. As a journalism professor and author on libel, I see important principles in the Sandmann case:
Truth seeking is a primary mission of journalism News reporting inspires debate. When reporting veers to malicious falsehood, that's libel. Reporting controversy does not constitute libel.
Nicholas Sandmann, a private citizen and student at Covington Catholic High School, was unwittingly catapulted into the fray amid angry politics that divide our nation.
He and his family – understandably – were upset by the glare of global attention. They sued for a quarter-billion dollars, the purchase price of The Washington Post in 2013.
Discomfort is not libel.
News evolves
News reports (video, photos and text) showed young Sandmann in a red MAGA ("Make America Great Again") hat, face-to-face with Native American elder Nathan Phillips on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in January. Twitter exploded with viral videos with what appeared to be a confrontational moment between the two.
As the story evolved, journalists updated reports on the event in an era of heated us-versus-them politics and the 24-hour news cycle. Expanding their reporting, as more cell-phone video was released by onlookers, journalists informed us that a group of Black Hebrew Israelites was shouting slurs at Sandmann and other students in the moments before the initial viral video. His intent was to calm the situation, not to confront, he said.
More information, which may add to or revise meaning, does not constitute libel.
Opinions are protected speech "Few principles of law," said the federal judge in the Sandmann case (William O. Bertelsman), "are as well-established as the rule that statements of opinion are not actionable in libel actions."
Interestingly, Judge Bertelsman cited case law from Ohio to support his recent ruling that statements of opinion relating to matters of public concern are protected by the First Amendment (Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Company, 1990).
In the Sandmann case, the judge accepted Sandmann's statement that, when he was standing motionless in the confrontation with Phillips, his intent was to calm the situation and not to impede or block anyone.
"However, Phillips did not see it that way. He concluded that he was being 'blocked' and ... passed these conclusions on to The Post." The judge said the newspaper is not liable for publishing these opinions.
The big picture: protection of unpopular speech One of the toughest assignments of the First Amendment is to protect unpopular speech, even hate speech. Our Constitution protects the right of Americans to chant "send her back" at a Trump rally, a hateful shout aimed at Congresswoman Ilban Omar (D-MN).
Meanwhile, the Southern Poverty Law Center reports an increase, for the fourth straight year, in the number of hate groups operating across the country.
As we protect speech – even expression we may find abhorrent – we certainly must not undermine the free press.
America's standard for protecting free press and its search for truth was established by the Supreme Court in Sullivan v. New York Times (1964). It safeguards the free press from libel abuse, a vital protection for reporting on the civil rights movement, Watergate, and Vietnam.
Today, some want to undermine Sullivan, to erode protection of the free press. As we consider the big picture, let's remember Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis' time-honored advice that the answer to bad speech is more speech, not "enforced silence."
Class dismissed.

Thrusting labels on everyone is absurd, offensive

Texto completo: Who has the right to decide what I am?
I am a brown-skinned descendant of immigrants who came from southern Italy. When they arrived in the United States in 1905, they were reviled, ridiculed and discriminated against. In the South, Italian immigrants were subject to a mass lynching, which the New York Times celebrated in an editorial on March 16, 1891, stating: "These sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins, who have transported to this country the lawless passions, the cut-throat practices, and the oath-bound societies of their native country, are to us a pest without mitigations."
My grandfather had a cross burned on his lawn.
I was brought up by a single mother in Brooklyn, dependent on government assistance, sharing a home with a multitude of relatives. Our playground was the street. Our porch was a stone stoop, and the fire hydrants were our pool. The subway was my limousine. I had far, far more in common with other minorities in the inner city than I did with the white suburbanites. I was the butt of ethnic jokes. I couldn't date certain girls. I was looked down upon by those in the "better" class.
Yet, now, some omniscient force has thrust me, by default I guess, into the same class of "privileged" people as the descendants of slaveholders and of pilgrims on the Mayflower. How did I get here, and how do I now stand as accused of the privilege as descendants of those who burned the cross on my grandfather's lawn? The answer, I think, is apparent.
We are consumed as a society by the insatiable need to place everyone into categories, pre-determined by who knows? I don't fit neatly into the minority categories of today, even though my ancestors surely fit into the derogatorily named groups of their time. So, whoever makes the rules decided that I have to belong in some category, and they lump me into the "privileged" class as if I was just another indistinguishable molecule in an otherwise vast homogeneity.
I illustrate my personal situation to demonstrate the ridiculous and offensive result produced by thrusting everyone into an ill-defined, and thoughtlessly imposed, classification. An upper-middle-class person from the north of Spain is categorized by the same "Hispanic" designation as an impoverished indigenous person from Central America, simply because of a last name, thus diluting the intended meaning of the term. If some governmental benefit is available based purely on ethnicity, the Spanish person gets to compete equally with the indigenous person.
A person living in poverty in Appalachia can be part of the same "privileged" category as a person owning a $3 million apartment in Manhattan, solely because they are defined by the same racial characterization.
In our zeal to make sure everyone has a label, we ignore the absurdity of what we create, because the labels themselves have become more important than the person forced to wear them.
But no matter what box they squeeze me into, I am still a brown-skinned descendant of immigrants from southern Italy. And I am privileged to be that.

Texto completo: Kristie Reeves-Cavaliero lives in Austin, Texas. But recently, she couldn't stop thinking about a family across the country in Rockland County that she never met — Juan and Marissa Rodriguez and their children.
Nearly 1-year-old twins Luna and Phoenix Rodriguez died in late July after they were left in their father's hot car for eight hours while he was at work at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center in the Bronx. Juan Rodriguez, a 39-year-old Iraq War vet, told police he "blanked out" and thought he had dropped them at day care.
"We are having a lot of PTSD triggers from this case," said Reeves-Cavaliero.
The Texas pharmacist is a mother of twins now. But the case has haunted her and her husband, Brett Cavaliero, for a deeper reason.
Their daughter, Sophia Rayne Cavaliero, or Ray Ray, died in 2011 at age 1 after being left in a hot car. Brett Cavaliero thought he dropped her off at day care on his way to work. But he hadn't. She was found in the back of his truck three hours later. But it was too late.
Reeves-Cavaliero can't believe such senseless and awful loss is still happening.
"Our child died eight years ago, when she died she was about about the 498th case since 1998," said Reeves-Cavaliero, who has become an advocate for any and all methods that could prevent more heat stroke deaths of babies left in cars. "Since her death we're up to almost 800 kids — there have been more than 300 kids who have died since my child died.
"As a parent who's worked tirelessly with the child safety advocates and the politicians, it just makes me mad as hell," Reeves-Cavaliero said.
Preventing hot-car deaths The Cavalieros established Ray Ray's Pledge, which encourages day care providers to call a parent if a child has not been dropped off. Forgotten day care dropoff is the No. 1 source of child hot car deaths.
Social media comments have questioned if the twins' day care, located in Yonkers, had called about the their absence. Family and friends have said they didn't, and have not named the provider.
Reeves-Calaviero said that in most states, there is no mandate for child care providers to call about absences, which is done in K-12 schools.
No such mandate could be found in New York State Office of Children and Family Services regulations.
Child Care Resources of Rockland, which provides support and training for childcare providers and referrals for families, strongly recommends providers have a policy addressing absences, CCRR Executive Director Vicki Caramante said. "Reach out to a family if a child is absent without the program being notified," Caramante said. "Our staff is available to help programs write these policies and procedures."
Other measures can be taken to keep kids safe.
On the federal level, the HOT CARS Act — for Helping Overcome Trauma for Children Alone in Rear Seats — would mandate that new vehicles come with alert systems to remind drivers if a child is left in the backseat.
A state bill mandating backseat detection devices for vehicles sold in New York will be introduced this week by Sen. David Carlucci, D-New City. "The technology is available. Automotive manufacturers are already putting them in certain models," Carlucci said. "Everyone thinks it will never happen to them, but it does. That's why we need to ... make this technology standard in all new cars."
There are also several apps and other devices that remind drivers to check the back seat.
Alfredo Angueira, a friend of Juan Rodriguez since their days at SUNY Albany, said he's been surprised by how much technology exists to prevent this kind of tragedy.
"You can turn on your air conditioner from your cellphone," Angueira said. "In this day and age, this is not necessary anymore."
Fifty-two children died after being left in hot cars in 2018, the highest number of vehicular heatstroke deaths in the last 21 years, according to noheatstroke.org. So far this year, 24 children have died; Phoenix and Luna Rodriguez were the 22nd and 23rd fatalities.
Accident or crime It was Angueira who first mentioned to Juan Rodriguez the concept of Forgotten Baby Syndrome – a neurobiological state in which a person's brain believes a child is no longer in the backseat of a vehicle. "He hadn't heard of it."
Rodriguez, the New York Times reported, called David Diamond, a University of South Florida professor who is an expert of Forgotten Baby Syndrome, to find out more.
Angueira was not surprised that Rodriguez, who has a master's degree in social work, went to a primary source to research what had happened.
"Finding out information behind a condition is basically what he's done his entire career," Angueira said. "I think any one of us, your mind is going to search for answers. This isn't you, you love your children, what happened?"
Rodriguez was arrested Friday and jailed, Now out on bail, he was in court Thursday morning in the Bronx. Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter and two counts of criminally negligent homicide, both felonies, as well as two misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child. While the Bronx District Attorney is still weighing whether to send the case to a grand jury, Rodriguez' lawyer has said the DA should not charge him because it was an accident. The case was adjourned until Aug. 27.
Parents are charged with a crime about 50% of the time when a child dies in a hot car, according to Amber Rollins, director of Kids and Cars, a Kansas-based organization that is dedicated to saving the lives of children in and around cars.
"Juan being charged brings back so much how they treat the parents," said Reeves-Cavaliero, whose husband was investigated in Ray Ray's death but not charged. "The last thing that this family needed was for this guy to be arrested at a time like that."
Angueira said that Juan and his family had not been focused on the criminal case. "He's dealing with his mental state, his wife's mental state," Angueira said. Everything else, he said, is "tertiary."

Texto completo: A federal judge ruled against the FBI’s efforts to keep some redacted documents related to former FBI Director James Comey’s memos hidden from the public.
The ruling comes after the FBI asked Judge James Boasberg to reconsider a district court ruling earlier this year that CNN and other media organizations and watchdog groups were entitled to information related both to Comey's memos and to how those memos were used in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation, which concluded earlier this year. But the FBI battled against disclosure.
The bureau was claiming it had “effectively asserted” a Freedom of Information Act exemption as the basis to protect its redactions. But the judge said the FBI never actually made this assertion in the relevant filings. Nevertheless, the FBI wanted the judge to act like it had and to rule accordingly in its favor to stop more information from being released. The FBI also argued that, even though it invoked the National Security Act, it had actually meant to invoke the Freedom of Information Act instead.
The judge denied these requests Monday, calling the arguments a bridge too far and pointing out the FBI never made the arguments it now wanted him to consider.
Media and watchdog groups have fought to obtain documents relating to Comey's notes through federal open records laws since May 2017, when the existence of Comey's memos was first made public. Those memos recount hotly disputed conversations between Comey and Trump that are hotly disputed.
Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017, then one of the memos subsequently leaked by Comey to a friend was detailed in the New York Times a week later. Comey later told Congress he leaked the memo to prompt a special counsel investigation. The day after the story appeared, Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.
The Justice Department long argued the release of the Comey memos in full would interfere with the special counsel investigation, and the court originally ruled in its favor. But redacted versions of the memos were eventually released to Congress and the public.
Following the completion of Mueller’s investigation, CNN asked the court to unseal, in full, three documents: two 2017 memos to the court authored by high-ranking FBI official David Archey discussing why the special counsel compiled Comey's memos and answering the court's questions about the connection between the memos and the special counsel investigation, and a transcript of and other records related to Mueller lawyer Michael Dreeben's presentation to the court.
Speculation that Comey’s memos were being used by Mueller seemed to be confirmed when Archey told the court the Comey memos shouldn’t be released because they were considered evidence in the Trump-Russia probe.
The FBI eventually handed over much of the requested information this year, but CNN and others still sought redacted information from Archey's final memo. Following this week's judicial ruling, the information is likely to be made public soon.
DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz criminally referred Comey to the Justice Department earlier this year for the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information in his memos, but the Justice Department declined to press charges. Comey is not out of the woods yet, however, as Horowitz is still scrutinizing him as part of a broader investigation into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

'Way too convenient': De Blasio speculates about Epstein's death

Texto completo: 2020 presidential long shot Bill de Blasio speculated about the death of alleged child sexual predator and trafficker Jeffrey Epstein on Tuesday.
Epstein, 66, died last weekend from an apparent suicide after being found unconscious in his prison cell. The alleged predator had relationships with many influential individuals, including former President Bill Clinton and President Trump. Those relationships were called into question as Epstein awaited trial.
De Blasio questioned Epstein's death during a Tuesday evening appearance on Fox Business' Bulls & Bears.
“This is way too convenient," he said. "This makes no sense. He’s one of the most prominent prisoners in America, at that point. He had either attempted suicide previously or been assaulted. Either way, it is the same reality. He needed to be watched 24 hours a day. It’s one of the premier federal facilities in the country. It belongs to the Justice Department. This is — come on, how on Earth do they miss this?”
Fox Business’ Kristina Partsinevelos then questioned him about the implication he was making.'Way too convenient' — de Blasio speculates about Epstein's death"I have been saying all week, I’m not a conspiracy theorist by nature," de Blasio answered. "It means that sometimes you see a series of events that you cannot give a normal explanation for. And there needs to be a full investigation.”
David Asman later asked him if one of the prominent people Epstein was associated with could've "had something to do with his death."
“I’m going to say it a little more simply from my point of view," de Blasio responded. "The one thing I do not think is possible here is just pure traditional human error, that just some guard fell asleep or someone didn’t cover their shift. That’s the one thing I would rule out given the prominence of the case and the nature of the situation, which means something else happened. I don’t know what that something else is, but as sure as hell it needs to be investigated.”
Despite the New York City's mayor's insinuation, the New York Times reported Tuesday that two staff members in Epstein's unit were asleep for some or all of the three hours they failed to check on him. The officers then falsified reporters to cover the lapse.

Ivanka Trump conflates Chicago gun violence stats

Texto completo: As President Donald Trump came under intense criticism for his divisive rhetoric in the wake of mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, his daughter Ivanka took to Twitter to express concern about unrelated shootings in Chicago.
“As we grieve over the evil mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, let us not overlook that Chicago experienced its deadliest weekend of the year,” she tweeted. “With 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground in the Windy City—and little national outrage or media coverage—we mustn’t become numb to the violence faced by inner city communities every day.”
At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, both Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson swiftly condemned the first daughter’s statements as “wrong” and “misleading.”
But what part of these tweets was incorrect, and how did Trump get the story mixed up? We took a closer look to find out.
Conflated numbers
As Lightfoot and Johnson pointed out at Tuesday’s press conference, the tweets imply that the victims all came from a single shooting incident.
In reality, those numbers represent citywide statistics for gun casualties that occurred between Friday, August 2 and Sunday, August 4.
“She said seven killed and 52 shot near a playground. That’s not what happened,” Johnson said. “She’s conflating the whole weekend activity into one incident.”
One shooting that left seven injured did occur near a playground in Douglas Park during the early morning hours on Sunday, as the Sun-Times pointed out. But the rest of the victims sustained gunshot wounds from many other isolated shooting incidents around the city.
According to CPD Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, Trump was also wrong in saying that last weekend was the deadliest weekend of 2019 for Chicago, although it was the most violent weekend in terms of total shooting victims.
Data collected by the Sun-Times shows that gun violence left nine dead after a weekend in mid-July and eight dead in early June.
While news of the violence here in Chicago certainly took a backseat to the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton nationally, Trump mischaracterized the situation by saying there was “little national outrage or media coverage.” The outbreak of gun violence was front-page news in the Chicago Tribune and the Sun-Times, and it even found its way into Monday’s issue of The New York Times.
After angrily lamenting Trump’s dissemination of misleading information—the original post got over 35,000 likes and 8,000 retweets on Twitter—Lightfoot took the occasion as an opportunity to explain what a healthy partnership between Chicago and the federal government might look like.
“That’s the danger of trying to govern via Tweet,” the mayor said. “If they want to help, they should actually call us and ask for specifics, which we’d be happy to share, and we would offer them specific ways in which the federal government can actually partner with us to help address the issue of violent crime.”
While Trump failed to issue a formal retraction or correction, the White House did release a statement regarding the situation following Lightfoot’s comments.
“Ivanka has appreciated getting to know Mayor Lightfoot, respects her commitment to addressing this issue and looks forward to continuing the conversation around this issue, workforce development and economic opportunity for all,” the White House said. “To the extent that her quote was misleading in implying that all of the shooting incidents occurred in one location, it remains important to note that there were 7 deaths and 52 wounded across the city, resulting in one of the deadliest weekends in the city this year.”
Our ruling
Ivanka Trump tweeted “that Chicago experienced its deadliest weekend of the year...With 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground.”
Only seven of the wounded were shot in an incident that occurred near a playground in Douglas Park. Last weekend also was not the deadliest weekend of the year in Chicago, according to data from CPD.
We rate her claim Mostly False.

Daily on Healthcare: Nurse practitioners fight for more freedom

NURSE PRACTITIONERS FIGHT FOR MORE FREEDOM: States are slowly moving in the direction of expanding freedoms for nurse practitioners, whose duties are similar to that of physicians in that they can prescribe medication, order tests, refer patients to specialists, and manage treatments.
Twenty-eight states have restrictions on nurse practitioners by disallowing them from doing their jobs without getting sign-off from a doctor. In those states — including large ones such as California, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas — nurse practitioners have to work under an existing physician practice, meaning that every part of their job has an extra layer of oversight.
While doctor groups see this arrangement as a necessary part of delivering care, it's something nurse practitioner groups hope to change. If they are allowed to operate on their own, they say, they can help reduce healthcare spending, improve access to medical care, and address the doctor shortage at a time when the U.S. population is aging and demand for healthcare is growing.
"We are looking to improve the quality of care," said Adele Caruso, president of the Pennsylvania Coalition of Nurse Practitioners. "We are qualified providers, and we have shown that time and time again."
A hodgepodge of advocates, from AARP to conservative think tanks, have supported undoing restrictions.
But doctor groups oppose the changes, saying that nurse practitioners don't have the training or education needed to help patients get the best quality of care on their own. They conclude patients can benefit most when medical providers are led by doctors who address patients' needs with a team of specialists.
Doctor groups note that their members spend four years in medical school followed by three to seven years of residency, a training they say has put them in the best position to diagnose complex medical conditions and develop treatment plans specific to patients' circumstances. They contend there are other solutions to address the doctor shortage, such as loan forgiveness, increasing residency slots in medically underserved areas, and expanding class sizes.
"Every patient deserves access to the highest level of training they can get," said Dr. Danae Powers, president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society, which represents doctors in the commonwealth. "If you're going to take something off the doctors' plate, don't make it the time with the patients."
Powers said doctors are suffering from burnout because they spend so much time filling out forms, calling insurers, trying to get tests done, and dealing with unwieldy electronic medical record-keeping systems. Those problems, she said, are what lawmakers should be looking to address.

NUMBER OF UNSUBSIDIZED OBAMACARE CUSTOMERS DWINDLES: Roughly 40% of people who don’t get subsidies from the Obamacare marketplaces have dropped out over the span of two years, according to a study out Monday from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In all, 2.5 million left the market, likely because they found the premiums to be too expensive. The number doesn’t include the millions more people who bought insurance outside of the exchanges, who still have to buy plans that abide by Obamacare’s rules. In general, an individual does not get subsidies if they make roughly $48,560 a year for an individual and $100,400 for a family of four.
Democrats and Republicans interpret the development differently: Republicans often point to this group as evidence that Obamacare must go, but Democratic leaders in the House have said that Obamacare should have been more generous and have proposed increasing the income threshold at which people receive subsidies.
HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL SCHOOL GROUPS CRITICIZE TRUMP CHANGES TO ‘PUBLIC CHARGE’ IMMIGRATION RULE: The American Hospital Association, America’s Essential Hospitals, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and other hospital industry groups denounced the Trump administration’s update to the “public charge” immigration rule Monday, saying it will “undermine access to care for legal immigrants by discouraging the use of critical public programs like Medicaid,” and ask that the administration withdraw the rule.
California is prepared to sue the Trump administration: California’s Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced Monday the state is ready to sue the administration over rulemaking, saying it will damage the state’s economy and disadvantage low-income Californians who rely on food assistance programs and the state’s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. Because the updated rule will determine whether to grant an immigrant citizenship based on his use of public programs, Becerra says 2 million noncitizens will have to decide whether to take advantage of their eligibility for public healthcare or risk being deported.
HHS DRUG PRICING REFORM EXPERT TO LEAVE AFTER EIGHT MONTHS: Health and Human Services’ senior adviser to the secretary for drug pricing reform John O’Brien is leaving his post after eight months as the administration takes on the task of lowering drug prices and increasing healthcare cost transparency. O’Brien was selected to the position in December 2018, and will be replaced by John Brooks, currently principal deputy director of the Center for Medicare. O’Brien, former vice president of public policy for CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, was, according to Secretary Alex Azar, “one of the key architects of [President Trump’s American Patients First blueprint], he was one of the key leaders in its execution.”
FDA WARNS AGAINST DRINKING ‘MIRACLE MINERAL SUPPLEMENT,’ WHICH IS ACTUALLY JUST BLEACH: The Food and Drug Administration has been warning consumers since 2010 against buying and drinking Miracle Mineral Solution, which is advertised as a cure for everything from the flu and cancer to AIDS. The solution, when mixed with citric acid, becomes a powerful bleaching agent, and people who drink it have reported life-threatening dehydration from vomiting, diarrhea, and low blood pressure, as well as liver failure. The FDA has warned against these products many times before, but ads for them keep popping up on the internet.
KAMALA HARRIS FACES HEAT OVER HEALTHCARE AT IOWA NURSING HOME: Presidential contender Kamala Harris faced a bit of heat from an Iowa nursing home nursing home resident about how "Medicare for all" would be paid for. “We're going to pay because right now, let me tell you something, we're all paying for healthcare for everyone, and it's in the emergency room,” Harris said. The woman didn’t buy it and told Harris not to mess with the healthcare system as it is now.

Texto completo: The week just ended will go down in history and in the annals of failed good intentions. It was the moment when the Resistance — the self-declared defenders of the good, true, and holy against the assaults of the Trump interregnum — became in some ways still more unhinged than the regime they were protesting.
“This is a president who seems to want these things to happen,” said Mika Brzezinski of the Morning Joe program, days after the sickening bloodshed in El Paso, Texas. She was suggesting not only that the president relishes the sight of his own people dying, but that his backers are equally bloodthirsty and vile.
Cue Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro, brother and campaign manager to his twin brother, presidential candidate Julián Castro. Joaquin published a list of the top 44 local donors to Trump in his own congressional district, along with the names of their employers and their addresses at work.
“Sad to see so many San Antonians as 2019 maximum donors to Donald Trump…Their contributions are fueling a campaign of hate.”
Republican Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, who in 2017 just barely survived a shooter’s large-scale assassination attempt against multiple Republican congressmen, compared this to the hate that had fueled his own shooting.
“I don’t want to put these people’s names in my feed. because this is dangerous,” said the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman.
Americans should be able to vote and to give as they wished without incurring a penalty, or at least, that’s what most of us believe. Others evinced a very different belief, that voting for or giving to Trump should be illegal and that the Castros were doing their duty by making it even more difficult.
On MSNBC, two interviewers on a panel of three supported the ad and its makers, on the grounds that information about campaign donations is in the public domain. Castro didn’t tell people anything new, he just “rearranged” things, said Mika Brzezinski. But he rearranged them so as it make convenient and easy for anyone looking to annoy or to hurt Trump’s supporters, which of course, Castro will tell you, wasn’t the intent at all.
But under normal circumstances, information about political donations is available in FEC files, where very few crazy, violent people are going to go looking for it.
A new take on all this was given to us by one Frank Figliuzzi, a former assistant director of the FBI and frequent guest panelist. He informed the nation last week that Trump had revealed one piece of the puzzle when he said after the shootings that flags would stay at half staff for those killed until Aug. 8.
“The numbers 8-8 are very significant in neo-Nazi and white supremacy movements,” he told Brian Williams. “The letter ‘H’ is the eighth letter of the alphabet and to them the numbers 8-8 together stand for ‘Heil Hitler.’ So we’re going to be trailing the flag back up at dusk on 8/8.”
You got that? Trump is in league with a cohort of Nazis, to whom he sends signals that he is still with them in such subtle codes. Flags today, the number of cars in the motorcade tomorrow, and God knows what comes after that.
The takeaway is that the Resistance has become far more insane that what it was resisting. No good can come of that.

TRUMP’S VISIT TO PETROCHEMICAL PLANT SHOWS A DEMOCRATIC ‘BLIND SPOT’ ON FOSSIL FUELS: President Trump is touring a petrochemical plant in western Pennsylvania Tuesday afternoon to tout booming U.S. energy production and its ties to the economy of a swing state whose Democratic leadership is more embracing of fossil fuels than the national party.
While no one can guess how Trump will focus his visit, his allies say he has the opportunity to make the case for the growing demand for oil and gas for petrochemicals used in plastics, fertilizers, clothing, digital devices, and other everyday products, and how that contrasts with pledges from Democratic presidential candidates to phase out fossil fuels.
“There is such a contrast for the president going out to celebrate the fact that petrochemicals are the building blocks of modern day life, versus the Democrats who want to shut that industry down,” said Mandy Gunasekara, a former senior EPA official in the Trump administration who now runs the Energy 45 Fund, a nonprofit organization supporting the president’s energy agenda.
“It’s within the strategy of the Democrats to go after these plants because of their demand for fossil-based energy to do what they do,” Gunasekara told me in an interview.
Demand for petrochemicals is booming: Petrochemicals derived from oil and gas are becoming the largest drivers of global oil demand, the International Energy Agency said in a report last year, outpacing demand from cars, planes and trucks. IEA projects that petrochemicals will account for more than a third of oil demand growth over the next decade, and nearly half of growth through 2050. Petrochemicals could consume an additional 56 billion cubic meters of natural gas by 2030, and 83 bcm by 2050, IEA said.
The U.S. is poised to be a major part of serving that demand growth. It has become a low-cost location for chemicals production thanks to the shale gas revolution and is now home to around 40% of the global ethane-based petrochemical production capacity.
Production of ethane, a byproduct of natural gas that can be made into polyethylene, a form of plastic, is projected to increase more than 20 times by the year 2025, according to the Department of Energy.
Petrochemicals also have a role in the clean energy transition: That is because of their presence in materials used to manufacture solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and electric vehicles.
“Petrochemicals are one of the key blind spots in the global energy debate, especially given the influence they will exert on future energy trends,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director.
Shell, the European oil and gas giant that is building the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex that Trump is visiting, says some of the plastic produced at the plant can be used to create fuel-efficient vehicles.
The plant will convert natural gas produced in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions into plastic to be used in the manufacturing of consumer products. It is one of more than a dozen petrochemical plants that are being built, or have been proposed, across the world, according to the New York Times. That includes several across Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, as the Trump administration works with state regulators to build the country’s first natural gas and petrochemical hub in Appalachia.
The politics of petrochemical growth: But oil and gas companies have been getting in the petrochemical business before Trump took office. Shell approved the Pennsylvania plant in the Obama administration, when the growth of oil and gas production began. The U.S. has continued on that path under Trump, becoming the world’s largest combined producer of oil and natural gas.
"Trump is trying to claim credit in swing states like Pennsylvania for the shale boom which actually began and peaked under Obama," Paul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute, and former Clinton White House climate change advisor, told me.
Bledsoe, however, said Trump could potentially exploit national Democrats’ aggressive plans to phase out fossil fuels by playing up the continued demand for natural gas and petrochemicals.
"Democrats would be smart to recognize that shale gas will continue to be an important part of the energy economy for many years in Pennsylvania and Ohio, even as the clean energy jobs in wind, solar and electric vehicles also surge in those states,” he said.

DEMOCRATS STRUGGLING TO FACE FACT THEIR PLANS WOULD ALL BUT END FOSSIL FUELS: Most Democratic presidential candidates running for president have rallied around a shared goal: cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050.
However, few candidates appear to appreciate the ambition of that target, or explicitly say that it would necessitate almost entirely ending the use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. Fossil fuels — petroleum, natural gas, and coal — accounted for 80% of U.S. total energy consumption in 2018, according to the Energy Information Administration.
“Getting to net-zero by 2050, which some people try to diminish, will take a herculean effort and will require a reorganization of our energy economy in ways never imagined before,” John Delaney, a presidential candidate and former congressman from Maryland, told me.
Although many Democrats have embraced the goal of net-zero, few have outlined policy prescriptions for reaching the goal, or mentioned how they would get Americans to stop using fossil fuels.
Contrasts between plans: The exception to the rule is Jay Inslee, who has offered a comprehensive plan for ending the use of fossil fuels, which includes more immediate, specific goals of eliminating coal by 2030 and having fossil fuel-free electricity by 2035. His agenda includes working with Congress to ban the technique of fracking for natural gas, and rejecting new fossil fuel infrastructure such as pipelines.
Inslee, the governor of Washington state, accused front-runner Joe Biden during last month’s presidential debate of not sufficiently committing to eliminate fossil fuels from the U.S. economy.
Most candidates, including Biden, have also vowed to ban new oil and gas drilling leases on public lands — nearly a quarter of U.S. greenhouse emissions come from energy production on public lands. But they leave the door open for fossil fuel use more broadly, with some candidates specifically mentioning carbon capture as an important technology during the clean energy transition.

DEMOCRATIC STATES TO SUE TRUMP FOR ‘EVISCERATING’ ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT: Democratic states promised Monday to sue the Trump administration for its move to "eviscerate" the Endangered Species Act by modifying how the federal government implements the law in a manner more accommodating to businesses.
Democratic Attorneys General Xavier Becerra of California and Maura Healey of Massachusetts said they would file a lawsuit, along with "many" other states, in the coming weeks.
"This is another attempt by the Trump administration to end-run existing law and find a way to eviscerate it through rulemaking," Healey told reporters on a press call. "These new rules are misguided, they are dangerous, and they are illegal.”
The states are basing their lawsuit on three allegations, Healey said: The administration acted "arbitrarily" by not adequately considering science, it failed to properly absorb public comment, and the changes violate the text and purpose of the statute to protect vulnerable species from extinction.
Environmental groups are also planning to sue: "This administration's attempt to twist and reinterpret the law in ways that are illegal completely violates the spirit and intent of the law itself," Jamie Clark, president and CEO of the Defenders of Wildlife, said on the press call. "Regulations cannot change law. Only Congress can."
Industry groups supportive of the changes said Democratic states are overreacting.
"Everybody knows how hard it is to change anything related to Endangered Species Act because of the demagoguery surrounding it," Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, told me. "You try to do anything to make ESA work more practically and you would think someone is out there shooting polar bears.”

SOLAR PANEL IMPORTS PARTIALLY RECOVER AFTER TRUMP TARIFFS: The U.S. imported an average of 644,000 kilowatts of solar panels per month in the first four months of 2019, an increase compared to the level after Trump imposed tariffs on imported solar panels.
Solar panel imports had fallen to 300,000 kilowatts per month in the months following Trump’s imposition of tariffs on solar panels in early 2018, according to data released Tuesday by the Energy Information Administration.
The EIA said continued decline in the cost of solar PV modules may have offset some of the effects of the solar tariffs.
But that higher number of imports in early 2019 is still lower than the level of solar panel imports in mid-2017, before the tariffs were announced, when they were at more than 1,000 kilowatts per month.
In January 2018, Trump imposed a 30% tariff on imported solar panels as part of his trade agenda to target cheap products made by China and other Asian countries. The tariffs, to be levied over four years, are for 30% in the first year, 25% in the second, 20% in the third, and 15% in the fourth year.
BUTTIGIEG BACKS BIOFUEL INDUSTRY AGAINST REFINERY EXEMPTIONS TO RFS: Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is pledging to stop the “abuse” of small refinery exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard, a process that he says has been excessively used under the Trump administration to the detriment of U.S. farmers.
Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said he plans to side with biofuels and “rural America” by supporting the RFS “as written.”
“Pete will stop the abuse of small refinery exemptions established by the current administration, which allows fossil fuel giants to skirt their obligations to blend biofuels,” his campaign said Tuesday, as part of a plan he released on “unleashing the potential of rural America.”
Corn farmers and their representatives in Congress have accused the Trump administration of excessive use of the refinery exemptions, which they argue are eroding the market for ethanol.
The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that it exempted 31 oil refineries from 2018 requirements to use renewable fuel, while denying six applications — the first time the Trump administration denied small refiner exemption applications under the RFS.
Buttigieg, like other candidates, also calls for empowering rural communities to help combat climate change, by supporting R&D into soil carbon sequestration, providing incentives for farmers to conserve their land, and providing “resilience” grants to communities to help them prepare for climate-fueled weather disasters.
CLIMATE COMMITTEE REPUBLICANS HIRE ANALYST WHO CO-WROTE DISPUTED GREEN NEW DEAL STUDY: An analyst who co-authored a disputed study finding the Green New Deal would cost trillions of dollars is joining the Republican staff of the House’s climate change committee.
Philip Rossetti will work for Republicans on the Select Climate Crisis Committee, led by ranking member Garret Graves of Louisiana, as a fellow focused on energy and climate policy.
Rossetti was the director of energy policy at American Action Forum, a center-right group led by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Rossetti contributed to a study released by the think tank in February that claimed the bulk of the cost of the Green New Deal would come from its call for a federal job guarantee and universal healthcare.
Republicans in Congress quickly used the report as evidence of the Green New Deal being an overly expensive and broad method to combat climate change.
But Holtz-Eakin later said the often cited cost figure from the report — $93 trillion — did not actually appear anywhere in the text.
“Is it billions or trillions?” Holtz-Eakin told Politico. “Any precision past that is illusory."
Democrats say the report was misleading because it focused on the social proposals of the Green New Deal rather than the costs of transitioning to carbon-free power and transportation.

Texto completo: The New York Times demoted a top editor because of his controversial social media behavior.
"Jonathan Weisman met with [New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet] today and apologized for his recent serious lapses in judgment. As a consequence of his actions, he has been demoted and will no longer be overseeing the team that covers Congress or be active on social media. We don't typically discuss personnel matters but we're doing so in this instance with Jonathan's knowledge," a New York Times representative said.
An internal review began after Weisman, who was the deputy Washington editor, sent tweets that were widely viewed as racist and subject to strong backlash.
In late July, he asserted that Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar were not truly from the Midwest and John Lewis and Lloyd Doggett from the Deep South because they represent metropolitan areas. He deleted the tweet after critics said he was implying that people of color representing cities did not truly represent these regions.
Weisman again waded into controversy this month when he tweeted that liberal advocacy group Justice Democrats supported an Ohio primary challenger “seeking to unseat an African-American Democrat, Joyce Beatty, who represents Columbus.” That challenger, Morgan Harper, responded by saying, “I am also black.”
Roxane Gay, who is an author and Times contributing op-ed writer, issued a scalding rebuke that said, “Any time you think you’re unqualified for a job remember that this guy, telling a black woman she isn’t black because he looked at a picture and can’t see, has one of the most prestigious jobs in America. Shoot your shot.”
Gay later shared screenshots of emails Weisman sent to her and her publisher demanding an "enormous apology."
Tweet
Last week, a Times representative said Weisman "repeatedly displayed poor judgment on social media and in responding to criticism" and that the company was "closely examining what to do about it.”
Marc Tracy, a media reporter for the New York Times, said Weisman, "will be an editor in DC, but no longer overseeing Congressional correspondents, and no longer active on social media. Weisman has been contrite."
In what Tracy described as a brief interview, Weisman said, "I accept Dean’s judgment," referring to New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet. "I think he’s right to do what he’s doing. I embarrassed the newspaper, and he had to act," he added.

Texto completo: Scientists at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Va., were concerned when a young man contacted their department last year complaining of a heart-pounding, hallucinogenic high he had neither expected nor wanted to have.
The team, led by the forensic toxicologist Michelle R. Peace, had published a study about mysterious ingredients in vaping liquids. That's how the man, a graduate student Dr. Peace declined to name, knew to tell it about his experience.
He said he had vaped a liquid, from a company called Diamond CBD, that contained CBD, or cannabidiol. A compound reputed to have soothing properties, CBD has been marketed by the fast-growing cannabis industry as an ingredient in sleeping masks, kombucha, Carl's Jr. burgers and Martha Stewart-backed dog treats. It is not supposed to cause a psychoactive experience.
Dr. Peace decided to run some tests of Diamond CBD vaping liquids, some from the graduate student and some bought from the manufacturer. In four of nine samples, all marketed on the company's website as 100 percent natural, her lab discovered a synthetic compound, 5F-ADB. That ingredient has been linked by the Drug Enforcement Administration to anxiety, convulsions, psychosis, hospitalization and death.
Diamond CBD has often promoted its products as health aids meant to "help your body to heal and recover" and "to make you feel the best version of yourself." The company's parent, PotNetwork Holdings, said in a statement that independent tests did not show "any unnatural or improper derivative." The company said it planned to run more tests on its products and materials and would issue a recall if it found any problems.
The efforts of cannabis companies to go mainstream could be hampered by CBD advertising that depends on misleading or unproven claims, entrepreneurs and researchers said. Dr. Peace compared the marketing efforts of some companies to snake-oil scams in the 1800s, "when guys in wagons were selling sham tinctures in glass bottles."
"People are taking these products in good faith, because they believe somebody is overseeing the quality of these products," Dr. Peace said. "But there's basically nobody."
Hemp and marijuana are different varieties of the cannabis plant. Both produce chemicals known as cannabinoids, including CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, a psychoactive compound associated with a high.
CBD products derived from hemp are legal to possess under a new federal law, as long as they contain 0.3 percent THC or less. In marijuana, which is not legal in many states, the amount of THC tends to be greater.
But in the gray area between state and federal regulations, and in the shifting terminology used to describe (and sometimes conflate) cannabis, marijuana and hemp, dubious promotions have proliferated. Some brands have claimed that their CBD is "a lifesaver" and an "unbelievable cure." The Food and Drug Administration has warned companies to stop making "unfounded claims" that CBD can help treat cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, A.D.H.D. and opioid withdrawal.
Several tests have found mislabeled CBD products, some with more THC than is permitted. Companies have complained about competitors cloning their packaging and selling adulterated CBD products.
"This market was illegal for a long time," said Ann Skalski, a former executive at Saks Fifth Avenue who handles branding for Double Barrel, which recently marketed a $ 100,000 diamond-encrusted vaping device. "It might be hard for some of the players to change."
Cannabis products were once advertised via word of mouth or on stickers in bathroom stalls. Now, with growing support for legalization, cannabis ads have appeared in publications like The New York Times, which accepts advocacy ads on the issue of legalization.
Marketing professionals recruited from top agencies and luxury brands are working to drum up demand. Havas Creative Group, one of the largest advertising firms in the world, started a cannabis-focused offshoot in July. Within a decade, analysts expect Americans to spend more on cannabis than they currently do on their pets -- a figure that stands around $ 75 billion.
Retail companies have spent millions of dollars to dismantle the stereotype of dazed, joint-toting slackers. After running a "Forget Stoner" marketing campaign, the marijuana dispensary chain MedMen released a commercial this year, directed by the Oscar-winner Spike Jonze, called "The New Normal."
Some CBD products include a balm intended to soothe menstrual cramps, sold by Whoopi Goldberg's company. Gwyneth Paltrow's company, Goop, has promoted cannabis products in partnership with MedMen under the Wellness section of its site. Arizona Beverages, known for its iced teas, recently announced a partnership with Dixie Brands that could create THC-infused gummies and drinks. The message: Cannabis is as American as apple pie (a popular flavor for CBD-infused oils and tinctures, along with pumpkin spice).
Many companies are careful not to make unproven claims. But rules about marketing CBD and marijuana -- which vary from state to state based on what the products contain and how they are used -- are often confusing and difficult to enforce. Companies claiming to have a miracle elixir may face warnings but few serious repercussions.
"There are already 500 different products, and 5,000 around the corner, and we're doing nothing," said John Ayers, a computational epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego.
Mr. Ayers and two colleagues published a report this year accusing companies like MedMen of modeling their marketing campaigns after strategies used by the tobacco industry in the 1950s, including questionable health claims and techniques geared toward young consumers.
The researchers cited MedMen billboards with the slogan "Heal, it's legal," podcast advertisements promoting unnamed wellness treatments and a note on the company's website that it "cannot guarantee the accuracy of any marijuana information provided." MedMen's products included a high school varsity jacket emblazoned with a marijuana leaf, according to the report. MedMen declined to comment for this article.
As of July, more than 30 states allow medical marijuana, while more than 10 have legalized recreational marijuana. But the D.E.A. still considers it to be a Schedule 1 drug, in the same camp as heroin, ecstasy and LSD, and marijuana advertising is restricted.
The rules for CBD are different. Legislation passed last year removed some hemp-derived CBD from the federal government's list of controlled substances. But while the Food and Drug Administration warns that it remains illegal to market CBD as a dietary supplement or an ingredient in food and beverages, the agency has barely enforced the ban.
The agency is "using all available resources to monitor the marketplace" for deceptive advertising and is "working quickly to continue to clarify our regulatory authority" over cannabis products, said Amy Abernethy, the F.D.A.'s principal deputy commissioner, in a statement on Monday to The Times.
Since 2017, the F.D.A. has filed only nine warning letters against CBD companies. The agency "does not have the resources to go after all of the products," said Lisa M. Dwyer, a lawyer for the King & Spalding firm, who previously held advisory roles at the F.D.A.
Cannabis marketing has limited reach, at least for now. ABC declined to broadcast an ad from Lowell Herb Company, featuring the actress Bella Thorne, during the Oscars this year, the marijuana and hemp company said. The marijuana retailer Acreage offered to spend $ 5 million on a 60-second advocacy message during the Super Bowl, but CBS rejected the pitch, said Joen Choe, the company's vice president of marketing.
Paid advertising on Facebook and Google is also restricted, but many cannabis companies have still managed to promote themselves on social media. After Kim Kardashian threw a CBD-themed baby shower in April, her posts about the party most likely reached 12.3 million people, according to Captiv8, which connects brands with paid influencers.
"It's not always clear what the line is," said Taylor West, who handles cannabis clients for the communications firm Heart + Mind Media.
Some brands are going a different way, with ads critical of the hype. In July, CBDistillery unveiled seven billboards in Times Square that blasted brands trying to capitalize on the craze with products like CBD toilet paper and CBD condoms. The market is like the "Wild West," said Chris Van Dusen, the company's chief marketing officer.
"With the industry being so new, and there being so much confusion from the consumer side, companies selling gimmicky products aren't helping the industry's cause," he said.
At the same time, some CBD consumers continue to experience unexpected side effects. Dr. Peace, the toxicologist in Virginia, said that in recent months she had received dozens of messages, many of them "terrifying," from people worried that they had ingested adulterated CBD products.
"These aren't necessarily products being marketed and sold in sketchy shops," she said. "I've heard from, literally, little old ladies who walked in to their local pharmacy to purchase CBD products recommended to them."

Texto completo: Readers discuss a plan to deny green cards to those who are likely to require public assistance.
To the Editor:
Re "Policy Lets U.S. Reject the Poor for Green Cards" (front page, Aug. 13):
Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, claims that the administration's new "public charge rule" reinforces the ideals of self-sufficiency by ensuring that those seeking lawful permanent status "can stand on their own two feet."
This justification might seem rational if legal immigrants consumed the vast majority of public benefits, but they do not. The libertarian Cato Institute reported in 2018 that "immigrants are less likely to consume welfare benefits and, when they do, they generally consume a lower dollar value of benefits than native-born Americans."
In a nation in which immigrants constitute 17 percent of the work force, have a lower unemployment rate than native-born citizens and contribute billions to the economy every year, the new rule must be seen for what it really is: a racist assault on the country's most vulnerable residents -- low-income immigrant families -- that is meant to instill fear and undermine their access to the most basic health and social services.
For the sake of the economy, this is poor policy. For the sake of humanity, it's just cruel.
Elizabeth Arend
Washington
The writer works for the Primary Care Coalition in Montgomery County, Md., which provides services to low-income immigrants.
To the Editor:
People rarely decide to leave their home countries if they are comfortably situated. It is too hard to leave home, family, friends, culture and language unless there is a "push" factor like persecution, poverty, war or fear. These people, who need the chance to start anew, are the ones that the Trump administration's anti-immigrant fervor will seek to exclude by denying them permanent residency if they partake in public benefits.
Newcomers often need help to get their lives restarted and to get jobs. Now the proposed restriction of that help will doom them to permanent exclusion from a path to citizenship.
Not only does this draconian policy directly contradict the message inscribed on our Statue of Liberty, but it also raises uncomfortable connections to the past. In the 1930s and early '40s, as European Jews were seeking a safe place far from Nazi persecution, the State Department instructed American consulates to strictly enforce the LPC (likely to become a public charge) requirement.
Potential immigrants had to line up substantial commitments of support or sponsorship before their visa applications were granted. This requirement helped to serve the broader agenda of making it particularly difficult for Jews to immigrate. These Jews included my maternal grandparents, who were among the six million Jews the Nazis murdered.
While the situation then and now is not comparable in all aspects, it is a grim reminder of what hate of the other can mean.
Martha Holstein
Chicago
To the Editor:
What's wrong with an immigration policy that favors self-sufficient newcomers? These immigrants can contribute Day 1 versus newcomers who will need significant taxpayer assistance to get on their feet.
If money were free, if this country didn't have its own citizens who are poor and in need of public aid, no economic filter would be needed. But that's not the case.
Liberals who irresponsibly champion liberalism for its own sake, with no nod to practical matters, have led to Donald Trump in the White House. And may do it again.
Phoebe Huang
Stonington, Conn.
To the Editor:
This country welcomed my grandparents a century ago with almost no public assistance. Millions of us are offspring of ancestors who arrived very poor, getting support from relatives and private agencies, but little government help.
Should these new regulations take effect, I hope that warm hearts will do the same to help today's immigrants, undercutting the goal of these regulations.
Charles Merrill

To the Editor:
Now that President Trump has decided to reject poor immigrants, shouldn't he return the Statue of Liberty to the French?

Democrats Seek an Apt Retort; Republicans Tried Them All

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has called President Trump an "existential threat" to the nation.
Senator Kamala Harris has warned on the campaign trail that the president is a racist.
After the mass shooting in El Paso this month, in which a Texas man who confessed to killing 22 people echoed anti-immigrant language promulgated by Mr. Trump and right-wing media outlets, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, as well as former Representative Beto O'Rourke, escalated their verbal attacks on Mr. Trump, labeling him a "white supremacist."
Each contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination is trying to distinguish himself or herself as the strongest candidate to take on the president. In doing so, the candidates have been eager to be seen as speaking plain truth to what they frame as venal power on issues of race, character and everything else.
"Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax," Mr. Sanders wrote on Twitter over the weekend, while campaigning at the Iowa State Fair. "Donald Trump is an idiot."
But if the steady stream of ad hominem attacks is failing to shock, awe or drive the news, it is in part because there is little left in terms of criticism of Mr. Trump that has not already been volleyed -- by his own team.
In 2015, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, labeled Mr. Trump a "race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot" and called him the "ISIL man of the year," referring to the Islamic State. That was in addition to describing him as a "kook," "crazy" and a man who was "unfit for office."
Senator Ted Cruz, the second-to-last man left standing in the ugly 2016 Republican primary race, called Mr. Trump a "pathological liar" who was "utterly amoral," a "serial philanderer" and a "narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen."
Mick Mulvaney, the former Republican congressman who now serves as the president's acting chief of staff, in 2016 called him a "terrible human being" who had made "disgusting and indefensible" comments about women.
Revisiting the now hollow critiques from Mr. Trump's own party -- those Republicans have all embraced the president and his agenda, going on to serve in his administration or offer him support from Capitol Hill -- is raising questions about whether the search for a killer line on Mr. Trump is a fool's errand.
"Voters on the whole are completely desensitized to personal attacks on Trump at this point," said Tim Alberta, the author of "American Carnage: On the Front Lines of the Republican Civil War and the Rise of President Trump."
"Rick Perry called him a 'cancer' and then became a cabinet secretary," he said. "It's not like a swing voter in a battleground state will hear an ad hominem attack on him and suddenly think, 'I never thought of it that way."'
Mr. Alberta, who in researching his book spent time Monday-morning quarterbacking the 2016 election with many of the failed Republican candidates, said that "the unlearned lesson from 2016 for Republicans was that every day spent launching ad hominem attacks on Trump was a day not spent pointing to voters how little he knows about actually running the government."
While the attacks may help Democrats distinguish themselves from one another, they appear to have no effect on Mr. Trump's poll numbers, according to officials. Mr. Trump's internal approval ratings, a source familiar with the numbers said, have not shifted by more than 1 percent since April 2018, and hover between 43 and 45 percent.
"Everything is tribal at this point," said Brendan Buck, a former adviser to Paul Ryan, the former House speaker. "If you're with him, you're with him, in spite of or because of the way that he is." But Mr. Buck said that since 2016, there has been "slippage with women voters, suburban voters -- and I think some of it is related to his persona and the way he presents himself" and the character that Democrats are critiquing.
Trump campaign officials shrug off the race to be seen as the biggest Trump critic in the Democratic Party. They view it as an intraparty fight between candidates trying to raise small dollars and qualify for the next presidential debate, but they have tracked no negative effect on Mr. Trump's standing because of it.
And they have ignored the president's one Republican opponent, William F. Weld, the former Massachusetts governor waging the longest of long-shot Republican primary challenges, who also appears to be recycling the attacks that failed to stop Mr. Trump's capture of the party's nomination in 2016. "Donald Trump is a raging racist," Mr. Weld said last month. "He's a complete and thoroughgoing racist."
Mr. Trump, for his part, has bristled at being labeled a racist, but has not indicated to his allies or advisers that he intends to change his language or reach out to communities of color with a message of unity.
Democratic strategists, however, said there was a difference between a voter's expectations of a sitting president and a first-time candidate.
"Part of the reasons that voters in 2016 overlooked a lot of these same criticisms of Trump is that they hoped that his schtick was just a schtick," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. "It's possible these criticisms will be more meaningful because it's much harder to have the illusion that these character deficiencies aren't for real."
Mr. Garin, who worked for Ralph Northam in 2017 during Mr. Northam's Democratic primary race for governor of Virginia, said attacking Mr. Trump also helps centrist candidates prove themselves to progressive voters.
Mr. Northam's primary race opponent, former Representative Tom Perriello, challenged him from the left, Mr. Garin said, "but Ralph said in a commercial that Donald Trump is a narcissistic maniac."
"That's all that Democratic primary voters needed to hear to know he was in tune with them," he added.
Among the Democratic candidates for president, there is an awareness that Mr. Trump will always win in a game of diminishing nicknames and threatening speech. But many of them view it as a moral obligation to attach a label to him.
"At a time when the president's words are being weaponized by violent extremists, it's important to speak in direct terms about who he is," said Sawyer Hackett, the national press secretary for Julián Castro, a presidential candidate and former housing secretary. "He is a racist who fans the flames of white nationalism and white supremacy."

Texto completo: Reject Kalama proposal
My husband and I live on Kalama River Road, approximately five miles upstream from where Northwest Innovation Works proposes to build the world's largest methanol refinery to convert fracked gas for transport to China. The process would draw an estimated five million gallons of water from the Columbia and Kalama River aquifers each day. This week, the UN released a report warning that the world's land and water resources are being exploited at “unprecedented rates.” Do we really want to contribute to that by allowing China to manufacture more plastics?

Hold drivers responsible
On Aug. 3 on Highway 12 near Ethel, another motorcyclist was senselessly killed by a driver turning directly into his oncoming path. (“Longview motorcyclist killed in Saturday night crash near Ethel,” The Reflector, Aug. 5) This 28-year-old man, Derek Fanning, was killed in the prime of his life.
No charges or citations were filed immediately. Why not? This is negligent homicide at the least. Why isn't this the automatic charge when repeatedly motorcyclists are being randomly cut down on the roads by distracted, irresponsible drivers? Immediately cars should be impounded, cell phones confiscated, drivers arrested. How can we allow this to continue to happen with no repercussions? This slaughter isn't just local. Portland is a hotbed for riders being killed. Nationwide, drivers are failing their duties to properly look twice for motorcyclist.
Laws need to change. There are responsibilities that come with that set of car keys.

Put natural gas to work
In the early 1960s I moved to Los Angeles and wondered why all the oil wells were aflame. I was told they were burning off the natural gas by-product. Many Los Angeles taxis were experimenting with using natural gas, but I don't recall where that effort ended up.
Later I moved to Santa Fe, N.M., and, located in the Four Corners area near its northwest boundary was a huge coal burning power plant. The filth it spewed into the atmosphere was visible by our astronauts. Five years ago, as we drove through Wyoming we saw the same phenomenon, i.e., oil wells burning off the natural gas residue.
Over the years I've often wondered why this country doesn't use that natural gas to fuel our power plants — it's plentiful and easily captured and burns much cleaner than coal or oil. In fact, the night before Don Brunell's column (“Alternative to flaring natural gas,” July 30) appeared, my husband I were discussing this problem again. An incredible waste of an energy source that burns so much cleaner than any other fossil fuels, and we just keep polluting the environment by burning it. Truly ridiculous.
Thanks to Brunell for finally presenting this to the public.

Climate change requires big effort
The writer of “Act locally on climate change” (Our Readers' Views, July 21) says they're overwhelmed and want something to do locally to fight climate change. There is only one thing any individual can do about climate that will make a real difference: Vote. Vote for a new president and a new Congress, one that will make greenhouse gas emissions cuts that will get us at least close net-zero by 2030.
Local actions will have literally no effect, according to the world's scientific authorities on climate change (IPCC). These same climate scientists tell us we have only a decade left to phase out fossil fuels if we are to have any chance of avoiding “catastrophic” global warming (National Academy of Sciences).
Don't believe it? Read the first chapter of Uninhabitable Earth, the New York Times best-seller by Googling “PBS.org uninhabitable.” It begins, “It is worse, much worse, than you think,” and proceeds to produce the peer-reviewed scientific evidence to back up that statement, including what's already happening and what the science shows the future holds for us, according to whether we act nationally now or we don't.
From Forbes: “The Green New Deal is affordable; the cost of inaction is incalculable.”

Trump not good for America
In response to Robert Kerr (“Stand up for America,” Our Readers' Views, Aug. 1): Once again, I quote Albert Einstein, “Two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.” I find it astounding that 63 million of these humans put a pathological liar (10,000 documented and counting), racist (dissed a gold-star family that is Arab, bad-mouthed a judge with Mexican heritage, told four elected woman of color to go back to their countries, tried to block all Arabs from entering the U.S.), sexist (take too long to list the woman that have accused him, says its OK to grab a woman by the genitals), Russian asset (Putin told me he didn't interfere, so it must be true), Vietnam-era draft dodger in the oval office.
Kerr's letter says Trump walks the talk; let's see. Mexico will pay for the wall: how is that going? Trump conned farmers and auto workers for their votes, a lot of whom now face bankruptcy and unemployment. He promised a tax cut to the middle class, which we all know only benefitted the 1 percent. “Drain the swamp?” Wow, I didn't know it could get any bigger. I also say stand up for America, but not Trump's, or evidently Mr. Kerr's.
Once again, Trump's campaign slogan is “Make white America great again.”

Herrera Beutler ignores duty
Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler has disappointed me by not condemning the president's racism. She explained her action (or inaction) by saying “I will not be voting for the resolution because it further contributes to our country's racial division.” Why would she be afraid to cause division between the r

Texto completo: Austin-based Joust Labs, a startup that provides a banking platform for self-employed workers, said Monday that it has raised $2.6 million.
The "neo-bank," an alternative bank that offers digital financial services, said the latest funds would go toward helping the company expand its platform and reach more customers. Joust's customers include freelancers, entrepreneurs and small- to mid-sized companies.
PTB Ventures led the funding round. Accion Venture Lab, Financial Venture Studio and Techstars also joined the round.
"At Joust, we understand the growing market of self-employed workers, freelancers and small businesses, and their need for an all-in-one banking solution—especially one that gives them the same benefits enjoyed by major corporations," Joust CEO and founder Lamine Zarrad said in a written statement. "Our platform not only saves time, but also reduces uncertainty and mitigates the risk of late and non-payment."
The company offers users
financial services including a bank account and payments processing through a mobile platform. Joust has six full-time employees in Austin and plans to grow to 15 employees by the end of the year.
Dave Fields, founder and managing partner of PTB Ventures, said the company helps freelancers that require a narrowed focus in their banking tools.
“Freelancers require credit and banking products that mirror the user experience of the consumer market but the product sophistication of the small business market,” Fields said in a written statement. “Existing financial market infrastructure just isn’t built to provide this bundle. Through the use of contextual data and proprietary risk algorithms, Joust reduces the cost, complexity and risk of becoming a solopreneur.”
Neo-banks have become increasingly popular for venture capitalists. According to a New York Times report in November, American neo-banks received four times as much funding as they did in 2017. The data from CB Insights also showed that neo-bank funding in 2018 was 10 times as 2015.
And CB Insights found that in 2018, there were 1,700 financial tech deals worth nearly $40 billion.

New Punahou president focuses on students’ resilience

Texto completo: Punahou’s new president, Michael Latham, can see from his wood-paneled office the spot where his naval- officer father dropped him off as a 12-year-old for his first day of school.
“I can remember very clearly what it was like to be a brand-new Punahou student,” said Latham, who entered seventh grade in 1980. “It’s really quite moving, actually, for me to look and see that spot. … I was definitely nervous but also really excited and eager to dive in.”
As Punahou’s 3,750 students start school Wednesday, Latham will be at the helm, replacing Jim Scott, who retired after 25 years on the job. At 51, Latham left his post as vice president for academic affairs and dean of Grinnell College in Iowa to come home.
“I feel a really strong sense of gratitude to Punahou, and a big part of what drew me back was the sense that I have the opportunity to serve a school that made such a big difference for me,” said Latham, still lean like the long-distance runner he was in high school.
His talented teachers could have pursued remarkable careers in a range of fields, he said, but chose to work with students and became his role models. His mother’s commitment to her faculty and students as a counselor and principal in local public schools also inspired him.
Punahou experience
“It was at Punahou that I came to understand that the really important question for me was not just what I was good at, but really what I cared about, what mattered to me, what am I able to commit myself to,” said Latham, who graduated in 1986.
“I think for many students at a really competitive and high-performing school such as this one, there’s a lot of ‘How can I distinguish myself, where can I excel?’” he said. “I came to understand that wasn’t the really important question. The important question was really what were my values.”
One teacher who left a lasting impact on Latham was Jay Seidenstein, who taught Advanced Placement U.S. history with questions that centered on ethical issues and required reflection. Now retired, Seidenstein remembers those classroom discussions vividly.
“I taught at Punahou for 37 years, and in that time I’ve had many brilliant and talented students, but when asked to name my best student, I’ve never hesitated to name Mike,” Seidenstein told the Honolulu Star- Advertiser. “I was especially impressed with his almost unbelievably intelligent contributions to class discussions — he seemed to speak in carefully constructed and proofread paragraphs.”
“These were a bunch of really smart kids, and they were awed,” he recalled. “But not intimidated, because that was not Mike’s way. He had a genuine modesty, and he wanted to hear what the others in the class had to say.”
Latham earned his undergraduate degree at Pomona College and a doctorate in history at the University of California, Los Angeles. He joined Fordham University in the Bronx, N.Y., as a history professor, making a name as a history scholar and publishing two books, before shifting to college administration.
Listening to diverse points of view is something Latham sees as crucial in his new job as well as for any well-rounded education.
“It’s really engaging with multiple perspectives that allows us to solve problems more effectively,” he said in an interview. “This is really what the future market wants: people who work in teams with people of diverse backgrounds and experiences.”
Core academic goals
He highlights three core academic goals for Punahou students:
>> Instilling essential habits and skills for lifelong learning and adaptation.
>> Applying knowledge to concrete, real-world problems.
>> Helping students become resilient and able to navigate uncertainty.
The importance of that third component became evident to him in recent years at Grinnell College. Like Punahou, the liberal arts school selects top-notch students and covers their demonstrated financial need, so cost and academic rigor tend not to be big problems.
More often, if students ran into trouble or didn’t complete their degree, it had to do with “the area of social and emotional learning,” Latham said.
“Did the student feel like he or she belonged there?” he asked. “Did the student have the ability to manage the stress and anxiety of college life? Did the student have the ability to establish relationships and engage in activities that give them a sense of purpose? Oftentimes those variables are ones which I think many schools haven’t given enough attention to.”
Latham is a new Punahou parent himself, along with his wife, Jennifer, who will soon be ordained as an Episcopal priest after completing divinity school. His younger daughter is entering ninth grade at Punahou while his older daughter chose stay in Iowa for her last year of high school, much as he wanted her to try his alma mater.
He defines Punahou broadly as a “knowledge community” and sees it thriving when it casts its net broadly, forging external partnerships and even educating parents — including himself.
“The learning that takes place shouldn’t stop with our students,” he said. “Our faculty are learning; our administrators, I hope, are learning. So too should our parents and the wider community that we’re part of.”
Touching on parenting issues, he recalled a recent New York Times article that described “snowplow parents,” who cleared all possible obstacles from their children’s paths in an effort to help them succeed. As it turns out, that approach can handicap them instead.
One line that stuck with Latham was a quote from author Julie Lythcott-Haims, a former dean of freshmen at Stanford: “The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid.”

In Dead of Summer, The Mets Snap to Life

Texto completo: A month ago, the Mets weren't exactly at rock bottom, but they weren't far-off.
The manager had cursed out a reporter. The general manager, according to multiple news media accounts, had thrown a chair in a meeting.
At the All-Star break, the Mets had lost 10 of their last 14 games, were seven games out of the last wild card spot and had the second-worst record in the National League at 40-50. It seemed pretty likely the Mets players were going to be playing golf and hunting come Oct. 1.
But on Monday morning the Mets woke up one game out of the playoffs after a torrid month that few could have predicted. At the All-Star break, if you still believed in the Mets, you could get 325-1 for them to win the World Series, according to Sports Odds History. Now those odds are down to 36-1.
Here's what happened, as reflected in some New York Times headlines.
'The Mets at Midseason: Can They Dig Their Way Out?'
The Times asked this question on July 12, as the All-Star break ended. The bullpen was a mess. Pitching coach Dave Eiland and bullpen coach Chuck Hernandez had been fired. At least Pete Alonso had won the Home Run Derby.
One person was optimistic. "I feel like we can make a run at this thing," Manager Mickey Callaway said. "We can sneak into that wild-card."
That statement, which very likely caused puzzlement for all but the most deluded of Mets fans, might just turn out to be correct.
Since the break, the Mets are on an unexpected 21-7 run that includes seven- and eight-game winning streaks. (The team Mets fans love to hate, the Yankees, are only 20-10 over that period.) Now, at 61-57 with arguably the top pitching staff in baseball, the Mets are suddenly the team no one wants to face in a short series.
It started with a 4-1 stretch against the Marlins and Twins that included a 4-for-4 performance by Michael Conforto against Minnesota. The team then lost three of four to the Giants, but all the losses were by a single run. Maybe something was brewing.
'Mets Need to Take a Padres-Style Leap'
Heading into a series against San Diego with the trade deadline approaching, The Times suggested the Mets might take a page from their opponents' book and consider trading veterans for prospects. Perhaps Noah Syndergaard, the team's talismanic pitcher, might have to go in the fire sale.
But the Mets proceeded to take two of three from the Padres -- Robinson Cano rolled back the years with a three-homer game -- and sweep the Pirates. With things looking up, the Mets seemed to become buyers, not sellers, and landed the All-Star pitcher Marcus Stroman from the Blue Jays for two top prospects. It was all the sweeter for the Mets' fan base because of chatter that the Yankees were also interested in Stroman.
Almost immediately though, the signals became more mixed, when the Mets traded another starter, Jason Vargas, to the Phillies.
Most important though, the big names, like Syndergaard and Zack Wheeler, stayed put. Was it because the Mets believed in a turnaround? Or simply because they couldn't get the price they sought? Now, it hardly matters.
'Mets, After Vote of Confidence, Finish Sweep of White Sox'
As the trade deadline passed and the Mets players looked around and saw almost all their teammates were still in the locker room, the wins began to accumulate. A sweep of the contending White Sox made it seven in a row for the Mets. After the Sox, the Mets entered a stretch against the league's bottom-feeders, and proceeded to go 6-1 against the Pirates and Marlins. "If we keep rolling the way we are, we've got a really awesome chance to do something really special," Alonso said.
On Friday night, the Mets rallied from 6-3 in the bottom of the ninth to beat the Nationals in front of a reinvigorated Citi Field.
'As Wins Pile Up, Mets and Their Fans Soak in the Moment'
Oh, how the headlines have changed. The Mets finally lost on Sunday after eight wins in a row, but that wild card spot seems tantalizingly close.
Should they get the spot, the one-game playoff format may favor a team that can roll out Jacob deGrom (2.68 E.R.A.), the defending N.L. Cy Young Award winner, or Syndergaard as the starter.
The improvements seem to be coming from all over. The relievers appear to be coming around. Alonso, Conforto, Jeff McNeil and J.D. Davis are all consistent batting threats. The hiring of an 82-year-old, Phil Regan, as pitching coach could have looked eccentric if the team had slumped. Instead, it seems inspired. An outside-the-box suggestion by the hitting coach Chili Davis to move the batting tee a few inches seems to be what Conforto needed.
The Mets have benefited also from playing in a league that looks pretty flabby behind the elite teams like the Dodgers, Braves and Cubs.
Running down the Nationals? The Cardinals? The Brewers? That sounds far less daunting.
Beginning Tuesday night in Atlanta, site of so much Mets heartbreak a generation ago, it gets real. The Mets' run has been helped by a combined 11-2 record against the cellar-dwelling Marlins and Pirates. But 12 of the next 15 games are against the Braves, Indians and Cubs.
The Mets may yet be free for hunting and golf come October, but at least the next six weeks look like they will be very interesting.
"We've got a long way to go," Conforto said. "We're not even halfway through August."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — It was Friday night in a protective housing unit of the federal jail in lower Manhattan, and Jeffrey Epstein, the financier accused of trafficking girls for sex, was alone in a cell, only 11 days after he had been taken off a suicide watch.
Just that morning, thousands of documents from a civil suit had been released, providing lurid accounts accusing Epstein of sexually abusing scores of girls.
Epstein was supposed to have been checked by the two guards in the protective housing unit every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not followed that night, a law enforcement official with knowledge of his detention said.
In addition, because Epstein may have tried to kill himself three weeks earlier, he was supposed to have had another inmate in his cell, three officials said. But the jail had recently transferred his cellmate and allowed Epstein to be housed alone, a decision that also violated the jail’s procedures, the two officials said.
At 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, guards doing morning rounds found him dead in his cell. Epstein, 66, had apparently hanged himself.
The disclosures about these seeming failures in Epstein’s detention at the Metropolitan Correctional Center deepened questions about his death and are very likely to be the focus of inquiries by the Justice Department and the FBI.
Officials cautioned that their initial findings about his detention were preliminary and could change.
The federal Bureau of Prisons has already come under intense criticism for not keeping Epstein under a suicide watch after he had been found in his cell on July 23 with injuries that suggested he had tried to kill himself.
The law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said that when the decision was made to remove Epstein from suicide watch, the jail informed the Justice Department that Epstein would have a cellmate and that a guard “would look into his cell” every 30 minutes.
But that was apparently not done, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the death was still under investigation.
The city’s chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, announced Sunday night that her office had conducted an autopsy of Epstein, but she declined to release a determination about the cause of death.
She said a private pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden, who was hired by Epstein’s lawyers, had observed the autopsy examination.
The medical examiner is confident the cause of death is suicide by hanging, but she wants more information from law enforcement before releasing her determination, a city official said.
Senior law enforcement officials, members of Congress and Epstein’s accusers have all demanded answers about why Epstein was not being more closely monitored. On Sunday, the Bureau of Prisons offered no explanation for why Epstein was left alone and not checked on.
Epstein’s death has also unleashed a torrent of unfounded conspiracy theories online, with people suggesting, without evidence, that Epstein was killed to keep him from incriminating others.
Over the years, Epstein’s social circle had included dozens of well-known politicians, business executives, scientists, academics and other notables, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew of Britain and Leslie H. Wexner, the retail billionaire behind Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works.
Investigators are expected to focus intensely on the timeline of what happened in the period after Epstein was found semiconscious less than three weeks ago in a shared cell, with bruises on his neck, after a judge denied him bail.
He was placed on a 24-hour suicide watch and received daily psychiatric evaluations, the law enforcement official said.
But six days later, prison officials determined he was no longer a threat to his own life and put him in a cell in the protective housing unit with another inmate, a prison official familiar with the incident said.
It is standard practice at the Metropolitan Correctional Center to place people who have been on suicide watch with a cellmate, two people with knowledge of Epstein’s case said. The theory is a cellmate can provide company to someone who may be suicidal, helping them stave off depression, and can also alert guards in an emergency.
But Epstein’s cellmate was moved out of the protective housing unit, leaving him alone, the prison official said.
Bureau of Prison officials said it is standard procedure for guards in protective housing units to check on inmates every half-hour.
It remained unclear why that procedure was not followed in Epstein’s case. Like many federal prisons and detention centers, the jail has been short staffed for some time, union leaders have said.
The two guards on duty in the protective housing unit where Epstein was housed were both working overtime, the prison official with knowledge of the incident said.
One of the corrections officers was working his fifth straight day of overtime, while the other officer had been forced to work overtime, the official said.
Eric Young, president of the national council of union locals that represents guards at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, said there were cameras in hallways and common areas, but not in the cells of the unit where Epstein was being held.
“From the moment you walk onto that property, you are under camera surveillance,” Young said, adding that there should be video evidence of when the last checks were made and of anyone who approached Epstein’s cell.
Young said overnight checks in the protective unit are typically done every 30 minutes, but sometimes the schedule varies a bit, so that inmates cannot precisely predict when guards will come by their cells.
Young would not discuss whether the two guards on duty at the time of Epstein’s death were doing regular checks on him.
But Young said he was certain that Epstein was in the cell alone — and nearly certain Epstein had a cellmate after he was removed from suicide watch.
“I can tell you it is unequivocal that he was in a cell by himself,” Young said. “I can tell you Epstein didn’t have anyone in the room with him when he committed suicide.”
Built in 1975, the Metropolitan Correctional Center is an imposing 12-story brick building at 150 Park Row, a stone’s throw from the two federal courthouses in lower Manhattan. It holds about 800 people in 10 housing units, most of them awaiting trial or sentencing.
Some of its wings — notably the 10 South special housing unit — have severe security measures, and have housed high-profile defendants over the years, among them Gambino boss John Gotti, terrorist Ramzi Yousef and Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo.
An investigation by The New York Times last year showed that federal prisons across the country, including the Metropolitan Correctional Center, have been dealing with rising violence as staffing at the centers has dwindled.
Questions about the safety of such prisons arose late last year when James (Whitey) Bulger, the notorious Boston gangster, was brutally murdered in a West Virginia prison shortly after being moved there.
Cameron Lindsay, a former warden at the federal jail in Brooklyn and four other centers, said senior officials at the MCC made a series of mistakes in handling Epstein.
Lindsay said Epstein should not have been taken off suicide watch, even if the prison’s chief psychologist had determined it was safe to do so. With a high-profile inmate, the warden should have erred on the side of caution and kept him under close surveillance, separate from other inmates, Lindsay said.
“A psychologist is going to think one way, but a warden needs to think a different way,” he said. “You have to take the conservative, safe route and keep an individual like this on suicide watch.”
Lindsay pointed out that Epstein was also at risk to be attacked by other inmates because of the nature of the allegations against him. “In the subculture of prisons, it’s a badge of honor to take someone out like that,” he said.
Other former prison officials also questioned the jail’s decision to put Epstein on suicide watch for such a short period of time.
Though it is not uncommon for an inmate to be on suicide watch for less than a week, that is typically done in cases when an inmate receives bad news in court or from family — not soon after a suicide attempt, said Bob Hood, a former chief of internal affairs for the Bureau of Prisons.
In Epstein’s case, not only did he apparently attempt suicide on July 23, but humiliating information continued to be released to the public through news outlets, Hood said. That would normally have prompted prison officials to keep him under closer surveillance, not remove him from the 24-hour-a-day suicide watch, he said.
“Why he was taken off suicide watch is beyond me,” Hood said. He added, “A man is dead. The Bureau of Prisons dropped the ball. Period.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump tweaked Russia on Monday over a mysterious explosion he said was tied to a nuclear-powered missile that Moscow officials have described as a new class of weapon.
The blast occurred Thursday on a platform in the White Sea off Nyonoksa and reportedly caused a radiation spike in Severodvinsk. Weapons experts said they believe the explosion is related to a new missile Russia is developing that is powered by a nuclear reactor and intended to evade U. S. missile defense systems.
"The United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia," Trump tweeted Monday, marking the first time a U. S. official has weighed in on the blast. "We have similar, though more advanced, technology. The Russian 'Skyfall' explosion has people worried about the air around the facility, and far beyond. Not good!"
Trump did not provide specifics about what intelligence agencies had gleaned from the explosion. The New York Times reported that U. S. intelligence officials believe the incident may have involved a failure with the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, a new class of missile.
Russia's response to the incident has drawn comparisons to the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, though the explosion appears to be smaller in scope.
Blast: Deadly explosion at Russian test site involved nuclear power source, reports say
Trump's Monday tweet came after the U. S. walked away this year from a nuclear weapons treaty signed by President Ronald Reagan and then-Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. The U. S. has long argued that Russia was violating the terms of that agreement, and Trump has said he wants a new deal that would include Russia and China.

Texto completo: INDIANAPOLIS – Exodus Refugee in Indianapolis is bracing for the possibility the Trump administration will lower the number of refugees allowed annually into the United States to 10,000 or possibly even zero.
Administration officials have said they want to redirect some federal refugee funding toward processing asylum claims on the border.
Many refugee advocates, including Exodus Executive Director Cole Varga, disagree with this either-or policy and hope the refugee cap at least stays the same.
"In a best case scenario, it holds steady at 30,000," Varga said. "Even that is an awful response to a global crisis."
Politico reported in July discussions among Trump advisers of lowering the cap. A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services representative suggested a zero cap while officials from Homeland Security Department suggested a number between 3,000 and 10,000.
The Trump administration already reduced the cap from 110,000 under President Barack Obama to 45,000 in fiscal year 2018 and 30,000 this fiscal year. A finalized cap for federal fiscal year 2020 should be released before it starts Oct. 1.
How refugee groups are funded Varga said if the number is further reduced, the action wouldn't just leave stranded tens of thousands of refugees abroad who are done or nearly done with the U.S. screening process.
It also would mean financial trouble for resettlement reorganizations who help new arrivals and refugees already here. Much of these organizations' budgets come from federal funding based on the number of refugees they resettle.
Exodus was forced to cut about one-third of its staff in 2017 after the initial cap reduction.
Varga said Exodus does have other sources of funding and has fared better than other organizations across the country, though, some of which have been forced to shut down.
Although the number of refugees Exodus settled dropped from 947 in 2016 to 323 so far this fiscal year, Indianapolis benefits from having large established Burmese and Congolese populations that grow as family and friends of current residents arrive.
"We're in better shape than a lot of places because we have a large Burmese population and Congolese population," Varga said. "We haven't felt as drastic a decrease as a lot of offices."
Trump's focus on the border Ken Cuccinelli, acting U.S. citizenship and immigration services director, said in an Aug. 1 CNN interview the administration wants to keep the number for refugee admissions low so funds can be redistributed to handle the administrative backlog of asylum cases from the border.
"I'd like to see us have a number low enough so we can handle asylum claims," Cuccinelli said.
A similar reasoning was given for the last cap reduction. In September 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said lowering the refugee cap to 30,000 was not a "barometer of America's commitment to vulnerable people around the world" but reflected the "greater public expense" of processing an increased number of asylum seekers, according to a report in the New York Times.

Lana Del Rey, 'Looking for America'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Written on Monday, teased with a snippet on Instagram that same day, and then released in full on Friday, Lana Del Rey's "Looking for America" is a rapid-response protest song -- following a slew of mass shootings -- from an artist whose tortured relationship to an idealized America has always been central to her persona. "Pulled over to watch the children in the park/We used to only worry for them after dark," she sings, lightly vibrating with anger. What makes this protest so striking is that Del Rey sings about the country's fall from grace ("I'm still looking for my own version of America/One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly") with a convincing wistfulness, the sort that jingoists think is all their own. JON CARAMANICA
Alessia Cara, 'Rooting for You'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
More of Alessia Cara's voice unimpeded, please. "Rooting for You" is lilting and pleasant, a light vamp with some Huey Lewis-era digitized saxophone jammed in the middle. Cara has an exemplary voice, and she doesn't have to push hard to extract meaning. "Now I see you're having so much fun/with everyone/you had so much fun making fun of," she sings almost tenderly, as the sarcasm drips off like grease. CARAMANICA
Megan Thee Stallion featuring Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla Sign, 'Hot Girl Summer'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Meme first, song second is perhaps the wrong order. The pressure to make "Hot Girl Summer" -- the new track from Megan Thee Stallion, following her coining and popularizing the titular phrase -- a special event may have been too strong. Certainly she didn't need Ty Dolla Sign (not by any metric a hot girl) singing about his own pleasure to begin the song. And while the team-up with Nicki Minaj is inspired -- Megan is assertive and plain-spoken, Minaj is jubilant -- the production is bizarrely downcast. It's a missed opportunity, lacking the exuberance of the phrase, the sentiment, the meme and, ultimately, the summer. CARAMANICA
PJ Morton, 'Kid Again'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"You don't need to give up, that's the beginning of the end," PJ Morton sings, a chorus of falsetto harmonies flickering around him. "You just need to believe like a kid again." Morton is a New Orleans-born virtuoso who plays in Maroon 5, and in his own work he runs the influences of Allen Toussaint and Stevie Wonder through a bevy of ideas from R&B's more recent decades. All the while he's leaning hard on his buttery, heartfelt singing voice and masterful studio chops. On "Kid Again," with a repetitive chord progression wrapping its arms around him, he insists on idealism and innocence, things that feel like precious commodities today: "You don't need to grow up/You just need to believe like a kid again." GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
Chastity Belt, 'Elena'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Lydia Lund and Julia Shapiro's vocals wind around each other, buffer each other, underscore each other as they sing about a boyfriend who was hardly worth the trouble: "His only intrigue was the lack of him/Fill in the blanks with what you see fit." The Seattle band's new self-titled album is due in September. CARYN GANZ
Bas featuring Ari Lennox and Kiddominant, 'Amnesia'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
An unexpectedly seamless blend of euphoric Afrobeats, spacey R&B, melancholy post-Drake pop and straight-talk rapping. CARAMANICA
Stephen Mallinder, 'Working (You Are)'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Stephen Mallinder of the English post-punk provocateurs Cabaret Voltaire will release his first solo album in 35 years, "Um Dada," in October. Its leadoff track, the groovy curio "Working (You Are)" is a delightful companion to Marie Davidson's pointier "Work It" from last year, introducing and then quickly retracting a series of ear-pleasing, familiar dance-music flourishes. In a statement announcing his return, Mallinder wrote of a "false nostalgia about the analogue past," and concluded: "Let the machines talk to each other, let them dance ... they lead, we follow." GANZ
Grade 2, 'Graveyard Island'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The English punks in Grade 2 come through with a super-catchy blast of rebellion rock with "Graveyard Island" from their Hellcat debut, produced by Rancid's Tim Armstrong: "We see it now/it's smoke and mirrors/our broken future couldn't be any clearer." GANZ
Mike Holober Gotham Jazz Orchestra, 'Jumble'
At the outset of this 14-minute track, which opens the Gotham Jazz Orchestra's fine new album, "Hiding Out," a quietly suspenseful melodic theme is passed around between flutes and muted brass and cooled-down saxophones. A bass line creeps upward, starting to bring a Brazilian maracatu rhythm to life below. Mike Holober's woven composition unfolds across various movements, kicking up dust as it goes along; toward the end, after a snaky, scorching guitar solo from Jesse Lewis, the whole band piles in together, and the rambunctious energy of a street parade -- or just a lively city block, on any day of the year -- spills forth. RUSSONELLO

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Not long before Christmas 2012, Paul Manafort, then a foreign lobbyist, congratulated Gregory B. Craig, a well-known Washington lawyer, on the release of a report that Mr. Manafort had commissioned to help Ukraine's pro-Russian president polish his image in the West.
"Well done," Mr. Manafort wrote in an email to Mr. Craig after the lawyer had briefed American journalists on the report, which largely justified the criminal prosecution of the Ukrainian leader's political rival.
Government officials in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, "are especially happy with the way the media is playing it," Mr. Manafort wrote, later adding, "You are 'THE MAN."'
"I am glad it went so well," Mr. Craig replied.
Seven years later, that email exchange will be evidence in a criminal trial that has shaken Washington's lobbying, consulting and public relations industry to its core. Mr. Craig, 74, is charged with deceiving Justice Department officials who sought to determine whether he should have registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, commonly known as FARA, for work that earned his law firm more than $ 4.6 million.
His trial, which starts Monday and is expected to last about two weeks, is widely viewed as a litmus test of the Justice Department's growing effort to hold more foreign lobbyists criminally responsible for conduct the agency once treated as mere administrative infractions. Although Mr. Craig is charged with lying to federal law enforcement officials -- not for failing to register as a foreign agent -- defense lawyers said his indictment signified a sea change in the Justice Department toward those who failed to disclose their foreign lobbying work.
"The fact that there is a Greg Craig trial shows how much the atmosphere has changed," said Matthew T. Sanderson, a defense lawyer who specializes in foreign lobbying cases at the law firm of Caplin and Drysdale. "The Justice Department is going after some high-profile scalps."
In a video posted on YouTube after his indictment, Mr. Craig predicted he would be exonerated at trial. "I did not participate in a scheme to mislead the government or conceal material facts," he said. "This prosecution is unprecedented and unjustified. I am confident that both the judge and the jury will agree with me."
If convicted, Mr. Craig faces up to five years in prison, although recent defendants charged with the same offense have been sentenced to from two weeks to a month behind bars.
In the past two years, almost all of the high-profile cases against unregistered foreign agents sprang from the investigation by the former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian influence on the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Mueller's team convicted three former aides to Mr. Trump of crimes that encompassed FARA violations: Mr. Manafort, who served as Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign manager; Rick Gates, the former deputy campaign manager; and Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump's first national security adviser.
But when the special counsel's office closed up shop in May, the Justice Department signaled that its scrutiny of foreign lobbyists would continue. The department put one of Mr. Mueller's prosecutors, Brandon L. Van Grack, in charge of a revamped FARA unit, declaring that the foreign lobbying disclosure act was "increasingly an enforcement priority."
How far the prosecutors can push the once-obscure, 81-year-old statute is an open question.
Critics claim that the statute is as vague as it is broad, a problem already evident in the case against Mr. Craig, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Days before his trial was to begin, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed one of two counts of false statements against Mr. Craig, saying the language of the FARA statute was too ambiguous to justify it.
The department's enforcement drive is also hampered by a vast exemption for lobbyists who are paid by foreign commercial entities, even though business leaders are often stand-ins for foreign government officials who will pay millions to lobbyists to promote their interests in the West.
On the other hand, prosecutors often have an advantage in the courtroom when FARA cases make it that far. Juries are typically unsympathetic to consultants, lobbyists and lawyers who enrich themselves by working for a foreign power but hide their work from their own government. "It is hard to feel sorry for that cohort of people," said Mr. Sanderson, the defense lawyer.
Consider the most recent case: the prosecution of Bijan Kian, who was accused of failing to disclose lobbying work for the Turkish government. Mr. Kian is a former business partner of Mr. Flynn, the former national security adviser who is awaiting sentencing on charges of filing false documents to Justice Department officials about the Turkish lobbying work, as well as lying to F.B.I. investigators about a different matter.
The federal judge who presided over the trial complained that the evidence against Mr. Kian, who also goes by the name Bijan Rafiekian, was "very, very circumstantial."
Jurors nevertheless deliberated only five hours before finding him guilty last month of working as an unregistered foreign agent and conspiring to violate FARA, including by submitting false documents. Whether the judge upholds that verdict or throws it out will help define the legal parameters of the department's new enforcement effort.
Mr. Craig's trial will focus on a now familiar narrative of how Mr. Manafort led a far-flung effort to burnish the reputation of Viktor F. Yanukovych, who served as Ukraine's president from 2010 to 2014. Mr. Manafort is now serving a seven-and-a-half-year prison term for conspiracy and financial crimes, including some stemming from that work.
Seeking to shore up Mr. Yanukovych's image in the West, Mr. Manafort recruited Mr. Craig's law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, to produce a report on the corruption case against a political rival of Mr. Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko.
According to the indictment charging Mr. Craig, he wrote a memo for his own files stating that the evidence of Ms. Tymoshenko's criminal intent was "virtually nonexistent." But the report he spearheaded found that the evidence presented at her trial supported the conviction that led to her imprisonment.
The reaction of American journalists to the Skadden Arps report was of intense interest to Mr. Manafort, to public relations officials hired to spin the report's conclusions, and to Mr. Craig, prosecutors say. Following a carefully calculated news media strategy, Mr. Craig delivered an advance copy to The New York Times and volunteered to be interviewed by Times reporters, court filings show.
After the report's publication in December 2012, Justice officials asked Mr. Craig a series of questions, including how much the law firm had been paid and whether the firm's lawyers had discussed it with journalists.
Mr. Craig insisted that he had discussed the document with journalists only after it had become public and purely to "correct misinformation," according to court filings. He did not indicate that the law firm had been paid more than $ 4 million by a Ukrainian oligarch, whose funds were routed through offshore accounts, disclosing only a fraction of the firm's payments, prosecutors claim.
Although Mr. Craig was well aware of FARA's requirements, prosecutors say, he misled the Justice Department officials because he did not want to limit his future career prospects by registering as a foreign agent. They claim he repeated some of his misleading statements to the special counsel's team, as well.
The government's witness list includes Mr. Craig's own former law partners. In January, the firm agreed to pay the Justice Department $ 4,657,568.91 to settle an investigation into FARA violations.
That amount represents precisely what it was paid for its Ukraine report.

Texto completo: Welcome to the Smarter Living newsletter! Every Monday, Tim Herrera emails readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.
It's an inevitable part of having a job: At some point we all feel a little uninspired. Maybe you're not crazy about a new project, or you just can't pump yourself up to finish something that's been dragging on, but you know when the feeling hits, and it can feel like a block on your ability to get things done.
And that's O.K.! It's generally a solvable problem, and it's rarely the end-of-the-world scenario it can sometimes feel like.
"Often people lose motivation because they no longer find their work meaningful, and that can take many forms," said Liz Fosslien, co-author of "No Hard Feelings," which looks at how emotions affect our work lives. "It could be that you've lost sight of the impact your work has on the broader world."
Losing that spark can hit at any time, added Mollie West Duffy, the other co-author of "No Hard Feelings," and sometimes you might not even realize you're in that slump until it's pointed out to you.
"I think it can be a slow progression," Ms. West Duffy said. "It's sort of like the boiling frog, it slowly starts getting more and more distracting to you, and you might not realize it."
Feeling uninspired or unmotivated can sometimes -- though not always -- lead to burnout, and the overlap in symptoms is clear: It's that "blah" feeling when you approach your job or a task, or the feeling of just being stuck in a rut. It can sometimes be hard to pinpoint or recognize that you're in a slump, but it's quite common among American workers: One study from 2018, found that one in five highly engaged employees is at risk of burnout.
So if burnout is an endpoint that can result in deep job dissatisfaction and unhappiness, the road there is a slippery slope of a lack of inspiration. But there are ways to counter it.
One of the most common sources of lowered motivation at work is what Harvard researchers called the progress principle, which is the idea that making progress in meaningful work is the "single most important factor" in boosting one's "emotions, motivation, and perceptions during a workday."
"Often you're not motivated because your goal is too big," Ms. Fosslien said. "So if you can just break that into mini-milestones -- like what are you going to do today that you can cross at the end of today?"
Even tiny units of progress, like sending an email you've been meaning to write forever, can contribute to a sense of accomplishment, which can boost your overall motivation, Ms. Fosslien said.
But ticking items off your to-do list can take you only so far if you're in a spiral of a lack of inspiration. Focusing on your relationships, instead of your actual work, can remind you of the impact you have.
"Take note of how your work has impact on the people at the company you work with. There's not always external impact, but there's internal impact," Ms. Fosslien said.
One technique she has found success with is to take a timeout during the day and write down three ways your work has helped your colleagues. These small moments can help to put you in the mindset of remembering that even if you're dealing with a lack of motivation, you can still help those around you.
"Anywhere you can look for little reminders of the impact that your work has, whether it's your colleagues, the people your company impacts or the people affected by your personal projects," Ms. Fosslien said.
Indeed, fostering those relationships can often be the motivation you're looking for: Research has shown that motivation at work often comes from working with people you care about, and people with friends at work tend to find their jobs more satisfying. According to a 2018 poll from Gallup, "When employees possess a deep sense of affiliation with their team members, they are driven to take positive actions that benefit the business -- actions they may not otherwise even consider if they did not have strong relationships with their co-workers."
But when all else fails and you just can't find that spark of inspiration, fall back on a tried-and-true strategy: Take a little time away from your job.
"Often when work is negative it's because you're working too much and it's taking over our mental capacity," Ms. West Duffy said. "Remember that work doesn't define you, and it's only a part of you."
Added Ms. Fosslien: "When it feels really bad it's the hardest time to do it, but it's also the most important time to seek out something not work-related that brings you joy."
She added: "Keep doing the things that bring you lightness."
Thanks, have a great week!

Tip of the Week
This week I've invited Lisa Rabasca Roepe , a writer in Washington, D.C., to tell us why we should probably tidy up our desk.
If you're like most people, your desk is littered with papers, tchotchkes and file folders.
But a cluttered desk can undermine our ability to solve a difficult task, according to a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research. Students working at a tidy desk were willing to spend nearly 7.5 more minutes trying to solve a puzzle compared to students working at a cluttered desk.
"You should only have the things you use every day on your desk," said Donna Smallin, organizing expert and author of "Clear the Clutter, Find Happiness: One-Minute Tips for Decluttering and Refreshing Your Home and Your Life."
Everything else should be stored somewhere else, she said: a desk drawer for items you use everyday, a shelf for any reference materials or a cabinet for files and supplies.
The easiest way to tackle that pile of papers in the corner of your desk, according to Ms. Smallin, is to flip it over and start at the bottom, because those papers are outdated and it will be easier to release them.
Not sure whether to keep it? If you don't need it for legal or financial reasons, toss it, Ms. Smallin said. And if you must keep it, scan it. Our friends at Wirecutter -- a New York Times company that reviews products -- recommend the smartphone app Scanbot for all your scanning needs.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Edmonds: Left wants media to report agenda instead of the news

Texto completo: It has been more than a week since the terrible murders in Texas and Ohio. And over this time, while normal Americans grieved the loss of life, we have had to watch some pretty nasty political posturing.
We have seen Democratic presidential candidates accusing the president of being a white nationalist while TV hosts like John Oliver bolstered that agenda by accusing the President of “creating an environment” that allows the growth of “white nationalism and anti-immigrant rhetoric.”
See how he combined white nationalism with anyone who does not support unlimited immigration? As if they are one and the same. They are not. But leftists want them to be because it furthers their agenda. So, they use these national tragedies to gin up outrage, throwing baseless accusations at their opponents. But in doing this they continue to create more and more anxiety for their followers toward their fellow man, rising tensions and generating an unhinged reaction from their base.
All of this is not good for our country.
An incident with the New York Times illustrates how unhinged the left is becoming in their desire to further their rhetoric.
The day after the president spoke about the mass murders, headlines across the country summed up his brief comments in eight words or less. Some got it right, some got it wrong and some followed the agenda. One, however, got the headline right but the agenda wrong. And boy did the left go crazy.
The New York Times, previewing its morning edition on Twitter, showed its headline as “Trump Urges Unity VS. Racism” and was instantly excoriated on Twitter by regular subscribers, democratic presidential candidates and fellow journalists.
Let me give you a few examples (the ones clean enough to share) of the meltdown. First, we have John Weaver, who says he’s a Bush, McCain, Kasich strategist and an NBS, MSNBC analyst. Mr. Weaver tweeted, “I rely on the New York Times reporting. And respect them. But I’m cancelling my subscription and urge others to do the same. The management decision to reward this racist with a headline is too much. We must confront this at every level.”
James R. Dissent, also on Twitter, tweeted: “Last straw. I’m unsubscribing. Taking out new subscription to Washington Post. Same reporting reach and less of a shameless Trump rag. Thanks for making my decision easy.”
Oliver Willis, a member of Shareblue Media, a self-proclaimed progressive news platform inflammatorily tweeted, “the new york times wants us dead. because that’s the only reason you’d watch that racist slime squish his way through this and come up with that headline. prove me wrong.”
Democratic candidate Beto O’Rourke, who had in an earlier interview said dismissively it “cannot be open for debate” that Trump is a white nationalist, tweeted about the New York Times headline saying, “Unbelievable.”
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, “Let this front page serve as a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by – and often relies upon – the cowardice of mainstream institutions.”
Upping the ante, Democratic candidate Sen. Cory Booker tweeted, “Lives literally depend on you doing better, NYT. Please do.”
All of this hysteria because the New York Times wrote a headline accurately describing the President’s brief comments where he said, “In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy – these sinister ideologies must be defeated.”
Because what they really wanted was a headline that would soothe their rattled nerves by affirming everything they have been told to believe about the President; that he is a white nationalist, that the NRA kills people, and that their agenda (like the kind in Baltimore and Chicago) save lives. And they want every institution they worship – government and the media – to never, ever, ever remind them they just might be wrong. The New York Times committed the grievous offense of doing just that, at least until they ran a second edition of the same paper and changed their headline to “Assailing Hate But Not Guns.” (Because virtue signaling the “evils” of guns is totally woke, right?)
But the response to the new, more woke headline?
More outrage and anger. It still wasn’t aligned to their agenda, as broadcast journalist of CNN and Al Jazeera fame Soledad O’Brien tweeted the New York Times print editor Tom Jolly: “you seem like a nice guy. That headline is not good. Not accurate. Not contextual. It’s just wrong and the grey Lady should be ashamed of printing this crap. The President does not, in fact, assail hate. He fans the flames and inspires white supremacists. Do. Better.”
Got that, New York Times? The president inspires white supremacists! You have your marching orders. Don’t report the news, report the agenda.
Poor New York Times. It’s tough to get it right with an increasingly unhinged leftist subscriber base.

Bulletproof backpacks are the back-to-school rage

Texto completo: Headnote Mass shootings have families on edge
Before his fieshman year at the University of Connecticut, J.T. Lewis received an unusual gift from his mother: a bulletproof backpack.
Lewis, who will be a sophomore at the university comes from a family shattered by gun violence: His younger brother, Jesse, was killed in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
When his mother, Scarlett, gave him the dark-gray backpack, he said, she did not have to say a word.
"We just had a mutual understanding," said Lewis, 19, who is running for a seat in the Connecticut state Senate.
Now he wears the armored backpack on campus because it makes him feel safer, even if it means he sweats a little more under the bulky load.
"I don't know if it's going to have any effect," Lewis said. "But it might if I get shot from behind."
As mass shootings become a tragic fact of life in the United States - at schools, stores, movies theaters and houses of worship - it's not just the families of victims who are investing in protective gear.
In a dystopian development, a growing number of companies are offering bulletproof backpacks in back-to-school sales, marketing them to parents who are desperate to protect their children from gunmen.
"It's incredibly depressing," said Igor Volsky, the director of Guns Down America, a gun-control advocacy group. "The market is trying to solve for a problem that our politicians have refused to solve."
Demand for bulletproof backpacks surged after the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018. With back-to-school season approaching, the shootings this weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, have brought renewed attention to the products.
In the past, some stores have reportedly sold out of the backpacks, which typically cost $100 to $200. Months before the Parkland shooting, a private Christian school in Miami sold protective panels that could be inserted into backpacks, charging $120 for the bulletproof shields.
This year, ArmorMe, a personal-defense company run by a former Israeli commando, Gabi Siboni, started selling a bulletproof backpack that can unfold into a larger covering.
"The backpack is designed first of all to be a very stylish and nice-looking backpack," Siboni said. "And it has panels that protect you against bullets. It will increase your survival chances."
Another company, Guard Dog Security, has been selling bulletproof backpacks since shortly after the Sandy Hook shooting. The products are available at Office Max, Office Depot and Kmart, and the company recently released a model that costs less than $100.
"It could be the difference between life and death," said Yasir Sheikh, who runs Guard Dog.
In the past, companies have been criticized for falsely claiming that their armored backpacks were certified by the National Institute of Justice, which oversees the body armor used by law enforcement. The agency, part of the Justice Department, has not certified, or even tested, the bulletproof backpacks and has no plans to do so, said Mollie Timmons, a department spokeswoman.
Still, Sheikh said, Guard Dog's backpack is designed to meet the agency's Level IIIA performance standard for body armor, which would make it resistant to bullets fired from shotguns and handguns. The backpacks are tested at a facility in Oregon, he said.
But Sheikh acknowledged that the backpacks were less effective at blocking gunfire from powerful semi-automatic weapons, like the ones used at Sandy Hook. And gun-control advocates say there is no evidence that armored backpacks, however carefully tested, would keep children safe during a shooting.
"We're asking children to stand up to gunmen because lawmakers are too afraid to stand up to the gun lobby," said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a grassroots gun-control organization. "There isn't a parent in this country that isn't terrified. These companies are capitalizing on that."
Siboni, who runs ArmorMe, said it was unfair to accuse his company of exploiting national fears about gun violence to turn a profit.
"Whatever you do, you're capitalizing on something," he said. "We are just responding to a need."
In several recent Twitter posts, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a Democratic presidential candidate, has held up bulletproof backpacks as a symbol of the broader problem of gun violence in the United States.
"Parents shouldn't have to buy a bulletproof backpack for their child just to keep them safe in school," she tweeted in July. "This shouldn't be normal."
But for Celeste Green, a senior at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, the backpacks seem like a necessary precaution.
The day before the shooting in El Paso, Green, 22, learned that a teenager in her hometown, Columbia, South Carolina, had threatened to "shoot up" a local school. When she saw the news, she thought of her younger sister, who is starting high school in the fall. Green sent her mother a few videos and hyperlinks with information about bulletproof backpacks.
"Immediately, she was like: 'Where should I start? Where should I look?'" Green said. "There was no question.

Your baby boomer report card

Texto completo: If there's one thing young adults can agree on, it is that baby boomers have ruined the world. This seems a tad harsh. So maybe it's time for a resentment-free assessment of the boomers, conducted by a trained pop sociologist with no ax to grind.
What follows is a report card of a generation. And we're only counting real boomers here - those who had youthful, live experience of events like Vietnam and Woodstock. Despite what the Census Bureau people say, those born after 1960, like Barack Obama, don't count.
Politics  C-
The baby boomer political era began in 1992, with the election of Bill Clinton. In the five years before that, these leaders dominated world politics: Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela, John Paul II, Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand.
Baby boomers have been unable to match that level of talent. During the years of boomer dominance - from Bill Clinton through Donald Trump - America's political institutions have become dysfunctional, civic debate has crumbled, debt has soared and few major pieces of legislation have passed.
Social Movements  A
Boomers are bad at politics because they distrust institutions. But this has made them good at leading decentralized social movements: environmental, feminist, civil rights, LGBTQ rights.
One lesson of the age is that when all media are focused on left-wing, elite-approved movements, it's important to notice the people quietly reacting against them. The right-leaning boomer movements are just as important: the conservative movement, the religious right, the Tea Party movement, the pro-life and gun rights movements, the populist revolt.
Popular Culture  A
It makes sense that a generation raised on rock 'n' roll and TV would put its energy into popular culture. The boomer generation has produced a string of greats who can withstand comparison with members of any other generation: Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Stephen King, Jimi Hendrix, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Oprah, Ron Howard, Madonna, Stevie Wonder and on and on.
High Culture  C-
The boomers entered college just as universities were expanding and becoming more specialized and professionalized. This produced the most educated generation up to that time, but the specialization and ghettoization of intellectual and artistic life took its toll on the nation's culture.
It's not that people aren't producing good work, but its influence tends to be confined to the academy or specialized subcultures. Art, classical music and novels have lost cultural influence. Boomer writers do not play the same roles as Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Maya Angelou, Thomas Pynchon, Philip Larkin, John Updike and Toni Morrison. Many of the most influential living philosophers are pre-boomer - like Amartya Sen, Charles Taylor and Alasdair MacIntyre.
Technology and Innovation  A-
A person who was born in 1900 and died in 1970 grew up with horse-drawn carriages and died with a man on the moon. Today's 70-year-olds have not seen technological change on the same order.
But they've seen a lot. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. Teams led by Francis Collins and Craig Venter decoded the genetic sequence. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak are among a great cloud of boomer tech innovators. Robert Jarvik, who developed the implantable heart, stands in for all those doing amazing work in medical innovation.
Lifestyle  A
This isn't even close. Restaurants are much better now. Products and buildings are designed in more interesting ways. Coffee, ice cream and all else is far more varied and delicious.
Manners and Morals  C
In the realm of manners, boomers brought on the triumph of the casual. Everything that was refined, stuffy, formal and stiff was loosened up by the boomers, and this is very good.
In the realm of morals, things are more complicated. If the ethos of the silent generation was "We're all in this together" and the code was self-effacement ("I'm nobody better than anybody else, but nobody's better than me"), then the ethos of the boomers is "I'm free to be myself" and the code is "Do you see how special I am?"
Personal freedom has been the master trend for this generation. That was a legitimate reaction against conformity. On the other hand, there is more isolation, bitterness and division. The ethos of the meritocracy filled the values void left by the retreat of any shared moral vocabulary.
Overall Grade  B
As a generation, boomers have excelled at the material things that make life pleasant, convenient, long and fun. They have struggled in the realms that other civilizations would have considered more profound: governance, philosophy, art and public morality.
Special Bonus Question: Who is the quintessential boomer and what does he or she say about the generation?
Here are the nominees:
 Bill Clinton: Hugely talented, high achieving, sometimes self-indulgent.
 Steve Jobs: Design genius; lacked some interpersonal skills.
 Madonna: Scraped her way to the top; became the emblem of self-reinvention.
 Bob Dylan: Entered the stage with a burst of genius that seemed as if it was going to change everything, but somehow didn't.
 Steven Spielberg: Preserved human values in an age of technology; looked back admiringly to earlier generations.
 Donald Trump.

Texto completo: Fifty years after Woodstock, legends about the music festival are tightly braided with the reality of its three chaotic days. The 1969 show was muddy enough (literally and figuratively) for many people to believe both the myths and the debunking, sometimes simultaneously. Even the name of Woodstock doesn't hold up to cursory fact-checking, as most people know -- while the name of Woodstock, N.Y., was more marketable because of the town's association with Bob Dylan, the event happened more than 40 miles away, in Bethel. Here are five other Woodstock stories that, like the brown acid, turned out to be problematic.
Myth: Joni Mitchell wrote the anthem "Woodstock" about her experiences at the festival
Reality: Mitchell never made it to Woodstock -- she was stuck in a hotel room in New York City. She had been planning to accompany Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young to the festival, but when their joint managers, David Geffen and Elliot Roberts, saw how chaotically Woodstock was unfolding, they instructed her to stay in New York: She had an important appearance booked on "The Dick Cavett Show" taping the Monday afternoon after the festival ended, and they were worried she wouldn't make it back in time.
"I was the girl of the family and, with great disappointment, I was the one that had to stay behind," Mitchell told the writer Dave Zimmer for his 1984 biography of Crosby, Stills and Nash. She put aside her bitterness to write a song exalting the festival as a holy gathering, informed by the footage she saw on television and the stories she heard from her then-boyfriend Graham Nash. CSNY had a hit single with their version of it in 1970, while Mitchell included the song on her album "Ladies of the Canyon."
"By the time we got to Woodstock we were half a million strong," she sang, probably overstating the attendance by about 100,000 people. "For a herd of people that large to cooperate so well, it was pretty remarkable," she told Zimmer -- the first three times she performed the song live, she burst into tears, she said, moved by the miracle she hadn't witnessed.
Myth: The weekend was all hippie good vibes
Reality: While many people commented on the air of bonhomie at Woodstock -- where a utopian spirit triumphed over rain, paralyzing traffic jams and not enough food -- that didn't mean that everyone held hands and sang the Youngbloods' "Get Together" all weekend long. With hundreds of thousands of people in close quarters, some will disagree.
Most notably, Abbie Hoffman, the anarchist and political activist, got onstage during the Who's set, around 5:30 a.m. on Sunday morning. High on LSD, he grabbed a live microphone and shouted about the injustice of John Sinclair, the manager of the MC5 and founder of the White Panther Party, serving a 10-year prison sentence for possession of marijuana.
The guitarist Pete Townshend profanely told Hoffman to get off the stage and then got physical about it. "Feeling malevolent, I knocked Abbie aside using the headstock of my guitar. A sharp end of one of my strings must have pierced his skin because he reacted as though stung, retreating to sit cross-legged at the side of the stage," Townshend wrote in his 2012 autobiography "Who I Am." "I was always absurdly territorial about our performance space."
Myth: Woodstock was a commerce-free zone
Reality: Although Woodstock's promoters gave up on collecting tickets or money early on when it became clear that throngs of young people would be attending the show without paying the mandated $ 18 for a three-day pass, that didn't mean they were unconcerned by cash.
The festival's origin story: Joel Rosenman and John Roberts came into some money and placed an ad in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reading, "Young men with unlimited capital looking for interesting, legitimate investment opportunities and business propositions," which led them to the hippie entrepreneurs Michael Lang and Artie Kornfeld. The quartet discussed opening a recording studio in Woodstock -- the festival was originally intended to promote it.
On the weekend of the festival, even as the four promoters scrambled to provide food and water for the crowd, they ran up against a reality of rock promotion: Musicians generally don't want to perform if they don't get paid. They had to convince a local bank to open on a Saturday night and loan them the necessary cash. The highest-paid performer was reportedly Jimi Hendrix, who got $ 18,000; Blood, Sweat & Tears were paid $ 15,000; Janis Joplin, the Band and Jefferson Airplane, $ 7,500 each; and Santana just $ 750.
The Woodstock backers didn't break even at the gate, but they made a lot of money from secondary income streams in the years after the show, like the concert film and the triple-LP soundtrack: Eleven years after Richie Havens opened the show, Woodstock finally went into the black, its organizers said in 2009.

Myth: The "Peanuts" comic strip took inspiration from Woodstock, not the other way around
Reality: The cartoonist Charles Schulz first introduced Snoopy's sidekick in a March 1966 "Peanuts" strip, but the character was nameless until June 1970 -- when Schulz called the bird "Woodstock" in an effort to appeal to the younger generation. The name flipped the character's intended gender; Schulz had thought of the bird as female, but decided that the Woodstock name was male.
Schulz had, however, already made an impact on the Woodstock cohort: The Grateful Dead keyboardist Ron McKernan was widely known by the nickname "Pigpen" -- his poor hygiene reminded people of the perpetually unkempt Peanuts character Pig-Pen. He was the Dead's first frontman, and while he had trouble with the band's more experimental turns, he remained a reliable blues singer until his death in 1973. At Woodstock, Pigpen had been singing a showstopping version of "Turn on Your Love Light" for more than half an hour when the Grateful Dead's show actually stopped -- the band's amps overloaded, which concluded the set.
Myth: Jimi Hendrix electrified hundreds of thousands of people with his version of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
Reality: Hendrix was the closing act at Woodstock -- after a series of incendiary live performances, including setting his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, nobody wanted to follow him. The Jimi Hendrix Experience had broken up, so Hendrix pulled together a pickup band he called Gypsy Sun and Rainbows, and spent the weekend of Woodstock rehearsing with the band, enjoying himself and not sleeping.
Because of the festival's delays, Hendrix didn't take the stage until 9 a.m. on Monday, following the kitschy '50s revivalists Sha Na Na. By most estimates, at least 90 percent of the audience had left at that point, returning to their ordinary lives -- and the exodus continued steadily throughout his set.
Hendrix played "The Star-Spangled Banner" as part of a half-hour medley near the end of his performance, just before seguing into "Purple Haze." He had done the American national anthem dozens of times before, but this electrifying version, three minutes and 46 seconds, wouldn't become iconic until the "Woodstock" movie was released the following year. Full of audio pyrotechnics and feedback, it became the anthem for a nation at war, and the most enduring musical moment from a festival of peace.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

China tries to teach Trump economics

Texto completo: If you want to understand the developing trade war with China, the first thing you need to realize is that nothing Donald Trump is doing makes sense. His views on trade are incoherent. His demands are incomprehensible. And he vastly overrates his ability to inflict damage on China while underrating the damage China can do in return.
The second thing you need to realize is that China's response so far has been fairly modest and measured, at least considering the situation. The U.S. has implemented or announced tariffs on virtually everything China sells here, with average tariff rates not seen in generations. The Chinese, by contrast, have yet to deploy anything like the full range of tools at their disposal to offset Trump's actions and hurt his political base.
Why haven't the Chinese gone all out? It looks to me as if they're still trying to teach Trump some economics. What they've been saying through their actions, in effect, is: "You think you can bully us. But you can't. We, on the other hand, can ruin your farmers and crash your stock market. Do you want to reconsider?"
There is, however, no indication that this message is getting through. Instead, every time the Chinese pause and give Trump a chance to rethink, he takes it as vindication and pushes even harder. What this suggests, in turn, is that sooner or later the warning shots will turn into an all-out trade and currency war.
About Trump's views: His incoherence is on view almost every day, but one of his recent tweets was a perfect illustration. Remember, Trump has been complaining nonstop about the strength of the dollar, which he claims puts America at a competitive disadvantage. On Monday he got the Treasury Department to declare China a currency manipulator, which was true seven or eight years ago but isn't true now. Yet the very next day he wrote triumphantly that "massive amounts of money from China and other parts of the world is pouring into the United States," which he declared "a beautiful thing to see."
Um, what happens when "massive amounts of money" pour into your country? Your currency rises, which is exactly what Trump is complaining about. And if lots of money were flooding out of China, the yuan would be plunging, not experiencing the trivial (2%) decline that Treasury condemned.
Oh well. I guess arithmetic is just a hoax perpetrated by the deep state.
Still, even if Trump isn't making sense, will China give in to his demands? The short answer is, "What demands?" Trump mainly seems exercised by China's trade surplus with America, which has multiple causes and isn't really under the Chinese government's control.
Others in his administration seem concerned by China's push into high-technology industries, which could indeed threaten U.S. dominance. But China is both an economic superpower and relatively poor compared with the U.S.; it's grossly unrealistic to imagine that such a country can be bullied into scaling back its technological ambitions.
Which brings us to the question of how much power the U.S. really has in this situation.
America is, of course, a major market for Chinese goods, and China buys relatively little in return, so the direct adverse effect of a tariff war is larger for the Chinese. But it's important to have a sense of scale. China isn't like Mexico, which sends 80% of its exports to the United States; the Chinese economy is less dependent on trade than smaller nations, and less than a fifth of its exports come to America.
So while Trump's tariffs certainly hurt the Chinese, Beijing is fairly well placed to counter their effects. China can pump up domestic spending with monetary and fiscal stimulus; it can boost its exports, to the world at large as well as to America, by letting the yuan fall.
At the same time, China can inflict pain of its own. It can buy its soybeans elsewhere, hurting U.S. farmers. As we saw this week, even a mostly symbolic weakening of the yuan can send U.S. stocks plunging.
And America's ability to counter these moves is hindered by a combination of technical and political factors. The Fed can cut rates, but not very much given how low they are already. We could do a fiscal stimulus, but having rammed through a plutocrat-friendly tax cut in 2017, Trump would have to make real concessions to Democrats to get anything more - something he probably won't do.
What about a coordinated international response? That's unlikely, both because it's not clear what Trump wants from China and because his general belligerence (not to mention his racism) has left America with almost nobody willing to take its side in global disputes.
So Trump is in a much weaker position than he imagines, and my guess is that China's mini-devaluation of its currency was an attempt to educate him in that reality. But I very much doubt he has learned anything. His administration has been steadily hemorrhaging people who know anything about economics, and reports indicate that Trump isn't even listening to the band of ignoramuses he has left.
So this trade dispute will probably get much worse before it gets better.

Day care costs for Minnesota parents among the highest in nation

Texto completo: Michelle Favela looked over the room full of long-term investments, disguised as adorable 4-year-olds.
“I like this. I feel like I am making a difference,” said Favela, an aide at the New Horizons Academy in Eagan. “They are going to have a good future.”
Every one of the 17 children in her classroom last month represented a fast-rising cost for families. Tuition at Minnesota day care centers has reached an average of $16,000 for infants — the fourth-highest in the nation. That’s the average per year for an infant. It’s less as the child gets older.
HIGH COST, HIGH QUALITY
Child advocates say the high cost is a sign that the quality, too, is exceptional.
“We have the nation’s children in our hands. Somehow, the value of a child has to be recognized,” said Ann Edgerton, director of the University of Minnesota Child Development Center.
Minnesota should be proud of its day care system, said New Horizons CEO Chad Dunkley. He links superb day care to Minnesota’s best-in-the-nation test scores of high-schoolers.
Yet he admitted that the cost can be crushing for parents. It’s more than tuition at the University of Minnesota, more than average rent, more than the entire income of poverty-level parents.
“This is a hot topic, and a real dilemma for us,” said Judy Ohm, director of early childhood development at the Wilder Child Development Center in St. Paul.
REGULATIONS
A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute examined day care centers — not home-based day care. The average annual cost for a Minnesota infant was $16,087, and $12,252 for a 4-year-old.
Only California, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., charge more. Minnesota’s costs are 28 percent higher than Wisconsin’s, and 55 percent higher than Iowa’s.
The blame for the costs — and the credit for the quality — lies with regulations.
Labor accounts for 70 percent of day care costs, and regulations control labor.
Minnesota requires the equivalent of two years in college to be a day care teacher. “Other states require that you are 18, you are breathing and you pass a background check,” said CEO Dunkley.
Aides, who have less education than teachers, also work in Minnesota day care centers.
Centers take pride in their workers. “We hire people who model the best practices. That skews up the prices quite a bit,” said the U’s Edgerton.
Teachers are paid more, and there are more of them — the ratio in Minnesota is one teacher to four infants.
In Mississippi, said Dunkley, it’s nine.
OTHER FACTORS BOOST COST
CEO Dunkley operates New Horizons in Minnesota, Iowa, Idaho and Colorado, and studies regulations of other states. He warned against easing regulations to save money.
“We do not want to lower the quality. Mississippi kids are not doing very well,” he said.
In addition, other factors boost the cost of day care.
“We want small classroom sizes, low teacher-to-child ratios, and want it open 10 or 12 hours a day,” said Ann McCully, director of the nonprofit Child Care Aware, which helps parents and day care providers.
“It adds up fast.”
Construction costs, too, are high in Minnesota. Dunkley said building a New Horizons facility in Iowa costs 25 percent less than in Minnesota. Wages are about 25 percent lower in Iowa, he said.
Advocates are pushing for even higher standards — which would bring higher costs and higher quality.
“This field is trying to become more professional,” said Edgerton. “The public is demanding more high quality care. That requires more teachers with master’s degrees, and more licensed teachers. The public wants more.”
‘I FEEL BADLY FOR SINGLE MOMS’
But is the public also asking for child care it can afford?
A single poverty-level mom with a single child couldn’t cover the costs of day care with her entire income. Middle-class parents are often stunned when their infant’s day care costs more than their 18-year-old’s college tuition.
“I feel badly for single moms. I know it’s very hard,” said Edgerton.
That’s why day care advocates lobby for subsidies for parents.
“We should not do this on the backs of parents or the pockets of providers,” said Child Care Aware’s McCully. “We need to invest in the system.”
Good day care is in the national interest, said Edgerton. “The nation needs to make a decision, the way Europe has,” she said.
And so is affordable day care.
IMPACT ON BIRTH RATES
Dunkley pointed out a New York Times story in which expensive day care was cited as the No. 1 reason why young adults did not have children. It’s one reason why the birth rate in the U.S. has fallen for four consecutive years.
At the New Horizon in Eagan, Selvini Rajanayagam took a break from teaching her class of 4-year-olds.
The comparison with college tuition isn’t hypothetical to her — her son is a sophomore at the U. Tuition for the 2018-19 school year was $14,760 — so she pays less for his tuition than parents pay for the children in her class.
And it’s worth every penny, she said.
She admitted that her extensive training — a bachelor’s degree and 21 years of experience — contributes to the cost of day care. But during the next hour, as she worked with the kids, the quality was obvious.
She and aide Favela read books to the kids, practiced their numbers, played games, sang and danced, all in a classroom with no screens for TV, computers or phones.
She said the children — and everyone else — benefit when kids are carefully nurtured.
“I don’t think we will ever regret it,” said Rajanayagam. “It’s a good investment.”

Texto completo: On Sunday morning, the country woke up to terrible news: back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton.
Every time this happens, our team has a similar conversation. How do we cover a story that plays out over and over in the United States in a way that recognizes the significance of the moment -- and honors the victims -- without elevating the horrific act itself?
Sadly, we've needed to answer that question many times in the two and a half years since we started the show. After Las Vegas, for instance, we focused on two things. First, why, after every mass shooting, are there calls for gun legislation but nothing ever actually happens? We spoke to Robert Draper about the N.R.A. playbook that is deployed after each shooting. Second, who actually needs an assault rifle? What are these weapons used for, other than acts of violence? We called a gun store owner in Virginia, who, in an added layer of complexity, had sold the gun used in the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007.
In the case of the El Paso shooting, the gunman had used language that echoed rhetoric being used by government officials, including our own president -- calling the flow of migrants across the border with Mexico "an invasion." He had targeted a border city, and specifically a Walmart that exemplifies the cultural bonds that tie Mexicans and Americans together there.
We wanted to find a way to capture that reality.
Producers Rachel Quester, Alexandra Leigh Young and Lisa Tobin took charge on Sunday of making Monday's show. Over the next few hours, a half dozen other producers jumped in to help. Together, we tried to tell the story of a horrible day that has become horribly familiar.
We started calling Times reporters who were either based in the area or had been dispatched there after the shooting. We reached out to national correspondent Simon Romero, who covers immigration. He explained to us how undeniable it seemed that the shooter was making a political statement -- he had driven hundreds of miles to a city at the epicenter of the immigration debate, across a state where rapidly changing demographics pose a threat to longtime Republican dominance.
Then our colleague Jenny Medina sent us tape. It told an extraordinary story. She happened to have been covering Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic presidential candidate from El Paso, when the shooting occurred. She followed him back to El Paso, where he held an impromptu news conference with reporters. Jenny turned to a couple in the crowd, and what happened next took our breath away:
Jenny: Are you from El Paso?
Patricia Oliver: No. We are from Parkland. We lost our Joaquin in the Parkland shooting. And we were -- and you know what? We were waiting for Joaquin's -- today's birthday, his 19th birthday today. And I have to deal with this again. And we're trying, you know -- and I'm -- I'm telling you this because that's why we came here, really. The purpose to be here for Joaquin's birthday is we want to do something very remarkable, very important. And we want to do something with kids because Joaquin was very -- I don't know, he was very sweet with the kids. And we decided to come here and visit all the detention centers when this happened.
This couple had lost their son in the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., and traveled to El Paso for his birthday, honoring him in part by visiting a migrant detention center nearby. By pure coincidence, they'd been in town when this weekend's shooting occurred.
It took Jenny's breath away, too. You can hear her in the tape, breaking out in tears as she realizes who she's interviewing.
In that moment, the era of mass shootings had begun to converge in an awful way -- the tragedies becoming so commonplace that victims of one are now present for another.

Rachel ❤️ C-Span
Rachel Quester, the number one fan of C-Span on our team, had the chance to be on the other side of the screen this week, talking about "The Daily" and taking call-in questions. She told us what it was like:
"To me, one of the most valuable resources for 'The Daily' is C-Span. It helps us take listeners inside the chambers of Congress and capture the drama and tension in the room on big hearing days. So it was quite the honor to be able to appear on the network this week and offer some insight into how we make our show. The calls from viewers came in real time, so I had to answer on the spot, live on TV. That was a new challenge -- as an audio producer, I'm used to being on mic, not on camera! But I loved hearing from people across the country and getting a sense of the topics they're most concerned about."

Coming soon on 'The Daily'
All year, we've been following the newest class of House members in our series "The Freshmen." The first two episodes profiled Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, one of the four progressive congresswomen known as "the squad."
While the liberal wing has seized much of the country's attention, the path to power for House Democrats has run through districts that flipped from red to blue in the midterm elections -- districts won by moderates with a very different vision for the party. In the next episode of the series, coming soon, we'll meet one of them: Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey. Look out for it at nytimes.com/thedaily or wherever you get your podcasts.
______
On 'The Daily' this week
Monday: In the aftermath of the weekend's mass shootings, Simon Romero looks into why El Paso was targeted, and Jenny Medina tells us about her encounter with a couple in El Paso who lost a child in the Parkland shooting.
Tuesday: "He always has the same routine whenever there's a mass shooting. He has to go research whether there is an 8chan connection." Kevin Roose on why 8chan's founder now wants the site taken down.
Wednesday: In the years before his death, Osama bin Laden seemed to be grooming a successor: his son. With that son reported dead, Rukmini Callimachi explains what's next for Al Qaeda.
Thursday: Mitch Smith and Michael Crowley describe what it's like in Dayton and El Paso on the day of President Trump's visits. You have "people with Trump flags, people who are standing there with signs that say 'Dump Trump,"' Mitch says, "right next to each other."
Friday: India's Hindu nationalist government erased the autonomy of Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim territory claimed by both India and Pakistan. We spoke to Jeffrey Gettleman about what brought a decades-long conflict to a tipping point.

A quandary for Never Trumpers

Texto completo: The Democratic debates have been hard on Never Trumpers. The small but vocal group of Republicans and former Republicans who oppose President Donald Trump has watched in horror as Democrats veered leftward, embracing "Medicare for All," virtually open borders, sky-high taxes and other positions no conservative could ever accept.
The Never Trumpers see disaster coming in the form of the president winning re-election over a Democrat who moved too far left for the American voter.
So they issue warnings. The Democrats’ performance in the most recent debate was "worse than farcical," The New York Times’ Bret Stephens wrote. "It’s tragic. It will make the Trump campaign’s job of selling the president as the non-insane option in next year’s election shamefully easy."
Bill Kristol, the former Dan Quayle aide who founded the now-shuttered Weekly Standard, tweeted, "Best moment in this debate: ‘It’s time for closing statements.’" After the first debate — a widely watched event that gave voters across the nation their initial impression of the Democratic field — some Never Trumpers were deeply alarmed.
"Trump wants to portray Democrats as open-border socialists," wrote The Washington Post’s Max Boot. "And in their eagerness to court progressive primary voters, the candidates are playing into his hands."
The fretting and complaining, coming from people who had been Republicans until Trump came along, set some liberals on edge.
"I, for one, have pretty much had it with the chorus of center-right voices braying that the Democrats are heading for certain doom ... if the party picks a nominee who actually embraces the party’s ideals," wrote the Post’s Eugene Robinson, adding that "Never Trump Republicans and independents may be shocked to hear this, but the Democratic Party is likely to nominate a Democrat for president."
The pushback served to highlight the Never Trump dilemma. First, they went through a torturous process searching for a candidate to support in the 2016 election. Now, it’s happening again.
The 2020 problem is twofold. The first part is that there is no hope of challenging Trump within the Republican Party structure. As sitting president, Trump controls the Republican National Committee and has the support of the vast majority of GOP voters.
The second part is the depressingly woke Democratic field. Only a few Never Trumpers would be able to support a Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris. Some would probably be happy with Joe Biden, but perhaps more the Biden of their memories than the man who will have to move far enough left to capture the Democratic nomination.
The fact is, barring some extraordinary event that no one can predict, the 2020 presidential race will be between President Trump and a Democratic challenger.
Trump will be chosen by Republicans. The Democrat will be chosen by Democrats.
And one of the two will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2021.

‘Basketball or Nothing' covers hoops dreams on Navajo Nation

Texto completo: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- High school basketball fans in Arizona and New Mexico likely know all about "rez ball" -- a run-and-gun, pass-cut-and-shoot style of play popular in Native American communities. The style excites fans and allows teams without big centers to wear down opponents by running them off the court with speed and strong shooting.

The best practitioners of rez ball help build community in some of the most isolated towns in the American Southwest. Fans travel for hours to see the games, while others listen to radio broadcasts spoken in Native American languages.

A new Netflix docuseries "Basketball or Nothing" examines the hoop dreams of one such team from a rural, Arizona town in the heart of the Navajo Nation.

The series follows the Chinle High School boys' basketball team as its seeks to capture the community's first state title. But to get there, the players must battle normal teen pressures and the realities that surround them in the nation's largest Native American reservation.

Through the eyes and words of Wildcats coach Raul Mendoza and his players, the series documents how their isolation and experiences in one of the poorest regions of the country have shaped them. The teens speak on living in homes without basic services. Filmmakers show them traveling for hours across the state for games and returning home after midnight while resting on cold bus windows.

Basketball is a diversion, team member Josiah Tsosie says, but also a chance to hope. "We always dream big," he tells filmmakers.

Can Mendoza, a member of the Tohono O'odham tribe in Arizona, convince his young men to suppress their disadvantages and focus on perfecting their advantages -- for the season and life?

"There's really nothing going on in Chinle," die-hard fan Mo Draper says in the opening of the series. "(There're) no clubs, no dance, no movie theatres. There's really no outlet for the kids or the adults."

That's why Chinle basketball is an addiction, Draper said, but one that brings happiness.

Or pain if the team sees another losing season.

Co-director and executive producer Matt Howley said he got the idea for the film after watching an online video about rez ball and reading a New York Times profile on Mendoza.

Yet, he didn't want to be another outsider coming into a Native American community with assumptions and stereotypes. So, Howley and the film crew opted to skip a narrator and only allow the people of Chinle to speak.

"It was important to let them tell their own story," Howley said.

To do that, filmmakers had to stop shooting for a while and gain the trust of the players, Howley said. "After a week or two," the players allowed filmmakers inside their homes.

The docuseries couldn't escape issues of life on the reservation: poverty, health care, addiction. However, Howley said he left it up to the players and their coach to discuss the subjects.

In the first episode, Mendoza races to prepare the players for their opening game against a taller Snowflake, Arizona, team. The Wildcats have to travel two hours to get there.

"Don't take the first shot they give you," he tells them during the game. "Take the shot you want."

It's an ongoing theme he will stress throughout the series. Play rez ball but with structure, and you'll be in a position to win today. And if you win today, you can win tomorrow.

And the next day. And the next day.

Texto completo: Uber announced on Thursday that it lost a staggering $5.2 billion in the second quarter of 2019 in its biggest quarterly loss to date.
According to financial reports, the ride-sharing company reportedly paid $3.9 billion in stock-based compensation expenses to employees following Uber's initial public offering in May, which contributed to the considerable loss.
But even without those payments, Uber still lost about $1.3 billion during the quarter, an increase of more than 50% of reported losses during the same period last year.
The company has diversified itself in recent years by investing in freight shipping, meal deliveries, and providing discounts for its ride-sharing services to lure consumers away from competitors such as Lyft.
But Uber's revenue growth remains on a downward trend, and the company posted only a 14% revenue increase compared to the same quarter in 2018, its slowest hike to date.
"There's the meme [going] around, which is, can Uber ever be profitable?" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on a conference call with analysts Thursday. "I've certainly heard that meme, along with others."
Khosrowshahi signaled the earnings report meant that his company was fixated on "healthy revenue growth." The CEO emphasized that the ride-sharing and meal delivery services could possibly "be a spectacular business long-term."
"We think that 2019 will be our peak investment year," Khosrowshahi said in an interview with the New York Times. "We want to make sure that the kind of growth we have is healthy growth. The competitive environment, which got worse in the second half of last year, is progressively improving now."
Uber revealed it was laying off 400 employees from its marketing team in the days before the earnings report was released in an effort to revamp its marketing department.

Texto completo: After completing 12 books for "The Land of Stories" fantasy series, Chris Colfer is back with a brand new adventure – and this one, he reveals, was the "toughest book" he's ever had to write.
The author, known for his role as Kurt Hummel in the Fox musical show "Glee," has captured a huge fan following from his best-selling middle-grade series. "A Tale of Magic" will be a sequel to that series.
"A Tale of Magic" (Little, Brown and Co.), out Oct. 1, is special for a variety of reasons.
The tale follows 14-year-old Brystal Evergreen, as she tries to survive the oppressive Southern Kingdom where it is illegal for women to read books. While working as a maid at her local library and having to sneak out titles, she discovers a secret section with a book about magic, which is also outlawed throughout the world, leading her down a complicated path.
The book, which tackles powerful issues, was more difficult to write than Colfer imagined.
"At its core, 'Tale of Magic' is a story about overcoming prejudice and oppression and more than anything I hope it inspires and encourages anyone out there who is fighting their own battles of injustice or inequality," he told USA TODAY.
"When I first started, I was not expecting it to be as difficult as it was, but the world changed so significantly since I agreed to do it, to when I started writing it... I knew I had to tell a story that I thought would help kids and families out there who are having a difficult time with the times we live in," he continued.
Colfer is embarking on a tour for the book, he shared exclusively with USA TODAY. But unlike Colfer's previous book tours for "Stories," which transformed into auditorium-sized events with costume contests, readings and games, the format for his new tale will be much more traditional, beginning with the tour's first stop in New York City on the day of the book's release.
"Since this is a brand-new series I'm going to be doing a traditional book signing this time around," Colfer revealed .
"As soon as the readers are familiar with the new story, the new characters, we'll go back to the town hall-style because it was a big hit with the kids – and their parents because they didn't have to wait in a line with their kids," he laughed.
What the New York Times bestselling author is most looking forward to, however, is the fan reaction to the meaningful story line behind the book.
"One of the biggest motivations for this book was actually for parents and teachers, and for all the parents and teachers out there who are having a difficult time talking to their children about the troubling things they see on the news every day," he said. "I really hope that 'A Tale of Magic' acts as a point of reference to make those conversations a lot easier."
Colfer explained that writing has always been a therapeutic activity for him, and helped him get through some of his own toughest times.
"As a kid, I had a sister with special needs, which was very difficult for my family, so whenever times got tough I would just whip out my computer or a pad of paper. ...
That tool came in later when I grew up as a closeted gay kid in a public high school, and also being a gay teenager on public television," he said.
As a vocal member of the LGBTQ community, the author shared he has received appreciation from LGBTQ fans who connected with his books.
"My books are sold in places and do very well in places where LGBT people are discriminated against quite brutally and I do hear from those kids a lot," Colfer said. "If you look at my Twitter you might find some pictures of LGBT kids holding my books up by the Kremlin and other landmarks. That means a lot to me."
Colfer even admitted to having a whole room in his house dedicated to letters, fan art and fan creations, adding "that's my favorite part because I get to see my characters through someone else's eyes."
The author added that although "A Tale of Magic" acts as a prequel, it is a "completely independent story, and you don't need to read 'Land of Stories' to enjoy it."
Fans might want to get reading soon because Colfer announced his next literary focus: writing the sequel.

Hundreds Arrested in ICE Raid in Mississippi

Texto completo: Federal agents raided several companies across Mississippi on Wednesday, rounding up hundreds of immigrant workers in what federal officials said might be the largest worksite enforcement action ever in a single state.
In a coordinated sting, more than 600 agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement showed up at the sites with federal warrants that allowed them to search the premises. About 680 immigrants who were believed to be working without legal documentation were apprehended and taken away on buses.
Lindsay Williams, a spokesman for the agency, said the federal agents executed the search warrants in conjunction with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi.
The operation was the culmination of a yearlong investigation, and it unfolded just hours before President Trump -- who has made illegal immigration a trademark issue and who recently vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants -- arrived in El Paso, a majority Latino city on the Mexico border where 22 people were killed over the weekend in an attack that federal authorities are investigating as an act of domestic terrorism.
[The raids left some children without a parent at home. "Government, please show some heart," one 11-year-old begged.]
The raids were by far the largest to occur since Mr. Trump took office, and the biggest since December 2006, when more than 1,200 people were swept up in a raid at several units of a meat processing company.
Three poultry plants that are owned and operated by Peco Foods in three towns, and a fourth run by Koch Foods, in Morton, Miss., were among the facilities raided on Wednesday.
Mayor William Truly of Canton told the local ABC affiliate that federal agents had identified workers who were in the country illegally and rounded them up, put them in buses and took them away.
Three buses took migrants who had been arrested at Koch Foods to a National Guard base.
"Those who were arrested are being processed and they are being given their due process," Mr. Williams said.
One woman who said she was a lead worker at the Koch Foods plant told a local television station, WAPT, that ICE agents had come into the building and ordered employees to line up and walk outside.
"That's all our workers -- half of the plant!" she said of the detained workers. "I just know it's messed up because we've got to think about the kids and everything. I mean, who's going to get their kids?"
The woman, who was not identified, said multiple buses had already left the area with detained workers.
Other women said in a video posted on social media that they were worried about a 12-year-old girl whose mother was being questioned by officers inside the plant. A girl could be heard wailing in the background. A girl no more than three feet tall slowly waddled toward the metal gate to look, with other workers, at those who were being detained.
Photographs and videos showed groups of people waving as buses drove away. Others wiped tears away or held on to a metal gate outside of the plant in Morton, Miss., as they watched officers carry out the operation.
Men and women walked in boots with their hands zip-tied behind their backs. Other detained employees sat on the grass or near large, white silos on the company property.
"We have officially returned to the era of massive worksite raids," said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy organization. "The net result will be immigrant workers pushed further underground, families separated and local economies decimated. The American worker and their family lose their neighbors, fellow church members and friends."
"The American economy loses a work force that is contributing in more ways than we can imagine," he continued. "And, along the way, we are no safer as immigrant communities are pushed further from law enforcement."
The poultry industry has long relied on immigrant labor to do the physically taxing work of cutting, cleaning, deboning and packing chicken in cold, sometimes dangerous conditions.
In statements, both poultry processors said they utilized E-Verify, a government electronic system designed to confirm that employees are eligible to work in the United States.
Immigrants eager for work traditionally have used fake Social Security numbers and green cards to secure jobs. But those do not pass E-Verify. Thus, in recent years, more immigrants have resorted to using the identities of legal United States residents, the identities of dead citizens, or the Social Security numbers of their American-born children to pass the electronic verification program.
After The New York Times revealed last December that Mr. Trump's golf resorts employed undocumented immigrants, the Trump Organization terminated dozens of workers and said that it had begun to use E-Verify. The company has faced no penalties for hiring housekeepers, groundskeepers and cooks who used phony documents to obtain employment, some with the knowledge of at least one manager in New Jersey.
[Making President Trump's Bed: A Housekeeper Without Papers]
Peco Foods, which is based in Tuscaloosa, Ala., is described on its website as a "fully integrated grower, processor and marketer" of poultry products. The 80-year-old company is family-owned, according to the website.
In a statement, the company confirmed that three of its facilities in Mississippi -- in Bay Springs, Canton and Sebastopol -- had been raided. It said it had adhered to all local, state and federal laws and had used E-Verify to screen its new hires.
Koch Foods, one of the country's largest poultry processors with more than $ 3 billion in annual sales and with plants around the country, employs more than 10,000 people. The company was subjected to immigration enforcement action in 2007.
"The chicken industry uses every tool in the toolbox, including E-Verify, to help ensure a legal work force," said Tom Super, a spokesman for the National Chicken Council, whose members include Koch Foods. "And we've been strong advocates before Congress to make those tools even stronger."
The coordinated sweeps on Wednesday were reminiscent of large-scale raids on meatpacking plants that occurred during the administration of President George W. Bush.
In one prominent case in Postville, Iowa, in May 2008, agents backed by air and ground support descended on a kosher meat processing plant called Agriprocessors and arrested nearly 400 workers.
Last June, about 150 workers were arrested during a raid on a gardening and landscaping company in Ohio. And in April last year, immigration agents detained nearly 100 workers at a meatpacking plant in Morristown, Tenn. The owner of that facility was sentenced to 18 months in prison.
[ICE Came for a Tennessee Town's Immigrants. The Town Fought Back.]
"It's all part of a concerted effort by this administration to target not only the individuals in the United States unlawfully but also the companies that are employing them," said Dawn Lurie, a lawyer who specializes in immigration compliance.
Last month, ICE agents converged on thousands of companies across the country to notify them that they had to submit hiring records so authorities could confirm that their employees were eligible to work in the United States. Often, those audits result in civil fines levied against the companies and the loss of a significant number of workers.
Mike Hurst, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, said in a statement that Wednesday's action "is believed to be the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in our nation's history."
In a statement, ICE said that everyone who was arrested on Wednesday was being interviewed "to record any potential mitigating humanitarian situations" that would determine who would remain detained and who might be released from custody.
In all cases, the agency said, everyone was being sent to immigration court. For those who had already been ordered to leave the country, they would be processed and deported.
Sources close to the Department of Homeland Security said they recognized that the optics were difficult following the El Paso shooting, one of two mass shootings over the weekend that killed a total of 31 people. But preparation for the operation had been underway, with hundreds of government operatives flown in days ago, they said.

Times Adds New Readers, But Its Profits Dip in Process

Texto completo: As digital revenue becomes more central to the newspaper business -- and with a small boost from the launch of "The Weekly," a television show on FX and Hulu -- The New York Times Company on Wednesday reported second-quarter revenue growth of 5.2 percent compared with the same quarter last year.
Operating profit declined by the same proportion, to $ 37.9 million from $ 40 million a year earlier. In a statement, Mark Thompson, the company's chief executive, said the dip in profit was "in large part a result of continued investment into growing our subscription business."
The company's share price dropped 12 percent on Wednesday.
The number of paid subscriptions, digital and print, reached 4.7 million, a high. Nearly 3.8 million people pay for the publisher's online products, with the company adding a net total of 197,000 customers for its news, crossword and cooking apps during the quarter, a sharp increase from the 109,000 subscriptions added in the same period in 2018. Of those subscribers, 131,000 came for the digital news product.
Since introducing its web paywall eight years ago, The New York Times has sought to guard against industry declines in print advertising revenue by making most of its money from subscriptions, breaking from the traditional newspaper business model.
"We're making steady progress toward our goal of reaching 10 million total subscriptions by 2025," Mr. Thompson said.
Subscription revenue rose 3.8 percent from a year earlier, to $ 270.5 million. Digital-only subscription revenue makes up less than half that, $ 112.6 million, but grew more than 14 percent from last year's second quarter.
In advertising, past trends held. Digital advertising revenue rose 13.7 percent year over year, while print advertising dropped 8 percent. Even so, in absolute terms, print ads brought in slightly more money than digital ads during the second quarter, $ 62.7 million versus $ 58 million -- a sign that ads on paper remain lucrative.
In its report on Wednesday, the company said it expected digital subscription revenue to continue to rise steadily in the third quarter. At the same time, it warned that the outlook for ad revenue was not so promising for the second half of 2019, with expected drops in total ad revenue and digital ad revenue from strong third and fourth quarters last year.
The Times entered new territory during the second quarter with "The Weekly," a documentary series meant to capitalize on the success of the hit Times podcast "The Daily" and extend the reach of the paper's journalism into television and the booming streaming industry.
The show, which went live in June, figured strongly in the part of the company report defined as "other," a category that notes income from neither subscriptions nor advertising.
In the second quarter, the revenue associated with this sector of the Times business rose roughly 30 percent, to $ 45 million, from the equivalent period a year ago, even as it helped increase costs. The Times pays to produce the show and receives licensing fees from FX and Hulu.
"'The Weekly' represents a significant opportunity to expose Times journalism to new audiences in a compelling format," Mr. Thompson said, "and we're very excited about its future potential."

Warren lags other candidates on a plan for gun control

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Last weekend's senseless carnage thrust the politics of gun control into the center of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, prompting numerous candidates to make or reiterate full-throated calls for sweeping gun reforms, like assault weapon buybacks or national licensing systems.
Among the candidates who have yet to release a detailed gun safety policy is an unexpected name: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has made ambitious and progressive policy proposals the bedrock of her presidential race. There are 29 policy announcements listed on Warren's campaign website, but none of them specifically mention guns.
That is likely to change by this weekend, however: A campaign aide said she is set to release a new plan on guns prior to a forum organized by Everytown for Gun Safety and other groups in Iowa on Saturday. The plan will deal at least in part with enforcement, according to a person familiar with it, calling for strengthening the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms with more money and tougher regulations, and revoking licenses from gun dealers who violate rules.
Warren has consistently called for stronger gun safety measures in Congress, winning her high praise from gun safety groups. But the fact that she waited until the eighth month of her campaign to deliver a comprehensive policy on an issue at the heart of some of her opponents' platformsgives their allies an opening to suggest that she has a hard time getting out of her own policy wheelhouse.
“The senator does an extremely good job dealing with issues that fall within the realm of economics," said Bakari Sellers, a former state lawmaker in South Carolina who has endorsed California Senator Kamala Harris. “Some of the other issues . . . she struggles with."
Warren has already released an immigration plan, and in recent days she has strongly condemned white supremacy, domestic terrorism, and called President Trump a racist.
But she has a worldview that is at once sweeping and deeply focused, relating most of society's ills back to the issues of corruption, corporate greed, and economic inequality that animate her campaign. While critics like Sellers suggest her focus on her core themes is limiting, other Democrats see that focus as an asset for her campaign that helps her link different issues together.
“No matter the issue, it can connect back to an overall theme, which I think is powerful for voters," said Andrew Feldman, a progressive Democratic strategist in Washington.
This week, instead of immediately rolling out a new gun plan, she tied gun control directly to her concerns about the role of money in politics.
“The majority of Americans want to see us put sensible legislation in place to get the guns out of the hands of people who pose threats like this, and yet it doesn't happen and the reason for that is because the gun manufacturers own Washington," Warren said in an interview on MSNBC on Sunday, vowing to do “everything I can by executive order," and calling to get rid of the filibuster so the Senate can pass new gun laws with a simple majority.
Other candidates, meanwhile, have already made detailed, multipart gun safety proposals a central tenet of their campaigns. In April, Harris released a plan to take four specific executive actions to increase background checks, take lawbreaking gun dealers to court, and more. The following month, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker rolled out a 14-point gun violence plan that is anchored by a federal licensing program for gun owners.
Following the shootings over the weekend, two other candidates — Washington Governor Jay Inslee and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — each rolled out new multistep gun safety plans on Tuesday, both of which echoed Booker's call for nationwide gun licensing.
On Sunday, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders called for a ban on making, selling, and transferring assault weapons and a buyback program; the following day, in a CNN interview, former vice president Joe Biden endorsed a national buyback program, and his campaign is touting his efforts to pass the 1994 ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, which has since expired.
Gun safety advocates say the issue is likely to become central in both the primary and the general election, marking a significant shift from the 2008 and 2012 elections.
“What we're going to see in 2020 is a referendum on the future of firearms policy in America," said Peter Ambler, the executive director of the gun safety group Giffords. He said guns were also a galvanizing issue for Democratic voters in last year's midterm elections.
Warren is not the only top-tier candidate who has yet to lay out a comprehensive gun policy. Biden has not released one, either, although an aide said the campaign will do so.
At times over the course of her campaign, Warren has sounded a cautious note on guns that is at odds with some of her more crusading liberal politics. During the first Democratic debate, she called for new research into gun violence, which has gotten little government funding in part because of an NRA-backed amendment from the 1990s that stymied gun research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In a video interview with The New York Times, she emphasized a cultural connection to guns drawn from her childhood in Oklahoma. “My family had guns when I was growing up. My brothers have guns," she said, adding, “We need to have better gun safety laws in place, serious laws."
Warren speaks more about the issue on the campaign trail if she is asked specifically about it by audience members, and often seeks to broaden the conversation beyond mass shootings to the pain of everyday gun violence — a point some gun control advocates appreciate.
“It's not just the mass shootings that make headlines, it's the children who are shot on our sidewalks, in our playgrounds and backyards, visiting a friend," Warren said in Lansing, Mich., recently.
“We know what we need to do," Warren said, calling for universal background checks, closing gun show loopholes, and to “take the weapons of war off our streets."

Texto completo: Bruce Fleming got his job back. I learned of the decision by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to reinstate Professor Fleming at the Naval Academy, and my first visceral reaction was one of resignation. I wasn't surprised. On the day of his announced reinstatement I came across two tweets on social media, and the essence of who Bruce Fleming is became crystal clear to me.
The first tweet was from Capital Gazette reporter Danielle Ohl.
"Professor Bruce Fleming emailed me back in April, saying he fantasizes about headlines saying he'll be reinstated. Seems like he got his wish."
The very next tweet in my Twitter feed was someone retweeting Donald Trump's ranting during the Mueller testimony on Capitol Hill.
"I would like to thank the Democrats for holding this morning's hearing. Now, after 3 hours, Robert Mueller has to subject himself to #ShiftySchiff - an Embarrassment to our Country."
Similarly, the president's tweet didn't stir anything in me other than resignation. I wasn't surprised, and it is hard to get bothered anymore when the narrative coming from him is just constant vitriol and narcissistic spouting off just to stir the pot.
And then it struck me, that's who Bruce Fleming was and always wanted to be when he was teaching at the Academy. He was Donald Trump. He would push the envelope. He would criticize and wow his students and peers with his irreverence for the standards of civility and mainstream education. Why? For the betterment of the process and the institution?
No. He did it for himself. He wanted the attention. It's clear narcissistic behavior. It is similar to what the President does on Twitter, and I have to wonder how Trump-like Bruce would have been on that platform had it been a mainstream social media channel back when he was first crafting his anti-Academy philosophy.
I served as the Naval Academy public affairs officer from 2013 to 2016, and Bruce and I were very familiar with each other. We'd meet for lunch. I'd swing by his office to say hello. We debated issues. In our very first exchange, Bruce (ever the English professor) corrected a grammatical error in my email where I used "renowned" instead of "renown." In truth, I didn't mind Bruce. I liked him, and I still do. I think he's incredibly smart.
By the time I arrived at USNA, Bruce had been published many times over in his efforts to criticize and denigrate the academy for its admissions standards, sexual assault prevention training and the oft-recycled rants about how the service academies were sumps on taxpayer dollars and should be shut down.
The arguments were stale. We all knew what he was saying and what he would continue to say. The ground was over-saturated with Bruce's arguments and provocative musings. The issue was this. Who is listening? Who is Bruce's target audience? Is he trying to sway opinion? Influence Congress? Rile up a traditionally pro-academy Annapolis readership? Scare the current USNA staff?
I don't think so. I think he writes this stuff to be purposefully contrarian ... and then he sits back and revels in the attention. That's not adult behavior. That's not professorial behavior. That's Trump behavior.
Baltimore Sun reporter Tim Prudente covered the ongoing MSPB deliberations on Fleming's reinstatement in May. He wrote, "By 2009, he was telling a CNN reporter that admissions standards were weakening. In a 2010 Op-Ed in The New York Times, he wrote the Naval Academy 'lost its way.' He blasted the academy with articles in Salon, The Atlantic, The Federalist and Inside Higher Ed. 'Fleming's at it again,' wrote Cmdr. John Schofield, the spokesman, in one email presented to the court. 'Almost comical how he regurgitates the same argument.' " I stand by that statement. I still feel that way.
Bruce would publish something and then email me desperate for his desired response. "I bet I ruined your day with this one," he once wrote me after one of his anti-Academy articles.
No. It didn't ruin my day. His content was regurgitation. And it was indeed comical for us to see him pander for the attention. The shock factor was gone. It didn't affect me or my staff. It didn't move the needle for the superintendent. We were dealing with real issues. We were busy.
The problem was this: Bruce was - and still is, I presume - so utterly preoccupied with himself, that he does the academy, his students and himself a disservice. Bruce does indeed fantasize about the headlines. That's true. Instead of doing that, he should fantasize about being a better educator.
I'm not trying to poke at Bruce here. Like I said, I like him, and I think he has a lot to offer the students at the Naval Academy, an institution I believe in and have come to love. The service academies are important. The students who have signed up to serve this nation are women and men of character and consequence.
They deserve the very best moral, mental and physical training and education available. I hope, as Bruce returns to campus, he will use his reinstatement to advance their education and prepare them for their careers ... instead of fantasizing about his headlines.
Retired Navy Cmdr. John Schofield served for 21 years and retired in 2017. He lives in Annapolis.

Has anyone actually read the El Paso manifesto?

Texto completo: The manifesto written by accused El Paso mass killer Patrick Crusius is the basis for the argument that the shootings were inspired by President Trump. Media commentators, Democratic presidential candidates, and all types of Trump critics have made that case in the days since the murders.
Much discussion was spurred by an article in the New York Times with the headline, "El Paso Shooting Suspect's Manifesto Echoes Trump's Language." The story quoted just 28 words of the nearly 2,400-word manifesto. It noted that Crusius specifically wrote that his views "predate Trump." And it warned that "linking political speech, however heated, to the specific acts of ruthless mass killers is a fraught exercise." Nevertheless, the Times declared that even "if Mr. Trump did not originally inspire the gunman, he has brought into the mainstream polarizing ideas and people once consigned to the fringes of American society."
Democratic contender Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso native, was much more blunt. "22 people in my hometown are dead after an act of terror inspired by your racism," O'Rourke tweeted to the president.
So what did Crusius actually write? The Times story did not link to the manifesto, nor did many other media accounts. Most news organizations decided that even though the manifesto is clearly part of the El Paso story, they should not give Crusius the exposure he sought by linking to its full text. So many stories have included just a few snippets from the document. (The Washington Examiner has also decided not to link to the manifesto, but it can be easily found on the internet.)
But since the manifesto has become such an important part of the moment's political debate, it is worth looking at the whole thing. And the impression one gets after reading the manifesto is quite different than some press accounts.
First, to be clear: The manifesto is insane. Part of it discussed commonly debated issues such as the environment and the economy in ways that are well within the boundaries of political conversation going on today — indeed, that might have come out of the New York Times or many other outlets. Other parts of it mixed in theories on immigration from far right circles in Europe and the U.S. Then it threw in beliefs on "race-mixing" straight from the fever swamps. And then it concluded that the solution is to murder Hispanic immigrants, going on to debate whether an AK-47 or an AR-15 would best do the job. By that point, Crusius had veered far from both reality and basic humanity.
But the question is, was he inspired by President Trump? It is hard to make that case looking at the manifesto in its entirety.
Crusius worried about many things, if the manifesto is any indication. He certainly worried about immigration, but also about automation. About job losses. About a universal basic income. Oil drilling. Urban sprawl. Watersheds. Plastic waste. Paper waste. A blue Texas. College debt. Recycling. Healthcare. Sustainability. And more. Large portions of the manifesto simply could not be more un-Trumpian.
Crusius began the manifesto by expressing support for Brenton Tarrant, the man who in March murdered 51 people and wounded 49 others in attacks on a mosque and an Islamic center in Christchurch, New Zealand. Tarrant wrote a 74-page manifesto entitled "The Great Replacement" that dwelled on demographic change in Europe, which Tarrant said was experiencing an "invasion" of immigrants with higher fertility rates than native Europeans. "This crisis of mass immigration and sub-replacement fertility is an assault on the European people that, if not combated, will ultimately result in the complete racial and cultural replacement of the European people," Tarrant wrote.
Tarrant's writing deeply affected Crusius. The first words of Crusius' manifesto were, "In general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto." Crusius went on to write that, "This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion* of Texas. ... I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion." Later, Crusius referred to Hispanic immigrants as "invaders who also have close to the highest birthrate of all ethnicities in America," and noted: "Actually, the Hispanic community was not my target before I read 'The Great Replacement.'"
Crusius was clearly inspired in large part by Tarrant, who in turn said he was inspired by seeing demographic change in France when he traveled to Europe in 2017.
With that in the background, Crusius expressed deep concerns about politics in the U.S. One of the "biggest betrayals" in history, he wrote, was "the takeover of the United States government by unchecked corporations." Crusius said he could write "a ten page essay on all the damage these corporations have caused." But the biggest problem, he said, was a dangerous political mix: "Due to the death of the baby boomers, the increasingly anti-immigrant rhetoric of the right and the ever increasing Hispanic population, America will soon become a one party-state."
That one party, of course, was the Democratic Party. And although Crusius had little use for Republicans, he was most angry about what he had seen in the recent Democratic presidential debates:
They intend to use open borders, free healthcare for illegals, citizenship and more to enact a political coup by importing and then legalizing millions of new voters. With policies like these, the Hispanic support for Democrats will likely become nearly unanimous in the future. The heavy Hispanic population in Texas will make us a Democrat stronghold. Losing Texas and a few other states with heavy Hispanic population to the Democrats is all it would take for them to win nearly every presidential election. Although the Republican Party is also terrible. Many factions within the Republican Party are pro-corporation. Pro-corporation = pro-immigration. But some factions within the Republican Party don't prioritize corporations over our future. So the Democrats are nearly unanimous with their support of immigration while the Republicans are divided over it. At least with Republicans, the process of mass immigration and citizenship can be greatly reduced.
That is a not-inaccurate restatement of some of the calculations that have been going on in both Republican and Democratic strategy rooms around the country for many years, certainly before the emergence of Donald Trump as a presidential candidate.
Crusius expressed a number of reasons for his anxiety about immigration. Among them was the growth of automation in the American economy. "Continued immigration will make one of the biggest issues of our time, automation, so much worse," Crusius wrote. Crusius had obviously read reports that millions of American jobs will be lost to automation in coming years. He noted that while "some people will be retrained ... most will not."
Crusius felt automation would take away his future, too. "My whole life I have been preparing for a future that currently doesn't exist," he wrote. "The job of my dreams will likely be automated."
The automation threat, Crusius continued, means the U.S. "will have to initiate a basic universal income to prevent widespread poverty and civil unrest as people lose their jobs." (Crusius shared an interest in universal basic income, or UBI, and a pessimism about job retraining, with Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang.) Crusius' idea was that fewer "invaders" meant more resources for government programs. "Achieving ambitious social projects like universal healthcare and UBI would become far more likely to succeed if tens of millions of dependents are removed," he wrote.
Then there was education, the price of college, and the job market. "The cost of college degrees has exploded as their value has plummeted," Crusius wrote. As a result, "a generation of indebted, overqualified students [are] filling menial, low paying, and unfulfilling jobs." A high school degree used to be "worth something," he said. No longer.
And then, the environment. Americans enjoy an "incredible" quality of life, Crusius wrote, but "our lifestyle is destroying the environment of our country." Corporations, he said, are destroying the environment by "shamelessly over-harvesting resources."
Crusius cited a children's book by Dr. Seuss, The Lorax, which dealt with environmental devastation. It was published in 1971 and was made into a successful movie in 2012, when Crusius was 14. "This phenomenon is brilliantly portrayed in the decades old classic 'The Lorax,'" Crusius wrote. "Water sheds around the country, especially in agricultural areas, are being depleted. Fresh water is being polluted from farming and oil drilling operations. Consumer culture is creating thousands of tons of unnecessary plastic waste and electronic waste, and recycling to help slow this down is almost non-existent."
There was more: "Urban sprawl creates inefficient cities which unnecessarily destroys millions of acres of land," Crusius wrote. And: "We even use God knows how many trees worth of paper towels just [to] wipe water off our hands."
After his environmental concerns, Crusius, incredibly, moved to a discussion of the AK-47 versus the AR-15. And then to his racial theories. "I am against race mixing because it destroys genetic diversity and creates identity problems," he wrote. "Racial diversity will disappear as either race mixing or genocide will take place. But the idea of deporting or murdering all non-white Americans is horrific. Many have been here at least as long as the whites, and have done as much to build our country." Crusius then suggested dividing America into a "confederacy of territories" by race.
Crusius ended the manifesto by saying he expected to be killed in the attack he would allegedly carry out on Saturday. As it turned out, the shooter was not, and he is now behind bars, charged with killing 22 people and wounding 26 others. He said his actions would be misunderstood as being tied to Trump.
"My ideology has not changed for several years," Crusius wrote. "My opinions on automation, immigration, and the rest predate Trump and his campaign for president. I [am] putting this here because some people will blame the President or certain presidential candidates for the attack. This is not the case. I know that the media will probably call me a white supremacist anyway and blame Trump's rhetoric. The media is infamous for fake news. Their reaction to this attack will likely just confirm that."
That was the only time Trump appeared in the manifesto, and it appears clear that Crusius borrowed his "fake news" characterization of the news media from the president. But that is not what Trump's critics have charged. They have charged that Trump inspired Crusius to kill. They have charged it so often in the last few days that it has hardened into a general perception that Crusius was inspired by the president. But read the manifesto. It's just not there.
*The word "invasion" has been used in connection with illegal immigration since long before the president ran for office. In the 1990s, for example, the state of California unsuccessfully sued the federal government, claiming the government did not protect states from an "invasion" of illegal immigrants. In 2010, the state of Arizona also unsuccessfully challenged the federal government over a similar "invasion." The word was also used, well before Trump, in general commentary, usually by those who sought to restrict immigration levels into the United States. And more generally, too: Bobby Jindal, the son of immigrants and governor of Louisiana who ended his 2016 presidential campaign with a bitter attack on Trump, used to say that "immigration without assimilation is invasion."

Texto completo: Dear reader:
For some time now, we’ve been hearing about attacks on the mainstream media from the right – most prominently, charges of “fake news” leveled by President Donald Trump against stories he feels are biased and the media’s tendency to frame whatever he does in a negative light.
This week, it was the left’s turn. After Mr. Trump addressed the nation on Monday in the wake of two horrific mass shootings, The New York Times posted a story with the following headline: “Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism.”
An outcry ensued.
“Let this front page serve as a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by – and often relies upon – the cowardice of mainstream institutions,” tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. “Unbelievable,” chimed in former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who hails from El Paso, the site of Saturday’s massacre.
Joan Walsh, a correspondent for The Nation, tweeted that she was canceling her subscription (“I can’t keep rewarding such awful news judgment”). Indeed, CancelNYT actually became a trending hashtag.
Eventually, the headline was changed and Dean Baquet, the Times’s executive editor essentially apologized, explaining that the narrow layout on the page didn’t allow room for “subtlety.”
Of course, the headline wasn’t factually inaccurate – Mr. Trump did urge unity against racism in his speech. But to critics on the left, that framing was entirely misleading, since it ignored the many times Mr. Trump’s own words have seemed to stoke racial animus in this country.
“A vast swath of Democratic voters are pretty angry at the media,” former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer told Politico. “They see a racist liar in the White House and a media too afraid to call him a racist or a liar.”
Mr. O’Rourke’s struggling presidential campaign had a viral moment earlier this week that seemed to encapsulate the growing liberal frustration with the press. Asked by a reporter whether there was anything the president could do to “make this any better,” he responded: “What do you think?” adding: “Members of the press, what the [expletive]?” He went on: “It’s these questions that you know the answers to. I mean, connect the dots about what he’s been doing.”
To the right, much of mainstream media is saddled with inherent bias. To the left, it’s too often constrained by absurdly artificial conventions that prioritize “balance” over truth.

Texto completo: LAKE HOPATCONG, N.J. - Around Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey’s largest lake, workers have been laid off, sailing lessons canceled and summers ruined. The reason: clouds of electric-green algae in the water, blooming in quantities never before recorded.
State warnings that the water is unsafe - which began in June and remain in effect for all but one small branch of the lake - have come during a summer of unusually intense algae blooms in many parts of the country. Fueled by heavy rains and hot, sunny days, the blooms have caused high-season swimming bans from lakes in the Pacific Northwest to the entire Mississippi seacoast.
Climate change is a likely factor, scientists say, in an increase in blooms of cyanobacteria - technically not algae but single-cell organisms that, when they grow densely, can produce toxic substances.
More frequent, more intense rainstorms that drive nutrients like sewage and fertilizer into waterways - coupled with more hot days to warm the water - create ideal conditions for the blooms, which in recent years have appeared in more places, earlier in the summer.
The biggest challenge is in places with older sewer and stormwater systems that have been overwhelmed by fast-moving storms, as has happened repeatedly this summer in New Jersey and New York. The Environmental Protection Agency has put the cost of upgrading New Jersey’s stormwater system at $16 billion.
“With climate change, we’ve got more precipitation, we’ve got sea-level rise and all this aging infrastructure,” said Chris Sturm, managing director for policy and water at New Jersey Future, a group pushing for better-planned development.
But as with climate change, the blooms have aroused political passions across the country - most recently in this conservative, Republican-leaning section of New Jersey - over how dangerous they are and how to handle and prevent them. There have been crowded meetings, dueling allegations of government meddling and environmental neglect, and even conspiracy theories.
People scarce
All of it is unfolding as Lake Hopatcong businesses watch income slip away. The lake, normally buzzing with swimmers and water skiers, is so empty of humans that a black bear recently took a swim across it.
Lake Hopatcong is a many-tentacled, 4-square-mile man-made body that a century ago developed as a resort. Several restaurants along it can be approached by boat, and many houses have docks and boathouses on stilts.
Locals along the shore note with frustration that some states, like Vermont and Connecticut, have less stringent standards for what constitutes an unhealthy level of cyanobacteria, which pose health threats ranging in severity from rashes to neurological problems.
“They don’t seem as panicked about it as New Jersey,” said Laurie Murphy, 59, who runs Dow’s Boat Rental.
Role of the ‘rain tax’
And some Republican politicians have even accused state agencies of ginning up the threat as a scare tactic to promote what they call a “rain tax.”
Environment and planning advocates say that is an incorrect description of a potential solution: stormwater utilities. The utilities exist in 1,716 localities in 40 states and will be an option for New Jersey municipalities starting next month under a law signed by the Democratic governor, Philip D. Murphy.
The utilities are a mechanism for localities to charge fees to property owners based on how much stormwater runoff they generate. Runoff not only increases flooding, it sluices sewage, fertilizers and other pollutants into lakes and oceans, nourishing bacteria.
Fees would be higher for properties that have more impervious surfaces, like asphalt; commercial properties would likely pay the most.
The income would have to go to reduce and safely manage runoff, with better drainage, protective plantings like rain gardens and green roofs, and maintenance.
But Hopatcong-area Republican politicians are having none of it. Some are urging their towns to pass resolutions vowing not to establish the voluntary utilities, and at least one, Sparta, part of the lake’s watershed, has done so.
“This is a new tax, no matter how you cut it,” Assemblyman Hal Wirths of Sussex County, which shares the lake with Morris County, said at a recent hearing.
“The politicians are not helping,” said Elliott Ruga, deputy director of the New Jersey Highlands Coalition, a group of local environmental organizations that supports the utilities.
“It’s really a problem that because of ideology, we may not find a solution,” Ruga added.
Fred Lubnow, a private-sector water consultant who has worked in the community for decades, is careful not to stress climate change in public meetings and avoids discussing stormwater utilities: His job, he stresses, is to describe the “menu” of needed improvements, not how to pay for them.
This debate has played out around the country. “Rain tax” arguments often defeat stormwater utilities, even in flood-prone areas, according to a study by Western Kentucky University researchers, who recommended lengthy public education campaigns before proposing a utility. But last year, a measure passed in Los Angeles County, with the required two-thirds of the popular vote - even though it was unabashedly called a “stormwater tax.”
The problem at Lake Hopatcong resembles - to a point - climate change in miniature: A nation cannot save itself from climate change by reducing carbon emissions if other countries do not.
Pollution streams into the lake from diffuse sources. So if a few lakeside homeowners or a single town spend money and time taking measures, they could still face lake closures unless everyone in the watershed does the same.
But environmental advocates insist the parallel goes only so far.
“It’s a solvable problem,” said Sturm of New Jersey Future. “It’s just four towns in two counties that can work together.”
Two of the municipalities, Mount Arlington and Roxbury Twp., have sewers. Another, Hopatcong, started a sewer project but was unable to complete the more expensive work in rocky areas. The fourth, Jefferson Twp., has only septic tanks but requires them to be pumped out yearly.
There is a state-funded Lake Hopatcong Commission, but its budget dwindled to zero under the Christie administration; the commission was revived by the current governor, with a $500,000 budget that some legislators seek to increase.
Jessica Murphy, president of the Lake Hopatcong Foundation, lives in Maplewood, New Jersey, but summers on the lake, where she grew up sailing and sometimes sleeping in her family’s boathouse.
“You could put your ear to the floor and hear the water,” she recalled.
Upended plans
When she realized the algae bloom was stretching deep into the summer, she said, “My heart just bottomed out of my stomach.” She had planned to teach her 6-year-old daughter to water-ski, saying, “You only get one summer to be 6.” The phones at the foundation’s office were lighting up with calls from stressed business owners and residents asking what to do.
“If there is an upside, it’s that it’s forced all of us to look at our own contributing factors to this,” Murphy said. “Do I need to get my septic tank checked and buy some lake-friendly fertilizers? Conversations are happening that hadn’t been prioritized before.”
At a public beach on the lake, a busload of people from Paterson, New Jersey, some dressed in their bathing suits, had arrived unaware of the swimming ban. They were playing musical chairs instead.
At the nearby Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club, Olivia Eagles, 17, and Sean Crandal, 22, puttered past in a motorboat. Their sailing students had been sent home, the boats lined up on the dock. (Motorboating and large-boat sailing is allowed, but small sailing dinghies bring too much contact with the water.)
“You can’t have kids come here and stare at the water they’re not allowed to touch,” Crandal said.
Across the lake, a few patrons sat in hot sun on the dock outside a popular pub, the Windlass, but a manager asked reporters not to talk to them. Business was slow at a mini-golf course and nonexistent at a company renting paddleboards, which had laid off eight employees, including Alex Rivera, 19.
“I connect everything to climate change,” said Brooke Leitzel, 18, a clerk at the mini-golf course.
“I just know that I lost my job,” said Rivera.

Future of Puerto Rico's new governor in doubt

Texto completo: Moments after being sworn in as Puerto Rico's new governor, Pedro R. Pierluisi pledged in no uncertain terms that he would willingly step down in the coming days if the island's Senate voted against confirming him - even if that made him one of the shortest-serving governors ever to take office.
"I have to admit that that could happen," Pierluisi said with a chuckle. "But that's the situation."
That was on Friday. By Sunday afternoon, Pierluisi had appeared to reverse himself, arguing that the Senate had no say and that the courts would settle the issue. Then a few hours later, he was sued.
Puerto Rico remained Monday where it has been for weeks: in a state of protracted political paralysis that appears not to have been resolved by the installation of Pierluisi, who took over after former Gov. Ricardo A. Rossello's resignation became effective Friday. The territory's Supreme Court agreed to take up a legal action filed against Pierluisi's appointment.
Public furor fueled huge demonstrations against Rossello after leaked private messages showed him and his closest aides insulting Puerto Ricans. Questions over Pierluisi's legitimacy as governor left open the possibility that protesters would again take to the streets, if they see his installation as evidence of the unpopular political establishment unconstitutionally attempting to perpetuate itself in power.
"This isn't about whether Mr. Pierluisi is a good candidate, as some people have argued," said Julio E. Fontanet Maldonado, a constitutional scholar and the dean of the law school at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. "It's about defending the rule of law."
Late Sunday, the Senate president, Thomas Rivera Schatz, asked a lower court in San Juan, the capital, to grant a preliminary injunction ordering Pierluisi to cease functions as governor because he had not previously been confirmed as secretary of state by both chambers of the Legislative Assembly.
The secretary of state is next in line to succeed the governor. The House of Representatives confirmed Pierluisi as secretary of state Friday, but the Senate did not hold a hearing. Even in the case of the House vote, new questions arose Monday as to whether Pierluisi had submitted all the required paperwork before the vote.
"Puerto Rico is living a situation without historical precedent," wrote Rivera Schatz, who leads the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, which Pierluisi and Rossello also represent.
The Supreme Court said it would take up the Senate's complaint and asked for written arguments by Tuesday afternoon.
Originally, the Senate had scheduled a confirmation hearing for Pierluisi for Monday morning. But Pierluisi said that as governor, he could no longer be subject to confirmation as secretary of state. The hearing was canceled.
Pierluisi had argued during a news conference Friday that the Senate could "ratify" him as governor. But no legal framework for such a vote appears to exist in Puerto Rican law.
The Senate planned to meet in special session Monday afternoon, but Schatz said there would be no vote, according to the Associated Press. Despite his earlier waffling, Pierluisi had said Monday that he would abide by the Senate's decision.
"If the Puerto Rico Senate decides to hold any sort of vote over my incumbency, I will respect the result," Pierluisi said in a statement. "All I ask of senators before they make their decision is that they listen to the people, to whom we are all indebted."
A campaign to ask legislators to back Pierluisi has been carried out by his supporters for several days. One local television station sent a crew to interview Puerto Ricans on the street about Pierluisi; the host of the program seemed surprised that most people seemed content with his installation.
A second lawsuit against Pierluisi was filed early Monday by Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz of San Juan, who asked the Supreme Court to declare Pierluisi's swearing-in illegitimate. Cruz is a 2020 candidate for governor for the opposition Popular Democratic Party, which supports keeping Puerto Rico a United States commonwealth.
She told reporters over the weekend that while she does not support the next New Progressive official in line to be governor - Wanda Vazquez, the secretary of justice - the court must clarify existing law over the constitutional succession.
Outside the Supreme Court on Monday, Frank Torres Viada, a lawyer for the city of San Juan, described the island as being in the middle of a "judicial vacuum."
"Right now, Puerto Ricans are in a state of uncertainty, unrest and restlessness of spirit," he said, "because we don't really know who is governor of Puerto Rico." - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: Images from the arrest of a black man who was led away from the scene by mounted police who used a rope in Galveston, Texas sparked outrage during the weekend and prompted an apology from the department's chief.
The Galveston Police Department arrested 43-year-old Donald Neely, 43, who they said was arrested Saturday on a charge of criminal trespassing.
According to the New York Times, the photo was promptly posted to social media.
Chief Vernon Hale apologized to Neely in a Facebook post on Monday night.
"First and foremost, I must apologize to Mr. Neely for this unnecessary embarrassment," Hale said. "Although this is a trained technique and best practice in some scenarios, I believe our officers showed poor judgment in this instance and could have waited for a transport unit at the location of arrest."
Hale said his department has "immediately changed the policy" to prevent further use of the technique.
Dept. Statement
Practice not used correctly
The apology wasn't received well by some in the community.
Hate Crime
Many people in the black community bemoaned the symbolism of the image, saying it's reminiscent of slavery and the Jim Crow era, which highlighted violence against blacks by whites in the United States.
Don't even do a dog like that
Others questioned why the white officers couldn't wait for a car to transport their suspect opposed to marching the handcuffed Neely through the streets.
Neely is free on bond. He has no listed telephone number and couldn't be reached for comment.
Couldn't get a car?
Some black journalists even referred to cop's method of transport as using a "leash."
"Of course, it was a rope connected to his handcuffs -- effectively a leash," radio host and activist Egberto Willies wrote for the Daily KOS."Even the terrorist who killed 22 people in El Paso was escorted to the police car humanely."
Similar sentiments were shared by Leon Phillips, the president of the Galveston Coalition for Justice, according to the Times.
"If it was a white man, he wouldn't have been treated that way," Phillips said. "I guarantee there's nothing in their rules that you can put a leash on a guy while you ride down the street on a horse."
Phillips called for the two officers involved, who the Times identified as P. Brosch and A. Smith, to be fired.

La estricta Nueva York no escapa a los tiroteos masivos: 521 baleados este año, cifra en alza

Texto completo: Aunque los funcionarios de Nueva York condenaron pronto las nuevas masacres de civiles baleados en ataques al azar en otros estados del país el fin de semana, la ciudad tiene su propio problema de violencia armada.
Es cierto que el crimen de Nueva York está en niveles mínimos, pero ello no implica que no haya necesidad de controlar las armas.
Hace apenas unos días, el 27 de julio, un tiroteo masivo en una fiesta comunitaria en Brownsville (Brooklyn) dejó a una persona muerta y 11 heridos. Y la madrugada de ayer, en una vigilia en Crown Heights, cuatro personas más resultaron heridas de bala.
En el ínterin, el gobernador Andrew Cuomo firmó una ley que desde septiembre subirá de 3 a 30 días el período para tramitar un permiso de armas en Nueva York.
Específicamente en NYC, hay un auge de las pandillas violentas y varios inocentes han sido alcanzados por balas perdidas desde principios de junio en toda la ciudad, seis de ellos menores de edad.
Hasta el 28 de julio, 521 personas habían recibido disparos este año en la ciudad de Nueva York, en 441 incidentes, según la policía. Ello indica un alza frente a 501 personas disparadas en 413 incidentes en el mismo período en 2018.
Los disparos no se extienden de manera uniforme por toda la ciudad. Algunos recintos en Queens y Manhattan no han reportado ningún tiroteo este año. Otros han sumado muchos.
En el distrito 79 del Norte de Brooklyn, que incluye a Bedford-Stuyvesant, 24 personas han recibido disparos este año, incluidas las de la fiesta el 27 de julio donde los investigadores dijeron que varias víctimas tenían vínculos con pandillas.
Inmediatamente después de ese ataque en Brownsville, Eric Adams, presidente del condado de Brooklyn y otros más, pidieron que el hecho se etiquetara como un tiroteo masivo.
El alcalde Bill de Blasio inicialmente se resistió a llamarlo así, pero luego sí usó el término, destacó The New York Times.
“Nos hemos vuelto insensibles a la violencia armada en ciertas partes de la ciudad”, comentó Adams ayer. “Once personas en Park Avenue en Manhattan, es un tiroteo masivo y una crisis. Once personas baleadas en Park Place en Brooklyn, es un día (normal) en el vecindario”.
¿Cómo se compara el estado de Nueva York con otros en términos de leyes de armas?
Nueva York tiene una calificación A del “Giffords Law Center” para prevenir la violencia armada. El centro clasifica a Nueva York en el 6to de los 50 estados por la fuerza de sus leyes sobre armas, y el 48 de los 50 por tener una de las tasas más bajas de muertes por armas.
El Centro destaca que existe una correlación directa entre leyes más estrictas sobre armas y menos muertes. Pero los grupos pro derechos de armas creen que estas leyes penalizan a propietarios que son respetuosos de la ley.
¿Cuáles son las leyes de armas de Nueva York?
Después del tiroteo masivo en la escuela primaria Sandy Hook en Connecticut en 2012, el estado de Nueva York impulsó leyes más estrictas sobre armas (The Safe Act).
Esas reglas requieren que las armas de asalto se registren cada cinco años con la policía estatal, y hacen que las verificaciones sean obligatorias. en un esfuerzo por evitar que las personas con antecedentes penales graves o enfermedades mentales compren armas.
¿Cuántos delitos se cometen con armas de fuego en el estado de Nueva York?
El año pasado, hubo 7,885 crímenes violentos cometidos con armas de fuego en Nueva York, según cifras estatales. Más de 4,200 de esos crímenes ocurrieron en los cinco distritos de la ciudad de Nueva York, con pistolas como principal arma.
Muchas de las armas usadas en esos crímenes no son de acá. Según la Fiscalía general del estado, llegan a Nueva York desde lugares que no tienen leyes tan estrictas como las locales.
While gun control advocates view no single measure as a cure-all, they see tightening background checks as one of the most basic steps to diminish gun violence. Most Americans support such efforts, polls show, but the NRA portrays them as an affront to the Second Amendment.

Texto completo: Los autos sin conductor han llegado a la ciudad de Nueva York, finalmente .
Para debutar, los autos han sido situados detrás de las puertas del extenso Brooklyn Navy Yard , lejos de las calles de la ciudad repletas de autos, bicicletas y peatones.
Los automóviles comenzarán a transportar personas el miércoles alrededor de un circuito , un centro de fabricación y tecnología operado de forma privada.
Correrán los siete días de la semana para atender a los pasajeros que se dirigen hacia y desde un embarcadero recientemente inaugurado. No hay cargo por un viaje y cualquiera puede subir, reportó The New York Times.
La Corporación de Desarrollo de Brooklyn Navy Yard se asoció con Optimus Ride para la iniciativa, que incluye seis vehículos autónomos (también conocidos como AV).
Los vehículos autónomos han sido anunciados como la próxima revolución en el transporte, prometiendo mover personas y bienes de manera mucho más eficiente que los automóviles que dependen de personas detrás del volante.
Los defensores argumentan que la tecnología de conducción autónoma se puede aprovechar para aumentar la confianza y seguridad de los taxis, Ubers y autobuses, así como para hacer entregas de camiones y operar maquinaria de construcción.
También dicen que puede reducir la necesidad de autos personales y espacios de estacionamiento en ciudades congestionadas.
Pero parte de este entusiasmo desapareció después de que una mujer que andaba en bicicleta en una calle de Tempe, Arizona, fuera golpeada fatalmente el año pasado por un automóvil sin conductor que estaba siendo probado por Uber.
Fue la primera muerte peatonal conocida que involucró a un vehículo autónomo, aunque tres conductores de Tesla también murieron en los últimos años en choques que ocurrieron después de que se activó un sistema de asistencia automática al conductor.
También han sido criticados los autos autónomos que dependen del gas por el efecto invernadero que contribuyen al cambio climático.
Aún así, los vehículos autónomos continúan siendo probados en más de una docena de comunidades en todo el país , según Samuel I. Schwartz, consultor de transporte.
Añadió que casi todos estos autos autónomos están confinados a áreas cerradas, aunque algunos han operado de forma limitada en vías públicas.
Driverless cars have rolled into New York City. But don’t expect to see them traveling down Fifth Avenue anytime soon. https://t.co/RsTKwzjRbM

Texto completo: Now, more from my interview with Washington Post sports columnist John Feinstein, the author of 35 books.
"Quarterback" was the prolific author's current book when we talked by phone while he was driving back East after attending the Final Four. Among his New York Times bestsellers is 1986's "A Season on the Brink." That's the book about the year he shadowed Indiana University's basketball team and its infamously (wink) equanimous coach Bobby Knight.
There's a Minnesota connection to "A Season on the Brink," thanks to Sid Hartman, Strib sports columnist.
Q: When was the last time you crossed paths with Bob Knight, and how did that go?
A: It was May of 2018. It was at the players championship. He was participating in a celebrity event. I was standing in the lobby talking to David Cone, the old pitcher, who was also playing in the event. Bob was on the other side of the lobby talking to a guy named Jeff Sluman, who once won the PGA championship. David said to me, "If Bob Knight comes over here right now, what's going to happen?" I said, "David, I have no idea. He might ignore me, he might curse me out, he might hug me." I've had all those responses from him at different times.
Bob came over a few minutes later and could not have been more friendly. David said, "What happened?" I said, "Well, I guess he remembers who I am, but he has forgotten how much he hates me."
Q: Isn't Bobby Knight in his 70s?
A: 78.
Q: OK. Well, Sid Hartman, who was still a pistol through his 70s and 80s, just turned 99, and he's finally mellowing, somewhat.
A: I saw him at the games this weekend. I'll tell you a Minnesota story.
As I am sure you know, Sid has been friends with Knight for years and years and years. Indiana lost a game at Iowa on a Thursday night. They got hammered. Then Knight flew from Iowa to Minneapolis because they were going to play Minnesota Saturday night. After a loss, Knight would make coaches stay up until 3 or 4 in the morning looking at the tape because he knew there was a secret in there somewhere.
So we got up for breakfast the next morning on about four hours' sleep and Sid came walking into breakfast. When [Knight] is in a bad mood he'll just ignore people, even friends of his. He wouldn't even look up and Sid sat down. He understood what was going on, he didn't say anything.
Walking out of breakfast, [Sid asked Feinstein], "What are you going to do all day in the snow?" It was February. Surprise, it's snowing. I said, "Well, I'm just going to do what I do every day, Sid. I'm going to follow Knight around," and Bob whirled, pointed his finger in my face and started screaming. "Don't you ever call me Knight! Who do you think you are? You're 28 blanking years old. You call me Bob. You call me coach. Don't you ever call me Knight!"
I had learned by then you can't have an argument with him in front of his coaches. He's got to win the argument. I said, "Well, I'll see you at practice." And I went for a walk in the snow.
I was very frustrated and tired and I said to myself: "Every day we're on the brink of another disaster. Win or loss, we are on the brink of something every single day." And I said, "Wait a minute. That's the title to the book, 'A Season on the Brink.' "
So, Sid Hartman was indirectly responsible for me coming up with the title to that book.
Q: That's very sweet, but let me get this straight. It's OK to call him "coach" or "Bob," but "Knight" is disrespectful?
A: Someone got fired because a kid walked past him one day and said, "What's up, Knight?" and Knight went ballistic. When Knight went testy, I wasn't talking to him. I was talking to Sid. What I was doing was putting myself down, like I don't have any life, I'm just going to follow Knight around like I always do.

Associated Press Explains: What Is The Online Forum 8chan?

Texto completo: NEW YORK - An anonymous online forum called 8chan has drawn attention in the wake of mass shootings in Texas and Ohio because violent U.S. extremists have used it to share tips and encourage one another. The site suffered sporadic outages Monday after its cybersecurity provider cut off support for what it called a "cesspool of hate."
WHAT IS 8CHAN?
The online message board dates back to 2013. Under the banner of free speech, it allows users to post graphic and extremist content and doesn't censor posts.
The site has been linked to violent extremists. Police are investigating commentary posted on 8chan believed to have been written by the suspect in a shooting Saturday that killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas.
If there is a connection, it would be the third known instance of a shooter posting to the site before going on a rampage. In March, the gunman in mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques posted a rambling manifesto to the site, as did another who injured several people and killed one at a California synagogue in April.
8chan's founder, Fredrick Brennan, is no longer running the site. In an interview with The New York Times on Monday, he said the site wasn't doing any good and called for it to be shut down .
WHY DID 8CHAN GO DOWN?
The site went down briefly after security provider Cloudflare said it would stop supporting the site. Without Cloudflare, the site was vulnerable to outside hackers who shut down the site.
"8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hate," Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince wrote. "They have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths."
CAN 8CHAN BE SHUT DOWN?
8chan's popularity rose after the similarly named but unaffiliated site 4chan cracked down on more extreme posts. Because the U.S. doesn't specifically outlaw domestic terrorism the way it does foreign-sponsored extremism, such sites enjoy broad protection from government oversight under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.
Even if that weren't the case, content on sites like 8chan are also difficult to stamp out because users can simply move on if moderators grow stricter or if a site shuts down.
"Dealing with incitement to violence and hatred online goes well beyond any one platform," the American Defamation League's Oren Segal said.
"These hate and racist posts will find another way to get their message out and another site with less scruples will pop up to host them," added Tim Bajarin, a technology columnist and president of Creative Strategies. "The internet has always been a Wild, Wild West medium with very little controls to keep this type of harmful commentary from seeing the light of day."
WHAT ABOUT REGULATION?
Mutale Nkonde, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard, said it's time to think about creating a legal definition for harmful speech that could be regulated.
"We need to seriously balance do we want to be secure as a nation and have the ability to go to Walmart or we want to protect the speech of those who want to destroy our country from within?" she said.
But there has been resistance to passing legislation, said David Kaye, the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of expression and a University of California-Irvine law professor.
"It's very difficult to get any kind of law adopted in the United States," Kaye said. "Even after these terrible crimes and the connection the 8chan forum has to them, I don't see much of a likelihood of a pretty serious debate about how the companies should be regulated."
Kaye said that in the absence of U.S. government action on online speech, the most Americans can hope for is that companies like Cloudflare are transparent about their policies regarding hate speech - and what should be regarded as incitement to violence and not tolerated.
"There is probably horrible content that's being hosted by its clients in other parts of the world," he said, "but is it applying the same measures there?"

UNITY CAN BE WORSE THAN PARTISANSHIP EXCESSIVE UNITY CULTIVATES GROUPTHINK AND BREEDS CONTEMPT FOR DISSENT

Texto completo: I want to put in a good word for partisanship.
This might sound strange to some readers. I've written a lot about our problem with tribalism, including hyper-partisanship and political polarization. It was a major theme of my cheerily titled book "Suicide of the West." So I'm happy to concede that too much partisanship - or partisanship of the wrong kind - can be very bad.
But unity can be bad too. Excessive unity cultivates groupthink and breeds contempt for dissent. It tends to ride roughshod over minorities, and not just in the sense of racial, religious or sexual groups. Ideological minorities - including the smallest minority, the individual - can get trampled by the unity stampede (as my friend Kevin Williamson masterfully elucidates in his new book, "The Smallest Minority").
Self-described nationalists insist the country needs more unity - around their ideas. Self-described socialists also crave unity, but only around their agenda. At various times and places, Catholics, Protestants, Muslims and Hindus have all strived for unity, but only on their terms. In any large society, the demand for unity is usually the demand for power in a winner-take-all contest between different groups.
Our Constitution is set up around the idea that unity is scarier than disunity. The founders designed a system that prevented any one group, or "faction," from imposing its one-size-fits-all unity on everybody.
Ironically, the founders never envisioned political parties as a major component of this system. James Madison eventually embraced parties, but most of the founders were closer to Thomas Jefferson's view that if the only way he could get into heaven was by joining a party, he wouldn't go.
It was Martin Van Buren, the eighth president and true architect of the two-party system, who understood how crucial parties were. He studied the so-called Era of Good Feelings after the War of 1812, when the country was supposedly united under a single party. But, as political scientist Joseph Postell writes, "The problem with the Era of Good Feelings is that it was actually an era of bitter feelings and bitter conflict." It's just that the conflicts were between factions within the government.
"Party unity was premised on having another party, a common enemy, to oppose," Mr. Postell notes in a brilliant paper published by the Heritage Foundation. "Without that opposition, political conflict occurred within the party and the Administration."
Partisans have all manner of incentives to poke holes in the opposition's arguments and proposals - some patriotic and principled, some more base and selfish. But the process of political combat, which is supposed to take place in Congress, not on cable TV or Twitter, should get us closer to both the truth and a consensus about the way forward. The public is supposed to be the jury. Unfortunately, too many jurors only want to hear arguments from either the defense or the prosecution.
It's a cliché to note that the party out of power only cares about deficits and debt when it is out of power. This hypocrisy is annoying and at times dishonorable. But it's better than the alternative. If it's true that unlimited borrowing, mostly from China, to pay for things we can't afford is bad, better to have someone saying so, even if they're doing it for cynical purposes. Such complaints at least serve to check runaway deficit spending.
This week we crossed a Rubicon with the new bipartisan budget deal proposed by President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It marks the end of either party even pretending to care about such things. It's a victory of the sort of bipartisanship and unity so many claim this country needs. And it is a perfect example of how unity around a bad thing is worse than disunity over what constitutes a good thing.

Texto completo: I'll say this - and it's not much - about President Donald Trump's incendiary tweet attacks on Rep. Elijah Cummings and the city of Baltimore: At least, for a change, he's laid off my beloved Chicago.
The Republican president has treated Chicago, hometown of his predecessor President Barack Obama, as his favorite symbol of "American carnage," although he displays virtually no real knowledge of the real city.
I therefore braced myself for another Chicago hit after Trump made headlines over the weekend with a tweet that called Cummings' Baltimore district "a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess." He said that "no human being would want to live there." He later called Cummings, who is Black, a "racist."
I braced myself because Trump's tweet was based on a Fox News report on Baltimore's rat problem. The report cited a list put out by the pest control company Orkin on the cities with the highestnumber of residential and commercial rodent treatments in 2018.
Baltimore actually ranked ninth on the list. At the top, unfortunately, was my beloved Chicago, although I don't expect Chicagoans to pour into the streets to chant "We're No. 1" about this list
Nevertheless, Chicago is dealing with this problem just as Los Angeles and New York, respectively second and third on the list, are doing. Bashing Democrat-run cities has become a long-running trope among some Republicans, even though 10 of the nation's 12 poorest states in the union (Alabama, South Carolina, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, Idaho, Florida and Mississippi), according to U.S. Census data and the National Conference of State Legislatures, have Republican governors andlegislatures in which the Grand Old Party has majorities in both houses.
Media that want to offer a little balance have noted that Baltimore's rats sometimes have been encouraged by New Yorkers, such as JaredKushner, a NewYork real estate magnate and Trump's son-in-law. A 2017 investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times called "The Beleaguered Tenants of Kushnerville," reports conditions that led to lawsuits and 200 fines in 9,000 apartments owned by Kushner's company.
But let's face it. Trump's attacks have virtually nothing to do with his concern for living conditions in Baltimore compared with what they have to do with punishing Cummings. As chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, he pressed a tough case against Trump's border policy last week and also is conducting multiple investigations of the president.
And attacking Cummings also provides red meat for Trump's base during his never-ending re-election campaign
As Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot suggested when asked by reporters whether Trump was racist: Don't over-think it
"Racism is a part of who he is. It is a part of his strategy," Light-foot said Monday.
But everyone also should avoid being distracted by the race question from "what people actually care about and what they need," she said. "What they need is leadership."
Indeed, actions speaklouder than labels. Office-seekers in our democracy have a choice. They can try to win by dividing people along lines of race and other differences or theycan act to bring people together by emphasizing what we share in common.
Trump made his choice quite clear when he first announced his 2016 presidential campaign by attacking Mexican immigrants as "bringing drugs," "bringing crime, "they're rapists," as well as some who "I assume are good people."
More recently he has made public enemies out of "the squad," a quartet of freshman House Democrats and women of color whom Trump has told on Twitter to "go back" to where they came from instead of criticizing his administration. All four of the women - Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan; Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota - are U.S. citizens, and only Omar was born outside the U.S.
Trump's telling Cummings to go take care of his district and stop investigating his affairs strikes the ear much like the "Send her back!" chant that Trump's rally crowd in Greenville, North Carolina, employed. Both are just another version of the old and shameful message that too many members of minority groups still hear, "Go back where you came from."
Can Trump's version of white identity politics win in 2020? That's up to us voters.

Lina Nilsson: Is Utah poised to become the best place for women in tech?

Texto completo: I build innovative tech products for a living and moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Utah about a year and a half ago. Recently, I was in a meeting and realized that I have been forgetting to deploy my standard meeting “tools”: I haven’t been resetting my chair height uncomfortably high to appear as tall as the guys and I have been jotting down notes for all to see. And yet, no one at Recursion, my high-tech biotech employer here in Salt Lake City, has asked me to be the permanent official note taker or bring in more coffee.
In other words: I’ve taken down my defenses and been able to focus on the technical work I do best — without being consistently reduced to “office housework,” a duty scholars show is more likely to fall on women than men.
Here’s some sobering statistics: Utah has the nation’s largest gender wage gap. And women are the least likely to be employed in a STEM field in the Beehive State. But I’d like to propose another emerging stat: Utah could become one of the best places to be a woman in tech.
In the tech community, Silicon Valley is the model for all other tech hubs. Before you shake your head, consider all the names aspiring hubs give themselves: Silicon Slopes in Salt Lake City, Silicon Alley in New York City, Silicon Hills in Austin. The list goes on. But what if the world’s global center for high-tech is the past, not the future? Particularly for women.
Roughly 20 percent of technical roles in Silicon Valley-tech companies are held by women. Female-led companies get a mere two percent of venture capital funding. Women have higher career dropout rates and lower participation in leadership, too.
I work at a machine learning-biotech startup in Salt Lake City. But I have also spent nine years in the San Francisco Bay Area.The dynamics of being a woman in tech are simply different in Utah. We have been given both a risk and an opportunity to shape its future.
In the book “Brotopia,” reporter Emily Chang writes about the origins of Silicon Valley’s often toxic gender dynamics: how the culture, practices and employees of a small initial ecosystem of tech startups during the dawn of the commercial internet age in the late 1990s — the “PayPal Mafia” — spread across the industry. Today’s California tech companies have inherited a culture that over-values ruthlessness, homogeneity, and a path to success driven by “bro-networks.”
Many Silicon Valley companies are investing heavily in fixing these imbalances, which disproportionately affect women and minorities. But even the ‘equality trailblazers’ are struggling to make progress within this large, established ecosystem. Facebook, for example, has a massive gender equity effort supported by the vision of COO and “Lean In” author Sheryl Sandberg. Still, the company reports mere 1-3 percent yearly increases in the number of females in tech roles. In the industry more broadly, the numbers, and gender dynamics, are barely budging.
Salt Lake City has a chance to change that. Today, we have a small but rapidly growing ecosystem of modern high-tech firms. This means that seemingly small, initial actions by the leaders of these companies can have larger ripple effects than Facebook could achieve in Silicon Valley (and despite its massive investment).
For example: when the CEO of Recursion sets concrete company goals on diversity in recruiting and encourages community events like our Women in Science and Technology speaker series, this really matters. But when another Utah CEO stands up in front of thousands at the region’s largest tech conference and demeans the women attendees by suggesting they only showed up to crush on a certain pro-athlete guest speaker, this also really matters. We are setting the tone for the tech expansion to come.
This is a call to action for Utah tech leaders. We have all the pieces for Silicon Slopes to emerge not as a belated Silicon Valley clone, but as a next-generation tech hub. The way you shape diversity at your companies today — from large-scale policies to the 140 characters you tweet — will affect not just your company’s success, it will shape the way our local tech community grows. It is up to you whether Utah is the best — or the worst — place for a woman in tech.

Texto completo: Passengers on the New Haven line described “nightmare” train rides from New York to Connecticut early Sunday morning after hours-long delays caused by thunderstorms.
Some riders said they spent several hours stranded on the tracks and shuffled between trains after leaving Grand Central early Sunday morning. On one train, riders said they were given emergency drinking water, while others were given no food or drink as rain water dripped down the center aisle.
“It was a nightmare and people were furious,” said Carole Heller, a Fairfield resident whose train left the 153rd Street Station near Yankees Stadium around 11:30 p.m. and then stopped for about two hours near the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.
Trains on the New Haven and Harlem lines were delayed for 60 to 90 minutes for part of Sunday morning, said Lizelly Gutierrez, a spokeswoman from Metro-North Railroad. The Harlem line was on schedule by around 9 a.m. while the New Haven line was on time by around 11:15 a.m, Metro-North tweeted.
Saturday night’s thunderstorm caused problems between Mount Vernon east and New Rochelle on the New Haven line, while a tree fell on the tracks on the Harlem line, Gutierrez said.
On one New Haven line train that left Grand Central Station at 12:07 a.m., Metro-North workers gave “five-year shelf-life emergency drinking water” to passengers once they had been stuck on the train for about two hours, Hearst Connecticut Media Reporter Ethan Fry tweeted.
Fry, a passenger on the train, said he arrived in Fairfield shortly before 7 a.m.—nearly seven hours after leaving Grand Central.
Passengers were stranded in Wakefield around 2:30 a.m. and then taken off the train at Botanical Garden Station, where Fry said hundreds of people were “herded” onto diesel train that made local stops on the way to New Haven.
Heller said she, her son and 11-year-old grandson arrived at Westport at 2:30 a.m., about two hours later than they expected. She described the ride as hot, crowded and exhausting.
Passengers were told the rain had caused signal problems, she said. Lights were on in the train, but the aisle was wet from the rain that had poured in from the open doors when passengers boarded, Heller said.
“People were really annoyed,” she said. “No one rioted, but the thought was in the air.”
Passengers joked about wanting the train employees to bring them pizza, but only saw the conductor in the beginning of the ride when their tickets were checked, Heller said.
“The only thing we heard was the disembodied voice on the PA system,” she said. “We didn’t see any kind of a railroad employee.”
Another passenger said it took five hours and 38 minutes to reach Connecticut after leaving Grand Central at 12:07 a.m.
“As we enter hour 6 of our journey, the sun is rising, as are my hopes that I will see my home again soon,” tweeted Adam Bernard, a Fairfield resident who runs an entertainment blog.
Neil Vigdor, a reporter with The New York Times, described his trip as the “train ride from hell.” His train left Grand Central at 12:25 a.m. Sunday and arrived in Greenwich five hours and 13 minutes later, he tweeted.
The train took an hour and 20 minutes to go the 11 miles from Grand Central to just past Fordham, Vigdor said. Passengers were taken off the train in Wakefield around 3 a.m. before going to Botanical Gardens, where they boarded the diesel train, he said.
Delays on the New Haven line began around 11:45 p.m. Saturday when weather-related power issues near East Norwalk led to single-tracking between East Norwalk and Greens Farms, Metro-North tweeted. These delays were up to 20 minutes, Metro-North said. Delays were then reported between Mount Vernon East and Harrison.
By around 1:15 a.m., delays were up to 100 minutes on the New Haven line because of weather-related signal power issues. The 1:47 a.m. and 1:53 a.m. trains were delayed at Grand Central
On the Harlem line, the 7:10 p.m. Saturday train from Grand Central to Southeast was delayed 15 minutes because of a tree that fell near Croton Falls around 9 p.m., Metro-North tweeted. The tree caused “third rail damage,” Metro-North said.
This fallen tree caused a connecting train to be late and led to delays on the Wassaic Branch, too. A 1:51 a.m. train from Southeast to Dover Plains operated 130 minutes late because of this, according to Metro-North.
A bus service between Katonah and Southeast on the Harlem Line was set up around 11:15 p.m. and later between Croton Falls and Southeast. Delays were up to 25 minutes around 3:30 a.m. and 10 to 15 minutes by 4:45 a.m., Metro-North said.
The 4:14 a.m. and 5:04 a.m. trains heading from Southeast to Grand Central were also delayed because of a fallen tree near Purdy’s. Delays were estimated at 30 to 60 minutes, Metro-North tweeted.
Heller rides the Metro-North infrequently, but has never had a problem this severe.
“Somehow Metro-North needs to be pressured on this stuff,” she said. “This is not acceptable.”

Top House Republican says violent video games could be linked to mass shootings

Texto completo: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. , said video games could contribute to future mass shootings when asked about it in a television interview on Sunday morning. Appearing on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" in the wake of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, McCarthy was asked about how to understand factors contributing to a shooting.
"This may be a place where we could find this ahead of time," said McCarthy who discussed ways to detect future shooters.
"The idea that these video games that dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals," continued McCarthy, "I've always felt that it's a problem for future generations and others. We've watched studies show what it does to individuals, and you look at these photos of how it took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.

McCarthy added that he wanted to "get all the facts. "
"But what I'd like to do is get all the facts, are there indications? There are times before that we have found this," he said.
McCarthy's comments came after a mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart left 20 people dead and 26 injured and before a shooting spree early Sunday at an entertainment district in Dayton, Ohio left at least nine dead and 16 hurt.
The New York Times reported last year that there was little evidence to suggest there was any link between video games and mass shootings.
Among other evidence, the New York Times cites a 2011 court opinion from conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, "Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively.

The troublesome federal judge who escaped accountability

Texto completo: While we shouldn't rejoice at Manuel Real's death, his passing offers some good news: California's most troublesome federal judge is off the bench.
While federal judges are appointed for life, the fact that it required death to retire Real is a scandal that survives him. The 53-year career of Real — the nation's longest-serving active judge — offers lessons about the character, impunity, and impotence of our leaders.
If those first two paragraphs seem harsh, it may because you read the ludicrously glowing obituaries following Real's death this summer. The New York Times, L.A. Times, Associated Press and legal publications portrayed him as a judicial giant. Appointed to the bench by LBJ in 1966, Real courageously ordered the desegregation of the Pasadena schools in the early 1970s and blocked President Trump's efforts to strip funds from local police departments that don't cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.
"A towering legal figure," the L.A. Times called him. Stories approvingly quoted a statement from Central District of California Chief Judge Virginia A. Phillips calling Real the court's "heart and soul" and adding: "His legacy of public service is an inspiration beyond compare."
Real's record is incomparable, but let's pray it's not an inspiration.
What the obituaries missed was Real's routinely awful treatment of people in his courtroom, and a decision-making style so rushed and lawless that he was routinely reversed by higher courts. In 2006, Congress even held a hearing about impeaching him.
Being from Pasadena, I've known Real's name since I was a kid, given his heroic role in the desegregation cases. So it was a shock when, as an L.A. Times journalist, I covered hearings in his courtroom. I have never seen a judge as tyrannical as Real. He's the only judge to ever threaten me with contempt. For what? I don't know. I was quietly sitting, taking notes.
Real sometimes justified his behavior in the name of speed and efficiency. But his behavior encouraged disrespect for the law. He prevented jurors from taking notes or having courtroom testimony read back to them. He often yelled or cut off questioning of witnesses in nonsensical ways.
When challenged, he repeated a bizarre mantra: "Counsel, this is not Burger King! In this courtroom, we do it my way!"
Real "created a courtroom of terror," attorney Victor Sherman once told the L.A. Times.
"I'm sorry, but he acts like a 5-year-old with power," attorney Harland Braun told The Nation.
That Real was a menace was no secret, but no one could knock him off the bench. Not his fellow judges, who suffered his tenure as the central district's chief judge. Not the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judges who repeatedly removed him from cases when he ignored their orders.
Real survived even after he mishandled a trust fund containing the assets of Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos. And he kept going despite analyses that found he was reversed in one-third of all cases — twice the average for federal judges — and two-thirds of the time in major cases, often for basic procedural failings.
So why did Manuel Real get the generous judgment in death that he denied many who appeared before him?
Part of it is the human reluctance to criticize the deceased. Real also could be charming and public-spirited outside the courtroom; an elementary school is named for him in Perris, in Riverside County, because he helped establish a school district there.
But there are two other, more troubling explanations. First, in these highly politicized times, we have the bad habit of conflating ideology — Real was a liberal — with character. Second, the American system provides no practical way to remove people who violate norms and abuse their power, be they federal judges or — as today's news demonstrates — the president of the United States.
Even after his death, those who know better won't challenge Real. If you're expecting judges to protect us from tyrants, you'll be disappointed.

Texto completo: Greetings to you, "Hello, Dolly!" And happy anniversary, too.
The touring company of the hit revival, with Tony winner Betty Buckley as the irrepressible Dolly Levi, arrives at the Benedum Center, Downtown, Tuesday to close out Pittsburgh CLO's summer season.
And next week, on Aug. 11, the movie version of "Hello, Dolly!" - with Barbra Streisand directed by Pittsburgh's Gene Kelly - will celebrate its 50th anniversary a little early. The film debuted Dec. 16, 1969, but on Aug. 11 and 14, it will reappear in select movie theaters courtesy of Fathom Events and the TCM Big Screen Classics series.
The story, set in Yonkers and New York City in the 1890s, centers on a strong-willed widow who arranges marriages. She's also in search of husband No. 2 for herself and sets her sights on the irascible Horace Vandergelder while generally scheming for the benefit of several younger couples.
Carol Channing was 43 when she originated the role of Dolly on Broadway, while "Funny Girl" star Streisand was 27 when she played the role in the 1969 movie version. Streisand's relative youth did not sit well with some critics, zeroing in on the idea of a widow pursuing a wealthy older gent - Walter Matthau, then 49, as Horace Vandergelder.
In his New York Times review, Vincent Canby wrote, "I had the odd feeling that she must have been married to him at the age of 8 and lost him at 10" when she was widowed, for someone as young as Streisand to be playing Dolly.
On Broadway, though, the most recent revival has been a boon for actors of a certain age. Bernadette Peters, 71, and Donna Murphy, 60, followed or backed up Bette Midler, 73, who won a Tony Award in the 2017 revival that spawned the current tour, starring Buckley.
Here are some more facts and figures about the "Dollys" to get you on your way "Before the Parade Passes By."
On stage
Some fans may know Buckley, 72, through her TV work, from "Eight Is Enough" to HBO's "Oz," but the Theater Hall of Famer may be best known for her Tony-winning role in "Cats." She was Broadway's original Grizabella - the role being played by Jennifer Hudson in the upcoming screen version of "Cats" - and so memorably sang the showstopping "Memory."
Buckley inaugurated the Trust Cabaret Series in Pittsburgh in 2012.
The storied history of the Jerry Herman-Michael Stewart musical, "suggested" by Thornton Wilder's "The Matchmaker," began in 1964. CLO has welcomed "Hello, Dolly!" twice before, in 1986 and 2004, and the original musical Dolly, Channing, played the role here in 1994.
Louis Armstrong made the title song his signature in 1964 and won the best male vocal performance Grammy. When asked about topping the charts with "Dolly," he is quoted as saying, "It sure feels good to be up there with those Beatles." He also sang the song in the 1969 film version.
On screen
The movie was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won three: for production design, sound mixing and "original musical" - best original score today.
Kelly was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award, while Michael Kidd was the choreographer for a cast that included future "Phantom of the Opera" Michael Crawford, Walter Matthau and Tommy Tune.
Although Times movie critic Canby eviscerated the movie as overblown - a relatively kind word that he did not use - and it has a 43% rating among critics on Rotten Tomatoes, the audience rating is a fresh 76%.
Writing for AwardsCircuit.com, Christopher James said the movie deserved better than its reputation would suggest. "The film may be famous in its own right as a [Barbra] Streisand musical vehicle," he wrote in April, when "Dolly" closed out the TCM Classics Film Festival. "However, 'Hello Dolly' is arguably more famous for its high $25 million production budget. Despite being in the top five grossers of 1969, the film was a money loser at the time. This signaled the end of the grand '60s musicals."

Texto completo: Could an emerging technology reshape the battle lines in the abortion debate? Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, that fight has been defined by the interlocking, absolute values of choice and life: For some, a woman's right to choose trumps any claim to a right to life by the fetus; for others, it's the reverse. But what if we could separate those two -- what if a woman's choice to terminate a pregnancy no longer meant terminating the fetus itself?
That is the promise of artificial wombs, a technology that has already shown some success in tests on sheep fetuses. Early in a ewe's pregnancy, the lamb fetus is removed from her body and placed in a synthetic uterine environment in which it receives nutrients and fluids, and continues to develop to term, a process researchers call ectogenesis.
Artificial human wombs are still far in the future, and there are of course other ethical issues to consider. But for now, the technology is developed enough to raise new questions for the abortion debate.
In a 2017 issue of the journal Bioethics, two philosophers, Jeremy V. Davis, a visiting professor at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and Eric Mathison, a postdoctoral associate at Baylor College of Medicine, argue that while a woman has a right to remove a fetus from her body, she does not have the right to kill it. The problem is that, for now, the latter is inherent in the former.
Their argument builds upon that of the pro-choice philosopher Judith Jarvis Thompson, who famously argued in her 1971 paper "A Defense of Abortion" that women have a right to not carry a fetus for nine months -- but that women do not have a right to be guaranteed the death of the fetus.
Such arguments point toward a disjunction in the abortion debate. Ectogenesis is the answer.
Synthetic wombs have an appeal far beyond the abortion debate, of course. They could revolutionize premature birth, which the World Health Organization calls the number one cause of death among children under 5.
The most advanced research in ectogenesis is underway at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where sheep fetuses have been removed from their mothers' bodies after 105 to 120 days -- the equivalent, in a human, of 22 to 24 weeks -- and placed in "biobags," clear plastic containers filled with amniotic fluid. So far the lambs have developed with few complications.
Biobag technology could be available for humans in as little as one to three years, according to Dr. Alan Flake, a fetal surgeon in charge of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia artificial womb experiments. Another team performing ectogenesis research at the University of Michigan also believes they could have devices ready for humans in a similar time frame.
Some major supporters of artificial wombs are transhumanists, who believe in using technology to improve human health, intelligence and quality of life. Women's rights activists likewise support the research, aiming to free the female body.
But the promise of artificial wombs should appeal most to conservatives looking to reduce the 600,000 abortions performed annually in the United States, but pessimistic about the chance of overturning Roe any time soon. Every fetus that was going to be aborted but instead makes it into an artificial womb could be considered a life saved.
Dr. Daniel Deen, an assistant professor of philosophy at Concordia University in Irvine, Calif., recently said in an interview with the website Leapsmag: "If the technology gets developed, I could not see any Christians, liberal or conservative, arguing that people seeking abortion ought not opt for a 'transfer' versus an abortive procedure."
Obviously, the idea that science could short-circuit a moral debate is discomforting for some. As artificial wombs improve, biobags are likely to become a hot-button topic for conservatives, who will have to decide how far they want to use technology to accomplish their ethical goals.
There are practical challenges, too: Artificial womb transplants and births are sure to be dramatically more expensive than the typical 15-minute abortion procedure, which costs around $ 500. And if even a quarter of those fetuses that would have been aborted are brought to term artificially, 150,000 babies a year would be born, almost all of them likely to be put up for adoption -- more than the total number of annual adoptions in the United States. Who will pay for those procedures, and who will care for those children once they are born?
It is unlikely that the abortion debate will be resolved soon -- certainly not as a legal matter. But as a practical and philosophical one, artificial wombs offer a way for both sides in the debate to move forward. The only question is whether we are willing to accept the increasingly central -- and beneficial -- role that technology can play in resolving what were once considered immutable human problems.

An estate planning lawyer’s approach to blended families

Texto completo: This is part three in a series of five articles discussing the following case hypothetical from the various professional perspectives:
A and B are getting married. A has two kids from a previous marriage. B has one child from a prior marriage. They plan to have children together. A receives child support from a former spouse. A’s mother also lives with them and helps care for the children. B’s only child works in B’s business and both A and B hope their joint child(ren) will one day join the business as well. A and B have a lot to discuss!
The first thing I would tell A and B about their estate planning is “don’t try to plan for the next 20 years right now.” Trying to plan for too many “what ifs” can cause analysis paralysis. The best practice is to get a plan in place that addresses the “what ifs” of the next three to five years. That’s particularly true for A and B — newlyweds with a newly blended family. That’s why trusts are living documents — they need to be reviewed and adjusted over time as families, circumstances and laws change.
As long as you remain competent and alive, you can amend your trust. And if you don’t, well, you’ve put the right plan in place at the right time.
Currently, there are minor children involved. Were A to pass away, A may want or need to plan for the support and care of the children rather than B, who is likely self-sufficient and not dependent on A’s support at this early stage in their relationship. Later, when A’s children are grown and gone, A is more likely to want or need to provide for B.
B currently has to think about B’s business. In the event of B’s death, B may want to see B’s child carry on the business. If A needs an income stream from B’s estate however, an outright transfer of the business might not work. B’s options would include keeping the business owned by a trust with income paid to A, but with B’s child still running the business and getting a salary. Or, perhaps B can obtain life insurance that would pay to A and allow the business to be transferred to his child.
Life insurance or some other income stream (retirement plans, annuities, etc.) of B are useful here. If A is significantly younger than B, or close in age to B’s child, and B plans to provide for A first, then B’s child, there could be tension. A plan that has a child “waiting around for step-parent to die” can be an invitation to discord (witness the step-parent vs. children disputes of celebrities like Casey Kasem, Robin Williams and Glen Campbell).
If B has a stream of income that can be directed to either B’s child or A with the remaining assets going to the other of them, that can reduce tension. This may give the best hope for a continuing relationship between a child and a step-parent.
In the event of A’s death or incapacity, does the surviving biological parent (e.g. A’s ex-spouse) have custody of the minor children? If so, A may not be able to plan for B’s involvement with the children, but perhaps leaving money in trust with B as the trustee will at least assure some contact and oversight. If not, A will need to carefully consider whether A’s mother or B should be named guardian of the children.
At a minimum, A will want to get powers of attorney and health care directives for minors that allow for A’s mother and B to take care of the children in an emergency, including making health care decisions for the children if A is not able to.
If A and B should die together, who gets what and when requires careful analysis.
A’s children are younger than B’s one child, and if they have additional children in the future, the age gap will be greater. A and B can consider a “common trust” that holds all assets in one trust for the benefit of all children until the youngest child reaches a certain age or graduates from college.
The trustee makes distribution for “health, education, support and maintenance” of all the children, but is not required to do so equally. This gives the youngest child the same advantages as the older children for whom college, a car, perhaps a wedding, was already paid for prior to their parents’ passing.
When the youngest child reaches the stated age, the trust can be divided into shares for the children and distributed outright or over time when each child hits a certain age. The size of those shares is another area for discussion.
Does B’s child get half and A’s children split the other half? If A and B have a child together does that child get a portion of each half? The short-term answer is likely to be much different than the answer 20 years from now.
The decisions to be made will necessarily take into consideration whether there is a large disparity between the assets of A and B, and there are many formulas and approaches to deciding what’s “fair.”
I would say to A and B what I often say to my clients: This may be the first time you’ve had to design your estate plan, but your lawyer has done hundreds if not thousands of plans. No matter how complicated you may think your family is, it’s our job to help you figure out what works for your family, to provide some options for you, and get it all documented.
Then A and B can concentrate on the fun parts of their upcoming Brady Bunch life together. And I’d also say congratulations! And best wishes! And I’ll see you again in three to five years.

At a minimum, A will want to get powers of attorney and health care directives for minors that allow for A’s mother and B to take care of the children in an emergency, including making health care decisions for the children if A is not able to.
If A and B should die together, who gets what and when requires careful analysis.
A’s children are younger than B’s one child, and if they have additional children in the future, the age gap will be greater. A and B can consider a “common trust” that holds all assets in one trust for the benefit of all children until the youngest child reaches a certain age or graduates from college.
The trustee makes distribution for “health, education, support and maintenance” of all the children, but is not required to do so equally. This gives the youngest child the same advantages as the older children for whom college, a car, perhaps a wedding, was already paid for prior to their parents’ passing.
When the youngest child reaches the stated age, the trust can be divided into shares for the children and distributed outright or over time when each child hits a certain age. The size of those shares is another area for discussion.
Does B’s child get half and A’s children split the other half? If A and B have a child together does that child get a portion of each half? The short-term answer is likely to be much different than the answer 20 years from now.
The decisions to be made will necessarily take into consideration whether there is a large disparity between the assets of A and B, and there are many formulas and approaches to deciding what’s “fair.”
I would say to A and B what I often say to my clients: This may be the first time you’ve had to design your estate plan, but your lawyer has done hundreds if not thousands of plans. No matter how complicated you may think your family is, it’s our job to help you figure out what works for your family, to provide some options for you, and get it all documented.
Then A and B can concentrate on the fun parts of their upcoming Brady Bunch life together. And I’d also say congratulations! And best wishes! And I’ll see you again in three to five years.

Texto completo: Let's not rejoice at Manuel Real's death. But his passing offers some good news: California's most troublesome federal judge is off the bench. While federal judges are appointed for life, the fact that it required death to retire Real is a scandal that survives him. The 53-year career of Real — the nation's longest-serving active judge — offers ugly lessons about character, impunity, and the impotence of our leaders.
If those first two paragraphs seem harsh, it may because you read the ludicrously glowing obituaries following Real's death this summer. The New York Times, L.A. Times, Associated Press and legal publications portrayed his career as that of a judicial giant. Appointed to the bench by LBJ in 1966, Real courageously ordered the desegregation of the Pasadena schools in the early 1970s, and blocked President Trump's efforts to strip funds from police departments that don't cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.
"A towering legal figure," the L.A. Times called him. Stories approvingly quoted a statement from Central District of California Chief Judge Virginia A. Phillips calling Real the court's "heart and soul" and adding: "His legacy of public service is an inspiration beyond compare."
Real's record is incomparable, but let's pray it's not an inspiration.
What the obituaries missed was Real's routinely awful treatment of people in his courtroom, and a decision-making style so rushed and lawless that he was routinely reversed by higher courts. In 2006, Congress even held a hearing about impeaching him.
Growing up in Pasadena, I knew Real's name, given his heroic role in the desegregation case. So it was a shock when, as an L.A. Times journalist, I covered hearings in his courtroom. I have never seen a judge as tyrannical as Real.
Real sometimes justified his behavior in the name of efficiency. But his behavior encouraged disrespect for the law. He prevented jurors from taking notes or having courtroom testimony read back to them. He often yelled or cut off questioning of witnesses in nonsensical ways. When challenged, he repeated a bizarre mantra: "Counsel, this is not Burger King! In this courtroom, we do it my way!" Real "created a courtroom of terror," attorney Victor Sherman once told the L.A. Times.
That Real was a menace was no secret, but no one could knock him off the bench. Not colleagues who saw his difficult tenure as the central district's chief judge. Not the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judges who reversed him at record-high rates (in two-thirds of major cases, according to one analysis) and repeatedly removed him from cases during which he ignored their orders and violated basic procedures. He even survived mismanaging the assets of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos in one case.
Real wasn't even kicked the bench after his lawless 2000 takeover of a bankruptcy case involving a woman whose probation he personally oversaw. A U.S. Supreme Court commission would later cite Real as exemplifying an unaccountable judge. But federal judges police their own, and Real escaped that episode with a reprimand. Appallingly, in his later years, other judges honored him.
Real was unrepentant. In one of several LA Times stories about his misconduct, Real said: "The best thing about being a judge is the nature of the service you think you're rendering. The worst thing, probably, is the inability to come down off the bench and punch somebody in the nose."
So why did Manuel Real get the generous judgment in death that he denied others in court?
One reason is the human reluctance to criticize the deceased. Real also could be charming and public-spirited outside court; a school is named for him in Riverside County, where he helped establish a school district.
But there are other, more troubling explanations. First, in these politicized times, we have the bad habit of conflating ideology — Real was a liberal — with character. Second, the American system provides no practical way to remove people who violate norms and abuse power, be they federal judges or — as today's news demonstrates — president of the United States.
Even after his death, those who know better won't challenge Real. If you're expecting judges to protect us from tyrants, you'll be disappointed.

Diversity, Inclusion and Anti-Excellence

Texto completo: Anyone who has followed the news from college campuses over the past few years knows they are experiencing forms of unrest unseen since the late 1960s.
Now, as then, campuses have become an arena for political combat. Now, as then, race is a central issue. Now, as then, students rail against an unpopular president and an ostensibly rigged system. Now, as then, liberal professors are being bullied, denounced, demoted, threatened, sued and sometimes even assaulted by radical students.
But there are some important differences, too. None of today's students risk being drafted into an unpopular, distant war. Unlike the campus rebels of the '60s, today's student activists don't want more freedom to act, speak, and think as they please. Usually they want less.
Most strange: Today's students are not chafing under some bow-tied patriarchal WASP dispensation. Instead, they are the beneficiaries of a system put in place by professors and administrators whose political views are almost uniformly left-wing and whose campus policies indulge nearly every progressive orthodoxy.
So why all the rage?
The answer lies in the title of Anthony Kronman's necessary, humane and brave new book: "The Assault on American Excellence." Kronman's academic credentials are impeccable -- he has taught at Yale for 40 years and spent a decade as dean of its law school -- and his politics, so far as I can tell, are to the left of mine.
But Yale has been ground zero for recent campus unrest, including a Maoist-style struggle session against a distinguished professor, fights about "cultural appropriation," the renaming of Calhoun (as in, John C.) College, and the decision to drop the term "master" because, to some, it carried "a painful and unwelcome connotation."
It's this last decision that seems to have triggered Kronman's alarm. The word "master" may remind some students of slavery. What it really means is a person who embodies achievement, refinement, distinction -- masterliness -- and whose spirit is fundamentally aristocratic. Great universities are meant to nurture that spirit, not only for its own sake, but also as an essential counterweight to the leveling and conformist tendencies of democratic politics that Alexis de Tocqueville diagnosed as the most insidious threats to American civilization.
What's happening on campuses today isn't a reaction to Trump or some alleged systemic injustice, at least not really. Fundamentally, Kronman argues, it's a reaction against this aristocratic spirit -- of being, as H.L. Mencken wrote, "beyond responsibility to the general masses of men, and hence superior to both their degraded longings and their no less degraded aversions." It's a revolt of the mediocre many against the excellent few. And it is being undertaken for the sake of a radical egalitarianism in which all are included, all are equal, all are special.
"In endless pronouncements of tiresome sweetness, the faculty and administrators of America's colleges and universities today insist on the overriding importance of creating a culture of inclusion on campus," Kronman writes.
"They stress the need to respect and honor the feelings of others, especially those belonging to traditionally disadvantaged groups, as an essential means to this end. In this way they give credence to the idea that feelings are trumps with a decisive authority of their own. That in turn emboldens their students to argue that their feelings are reason enough to keep certain speakers away. But this dissolves the community of conversation that the grown-ups on campus are charged to protect."
This is a bracing, even brutal, assessment. But it's true. And it explains why every successive capitulation by universities to the shibboleths of diversity and inclusion has not had the desired effect of mollifying campus radicals. On the contrary, it has tended to generate new grievances while debasing the quality of intellectual engagement.
Hence the new campus mores. Before an idea can be evaluated on its intrinsic merits, it must first be considered in light of its political ramifications. Before a speaker can be invited to campus for the potential interest of what he might have to say, he must first pass the test of inoffensiveness. Before a student can think and talk for himself, he must first announce and represent his purported identity. Before a historical figure can be judged by the standards of his time, he must first be judged by the standards of our time.
All this is meant to make students "safe." In fact, it leaves them fatally exposed. It emboldens offense-takers, promotes doublethink, coddles ignorance. It gets in the way of the muscular exchange of honest views in the service of seeking truth. Above all, it deprives the young of the training for independent mindedness that schools like Yale are supposed to provide.
I said earlier that Kronman's book is brave, but in that respect I may be giving him too much credit. Much of his illustrious career is now safely behind him; he can write as he pleases. Would an untenured professor have the guts to say what he does? The answer to the question underscores the urgency of his warning.

Guatemala Deal Divides Trump's Cabinet Officials

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump struck an agreement last week to require thousands of Central American migrants to seek asylum in Guatemala before coming to the United States. But the White House ceremony to hail what the president called a "landmark" measure -- one that could transform the American immigration system -- almost did not happen.
Just two hours earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had criticized the agreement in a closed-door meeting with Mr. Trump and Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, and several other aides, according to three senior administration officials briefed on a debate that ensued in the Oval Office.
Mr. Pompeo called the agreement flawed and a mistake, and he told Mr. Trump that the Guatemalan government did not have the ability to carry out its terms, said the three officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate deliberations.
Mr. McAleenan pushed back, according to two of the officials. He argued that the accord, like similar ones in Europe, would stem the flow of immigrants, which has so infuriated Mr. Trump.
Mr. Pompeo lost the argument. After holding up the necessary -- and usually perfunctory -- State Department authority to approve the accord, Mr. Pompeo granted it in time for the modest ceremony where the Guatemalan interior minister, Enrique Degenhart, signed off on the deal with the United States.
"I would say that Guatemala is definitely clear on the responsibility that it has," said Mr. Degenhart, representing President Jimmy Morales of Guatemala in an agreement that the country's Constitutional Court has said must be approved by Guatemala's congress. "We are clear that we have to make changes."
Now it will be up to both governments to make it work.
Whether Guatemala is capable of handling a flood of migrants sent from the United States is central to the political and diplomatic concerns being expressed in both countries and will be the focus of legal challenges that are likely to be filed by immigration advocates in the United States.
In meetings this week with officials in Guatemala City, Guatemala's capital, Mr. McAleenan said the United States would return a limited number of migrants to Guatemala as the country gets its own asylum system up to speed.
He predicted that many migrants would return to their home countries instead of seeking asylum there. United States officials said that $ 40 million in American aid for immigration facilities, transportation and care would help officials in Guatemala manage any refugee surge.
"The State Department and Secretary Pompeo have been a critical partner in supporting D.H.S.'s regional strategy on migration," said Andrew Meehan, the acting assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security. "It will be implemented in partnership with international organizations and nongovernmental partners with experience in building and maintaining capacity for those seeking protection in another country."
But in an interview on Thursday, one Guatemalan congressman described his country as completely unprepared to accept thousands of migrants from El Salvador and Honduras.
"We can't do it. We just can't do it," said the legislator, Paul Briere, who was the chairman of the Guatemalan immigration committee from 2013 to 2017.
"We're not prepared for that agreement," Mr. Briere said. "We don't have the resources; we don't have the infrastructure. We can't."
Under the so-called safe-third country agreement, migrants who travel through Guatemala to the southwestern border to seek asylum will be denied protections in the United States. Unless they can prove a fear of persecution or torture in Guatemala, they will be given the option to return to their home countries or to Guatemala, where they could seek refuge.
The number of Central American migrants seeking asylum in the United States has surged over the past year as tens of thousands of families flee gang violence, extreme poverty and corruption in their home countries. The number of migrants taken into custody at the southwestern border peaked at 144,200 in May.
Many of the migrants sent to Guatemala would be processed by the Guatemalan Migration Institute -- situated in a small office building in the capital, and on the same block as three strip clubs -- where the staff of eight processed 262 requests for refuge last year.

Only 20 were approved, and 234 are still pending, said Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for the institute. The rest were either rejected or abandoned.
Officials at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security are betting that the agreement with Guatemala will have a big deterrent effect by persuading families in El Salvador and Honduras not to make the long, dangerous journey to the United States in the first place.
"President Trump made a great international deal with Guatemala that protects the rights of legitimate asylum seekers, strengthens regional cooperation and improves safety for all migrants," said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman. "Democrats' refusal to address this humanitarian crisis continues to leave our borders open and American communities unsafe."
State Department officials worked with Mr. McAleenan during the past several months to negotiate the agreement, traveling together several times to Guatemala. Diplomats were also with Mr. McAleenan this week as he discussed the agreement with Guatemalan officials.
Morgan Ortagus, Mr. Pompeo's spokeswoman, told The New York Times that the State Department said it "fully supports the safe-third agreement between the United States and Guatemala and all of the administration's efforts to stop the humanitarian crisis we face at our southern border."
But privately, some American diplomats question the agreement's basic assumption -- that Guatemala is capable of accepting what could eventually be thousands of asylum seekers each month. Officials also described irritation within the State Department over what is viewed as the Department of Homeland Security's meddling in a diplomatic mission with Guatemala.
Before the agreement can take effect, the Trump administration must certify that Guatemala is able to give migrants access to a "full and fair" asylum system, or similar protection.
"We do not believe there can be a plausible finding that Guatemala will provide a safe, fair and full asylum procedure," said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union.
That concern is shared by Guatemalan officials who deal directly with refugees arriving in the country.
Ms. Mena, of the Guatemalan Migration Institute, said few details have been provided for putting the agreement into action. One staff member said that with current resources, the institute would be overwhelmed by the incoming asylum seekers.
"We don't have the procedures," said Mr. Briere, the legislator. "We're not going to have it for 25,000 people or 50,000 people. We don't even take care of 300 people."
Operators of shelters in Guatemala are also worried about the possible arrival of thousands of migrants.
Mauro Verzeletti, the director of Casa del Migrante in Guatemala City, said his shelter has housed more than 8,000 migrants this year. It has the capacity to hold only 50 migrants at any time; only 13 migrants in the shelter on Thursday were pursuing refuge in the country. The rest intended to move on.
"The Casa del Migrante shelter is not designed for refugee seekers in the country," Mr. Verzeletti said. "It is designed for people going through the country."
"Guatemala does not have the capability to receive refugee seekers," he said. "That's why analysts are saying this is going to become a concentration camp."
Before the agreement can be enacted, the Trump administration must also certify that the "life or freedom" of migrants who are sent to Guatemala will not be threatened on the basis of their races, religions, nationalities, political opinions or memberships in particular social groups.
Officials with the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice are trying to speed up that certification. The State Department's country condition reports on Guatemala warn about rampant gang activity and say that murder is common in the country, which has a police force that is often ineffective at best. But other Trump administration officials are expected to argue that safe places remain in some areas.
Critics, including immigration-rights activists, insist that Guatemala will never meet American legal definitions of a safe place.
"Guatemala cannot even provide protection to its own citizens," said Eleanor Acer, the senior director for refugee protection at Human Rights First. "It's ridiculous to suggest that Guatemala can also provide protection to large number of migrants from other countries."

This philosophy worked well when he helped establish an online bank -- PayPal -- at a time few people trusted anything on the internet and, more recently, with his bet on the ultimate longshot presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Understanding where his latest gambit, a very public rebuke of the world's second-largest economy, fits into this strategy is as complex as his belief system.
In a pair of recent public appearances and, on Thursday, a New York Times opinion piece, Thiel diverged from virtually everyone in the global business community by stoking anti-China sentiment and goading the Trump administration to intensify the trade war. Thiel can take this position because, either by accident or by design, the Chinese economy is largely irrelevant to his business interests.
Thiel's network of venture capital and personal funds manages more than $7 billion and has bet on hundreds of start-ups. Of those, there are only three known investments in Chinese companies, according to a study by market research firm PitchBook commissioned by Bloomberg. The most recent was in a small Beijing biotech start-up early this year. None of the companies appears to be thriving.

Depending on how you look at it, Thiel's new Chinese offensive is a bitter response to missing the investment opportunity of the decade or a brilliant long game that's finally coming to a climax. His protectionist rhetoric, in which he accused Google of "seemingly treasonous" collaborations with the Chinese government, initially won plaudits from President Trump and could return benefits to his companies. A spokesman for Thiel declined to comment.
Three of Thiel's most promising investments -- Elon Musk's SpaceX, data mining company Palantir Technologies Inc. and border security provider Anduril Industries Inc. -- rely heavily on U.S. contracts. Those deals have grown in size, and the companies now supply crucial capabilities to the nation's defense and military complex.
Although federal contract approvals are supposed to be an objective process, emotional appeals and a sense of patriotism can have an effect, said Mike Hermus, a former technology chief for the Homeland Security Department. "The people who make decisions are still human," he said. "People can only compartmentalize so much."
Thiel didn't always look on China with scorn. He once viewed it as an economic wonder and characterized its rise as "the most important political trend of the new millennium." In a 2008 essay for Stanford University's Hoover Institution, a public policy think tank, Thiel wrote: "There is no good scenario for the world in which China fails." By 2014, his curiosity took on a dismissive tone. In his book "Zero to One," he wrote that Chinese technologists simply copied ideas from the West.
A persistent view Thiel has held is that China doesn't make it easy for foreigners to buy a stake in the country's prosperity. "I suspect we are underestimating China, but it may be very hard to invest," he told economist Tyler Cowen in 2015. In the meantime, several of his peers found ways in. Yuri Milner's DST Global and Sequoia Capital have been backing Chinese start-ups for a decade or more, with bets on the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com Inc. and Xiaomi Corp. that proved to be incredibly lucrative.
Thiel's picks, meanwhile, haven't become household names on the mainland. He invested $180,000 a decade ago in a Shanghai market intelligence start-up called Business Connect China, said a spokeswoman for his venture firm Founders Fund. (She disputed that Business Connect China is a Chinese company because it's incorporated in the Cayman Islands.) According to PitchBook research, Thiel bought an undisclosed amount of stock in Beijing's Genome Precision in 2016. And this year's investment was in Immunochina, which has raised less than $30 million from half a dozen backers including Thiel to develop cancer treatments.
As recently as last year, Thiel was still contemplating how to break into China. He evaluated various options, including partnering with local venture firms, people familiar with the conversations said at the time. Those talks never progressed, some of those people now say. It's essentially too late, said Helen Wong, a partner at Qiming Venture Partners. Today's market is highly competitive and leaves little room for an outsider, she said: "China is one of the two largest tech ecosystems in the world."
The new contrarian strategy, it seems, is to turn a weak business record in China into an asset. By targeting Google with his unsubstantiated claim last month, Thiel suggested associations with Beijing should be a disqualifier for a U.S. contractor. Trump at first entertained the idea, promising in a tweet that the White House would look into Thiel's claims of treason and calling him "a great and brilliant guy." The sideshow appeared to temporarily take heat off Facebook Inc., where Thiel is a board member. But Google denied the claims, and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said last week that they found no security concerns.
Some in Thiel's orbit said the venture capitalist's concerns are authentic. "He's a very patriotic guy," said John Meyer, who received a grant from Thiel's fellowship program to start a company in lieu of attending college. "If Google is building an AI office in Beijing and hiring a ton of AI engineers there, that means it's working with the Chinese government in some way. He's worried about that."
Thiel's stance could also win him fans in Washington. The three major U.S. contractors in which he holds stakes have at times echoed Thiel's message of American loyalty. They have a lot of money riding on federal spending.
Just this year, SpaceX has won more than $350 million from the Air Force, Defense Department and NASA. Palantir, which counts Thiel as a founder and chairman, secured a contract worth more than $800 million from the Army in March and another in July from the Defense Department for $144 million.
In the second agreement, which hasn't been previously reported, Palantir will supply software to intelligence agencies and the Coast Guard over four years. This deal was particularly significant because it wasn't open to competing bids and established Palantir as a "brand name" federal provider of defense technology, in the same league as Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. The designation can set a precedent, said Meagan Metzger, who runs the Washington-based Dcode accelerator, which consults with tech companies on federal contracting. "When you do a brand-name contract of that size, you have to get a bunch of approvals up the chain," she said. "That's a huge award."
The newest addition to Thiel's portfolio of government suppliers is digital surveillance company Anduril. Palmer Luckey, founder of the Facebook-owned virtual-reality headset Oculus, runs the business, which, like Palantir, takes its name from the lore of the book series "The Lord of the Rings," which Thiel loved. Anduril is staffed by more than a dozen Palantir veterans and funded largely by Thiel's Founders Fund.
Anduril has gained significant traction inside the U.S. government in the two years since it started operating. The start-up quietly took over the military's Project Maven this year, according to a news report in the Intercept, after Google faced employee protests and abandoned the effort. Anduril also secured a $13.5-million contract with the U.S. Marine Corps to provide autonomous surveillance towers on the border and at military bases, according to documents surfaced in July by worker advocacy group Mijente.
Thiel's love of country is being embraced throughout his empire. One of the newest additions to the Founders Fund investing team, Delian Asparouhov, posted a photo on Twitter on July 17 showing the office decor set to commemorate a visit from Luckey to discuss Anduril. A U.S. flag was draped across a whiteboard in the conference room, as he held a red, white and blue napkin emblazoned with the words, "USA all day."

New president, same Planned Parenthood

Texto completo: When Leana Wen was unceremoniously fired as president of Planned Parenthood, she penned a New York Times op-ed citing two reasons for her ouster: 1) Criticism that she “did not prioritize abortion enough.” 2) Resistance to her “attempt to depoliticize Planned Parenthood.”
Considering Planned Parenthood’s insistence that abortion makes up only 3% of its services (a wildly misleading claim given “Three Pinocchios” by the Washington Post), Wen’s focus on the other 97% would seem pretty reasonable. Under her predecessor Cecile Richards (a sharp political operator whose stated goal was to make Planned Parenthood the most powerful player on the Left), both breast exams and cancer screening and prevention services fell by two-thirds. About 95% of Planned Parenthood’s “services to pregnant women” were aborting their children, while adoption referrals made up less than 1%.
Maybe this imbalance is because abortion is big business. Planned Parenthood earns as much as 55% of its nongovernment health services revenue from abortions.
By resisting Wen’s efforts to “depoliticize” America’s biggest abortion business, Planned Parenthood has once again staked itself out as a nakedly political organization. In 2018, it spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress and supporting Democrats. In the election cycle that same year, Planned Parenthood donated to 118 Democrats ($864,398) and 2 Republicans ($5,700).
In the aftermath of her termination, Wen was criticized as being not merely apolitical, but too conservative. She envisioned Planned Parenthood transcending partisan politics and finding common ground, but that was seen as “mission creep” by the board and entrenched staff. What exactly is your mission if “work[ing] to change the perception that Planned Parenthood was just a progressive political entity and show that it was first and foremost a mainstream health care organization” constitutes mission creep?
The first doctor to lead the organization in two decades, Wen got the boot for having the audacity to assert that the organization billing itself as “America’s most trusted provider of reproductive health care” should focus its energy on expanding its menu of wellness services, not the number of politicians committed to increasing Planned Parenthood’s revenue in office.
Wen is learning what many of us have known all along: Planned Parenthood is not in the business of providing women’s healthcare. It is in the business of providing abortions and electing partisan politicians committed to abortion over authentic, comprehensive healthcare.

Texto completo: Empty-nester mom movie "Otherhood" starring Felicity Huffman is finally hitting Netflix.
Pushed back from its original spring release due to the brouhaha surrounding Huffman's involvement in the college admissions scandal, "Otherhood" finally premieres on the streaming service Friday.
The film follows three moms – Huffman as Helen, Angela Bassett as Carol and Patricia Arquette as Gillian – as they struggle being left behind after their adult children begin to lead their own lives.
The friends don't quite know how to handle things now that they're "others" instead of mothers. The three women pack up and surprise their sons — who forget them on Mother's Day! — with visit to New York.
"You know who you are without me," Carol tells her son. "I need to figure out who I am without you. "
Here's what you should know about "Otherhood," and where Huffman's legal charges stand right now.
'A heart that is bigger than the sun': Felicity Huffman has been 'humbled' by the college admissions scandal, says Eva Longoria
'Beginning rather than an ending'
In the film, Carol, a widow, decides she needs some time to figure out who she is when she's not a mother, and temporarily moves in with her son Matt (Sinqua Walls), a successful art director. He's not overly happy about it.
The movie is about the mothers' relationships with their sons, their deep friendship with each other, but also with themselves and what they want out of life, said executive producer Cindy Chupack.
"The women need to figure out who they are in this stage beyond motherhood — otherhood — which might be a beginning rather than an ending," Chupack told TV Insider.
Stars speak out on Huffman's scandal
The movie production wrapped before the story broke about the scandal. But more recently her co-stars praised how Huffman handled being accused of paying $15,000 to have her daughter's SAT answers corrected.
While doing press for the movie, Patricia Arquette said she believes her co-star is "sincerely truly sorry. "
"I think she dealt with it the best way that you can deal with it, but I know she's probably carrying a lot of shame and guilt," Arquette told Entertainment Tonight.
Bassett told The New York Times, "We all make mistakes. None of us is perfect. I think Felicity handled these unfortunate circumstances in a mature, responsible way. She held herself accountable and didn’t make excuses for her decisions, and I can only respect that. "
Before the scandal broke, Huffman shared her thoughts with Entertainment Tonight on being a mother on the set of "Otherhood" and said that done right, "you work yourself right out of a job. "
"If you do it badly and you've damaged your kids enough they're going to need you your whole life," Huffman said.
What's the status of Felicity Huffman's legal case in the college admissions scandal?
In May, a tearful Huffman pleaded guilty to charges in the nation's largest college admissions scandal, becoming the highest-profile defendant to admit to crimes in the blockbuster case. She is scheduled to be sentenced September 13 in federal court in Boston.
The 56-year-old actress pleaded to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud for paying $15,000 to have someone secretly and illegally correct her older daughter’s SAT exam answers. As part of the plea deal, federal prosecutors recommended she get a four-month prison sentence, substantially lower than the maximum of 20 years the charges carry.

Trump wrong to personally attack Cummings, right about Baltimore

Texto completo: President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D.-Md., a man widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore "dangerous," "filthy" and "rodent infested" – if you can believe what you read in the "failing New York Times."
In March, the Times Sunday magazine published "The Tragedy of Baltimore," which chronicled the decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered and there were piles of uncollected garbage.
In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita – more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore's population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and so far in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 – up from 147 homicides at the same time last year.
While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8% to 12.3% since 2014, Baltimore's remains virtually unchanged at 22.4%.
Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore's leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule.
Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House oversight committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who outrageously compare those facilities to "concentration camps") but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.

Senator Bernie Sanders Makes His Case with Ethnic Media Outlets

Texto completo: Headnote The Democratic presidential candidate holds roundtable for independent media
The Los Angeles Sentinel, along with other ethnic- based independent media platforms, met with Senator Bernie Sanders last Friday, to discuss issues affecting the communities they cover. From topics like the racial wealth gap and environmental racism, to gentrification, immigration and affordable healthcare - Sen. Sanders addressed it all.
"The role local ethnic media plays in informing minority communities is crucial. All communities deserve to hear our message of creating a government that works for all of us, not just the few, especially those who are disproportionately affected," said Sen. Sanders at the opening of the meeting.
The roundtable was part of an ongoing effort by the Sanders 2020 campaign to invest in and listen to communities of color. Present at the meeting were representatives from some of L.A.'s African American, Armenian, Chinese, Latinx, Indian and Filipino publications.
"I am more than aware that L.A. is incredibly diverse, and I think that we are all aware that we are dealing with the President of the United States, who tragically, is a racist, a religious bigot and a xenophobe and who wants to divide us up based on where we came from, what religion we believe in, the color of our skin and sexual orientation."
This is the second presidential campaign for the 77-year-old self-proclaimed 'Democratic Socialist' after losing to Democratic candidate Hilary Clinton in the primaries during the 2016 election. His liberal views, heavy criticism of corporate America and his promise to eliminate all studentdebt and college tuition quickly gained his popularity amongst the young, White left. Part of this contributed to why the senator lacked the Latinx and Black vote.
"Last time around, when I started the campaign, I think we started with three or four percent in the polls and nobody knew who the junior senator from the state of Vermont was," said Sen. Sanders. "In fact, not too many people knew what Vermont was," the Senator added jokingly.
This time around, Sanders is more popular with women and people of color than with White people and men, according to an analysis of a poll published earlier this year by Politico. It also shows that Sanders led all other Democratic candidates, except for Joe Biden, when it came to the Latinx vote.
To chair the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign are three notably diverse choices: Sen. Sanders selected Ben Cohen, cofounder of Ben & Jerry's along with three politicians of color - former Ohio Senator Nina Turner, Congressman Ro Khanna and San Juan, Puerto Rico Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz.
Sen. Sanders is currently tied with Senator Elizabeth Warren with 14 points trailing Joe Biden, who leads in primary Democratic nominee polls with 31 points.
"We're starting in a very different position today," says Sen. Sanders. "Many of the ideas that we talked about last time, now don't seem that radical."
Those issues like legalization of marijuana, raising the minimum wage to 15 dollars per hour, criminal justice reform, and student loan forgiveness set Sen. Sanders apart from other Democratic candidates Four years later, and these items are at the forefront of most Democratic candidates' platforms. Senator Kamala Harris, who trails Sen. Sanders with 11 points in the polls, just recently proposed her student loan forgiveness program which has since gained much criticism.
"Well you know what, virtually all of those same ideas are now being talked about by every candidate in the primary democratic process," said Sen. Sanders.
So how does he set himself apart?
"Well, I have been fighting these fights for a very long time and I think that what my record shows is that I have the courage to take on very, very powerful special interests who have undue influence over the economic and politic life of this country."
Reporters from each of the platforms present at the roundtable asked Sen. Sanders questions specific to those very powerful interests Sen. Sanders referred to. When the L.A. Sentinel asked Sen. Sanders how he would address the racial wealth gap in the country, he agreed that this was an important question. The New York Times recently reported that for every 100 dollars of a White family's income, a Black family makes only $5.04.
Sen. Sanders says that beyond the immense wealth disparity in the country, the racial disparities are massive in every index.
"Whether it is wealth, where the gap is, I think, 10 to 1 between a White family and a Black family; Whether it is educational opportunity - Black kids are going to leave school much more deeply in debt thanWhite kids;Whether it is healthcare, where you have an infant mortality rate in the Black community two and a half times that of the White community."
Amongst all of the items on his platform, Sen. Sanders most fervent promise is to be nothing like the president in office today.
"Certainly, as president of the United States, my job would be to do everything that I can to move the country in exactly the different direction than what Trump is trying to do," said Sen. Sanders.
In the coming months, the Bernie Sanders 2020 campaign will continue to reach out and engage with immigrants and communities of color across the country. This week, the senator will have an even larger audience to share his platform as he takes the stage in the second round of preliminary Democratic debates.
"I think what divides many of us from Trump's ideology is that we believe we have a hell of a lot more in common as human beings," said Sen. Sanders. "It is a priority for our campaign to continue this outreach and ensure our vision of coming together to create change in America is accessible to all."

Trump wrong to attack Cummings, right about Baltimore

Texto completo: President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D.-Md., a man widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore "dangerous," "filthy" and "rodent infested" -- that is, if you can believe what you read in the "failing New York Times."
In March, the Times Sunday magazine published a heart-rending story titled "The Tragedy of Baltimore," which chronicled the precipitous decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of southeast Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered and there were piles of uncollected garbage and a liquor store that allowed drunks to congregate while pretending to wait for the bus. " 'Watch your step,' someone called out as the group neared a dead rat," the Times reported.
The city's "regression has been swift and demoralizing," the Times wrote, adding that officials have "struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge." One resident contrasted the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor with her West Baltimore neighborhood, where, she said, "we're all bolted in our homes, we're locked down."
Residents are locked down with good reason. In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita -- more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore's population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and so far in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 -- up from 147 homicides at the same time last year. Baltimore is quite literally experiencing "American carnage."
While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8 percent to 12.3 percent since 2014, Baltimore's remains virtually unchanged at 22.4 percent. Children are trapped in failing schools that can't teach them to read or do math at grade level. No wonder Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., once compared Baltimore to "a Third World country" and said it is "a community in which half of the people don't have jobs (and) in which there are hundreds of buildings that are uninhabitable." This is happening in Maryland, the richest state in the country. Talk about income inequality!
Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions -- we should all agree that no one should have to. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore's leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule. Democrats have held a lock on the Baltimore mayor's office since 1967. They run the city council, the school system, the sanitation system, the housing authority and police department, and they represent the city in Washington. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), only the second Republican governor of Maryland since 1969, does bear some responsibility. But Baltimore is a deep-blue city in a deep-blue state; its plight is almost entirely a Democrat-created disaster.
Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House oversight committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who outrageously compare those facilities to "concentration camps") but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.
The irony is, Democrats are in large part responsible for both situations. For months they refused to provide the emergency funds Trump requested to address the surge in border crossings, which left U.S. facilities on the border under-resourced and overwhelmed. And for years they have ruled Baltimore as a one-party fiefdom as the city turned into an island of despair amid a sea of prosperity.
The tragedy of Trump's presidency is that he should be championing the people of Baltimore rather than using their plight to attack one of his critics. In 2016, Trump visited a black church in Detroit and gave a major speech in Charlotte in which he promised black Americans, "Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion." Last year, he was supposed to visit Baltimore to deliver a similar message but canceled. That would have been a lot more effective than a tweetstorm that only prompts Baltimore's beleaguered residents to rally around their incompetent Democratic leaders.

Resumen: A New York Times report Wednesday detailed disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's "fascination" with DNA, genetic engineering and modern-day eugenics

Texto completo: The disturbing fall of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender accused of sex trafficking young girls, took another turn Wednesday after the New York Times published a report of his desire "to seed the human race with his DNA. "
Epstein, 66, "sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls," as young as 14 in his Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, homes, prosecutors say. He was indicted last month and has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The shocking report by the New York Times, based on interviews with more than a dozen of his acquaintances and public records, described how Epstein desired to curry favor with accomplished scientists "to pursue his interests in eugenics and other fringe fields like cryonics. "
Epstein's lawyers did not respond the Times' requests for comments in the story.
Latest of Epstein case: Jeffrey Epstein could face trial as early as June on sex-trafficking charges
Here are three startling takeaways from the Times' report:
Epstein wanted to impregnate women at his New Mexico ranch
According to the Times, Epstein began telling scientists and businessmen in the early 2000s about plans for his 33,000-square-foot compound in New Mexico.
Epstein had "ambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and would give birth to his babies. " The Times cited two award-winning scientists and a financial adviser who said Epstein told them of his wish.
Epstein told multiple people of the desire and the anonymous scientists and adviser said they were present at dinners and gatherings during which Epstein detailed the plan.
Who is Jeffrey Epstein?: Billionaire charged with sex trafficking girls as young as 14
Jaron Lanier, a pioneer in the field of virtual reality, told the Times that a NASA scientists, whose name he couldn't remember, described to him how Epstein said he wanted up to 20 women at a time impregnated at his New Mexico property.
Lanier also said he thought that Epstein used his lavish dinner parties "to screen candidates" to have his children.
Epstein wanted to freeze his head and penis
One area of genetic pseudoscience that particularly fascinated Epstein was cryonics.
Proponents of cryonics, an unproven field, believe that freezing body parts after death can allow humans to come back to life once they are unfrozen.
The Times, citing an unnamed "adherent of transhumanism," reported that Epstein told the person that he wanted his head and penis frozen.
Transhumanism is a broader field of thought concerning how the human race could improve with technologies like genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. It is often criticized as a modern kind of eugenics.
Epstein injured in jail: Sex offender Jeffrey Epstein found injured in jail, received medical care
Epstein donated a total of $120,000 to the Worldwide Transhumanist Association, now named Humanity Plus, and its vice chairman, the Times reported.
Alan Dershowitz, a high-profile attorney who represented Epstein when he was accused of sex crimes in 2007, told the Times of a lunch during which Epstein "steered the conversation toward the question of how humans could be improved genetically. "
Epstein hosted renowned scientists, including Stephen Hawking, at fancy dinners and island conferences
To further his genetic goals, Epstein used his money and influence to be in the company of prominent scientists including Nobel prize winners.
According to the Times, famed physicist Stephen Hawking was among the high-profile scientists who attended at least one of Epstein's dinners or conferences:
They included the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who discovered the quark; the theoretical physicist and best-selling author Stephen Hawking; the paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and best-selling author; George M. Church, a molecular engineer who has worked to identify genes that could be altered to create superior humans; and the M. I. T. theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate.
Epstein's promised financial backing of the scientists' work drove some to turn a blind eye to his "half-baked scientific musings" and "sexual transgressions," the Times reported.
During a conference in the Virgin Islands, Epstein charted a submarine and gathered the scientists, including Hawking, aboard.
How to talk about Epstein accusations: Has the media 'sanitized' the accusations against Jeffrey Epstein?
The 2006 St. Thomas conference was said to be on the topic of gravity, but one participant told the Times that Epstein instead "wanted to talk about perfecting the human genome" and "was fascinated with how certain traits were passed on, and how that could result in superior humans. "
Harvard cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker told the Times that he was invited by colleagues to gatherings Epstein hosted. Pinker called Epstein an "intellectual impostor. "
"He would abruptly change the subject, A. D. D. -style, dismiss an observation with an adolescent wisecrack," Pinker told the newspaper.
Literary agent John Brockman first introduced Epstein to many scientists in hopes that he could provide funding for their work. Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Jeff Bezos were in attendance at one dinner, per the Times.
Epstein was also thanked for financial support in Nobel Prize-winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann's book “The Quark and the Jaguar. "

Guest opinion: The Valerie Harper you might not know

Texto completo: For decades, millions of Americans have felt like they know Valerie Harper from her title role in the TV show "Rhoda." Six years ago, we came to know her in a new way as she shared what it was like to face terminal brain cancer. There is still another role Harper played that deserves a spotlight even though she never did it for the credit.
In the first People magazine article about her 2013 diagnosis, Harper said, “I just got a letter from a friend who’s getting the Congressional (Gold Medal) in April. I hope I’m around then.” She was. That friend was Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Grameen Bank founder Muhammad Yunus and his invitation begins to reveal the impact Harper’s life has had.
Harper has been a long-term supporter of empowering women through microloans for the poor around the world and of other issues benefiting families here and abroad. How long term? At a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing about microloans in 1987, former Congressman Bob Dornan, R-CA, said, “I want to compliment my colleague Mr. Feighan (D-OH) and tell him what unusual lobbying his bill brings about. Sitting at home last week I got a call from a very important television star, Valerie Harper, otherwise known as Rhoda. And she said, ‘I just know you’re on this bill, Bob.’ And I said, ‘Well if I’m not, I’m going to get on it.’”
When Harper called Dornan and other committee members 32 years ago to discuss this little-known legislation, about 1 million of the world’s most impoverished people had access to a microloan. A third of a century later, the count has risen to more than 124 million very poor families.
Harper wrote about the impact her mother’s commitment to service had in her life when she wrote the foreword to my book "Reclaiming Our Democracy: Healing the Break Between People and Government." “During the years I pursued my passion — a career in the performing arts,” Harper wrote, “a little voice inside me asked. ‘But is this of real value? Should I be doing something of more service — like my mom who is a teacher and nurse?’”
Harper answered yes, and began using her celebrity to advance causes she cared about from the Equal Rights Amendment to the Hunger Project to ending homelessness in America. “My celebrity became a tool I used to contribute to my community and my world,” she wrote. “But I must make the choice to do so and find the means….”
“Her generosity toward people is overwhelming,” said her husband, Tony Cacciotti, “she’s always doing for others….”
I saw that generosity when both Harper and Cacciotti jumped into action to support the Candlelight Vigils my organization, the anti-poverty lobby Results, was organizing the week before the 1990 World Summit for Children.
I called Harper to tell her about the upcoming Summit and its intention to reduce the tragedy of 40,000 children dying each day from largely preventable malnutrition and disease. From my simple description came an avalanche of commitment. Over the next two months, she organized two briefings to bring celebrities on board and a slew of national television appearance on behalf of the Summit.
She also organized a full-page ad signed by 140 celebrities that appeared in The New York Times when Presidents Bush and Gorbachev were meeting in the U.S., urging the two leaders to attend the World Summit for Children. Harper was on the phone day and night, talking to celebrities and their assistants about the Summit and the ad. When the fundraising wasn’t going well, she and Tony paid for the Times ad and for reprints in Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter . Signers included Frank Sinatra, Jackson Browne, Sting and Elizabeth Taylor, who gave her OK from a hospital bed.
The day after the ad appeared, UNICEF Executive Director Jim Grant wrote Harper, Cacciotti, and their daughter Christina: “I returned last night from an encouraging audience with His Holiness the Pope on the future of the world’s children and our joint efforts to make a difference. I returned to discover The New York Times advertisement. Clearly you and your colleagues have made a dramatic difference for the World Summit for Children and for children the world over.”
Twenty-nine years after that Summit, UNICEF reports that child deaths have been cut by more than half; more than 24,000 young lives are saved every day thanks to the programs for which Harper and others advocated. Valerie Harper was no mere spectator to that change; she was one of the best supporting actors you could ask for. She didn’t do it for applause or to get her name in lights, but at the final curtain call in this lifetime, she deserves a standing ovation for the difference she has made for millions of the world’s poorest families.

Chef's tastes: Simple, fine dining

Texto completo: Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is one of the most revered chefs in the world.
The Michelin-starred chef has fed Oprah, George Clooney and the Dalai Lama. His eponymous fine-dining restaurant in New York received four stars from The New York Times.
Born and trained in France, Vongerichten owns and operates 39 restaurants worldwide and has shared his work on programs like the "Today Show," "Good Morning America" and "Top Chef."
We caught up with the acclaimed chef as he prepped his latest restaurant Jean-Georges Philadelphia, which opens at Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia in August. Vongerichten dished on food trends and let us know what's fresh and what's past their expiration date.
Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.
Question: What's your favorite trend happening in food today?
Jean-Georges Vongerichten: When I came to New York in 1986, people were eating Chinese food on Sunday nights. I feel today, people eat Asian food two or three times a week because they're looking for new sensation, new flavors. ... palates have changed nowadays. They have more tolerance for spice, for acidity, for more flavor on the food.
Q: Are there any food trends you don't like?
Vongerichten: Molecular gastronomy. What I love is the last couple years, we went back to more basics, like simple food. I'm not too crazy about sous vide as well, because I feel like, if you live in a city like Philadelphia or New York, you don't need to put things in a bag or cook it in a bag. I like fire. I like live cooking. I think we're going back to that, to a more simple, more direct way of cooking. I feel we are going back in touch to more simple life and more simple things. Nobody needs chemicals in their food. I feel the molecular gastronomy was a little out of whack.
Q: What food will never go out of style?
Vongerichten: People are always going to eat Italian food. They're always going to have sushi. Is it creative sushi? Is it traditional sushi? I mean, it's still sushi. Same thing with Italian. But you know what's never going to go out of style? Good food. Delicious food. Some type of people are looking for weird combination, but, in the end, we're all going back to delicious.
Q: Your career in food and dining has taken you all over the world. Are there any food trends from other countries you wish were more popular in America?
Vongerichten: When I go to a new city I've never been to ... I drop my luggage in the hotel. I go straight to the market, and I see how people eat. I feel like all the markets in Asia are run by people cooking at the market. If you look at the food trucks and everything else, the only street food we had in New York for many years was hot dogs. Now we have all kinds ... I'm a big fan of street food.
Q: What's an older trend that isn't in style anymore but you think should be brought back?
Vongerichten: I feel like in the old days, everything was on a platter. Everything was cooked in a pot, and put the pot in the middle of a table, and people served themselves. I feel we're going back to that a little bit. I don't know if it's the "Game of Thrones" cooking, where you put the leg of lamb in the middle of the table and people slice their own. People want to see the real food. I feel like we're going back to bigger pieces, less plating, less touching the food.
Q: How important would you say presentation is to the overall dining experience?
Vongerichten: Oh, it's very important. I mean, everything has to be Instagramable. Is it a whole chicken on fire or is it something beautifully presented with edible flowers? I think today, visual is very important, as you know. Is it simple? Is it complicated? But the visual I think today where everyone is posting food, everybody is taking pictures of views of design, I think it's a way of communication today. Sometimes if I go to a restaurant, I go to Instagram to see what the food looks like before I actually make a reservation.
Q: How do you think people will be eating in the future?
Vongerichten:I believe that the future of food is really plant-based. I was saying that to all my chefs. We're still gonna eat steaks and fish and a lot of things, but I think, as a daily diet, we're probably gonna eat more plants and grains.
Q: Who are some celebrities or famous people you've served in your restaurants?
Vongerichten: Oh my God, I have a huge list, but I don't remember all the names. You know, George Clooney to Oprah.
Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten has more than 30 restaurants around the world.

Texto completo: Setting Aerosmith aside, because their constancy is just freakish, it's hard to find bands from the '70s that are fully intact.
This week, two of England's finest visit Pittsburgh with a grand total of three original members between them.
Queen, of course, is down two members, notably the beloved Freddie Mercury and also John Deacon, while Jeff Lynne's ELO finds the founding frontman with a bunch of randos.
In preparation, let's wind the clock back to their heydays, when the original lineups rolled through the Stanley Theater and the Civic Arena.
The royal Queen
Queen, as depicted in last year's Oscar-nominated biopic "Bohemian Rhapsody," formed in London in 1970 as a glam rock band with a flamboyant gay singer from Zanzibar with superhuman pipes.
After a first U.S. tour in 1974 was cut short due to guitarist Brian May contracting hepatitis, Queen was scheduled for its Pittsburgh debut on Feb. 25, 1975, at the Stanley (now the Benedum), supporting its second album "Sheer Heart Attack."
Sadly, that night, Mercury was, ahem, "sick."
If you saw the movie, you'll recall Queen's rather feisty manager John Reid was played by a shifty Aidan Gillen, aka Littlefinger in "Game of Thrones."
"That day they canceled," recalls promoter Rich Engler, "Freddie and John had an argument, and Freddie ended up storming out of the hotel room and said, 'I'm not [expletive] playing tonight.' And he went somewhere."
Mercury was declared under the weather, but rather than cancel, DiCesare-Engler trotted out opening acts Styx and Kansas, which forever endeared both to Pittsburgh.
By the time Queen finally made its Pittsburgh debut, on Feb. 20, 1976, at the Syria Mosque, the band had something extraordinary to lay on the fans: a six-minute operatic suite called "Bohemian Rhapsody," the set piece of third album "A Night at the Opera."
Queen built on that success with three more '70s albums - "A Day at the Races," "News of the World" and "Jazz" - producing such hits as "Somebody to Love" and "Don't Stop Me Now" and bombastic stadium anthem "We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You."
Mercury would play just one more show in Pittsburgh, though, touring with eighth album "The Game" on Aug. 24, 1980, at a half-full Civic Arena. The Post-Gazette's Bernard Holland, later The New York Times' classical critic, speculated that turnout was low because Queen lacked substance. While decrying the band's "electronic gimmicks" and Mercury's "narcissistic prancing," he compared their music to Reddi-wip. Imagine for a second the Twitter reaction to that ...
Fourteen years after Mercury's death, in 2005, May and drummer Roger Taylor reunited for a tour billed as Queen + Paul Rodgers, fronted by the former Free/Bad Company singer who bore little resemblance to Freddie Mercury in looks, style or vocal tone. In an interview prior to the band's show at the Mellon Arena on March 20, 2005, Taylor told people who would complain about Queen using a replacement singer to "get a life."
"In a way, it's a little insulting," he said. "Great as Freddie was, the band was a true democracy. The fact that he was the visual focus and certainly, in the first 10 years, the most prolific writer, is not denied. But it was a four-man band."
Queen + Rodgers lasted until 2009, the same year May and Taylor went on "American Idol" and worked some strange magic with contestant Adam Lambert, a closer match to Mercury. They did their first show together in 2012, followed by an American tour in 2014 and now, five years later, the Pittsburgh debut of Queen + Adam Lambert.
Oh, one last Mercury story: For the 1980 Arena show, Mercury's rider called for a backstage dressed with pink lame curtains.
"I had never even heard that word before: lame," Engler says. He sent a runner out to find it, and he came back with pinkish purple something or other to decorate the room.
"Needless to say," Engler says, "when [Mercury] got there, he hated it and ripped it down."
Hello, ELO
In 1978, for the "Out of the Blue" album, the Electric Light Orchestra was touring arenas with a 60-foot-wide, $300,000 fog-spewing, laser-shooting "flying saucer" stage designed by an actual aeronautical engineer.
Because it took 16 hours to build, it was used only for the "A-shows" and on that Sept. 25, the stage was en route from Largo, Md., to Boston. Unfortunately, that was the night ELO was playing the Civic Arena.
"That's OK," Pete Bishop wrote in his Pittsburgh Press review, "we're used to getting snubbed here. We're a bit sick of it, but we're used to it."
ELO may not have landed its spaceship here, but the British "symph-pop" band had never been in the practice of snubbing Pittsburgh. The band played here six times in its heyday between 1973 and 1981, starting an opening slot at the Arena in December '73 for blues burner Johnny Winter. In contrast, with its double cellos and a violin, ELO's trick was blending classical and rock in a manner more power-pop than prog, like inserting Grieg's "In the Hall of the Mountain King" into "Great Balls of Fire."
ELO returned to headline the Stanley in April '74 with Spooky Tooth and again on St. Patrick's Day 1976. Engler, who ranks Lynne as one of his top 10 favorite artists, dating back to The Move, recalls his initial confidence in that '76 show, given the success of "Face the Music" and the singles "Strange Magic" and "Evil Woman."
"The thing was a lead balloon," he says. "I was in big trouble."
Saving the day was the addition of Journey, a hot San Fran newcomer with members of Santana - two years before Steve Perry and all the hits.
"As soon as I put Journey on the show, it sold out," Engler says. "The night of the show, Neal [Schon, from Journey] comes over to me and says, 'Rich, tell me the truth: Who sold the show?' I said, 'Well, I must admit, as soon as I put you on the show, it sold out quickly.' He said, 'Well, there you go, I told Jeff Lynne that!' "
Less than a year later, in February '77, the two bands returned to headline the Arena, this time with ELO touring behind "A New World Record," adding singles like "Tightrope," "Livin' Thing" and "Telephone Line."
Bishop deemed it "an evening of largely acceptable music" and Lynne a "below average singer" fronting a band that relied on form over substance.
ELO did just one more U.S. tour back then and one more stop in Pittsburgh, in October 1981 with Hall&Oates. A highlight of that show was Lynne's tribute to John Lennon, who was slain the previous December.
ELO gradually splintered in the '80s. Lynne became Otis Wilbury in The Traveling Wilburys - he had met Bob Dylan when the legend went to see the spaceship show in London - and produced albums for Charlie T. Wilbury Jr. (Tom Petty) and Nelson Wilbury (George Harrison).
Throwing together a new ELO, he recorded "Zoom" in 2001 and returned as Jeff Lynne's ELO for "Alone in the Universe" in 2015, planting the seed for a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction and tour in 2017 and, now, this first Pittsburgh show in 38 years.
Back in the day, Engler says, "a lot of these sophisticated acts didn't sell in Pittsburgh." Even with just the three originals, they're both about to pack PPG Paints, thanks to time, nostalgia and classic rock radio.

Texto completo: Senate Republicans on Tuesday raised doubts about sexual assault allegations against Air Force Gen. John Hyten, President Trump's nominee to serve as vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggesting the matter is unlikely to derail his confirmation.
Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), who revealed this year that she herself was sexually assaulted while in the military, said she found no evidence to corroborate a claim that Hyten assaulted a colonel who worked for him.
"Sexual assault happens in the military. It just didn't happen in this case," McSally, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee considering Hyten's appointment, said during a confirmation hearing, declaring Hyten "innocent of these charges" after conducting a three-week review of the allegations.

Army Col. Kathryn Spletstoser told the New York Times that Hyten assaulted her in her hotel room in late 2017.
Hyten denied the claims.
"It has been a painful time for me and my family, but I want to state to you and to the American people in the strongest possible terms that these allegations are false," he said before the Armed Services Committee.
Spletstoser, who worked for Hyten at U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha, accused Hyten of sexually assaulting her in a Palo Alto, Calif., hotel room in 2017 during a work trip. Several lawmakers said an Air Force investigation had not corroborated the allegation.
Spletstoser, who sat in the audience at Tuesday's hearing, said the investigation was not thorough and that Hyten did not fully cooperate. "I felt like I got sandbagged in there," Spletstoser told reporters after the hearing.
She acknowledged that her allegation was "a classic he-said-she-said" because "there were only two people."
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) said he expected Hyten to be confirmed.
To some, the Hyten nomination rekindled memories of the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and the decades-old allegations of sexual assault leveled by professor Christine Blasey Ford, who testified against him publicly.
Inhofe said he did not want the Hyten hearing to become "another Kavanaugh thing," in which a nominee was forced to combat claims of sexual misconduct in a public hearing. He said last year's Supreme Court process influenced how he addressed the claims against Hyten. Both Hyten and Spletstoser testified before the committee behind closed doors and the committee held five private sessions to review the evidence and testimony. Spletstoser did not testify in public.
Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), another military veteran on the panel, said lawmakers of both parties "really went into this with a sober attitude without partisan politics and we really dug into this."
McSally emphasized that her belief that Hyten was innocent should not discourage sexual assault victims from coming forward and trusting that their claims will be treated fairly.
"Don't take the wrong message from how this is being played out publicly," she said. "The process I just witnessed was strong, fair, and investigators turned over every rock to seek justice."
In 2018, an estimated 20,500 U.S. service members -- about 13,000 women and 7,500 men -- said they were sexually assaulted, according to an anonymous survey compiled every two years by the Department of Defense. That's up from a reported 14,600 cases in 2016, according to the survey, which was released in May.
But only about 1 in 3 service members who experienced sexual assault chose to report it, according to the survey.
Victims of a lower rank than their attackers often decide against coming forward, experts say, fearing their claims will not be believed or that they will face career-ending retaliation.
Documents related to the investigation have not been made public, but portions of the record may be released before the Senate votes. Hyten agreed under questioning from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) that he would support their release.
Hyten said Spletstoser had engaged in "toxic leadership" over those she supervised and suggested that he had been blinded to their complaints about her because she did good work and appeared professional in her dealings with him. She was "brilliant, she was doing spectacular work," he said.
Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a military veteran who has discussed being the victim of rape while in college and later spousal abuse, expressed concerns with how Hyten dealt with his accuser. He gave her positive work performance reviews until approximately the same time as the assault allegations. She was reassigned four months later.
"You only did something about it when concerns were raised about your own leadership," Ernst said. "All of this suggests a conflict between your personal inclinations and your professional responsibilities."
Ernst said she had "concerns" about Hyten's judgment, but added she would wait for the confirmation process to play out.
Democrats were divided as well. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said she was not aware of corroborating evidence, but "the lack of it does not necessarily mean the accusations aren't true."
Blumenthal said Monday he would not support Hyten's confirmation because of the accusations.
"Based on the information and evidence available to me so far, I can't support the nomination," he said. "The survivor has been incredibly courageous in coming forward and her allegations are serious and credible."
Duckworth, as well as presidential hopefuls Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), raised concerns that the military's investigation was conducted properly. The Defense Department did not follow its procedures, she said, "and that's a problem because it gives an appearance of preferential treatment for him, which then leads to the question why they feel that they need to do that."
Gillibrand opposes Hyten's nomination and has raised concerns that the investigation of Spletstoser's allegations was conducted by an officer junior to Hyten.
Warren believes that the Air Force made an exception for Hyten because of his rank and nomination, and that the job should go to someone else, according to one of her aides.

For a great pasta salad, think quality over quantity

Texto completo: As much of a recipe and rule follower as I am, I do enjoy going off-script and improvising. I get to feel creative and, ideally, use up odds and ends around the house, or capitalize on what looks the best that moment at the farmers market.
The summer staple pasta salad is one of those ideal winging-it kind of dishes, but you want to put some thought into it. Here are a few tips for making your best one yet.
Avoid the kitchen sink mentality. "Just because you're making a pasta salad, don't succumb to the compulsion to empty the contents of your refrigerator into the bowl," former Post recipe editor Stephanie Witt Sedgwick wrote in 2005. "A well-made salad deserves fresh ingredients."
Quality, in other words, is much more important than quantity. At its most basic form, "You just need a nice tomato, some pasta, olive oil and salt and pepper," says chef Amy Brandwein of Centrolina in Washington. "You don't really need that much else." Pick a few ingredients to spotlight, and let them shine, ideally without drowning them in dressing.
Choose a good shape. "Things with ridges are great," Brandwein says. Look for shapes that will allow sauces and ingredients to cling to them. Top contenders include fusilli, rotini, orecchiette, shells, farfalle (bow tie) and campanelle. After using ditalini in a recent recipe, I'm sold on adding it to my playbook. Its tiny tubes were uniform in size with the kernels of corn and diced tomatoes. Because pasta salads are such common on-the-go, potluck dishes, stick with shorter shapes that are easily scooped and eaten standing up (or hunched over a desk?). Longer shapes are not only trickier to eat in certain situations, but also more prone to breaking when cold.
Cook it properly. Suggested strategies differ here, and I can see the rationale behind all of them. The most typical advice is to cook the pasta to the point where it still has a little bit of bite left and isn't completely soft. Brandwein says the pasta will continue to cook a bit as it cools anyway, and keeping the noodles on the firmer side will prevent them from turning to mush in the salad. Her preferred strategy is to toss the cooked pasta with some olive oil and let it cool on a sheet pan.
Sedgwick recommends taking the cooling a step further by rinsing the cooked pasta under cold water. "Rinsing the just-cooked pasta extracts excess starch that can make the pasta gluey, ensures that the pasta will stay firm and eliminates the need for a lot of dressing," she writes. On the other hand, Melissa Clark at the New York Times recently suggested tossing hot pasta with dressing to keep the pasta from sticking together and to help it soak up flavor.
To throw a completely different possibility in the mix, Annie Petito at Cook's Illustrated turns conventional wisdom on its head by suggesting you cook your pasta several minutes past the slightly firm (al dente in commonspeak) stage. "Just as leftover rice hardens when it is refrigerated, al dente pasta tastes overly firm once it cools," she explains. That is a result of starch that pulls back together once the pasta cools and traps water. When you slightly overcook the pasta, her argument goes, by the time it hardens, it will achieve the right texture.
The fact of the matter is that no matter which strategy you choose, your pasta salad will likely be fine. Think about which method seems most reasonable/easiest to you, as well as how you plan to dress your salad and how much of that dressing you want to use. You're experimenting with pasta, which is pennies per serving. Don't sweat it.
Dress judiciously. "The flavor in a pasta salad should come from its guest stars - fresh herbs, cheese, vegetables, meat. The oil and the vinegar just help them along," according to Sedgwick. "Always start with less dressing than you think you will need." For her part, Brandwein is not a fan of vinegar or vinaigrettes in salad. She thinks they eat away at the pasta. Instead, she prefers to dress pasta salad with olive oil and lemon juice for acidity. But if you do plan on using vinegar or a vinegar-based dressing, especially if you're assembling in advance, you may want to hold off on adding it until shortly before you plan to serve the salad.
Prep. When you think about typical pasta salad add-ins, "a lot of these things need to be cooked first," Brandwein says. She includes broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and greens on that list. Hard pieces of vegetables, especially with softer pasta, aren't something she likes, and raw vegetables will not soak up flavors as well. Roasting and, especially, grilling will improve texture and flavor. Hold off on more delicate ingredients, such as herbs, until the last minute. Brandwein also prefers to add tomatoes at the end so they don't get watery and mealy.
Put it all together. Go as traditional or eccentric as you want. "There's no need to reinvent the wheel," Sedgwick advises. "Pick pairings you know work: mozzarella and basil; chicken and tarragon; Parmesan cheese and, well, anything." No matter what you want to include, it's worthwhile to take colors, textures and taste into account. Ingredients such as capers or olives can add enticing pops of briny flavor. Your cheese can be assertive and distinct (cubes of feta, curls of Parmigiano-Reggiano) or creamy and mellow (ricotta stirred in, torn pieces of mozzarella). Or finely chop some anchovies for an umami hit, as Brandwein recommends. Pasta salad also takes well to the addition of proteins such as chicken, salmon and even sausage, which can help elevate it out of side dish territory.

Texto completo: MAIDUGURI, Nigeria - Villagers in northeastern Nigeria are fleeing their homes, leaving everything behind, after armed men on motorbikes roared into their area and gunned down funeral mourners Saturday killing at least 65 people, officials said Monday.
Officials attributed the attack to Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist group that has terrorized the region for the past 10 years, although there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the assault.
The attack Saturday, in the village of Badu Abachar, north of the city of Maiduguri, was in retaliation foran earlier clash, officials said.
Villagers have formed defense goups, armed with hunting guns and knives, to resis Boko Haram. People ii the village that was attacked had repelled a militant assault two weeks earlier, said Mohammed Bulama, council chairman of he Nganzai area in Bornd state. He said the villagers had killed 11 Boko Haram fighters and seized 10 AK-41rifles.
Bulana said that Boko Haram gunmen had been moving freely around Borno state, rustling cattle and "cating away foodstuff from our people." Villagers who interited their cattle and had spent all their lives herding them felt the "unbearable pain" of losing them, he said.
Around noon Saturday, the Boko Haram fighters "came on a reprisal mission, attacking mourners at a graveyard in the area," Bulama said. In addition to those confirmed killed, at least 10 people were injured and dozens were still missing, so the toll could rise.
One survivor, Aji Gaji Mallam, said he had escaped death by pretending that he was dead as the slaughter went on around him, lying still for three hours. He said that four of his brothers had been killed in previous Boko Haram attacks.
"These people have been stealing from us so we decided to come together because we could no longer wait for an eternity for soldiers to defend us," Mallam said.
Another villager, Ba'na Modu, survived the attacks with gunshot wounds in both upper arms and was taken to a hospital in Maiduguri. But he had not heard from his wife and seven children since the attack, and no one could tell him what had become of them.
"I don't know their whereabouts," he said. "It is just unbearable for me. Where do I start from?"
Beginning in 2015, Nigeria's government and military have claimed repeatedly that Boko Haram was being subdued, even on the brink of defeat, its hiding places decimated.
But human rights groups, aid organizations and local Nigerians have long disputed such claims, and attacks have persisted.

Debate fact check: What are they talking about

Texto completo: GUN CONTROL
Senator Bernie Sanders' record on the issue is more complicated than he let on.
What he said:
“Back in 1988, coming from a state that had no gun control, I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I lost that election."
This is misleading. Sanders suggested he had a long history of fighting the National Rifle Association. Sanders noted that he has a “D minus voting record from the NRA and as president I suspect it will be an F record." He vowed that as president, he would “do everything I can" to take on the NRA.
But Sanders left out parts of his record as a lawmaker defending gun rights in Vermont, a rural hunting state. In 1993, then-Representative Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks and imposed a five-day waiting period for gun purchasers.
In 2005, while still in the House, Sanders voted in favor of a measure to shield gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits arising from the criminal use of their products. In 2012, after a mass shooting in Colorado, he suggested the federal government should steer clear of gun control, saying, “In my view, decisions about gun control should be made as close to home as possible — at the state level." But Sanders voted in favor of the 1994 assault weapons ban, which passed as part of a broad package of crime legislation.
HEALTH CARE
Governor John Hickenlooper suggested universal health care would not play well with moderate voters.
What he said:
“Last year Democrats flipped 40 Republican seats in the house and not one of those 40 Democrats supported the policies of our front-runners at center stage."
This is exaggerated. Hickenlooper was referring to “Medicare for All," the progressive plan for universal health care. Many of the seats Democrats flipped in taking control of the House in 2018 were in swing districts, or districts carried by President Trump; most of the freshmen who won those seats are centrists and do not support Medicare for All.
But at least two of them — Katie Porter and Katie Hill of California — do, and campaigned on it.
In 2017, Porter said on Twitter: “I believe in universal coverage and I support Medicare for All." Hill's campaign posted a video on Facebook explaining her reasoning for backing Medicare for All. “We have to do whatever it takes to get us to Medicare For All as soon as possible," she said.
TRADE POLICY
Sanders blamed trade policy, apparently referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, for Detroit's decline.
What he said:
“Detroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the streets as they moved to low-wage countries."
This is exaggerated. NAFTA, which went in effect 1994, is often blamed for the loss of American manufacturing jobs in the Midwest, but Detroit's struggles started well before that as global competition increased. Auto jobs started scattering during the energy crisis of the 1970s and the economic downturn of the 1980s. Moreover, jobs in Detroit were also lost to competition the union-averse South, where many carmakers sought cheaper labor.
* * *
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Trump's trade deals are not about helping American workers but are actually about helping big companies.
What she said:
“Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just doesn't understand what's going on. Look at the NAFTA 2.0. What's the central feature? It's to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity."
This is mostly true. While the drug provisions are not the core element of the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (NAFTA 2.0), it is a controversial provision that continues to hold up ratification of the trade pact. As The Times reported in March, the agreement gives biologic drugmakers 10 years of protections against other products that would rely on the data they used to win approval.
That 10-year provision would raise the timeline in Canada, where the industry currently has eight years of protection, and in Mexico, where it technically has none. It would not change current policy in the United States, where the standard is already 12 years.
CLIMATE CHANGE
The timelines of the problem are more complex than two candidates described.
What was said:
Beto O'Rourke : “I listen to scientists on this, and they are very clear. We don't have more than 10 years to get this right."
Mayor Pete Buttigieg : “Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate."
Both statements are misleading. Both O'Rourke, a former member of Congress from Texas, and Buttigieg are referring to a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that finds countries have about a dozen years to keep the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
At that point the planet will face severe effects including worsened droughts, floods, and heat waves. And since most scenarios for curbing warming require halving worldwide emissions by 2030, that means countries must take serious action now. But to claim that there are 12 or just 10 years until the point of no return goes beyond what the panel itself says.

Magical things happen on man's running adventures

Texto completo: JACKSONVILLE BEACH -- Lucky, a tricolor dog of uncertain age and breed, joined David Green during an ultramarathon in Brazil, ran more than 100 miles with him and has rarely left his side since.

So of course when Green took a short 14-mile training run Monday morning, preparing for his next 100-miler, Lucky joined him, running every step, leashless.

Five-and-a-half miles in, they paused under the Beach Boulevard Intracoastal Waterway bridge and Lucky plunged into a pond shared by three otters. Once cooled off, he rolled enthusiastically in some tall grass.

There: Ready to finish another run with his human.

At 55, Green is trying this summer to complete the Grand Slam of Ultrarunning -- four 100-mile mountain races spread out over just 10 weeks. Each takes place on single-track trails, and runners go day and night to the finish.

So far it's two down, two to go.

The first, in California, started in deep snow, on the steep side of a mountain. The second, in Vermont, was swamped by 100-degree temperatures and soaking humidity.

The next, in Colorado, will take place from 10,000 to 13,900 feet -- up and down, over and over.

They say the fourth, in Utah, is the toughest of them all, with runners tackling 25,000 feet of climbing within 36 hours.

To help prepare, Green on Monday once more sought out what elevation he could find near his home at the beach. He headed with Lucky to the Intracoastal bridge, which is all of 65 feet tall.

He laughed. OK, it's not much. But it seems to work.

Since 2011, Green has tackled 24 ultramarathons of between 100 and 200 miles, many on single-track mountain trails. He's finished 21 of them. When other runners find out he's from Florida, they always ask him: How do you train?

His answer? "I have a bridge I go up and down a couple of times."

If Green completes all four

in this summer's Grand Slam, he'd be the first Floridian over 50 to do it, he said. It's a daunting task. Most runners are in their 30s and 40s, and he's noticed that he doesn't recover as quickly as he used to.

"I'm tired. I'm not going to lie. It's a deep exhaustion," he said.

The Grand Slam's first race, in Squaw Valley on June 29, was brutal. He finished in 29 hours and 49 minutes -- with just 11 minutes to spare before the race's 30-hour time limit. "I was under the gun the whole way. It was the snow that was tough, the elevation, the climbing, the downhill. It was all tough," he said.

He probably hadn't fully recovered, he said, when he ran the Vermont 100 three weeks later.

In the heat and humidity, only 156 out of 360 runners managed to finish. But he, as a Floridian, finally had an advantage. Accustomed to those conditions, he finished in 29 hours and 4 minutes.

Colorado's Leadville 100 is next, on Aug. 17, at altitudes that would make it difficult for many flatlanders to take even a brisk stroll. He's heading out more than a week ahead of time to try to acclimate.

He's asked: What if he can't finish? What if the altitude is too much?

"I can't imagine it," he said. "I won't let it creep into my thoughts." •••

Green makes his runs in a $15 straw hat that's become something of a trademark for him. Other runners call him "Cowboy." He laughs: He's a city slicker.

He grew up in New Jersey, and wrestled and rowed crew at Columbia University. He began his career as a broker on Wall Street, then started a investment reporting company that was acquired by a large software company. Looking for warmer weather -- his wife, Monica, is from Brazil -- he moved to Jacksonville Beach 17 years ago. He's an entrepreneur who's started several companies and has some real estate holdings.

He did triathlons and Iron Man competitions until he was injured in a 2011 bike crash, unable to bike or swim for a while. That's when he took up the challenge of ultramarathons, even after four knee surgeries and some back issues.

He found they suited him: Triathlons were competitive, but the long runs are "community-driven." "They didn't feel like contests. They felt like family. 'Hey, we're all trying to do something that's really out there, and let's do this together, have some fun, bring some meaning to our lives.'"

Green is athletic, but said he's not a runner, not someone who glides effortlessly through a run.

"I am a plodder, but I want to this," he said. "I have a strong mind and a strong will and I know what I need to do. It's not about being the fastest."

Toward the end of a run, it becomes as elemental as having the will to just keep putting one foot in front of the other.

"You're hallucinating," he said, "and you're not able to add 1-plus-1 because your mind is shutting down to preserve energy for critical life functions. Oh yeah."

His wife teases him good-naturedly about his obsession. But it's just part of him, she said: "He cannot live without challenges. So he's always trying to find something more difficult."

Green acknowledged that he's always been a type-A person.

He's changed though, he said, after these ultramarathons, after running through day and night in Death Valley, Brazil, the Florida Keys, the Tetons, the Sahara Desert.

"Through that process, of going deep, and tearing back the layers of who you are and how you think, you almost find a very peaceful moment in all of that," he said. "And when you come out the other side, it's almost a cleansing." •••

In 2013, Green had just finished a relatively short race, the Boston Marathon.

After charging his phone at a nearby store, he was walking back to the finish line when two bombs exploded near him, killing three people, injuring many more.

As bystanders fled in terror, Green pulled out his phone, took a quick photo, and ran to help.

He remembers a shoe to one side with a foot in it.

He remembers a young woman missing a leg, and the EMT who grabbed a fleeing man, tore off the man's belt and used it as a tourniquet on the woman. He remembers sitting down next a dazed man, just talking with him until firefighters came.

Green became part of the news that day: It turned out his photograph had captured a clear image of bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, wearing a white baseball cap backwards, leaving the carnage.

Green shared the photo with the FBI, which encouraged him to share it widely. It soon went viral online, which led the New York Times and other outlets to reach out to him.

Days later, Tsarnaev was captured after his brother, the other suspect, was killed in a shootout.

Green was deeply affected by what he saw that day, though he went back to run the marathon a year later.

Actually, he started earlier than most that morning, running from the finish line to the start, then from start to finish, all over again. •••

Green has gone to run in Brazil six times, finishing a 135-mile run through the jungle and mountains.

Twice he's combined that run with a longer, multi-day trek of some 375 miles, along the Camino de Fe, a pilgrim's trail through the countryside.

Stray dogs often join runners along the way, but in 2018 one dog -- severely emaciated, sickly, ridden with ticks and heartworms -- was especially persistent.

He joined Green and his group and stayed with him for about 140 miles, somehow keeping up.

They lost track of each other, though, after Green sought medical care for his ravaged feet.

Four hours later, in the middle of the night, Green was trudging through the mountains when the dog appeared at his side and stayed, for good this time.

After Green arranged for a vet and paid $3,000 to a pet transporter, the dog has filled out to 65 pounds.

He now shares a house in Marsh Landing with three other dogs.

Green calls him Lucky, and said Lucky still stays close to him, looking at him, as if asking when they will run next.

He wonders: Why did Lucky follow him? Why do they have this connection? Green, who's not religious, not a believer in the supernatural, doesn't know for sure. But he has a theory.

"Honestly, that question is at the heart of why I do what I do. I actually believe that if you put yourself out there into crazy situations, crazy things happen, good crazy things. And sometimes bad crazy things," he said.

"These running adventures take you to the edge, and magical things happen."

After Trump's tweets, city's marketing agency claps back with ad

Texto completo: Baltimore's chief brand officer, Sarah Schaffer, rallied her team at Visit Baltimore - the city's tourism marketing arm - early Saturday, almost immediately after President Donald Trump punched "Tweet" on his electronic missive denigrating Charm City.
Schaffer said a flurry of texts, calls and emails led the team to a clear conclusion: Trump's attack on Baltimore was unprecedented and required a decisive rebuttal.
"There is more to Baltimore than rodents and refuse, and we wanted to make sure we made that clear," Schaffer said.
Their solution: a bold full-page advertisement in Monday's editions of The Baltimore Sun and The Washington Post, declaring: "People are talking about Baltimore. And there's more to know about this Great American City, where our neighbors are proud to live, work, build, create, and play."
For Baltimore boosters, like Visit Baltimore, Trump's attack offers a chance to change the city's narrative.
The Republican president took to social media Saturday, Sunday and Monday to attack U.S Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat. Trump called Cummings a "brutal bully" who represents a "disgusting, rat and rodent infested" district that is a "very dangerous & filthy place."
Cummings' majority-black 7th District includes swaths of Baltimore and portions of Baltimore and Howard counties. The longtime representative - who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee - stoked the president's ire after Cummings blasted the administration for its treatment of children being held at overcrowded border patrol facilities and the committee approved subpoenas for some White House communications.
Trump's tweets prompted a social media campaign - #wearebaltimore - to emerge over the weekend. Also in response, a new website Wearebaltimore.com launched earlier than expected to showcase "all that's right with Baltimore, enabling all communities and stakeholders to engage and share their positive experiences and highlight the many ways they are creating a promising future for the city they've invested in and choose to live, learn and leisure and do business."
From the civic pride expressed by current and former residents to the solidarity from officials in other urban centers, the episode has been unifying, said Michael Evitts, a Downtown Partnership senior vice president.
"Through our adversity comes strength," said Evitts, adding that the tweets have elevated conversation around a history of inequity that has contributed to Baltimore's challenges.
For Visit Baltimore, running the ad cost a "six-figure amount" out of its $16.8 million budget. But, Schaffer said, the price was "worthwhile." The ad also is scheduled to be published Tuesday in the Washington-zoned editions of The New York Times.
"It is unprecedented to have a president attempt to debase a great American city," said Schaffer, adding, "We wanted to take the opportunity with the spotlight on us to tell the real story."
A team of six at the organization worked Saturday and Sunday to design the ad. Schaffer said they assembled an assortment of "bragworthy" designations that have been bestowed on the city:
* Fifth on Forbes' list of Top 10 rising cities for startups.
* Fifth on Entrepreneur magazine's top cities for minority entrepreneurs.
* Second in a SmartAsset study for best cities for women in tech.
The ad also notes that the Johns Hopkins Hospital is third on U.S. News & World Report's 2018-19 list of best hospitals. And that The Wall Street Journal designates Baltimore as one of the three best U.S. cities for recent college grads.
It includes a nod to a larger Visit Baltimore campaign: "We'd love to meet you." Schaffer said Visit Baltimore promotes the city's entrepreneurs and artisans - "Meet the Makers" - as a way to encourage visitors to collect experiences during their stay.
The organization plans to launch rebranding campaign in the spring that will resonate with locals and entice travelers from across the country and the world, Schaffer said. Trump's tweets gave them a head start.

Texto completo: Richard Liebson, the quintessential crime-and-fires reporter, who for more than 30 years at The Journal News/lohud told the stories of police and firefighters, criminals and victims, military veterans, the down-and-out and so many unsung regular folks not unlike himself, died early Sunday at his White Plains home. He was 61.
He had cancer for about two years. But Liebson didn't want anyone to say that he battled the disease or that he was brave in the end. He saw and wrote about too much real suffering for that, and said that he himself lived a great, fulfilling life. Cancer just got him, like it got so many others.
Liebson was long one of The Journal News' best-known writers and characters, a beat reporter of the old school who chatted up sources on his off hours, huddled with people burned out of their homes, distrusted authority figures (and anyone who didn't answer a question directly), and managed to find the humanity in the most hard-bitten crime stories. In recent years, he covered the City of White Plains, tracking the city's business development and politics, even if he liked visiting police headquarters and the courts best of all.
"Rich was a smart, hardworking reporter and lucid storyteller who was admired by everyone in the newsroom for his trusted and generous counsel and infectious love of journalism," said Mary Dolan, editor of The Journal News/lohud.
Liebson covered many of the high-profile stories that hit the region, from the 1994 propane-truck explosion in White Plains to a sniper's killing of Eastchester Police Officer Michael Frey in 1996 to the fatal shooting of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. by White Plains police after Chamberlain accidentally triggered a life-alert alarm in 2011. But he took the most pleasure in describing how ordinary firefighters pulled grandma from a second-story window at 3 a.m., or revealing how sleepless detectives found the clue to crack a case, or recalling the forgotten heroics of military veterans, from the Battle of the Bulge to Iraq.
"He was one of the most genuine and unselfish people I've ever known," said Jorge Fitz-Gibbon, a longtime colleague at The Journal News. "He touched more lives than even he knew."
A proud military brat Liebson was a proud military brat who was born on Jan. 14, 1958, in Landstuhl, Germany and grew up on bases in Germany and the U.S. His father, Joseph Liebson, an Air Force master sergeant and plane mechanic, served in Vietnam and Thailand, and died from cancer in 1982 at 47 years of age. He had been regularly exposed to Agent Orange.
Liebson graduated from Valhalla High School in 1976. He served in the Army from 1976 to 1980, "writing for Stars and Stripes," making lifelong buddies, and coming away with many great stories, that he told again and again, about the shaky early days of the all-volunteer Army.
He was hired as a part-time reporter by what was then Westchester Rockland Newspapers in 1983 — and got a kick out of knowing he was among the last to enter the newspaper business without a college degree. He went on to do just about everything at The Journal News, including a dissatisfied stint as an editor (or "desk jockey," as he would say) and a much happier period as a weekly columnist. He also developed into one of The Journal News' go-to rewrite people, because he could translate complex policies into direct language that got to the heart of a matter without dumbing it down.
Liebson had his own ways of doing things. He sported a Fu Manchu mustache for much of the '90s, and often wore ill-fitting jeans or sweatpants on the job, even as he carried a leather suitcase from story to story. He walked with a pronounced limp for the last 20 years or so because he hadn't seen the sense in rehabbing old football injuries. And he never, ever drove anywhere without his Jets hat on.
He was an always-optimistic fan of the Jets and Mets, a devotee of Muhammad Ali and Bob Dylan, and a lifelong student of Abraham Lincoln, whose birthday his family learned to observe each year. He loved history, especially the Civil War, but was equally fascinated by local history and valued his time with local historians. Liebson was an authority on the Battle of White Plains and his definitive history of the battle hung in Westchester classrooms for many years.
Mentoring the young Liebson served as a mentor to dozens of young reporters, including his daughter, Rebecca Liebson, now a fellow at The New York Times. Doing so came easy because his enthusiasm for reporting never waned. He thought it was a privilege to help expose wrongdoing and tell the stories of unknown community heroes. In fact, after filing particularly rewarding stories throughout his career, Liebson would often turn to a colleague and say "I can't believe they pay me to do this."
As Rebecca wrote on Facebook, "My dad was one of the few people I know who was legitimately satisfied with what he had. He was a scrappy Air Force brat without a college degree that had somehow ended up with family and friends who loved him and his dream job as a reporter. He didn't need to seek outside validation because in his eyes he had already made it."
Liebson married Victoria Hochman on June 15, 1996. Hochman is a former editor for The Journal News and Newsday and is now manager of public relations for Thompson & Bender.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Morgan Shelby and Rebecca Liebson of White Plains; two brothers, Bruce Liebson of Greenwich, and David Liebson of Carmel; and two sisters, Liza Liebson and Laura Liebson of Acapulco, Mexico.
Visitation will be Tuesday from 4 to 6 p.m. at Ballard-Durand Funeral Home in White Plains. A memorial service will follow at 6. Liebson requested that no one wear ties.
Richard Liebson, one of The Journal News/lohud's best-known reporters and characters, died on Sunday.

‘Louder and more hateful’: Big-city leaders say Trump’s attacks on Baltimore are escalation of his strategy to denigrate diverse, liberal areas

Texto completo: President Trump's denunciations of Baltimore as an uninhabitable city are the latest in a string of disparaging attacks on diverse, liberal enclaves as violent, dirty and outside the mainstream - rhetoric that paints those areas of the country as fundamentally less American than whiter, more conservative strongholds.
Trump denigrated Maryland's largest city over the weekend as "a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess" and blamed it on Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is black, and claimed on Sunday that the lawmaker himself is "racist." Long before, Trump had taken aim at other major cities, some of which are predominantly African American, and their elected leaders.
He called San Francisco streets "disgusting," labeled Oakland and Ferguson, Mo., among the most dangerous places in the world, and lambasted the "crime spree" and "terrible blight" in Chicago. He also tagged Atlanta as "crime infested" and said the city represented by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) was "falling apart."
Last month, Trump used an interview with Fox News during a trip to Japan to condemn the "filth" caused by homelessness in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, blaming it on their Democratic leaders.
"It's disgraceful," Trump said, adding that his administration was looking at steps to "get that whole thing cleaned up."
To the leaders of those jurisdictions, Trump's indictment of Baltimore fits a long-standing pattern of a president who accentuates the nation's divisions along racial, ethnic and geographic lines.
"His spewing of white supremacist rhetoric is unending," Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) said in an interview Sunday, adding: "I fear that the rhetoric will only get louder and more hateful the closer we get to the election."
In 2015, Trump responded to a question from a New York Times reporter about the most dangerous places he has been by criticizing Oakland and Ferguson, the site of protest marches in 2014 over police brutality against African American men, for their crime rates. A PolitiFact assessment found that neither city ranked near the top in per capita murder rates in the United States, much less the world, as he had claimed.
Trump's willingness to disparage parts of the country comes as he has intensified attacks on Democratic minority lawmakers, including Cummings and four congresswomen who the president suggested two weeks ago should "go back" to foreign countries even though they are Americans.
Trump and his aides sought to frame his criticism of Baltimore as born of genuine concern for the city's residents, as well as a bid by the president to defend himself against criticism from Cummings over the administration's immigration policies. Cummings, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, is overseeing investigations into the president on ethics issues and potential conflicts of interest with the Trump Organization - which has angered Trump.
The president continued his assault on Cummings on Sunday, tweeting that the Democratic congressman is "racist" and that "his radical 'oversight' is a joke!"
In a tweet after returning to the White House from his Virginia golf club late Sunday afternoon, Trump said there was "nothing racist" about "stating plainly what most people already know."
Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday defended Trump's attacks on Baltimore and Cummings, saying that some people will be offended by anything the president says.
"Do you understand that that is offensive to the Americans who do live there?" host Margaret Brennan asked on CBS News's "Face the Nation."
"I understand that everything that Donald Trump says is offensive to some people," Mulvaney replied.
The president's Baltimore tweetstorm - including retweeting a bigoted far-right British media personality on Sunday - stood in sharp contrast to the way he has spoken about predominantly white areas of the country facing poverty, crime and drug problems.
At a summit on combating opioid abuse in April, Trump praised the efforts of officials in Georgia and Tennessee, which he called a "great state," and highlighted his administration's work in New Hampshire, West Virginia, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Ohio - all states that he won in 2016.
"We will prevail because of the courage, commitment, and compassion of heroes like all of you in this room today," Trump said. "You're incredible people. You are America's true source of strength."
Two weeks ago, at a Turning Point USA convention of conservative students, Trump referred to federal subsidies his administration has distributed to farmers harmed by his trade war with China and praised them as "great patriots" who support him.
Trump's defenders countered that his criticism of Baltimore is supported by the facts. The city, whose previous mayor Catherine E. Pugh resigned in May amid a corruption scandal, had the highest murder rate among the nation's 50 largest cities last year and ranked second in violent crime, according to the Baltimore Sun.
Conservative talk show host Ben Shapiro called Trump's Twitter attack "bad for the country," but he said the specific criticism the president leveled "isn't racist."
"It's evident to anyone with two eyes and a functioning prefrontal cortex," Shapiro wrote in a tweet to his 2.2 million followers.
But Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) called Trump's focus on Baltimore a blatant attempt to "galvanize his base."
Early in Trump's tenure, the president denounced Chicago, whose then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) was a former White House chief of staff to President Barack Obama, as "totally out of control." Trump said he would "send in the feds," which some city officials interpreted to mean the National Guard. Last August, after a weekend of violence left 12 people dead, Trump called the city's problems a product of "bad leadership."
"He knows he's not getting any significant votes in any urban center in the country, so why not vilify those areas?" said Lightfoot, who took office in May.
An analysis last week from David Wassermann, an editor at the Cook Political Report, suggested that Trump could lose the popular vote by as many as 5 million - nearly twice the number he lost by in 2016 - yet still go on to reelection in the electoral college next year if he is able to drive his supporters to the polls in key swing states.
Amid a firestorm of outrage, Trump's expanded attacks on Sunday included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a frequent subject of his ire. He called San Francisco, which she represents, "not even recognizable lately."
Trump also touted the low unemployment rate for African Americans and accused Democrats of playing the "Race Card."
The Trump administration has sought ways to punish Democratic strongholds represented by his political rivals. Last year, the White House pushed a plan to release undocumented immigrants in federal custody into "sanctuary cities" in liberal areas, including San Francisco, that withhold cooperation with federal enforcement operations. It was ultimately shot down by lawyers in the Department of Homeland Security.
"Enough is enough - it's disrespectful," said Khalilah M. Harris, who was one of 149 African American officials from the Obama administration who signed an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Sunday denouncing Trump's attacks on minority lawmakers.
Harris, who has lived in Baltimore for 25 years and founded a school there, said the youngest of her three daughters, who is 10, asked why she co-authored the essay. She responded that Trump "does not understand what it means to be a good American, and we need to remind him there are Americans who look like us and fight for this country every day."
To which, Harris said, her daughter replied: "So he's doing the same things he always does."

Trump says director of National Intelligence is resigning

Texto completo: Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats is leaving his job next month, ending a two-year tenure marked by President Trump's clashes with intelligence officials.
Trump announced Coats's departure on Aug. 15 in a tweet Sunday that thanked Coats for his service. He said that he will nominate Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, to the post and that he will name an acting official in the coming days. Ratcliffe is a frequent Trump defender who fiercely questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller last week during a House Judiciary Committee hearing.
Coats often appeared out of step with Trump and disclosed to prosecutors how he was urged by the president to publicly deny any link between Russia and the Trump campaign. The frayed relationship reflected broader divisions between the president and the government's intelligence agencies.
Coats's public, and sometimes personal, disagreements with Trump over policy and intelligence included Russian election interference and North Korean nuclear capabilities. Trump had long been skeptical of the nation's intelligence community, which provoked his ire by concluding that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election with the goal of getting him elected.
A former Republican senator from Indiana, Coats was appointed director of National Intelligence in March 2017, becoming the fifth person to hold the post since it was created in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to oversee and coordinate the nation's 17 intelligence agencies.
Coats had been among the last of the seasoned foreign policy hands brought to surround the president after his 2016 victory, of whom the president steadily grew tired as he gained more personal confidence in Oval Office, officials said. That roster included Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and later national security adviser H.R. McMaster.
Coats developed a reputation inside the administration for sober presentations to the president of intelligence conclusions that occasionally contradicted Trump's policy aims.
Associated Press
Scott says he wasn't told about '16 Russian hacking
US Senator Rick Scott said Sunday that he was never told by Homeland Security officials in 2016 when he was Florida's governor that Russian hackers had gained access to voter databases in two Florida counties ahead of the presidential election.
Scott said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that he was never contacted by the Department of Homeland Security in 2016 about the infiltration. The Republican said he learned about most of the details this year.
Current Governor Ron DeSantis said in May that the hackers didn't manipulate any data and the election results weren't compromised. DeSantis and other officials briefed on the matter wouldn't say which counties.
Scott made his comments when asked about a Senate report released last week that said all states were targeted to varying degrees by Russian hackers. Scott said he hasn't yet read the report, though he was briefed on it.
Last August, then-Democratic US Senator Bill Nelson, who Scott was running against, said that Russians had penetrated the systems of certain Florida counties and had "free rein to move about" before last year's midterm election. Scott, who defeated Nelson in the November election, criticized Nelson's allegations, saying they were sensational.
The Senate report outlined efforts by Russian hackers to get into systems in Illinois and around two dozen unnamed states. It detailed attempts in Illinois and a state only referred to as "State 2" but widely believed to be Florida, according to newsreports.
Associated Press
US inquiry of Trump friend focused on foreign lobbying
As Donald Trump was preparing to deliver an address on energy policy in May 2016, Paul Manafort, his campaign chairman, had a question about the speech's contents for Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a top campaign fund-raiser and close friend of Trump.
“Are you running this by our friends?" Manafort asked in a previously undisclosed e-mail to Barrack, whose real estate and investment firm does extensive business in the Middle East.
Barrack was, in fact, coordinating the language in a draft of the speech with Persian Gulf contacts including Rashid al-Malik, an Emirati businessman who is close to the rulers of the United Arab Emirates.
The exchanges about Trump's energy speech are among a series of interactions that have come under scrutiny by federal prosecutors looking at foreign influence over his campaign, his transition, and the early stages of his administration, according to documents and interviews with people familiar with the case.
Investigators have looked in particular at whether Barrack or others violated the law requiring people who try to influence US policy or opinion at the direction of foreign governments or entities to disclose their activities to the Justice Department, people familiar with the case said.
The inquiry had proceeded far enough last month that Barrack, who played an influential role in the campaign and acts as an outside adviser to the White House, was interviewed, at his request, by prosecutors in the public integrity unit of the US attorney's office in Brooklyn.
Barrack's spokesman, Owen Blicksilver, said that in expectation of this article, Barrack's lawyer had again contacted the prosecutors' office and “confirmed they have no further questions for Mr. Barrack."
Barrack has not been accused of wrongdoing, and his aides said he never worked on behalf of foreign states or entities. Asked about the status of the inquiry, a representative for the US attorney's office in Brooklyn declined to comment.
New York Times
Top Judiciary Democrat says Trump 'deserves impeachment'
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Sunday that he believes President Trump "richly deserves impeachment," an explosive statement from the lawmaker whose committee has the power to launch proceedings to remove the president from office.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, appearing on CNN's "State of the Union," said Trump "has done many impeachable offenses, he's violated the law six ways from Sunday."
"But that's not the question," Nadler continued. "The question is, can we develop enough evidence to put before the American people?"
The distinction illustrates a growing tension within the Democratic Party: Many members are convinced Trump ought to be impeached, but the consensus among party leaders is that they should try to secure more records and witness interviews through the courts before embarking on such a politically incendiary move, especially as the GOP-controlled Senate is likely to defeat such an effort.
Nadler's comments come on the heels of former special counsel Robert Mueller's congressional testimony on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Nadler called the testimony "an inflection point, in that it broke the administration's lie, the attorney general's lie, that the president was fully exonerated by the Mueller report."
As the leader of the committee that would launch the impeachment hearings, Nadler is the most important Democrat yet to publicly state his personal support for the cause in no uncertain terms. But he has been loath to cross House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California in his official moves — and gave no sign Sunday that he intended to break with that pattern.
"We're investigating the corruption of the administration, the abuses of power . . . all the things that might cause us to recommend articles of impeachment," Nadler said. "We now have to get further evidence and put it before the American people as we consider articles of impeachment."
Pelosi has regularly resisted the calls from her caucus for impeachment proceedings, but last week, she signed off on the House Judiciary Committee's appeal to a federal judge to enforce its subpoenas seeking the redacted grand jury information contained in the Mueller report. Nadler also told reporters that the panel would go to court next week to enforce its subpoenas against former White House counsel Donald McGahn, whose testimony was key to the report.

Erdman also founded Techline Furniture, with one of the first stores on Green Street -- now at 307 S. Locust St., C.

The architect is responsible for a 1966 dentist office at 919 W. Kirby Ave., C, now the Barham Benefit Group, which still also houses dentist offices.

Barham Benefit Group's mid-century modern building was something the current owner saw all through his childhood.

"I grew up near the building and later was thrilled to have the opportunity to purchase it," James Barham said of the mid-century modern building, distinctive for its high windows, extended eaves and gorgeous wooden stairs. "It's beautiful."

"The building's placement of the windows -- higher than most -- is a common feature of the Frank Lloyd Wright style of architecture, which allows a great deal of freedom in arranging furniture, said Barham staffer Carol Timms, who has thoroughly researched his life. "You will see similar features in Christie Clinic on Windsor -- another Erdman building."

Barham has preserved the era details like turquoise doors (you might remember avocado refrigerators from the times). All the furniture is mid-century modern.

Doctors and dentists shared facilities and Erdman offered ample parking, a tribute to the era of drive-in movies and drive-up hamburger joints.

Erdman's also famous for pre-fab houses, a new idea at the time that Wright was interested in.

Life Magazine wrote in 1953: "Neither the first nor the cheapest but probably the best-designed manufactured house."

He spoke of the role of the UI in the prefabrication movement, saying "the University of Illinois was one of the first architectural schools that believed in prefabrication. They had something called the Small Homes Council, and I was involved in that."

The architect had a wide-ranging life.

Erdman was born in Lithuania. He joined the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, where he helped build the Remagen pontoon bridges.

After the war, he found his goal: affordable housing for returning veterans.

Erdman and Henry Peiss formed the "Erdman/Peiss" lumber company to use pre-cut lumber and material in the "U-Form-It."

Then he went on to apply the prefab concept to buildings for medical clinics.

He also built several Wright-designed houses, according to his New York Times obituary.

"Wright opened a lot of doors," Erdman once recalled. "Everything I have, I owe to him."

Marshall Erdman & Associates built 500 houses and nearly 2,500 doctors' office buildings -- the leading provider of small clinics in the country, according to the New York Times obituary.

He also built 17 schools and remodeled or expanded 24 other schools in the Midwest and elsewhere, according to his company. The company still thrives, headquartered in Wisconsin.

Erdman died in 1995.

Erdman received a call to meet his idol, Timms said.

"Wright hired him on the spot to build the first Unitarian Meeting House in Madison, which made his career but cost him his fee, as well as what he had to borrow against his life insurance to finish the job."

The Wright-Erdman collaboration continues to be lauded as a magnificent structure. In 1957, the Museum of Modern Art included the building in an exhibit of outstanding contemporary religious buildings, and in 1973 it was added to the national Register of Historic Places.

Beginning with the building of Wright's Unitarian Meeting House, Erdman was known throughout his career to be a perfectionist, Timms said.

Much like Frank Lloyd Wright, Erdman had a unique personal style.

Longtime Champaign Techline co-owner Christine Breen said they probably first met in the mid-80s.

"He was a medium build man with strong eyes, a very strong accent and demanded the attention of any room he was in. Marshall would arrive at the factory after his afternoon nap. It was always apparent he had just awoke, sometimes from the wrong side of the bed," she said.

"Marshall was a humorous man, strong in his convictions and he was dressed in formal plaid shorts instead of pants, including a tie and jacket. His strong leadership went a long way to build a legacy in the medical, building and furniture field."

But he did give her one disappointment.

"At the last meeting I attended at the factory, they had a special surprise for all the attendees and I thought 'A new car!' like the Mary Kay company," she said.

Alas, no. It was the book he had written, "Uncommon Sense."

By the way, the original owners of the Kirby Avenue building had to call him back for a little more work.

"He hadn't included a garbage enclosure," Barham said. "So the architect designed one."

Texto completo: Question: When my daughter-in-law died, I was too distressed to sleep, and my doctor prescribed Ambien. Then I went to visit my daughter and accidentally took an Ambien before I left home.
Once I got to the airport, I kind of went to sleep.
Somehow or other, I got into the parking lot, boarded a shuttle bus and even got to the right gate.
Luckily, I had the shuttle ticket in my pocket to help me figure out where I had parked.
I realized on the plane that something was wrong. When I arrived, my daughter took me to the emergency room to be checked out.
Later I figured out that the problem was flying under the influence of Ambien. I'll never do that again!
Answer: Zolpidem (Ambien) is a popular sleeping pill. Many people take it on long flights to help them sleep, but sometimes it can cause amnesia.
Flight attendants are aware of a phenomenon they term "Ambien zombies": people who are sleepwalking or doing other things on an airplane while not fully awake.
This has led to some embarrassing situations.
Question: I have read on your website that putting antiperspirant on your feet could potentially prevent blisters.
Answer: Although blisters are common, scientists have devoted little effort to studying them.
Many years ago, researchers recruited more than 600 cadets from the U.S. Military Academy and conducted a double-blind trial.
The investigators concluded: "A 20% solution of aluminum chloride hexahydrate in anhydrous ethyl alcohol may be effective in reducing foot blisters during hiking; however, the side effect of skin irritation should be considered, and preventive measures studied to reduce this irritation."
Alternative approaches for blister prevention and treatment include products from 2nd Skin (Spenco). The company makes adhesive knit bandages to prevent rubbing as well as gel and blister pads.
Question: I was recently prescribed ibandronate (Boniva) after being diagnosed with osteoporosis.
I must admit the TV ads with Sally Field may have influenced me to choose that particular bisphosphonate. I've taken three doses so far, with some trepidation.
I'm 70 years old and still working full time as a nurse but not getting as much exercise as I need. My friends and family think I should not take this drug due to possible side effects.
My gynecologist, my endocrinologist and my periodontist urge me to take it. They say I have a good chance of living another 20 years, and the drug would make me less susceptible to fractures.
Now I have a prescription for Mobic from an orthopedic surgeon I saw about a Baker's cyst that's causing me pain. Do these two drugs interact?
Answer: Meloxicam (Mobic) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is prescribed for joint pain. It can be irritating to the digestive tract.
Because ibandronate (Boniva) can also cause indigestion, gastritis and abdominal pain, the combination may be hard on the stomach.

High drug prices scare politicians Have you ever heard the phrase "Everybody complains about the weather, but nobody does anything about it"? The same thing could be said about prescription drug prices.
Politicians of almost every description have called for lower costs of essential medicines. The president promised to lower drug prices during his election campaign. Instead, they have gone up. This reportedly makes him furious.
Presumably, pharmaceutical firms could have stabilized or even lowered their prices. That is what President Donald Trump asked them to do last year. However, this year prices have risen on more than 3,000 medicines, with the increase averaging about 10.5 percent. That is roughly five times higher than the general rate of inflation.
Drug manufacturers raised the price on certain medications by triple digits -- one form of fluoxetine (generic for Prozac) went up by 879 percent, according to reports from ArsTechnica, a technology news site.
While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates drugs, it does not regulate drug prices. As a result, Americans pay far more for their prescriptions than anyone else in the world. Prices for the same medications in Canada frequently cost just one-third of what they do in the U.S.
Where does that money go? Pharmaceutical firms frequently argue that it is essential for the research and development that must go into discovering new treatments. But we suspect a lot goes to marketing.
You can't watch television without seeing slick and expensive prescription drug commercials. At last count, in 2016, there were over 700,000 TV commercials for prescription medications. In 2019, the tally is likely much higher.
Then there is the whole issue of profitability. Shareholders expect a healthy return on investment. The Motley Fool, an investment advice website, offers this forecast for 2019:
"More than $320 billion was spent on prescription drugs in the U.S. in 2016, a figure that's expected to nearly double to $610 billion by 2021, according to IQVIA (formerly QuintilesIMS).
"With so much money being spent on necessary medicines, there's serious opportunity for pharmaceutical companies and investors alike." Aging baby boomers are expected to take lots of medicines and turbocharge the industry's profits.
In addition, pharmaceutical CEOs enjoy pretty impressive salaries. On May 26, 2019, The New York Times offered a table prepared by Equilar Figures based on 2018 remuneration. Total compensation, including stocks, options and perks, is breathtaking.
Here are a few examples: Leonard Schleifer, CEO of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, gets $26,520,555 total. Miles White of Abbott Laboratories racked up $22,872,393, and Kenneth Frazier of Merck took home $20,934,504 in total. It is hard to imagine that paying a CEO $20 million (like AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson do) doesn't impact drug pricing.
With the 2020 election campaign looming, Americans will be paying attention to proposals for controlling drug prices.

Constable: How a rescue cat from Hinsdale became one of TV’s

Texto completo: Taking a back seat to the Apollo 11 moon landing in our coverage of things celebrating a 50th anniversary this year leaves Morris the cat in uncharted territory.
"He was a TV star," says Tom Van Winkle, executive director of the Hinsdale Humane Society, where the advertising feline was discovered. Morris became a household name in 1969 by strutting his stuff in the first of 58 commercials for 9Lives. "It’s pretty amazing how it still resonates with people," Van Winkle says.
It’s likely that Morris was surrendered by his owner or possibly rescued off the street in 1968. But the orange-striped Tabby won over animal trainer and handler Bob Martwick of Lombard, who stopped by the shelter in Hinsdale looking for a cat to appear in commercials for 9Lives cat food. Martwick brought the calm, some would say aloof, stray cat to a meeting with the creative team at the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago, and Morris made an unforgettable impression.
"He jumped on the table … and he walked right up to the art director, the big cheese, and bumped him in the head. And then Morris just sat back," Martwick said during his many media interviews about the cat. "The art director said, ‘This is the Clark Gable of cats.’" Voiced by actor John Erwin, who also provided the voice for the popular He-Man cartoon character in the 1980s, Morris was the wisecracking, sardonic, finicky cat, who had little tolerance for anything except 9Lives cat food.
"Oh, I remember the Morris commercials. He definitely had a special personality that most cats don’t have," says Van Winkle, who now has enough Morris goodies at the Hinsdale Humane Society for a Morris shrine.
"This is a portrait from 1974," Van Winkle says of a large framed photograph of Morris that was taken in the photo studio at the L.S. Ayres department store in Indianapolis during one of the cat’s celebrity appearances.
"This was made by the company that makes the Emmy," he says, showing off a golden trophy in the image of Morris.
That trophy was given to one of nine cats from around the nation competing to be the 9Lives cat of the year in a lavish competition held in the famed Beverly Hills Hotel. Celebrity judges included Betty White and Ed Asner, remembers Jennifer Petterson, who started her public relations career in the 1980s with the third generation of Morris the Cat as part of her work with the Edelman communications firm of Chicago. Petterson and her staff flew in coach and carried the director’s chair with "Morris" written across the back, while Martwick and Morris, in a carrier tucked under the seat, flew first-class.
"You could see tufts of his fur through the carrier," remembers Petterson, who now lives in La Grange. "You didn’t dare say who he was because people would go gaga."
Petterson, who now runs her pettersonpr.com consulting firm, was one of a select few who got to hold Morris, aside from Martwick. A no-nonsense guy who still kept the crew cut he wore as a Navy pilot during World War II, Martwick also helped discover Spuds MacKenzie, the beer-selling dog of Anheuser-Busch.
"He was a lovely man, but was quiet and looked stern," says Petterson, who also worked with dog stars such as Beethoven, Lassie and the dog on "Frasier."
The original Morris died in July 1978 at the age of 17, and his obituary in The New York Times noted Morris was "laid to rest near Mr. Martwick’s home," apparently in a backyard ceremony befitting his unpretentious roots. Martwick died in 2001 at age 75.
All subsequent replacement look-alike Morrises have been rescue cats, and the current Morris can be found on Twitter at @MorrisApproved, on Facebook, and on YouTube with his "Cat’s Eye View" on the 9Lives Cat Food channel, which notes that "America’s choosiest cat gives back" in an effort to "Live Well & Prospurr."
In 2015, Morris was one of 10 brand mascots alongside the Green Giant, Ronald McDonald, Mr. Clean and others to be honored with "A Salute to Advertising’s Greatest Icons" at the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.
During his half-century career, Morris has received thousands of fan letters, and included his paw print on his responses. He endured countless puns about his purrfect life and his catapulting to stardom. He traveled the nation, promoting feline health and animal shelters, and visiting hospitals and schools. A later Morris launched his "Morris for President" campaign in 1988 by stumping with Eleanor Mondale, took a second shot at the White House in 2012, and might actually win if he joins the 2020 race.
The original Morris had a part in Robert Altman’s 1973 film, "The Long Goodbye," and appeared alongside Burt Reynolds and Dyan Cannon in "Shamus." Morris also is listed as the author of three books.
In addition to selling cat food, later versions of Morris worked with the American Veterinary Medical Association in Schaumburg in establishing February as Cat Health Month, and led the Morris Million Cat Rescue adoption campaign in 2006.
That activism for less fortunate cats helps explain why Morris is so fondly remembered today.
"It’s still a sense of pride for the shelter and the community that this famous cat came from us," Van Winkle says. "It’s pride for the whole community because a rescue animal made it big."

Venturing into life's great unknowns

Texto completo: I like people who admit that not only do they not know all the answers, they don't even know the questions. (Alas, a glib newspaper columnist is not one of these people.) A concept that takes this further is that of the "unknown unknowns."
Sounds like gobbledygook? Bear with me.
Donald Rumsfeld used the phrase in a state department briefing about terrorism in 2002. (Please don't get your knickers in a twist if you don't like Rumsfeld - the concept itself is apolitical.) He said there are "known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there also are unknown unknowns - the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones."
I am willing to bet that in your life, the dreadful thing you never even thought of to worry about was the one that brought you to your knees.
The concept of unknown unknowns applies to everything from personality types to urban planning. The know-it-all who doesn't know how much he doesn't know is a staple of comedy from "Falstaff" - a trickster who gets tricked - in Shakespeare's "The Merry Wives of Windsor" to Barney Fife in "The Andy Griffith Show." (Remember the scene where Barney, lecturing a group of kids on the perils of crime, accidentally locks himself in a jail cell?)
This concept is reversed in characters who don't know what they do know - for instance, Betty White's Rose Nylund character on "The Golden Girls" and Edith Bunker in "All in the Family." When daughter Gloria asks Edith why she married Archie instead of her former boyfriend Freddie Witthauser, Edith answers, "Well, I liked being called a 'Goddess of Beauty,' but somehow it seemed more permanent when your father called me a dingbat."
And, Forrest Gump solved the existentialist's dilemma by saying, "I don't know if we each have a destiny or if we're all floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I think maybe it's both."
Funny that these intuitives are either women who appear to be ditsy or men who are "not quite right," like the philosophical Jimmy Stewart character in the movie "Harvey," whose companion is an invisible 6-foot-tall rabbit. He tells the psychiatrist who is trying to cure him, "Doctor, I've wrestled with reality for 40 years and I'm happy to say that I've finally won out over it."
On a serious note, the unknown unknowns always are at risk in city planning, where the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.
An example is Toronto, where I frequently visit and which has the fourth largest population in North America. Clean, friendly and attractive to immigrants, its population growth has strained the city's limited taxation powers.
Starchitect (star architect) Jack Diamond pointed out this flaw in a 2018 article in The Globe and Mail: "The lowest-income cohort has expanded and has been displaced by economics to the urban periphery, where social services and transportation are least available; the highest-income cohort has increased and is consolidated primarily in the city centre; and the middle-income group has shrunk and now lies between the highest- and lowest-income groups."
In other words, it's three rings around the rosy - rich in the middle, middle income at the edge, poor at the outer edge - with a risk that all will fall down. As Diamond concludes, that's a problem that a ferris wheel on the water can't fix.
If you'd like to know more about how much you don't know, here's a link to a terrific series in the New York Times by Errol Morris: "The Anosognosic's Dilemma: Something's Wrong But You'll Never Know What It Is," tinyurl.com/23a6pw6.

Texto completo: WESTFIELD — Rookie Colts linebacker Bobby Okereke on Saturday denied wrongdoing in the Title IX case of sexual assault that was filed against him in 2015 when he was at Stanford, citing the twice-issued ruling of the university's in-house disciplinary board in the case.
Okereke, speaking on the matter for the first time since news of the allegation broke in June, maintains his innocence.
The third-round pick also cited his decision to reveal the nature of the incident to the Colts at the Senior Bowl. Okereke had not been publicly named at the time.
"Those were untrue allegations," Okereke said. "I fully complied with the school investigation and was found not responsible. I informed the team about it during the pre-draft process."
A New York Times report in 2016 revealed that the complainant decided not to file formal charges with the police in order to avoid the trauma of a police investigation, turning instead to the university's in-house disciplinary board. Under the U.S. Department of Education's interpretation of Title IX, universities are required to carry out investigations of sex crimes on campus and empowered to deal out discipline.
According to the Times, Stanford's board voted 3-2 in favor of the complainant in both cases, but Okereke was not disciplined because the school required a vote of at least 4-1 to find the accused responsible.
The Colts reviewed the Title IX investigation, interviewed Okereke at length about the incident and talked to several sources at Stanford about Okereke. They did not interview the complainant.
Ultimately, Indianapolis decided to pick Okereke despite the investigation.
"I don't want to sit here and act like we don't have sympathy for both sides," Colts general manager Chris Ballard said in June, characterizing it as a "he-said, she-said" incident. "It happened four years ago, and because there were no (police) charges and no disciplinary action taken by the university, and because of his track record since, we felt comfortable drafting him."
Ballard made team owner Jim Irsay aware of the allegations against Okereke before the draft, but took responsibility for the decision, saying it falls on him.
Okereke is not expected to be investigated by the NFL. Because the allegation was made years before he entered the league, it is not subject to the commissioner's personal conduct policy.
"Right now, I'm just focused on making this team," Okereke said. "Helping this team out like I can and moving forward."
Colts rookie linebacker Bobby Okereke said "I fully complied with the school investigation and was found not responsible."

Texto completo: In 1977, a fiery debate occurred on the floor of the U.S. Congress. Would television cameras be allowed to broadcast gavel-to-gavel coverage of congressional proceedings?
The late Congressman Leo Ryan, D-Calif., said:
"We are now about to change it from a forum to a theater. Now, that is not an exaggeration. That is a fact."
A prescient warning.
Ryan was right. America was beginning to merge politics and entertainment and the rules would never be the same. Gary Hart was arguably the first notable casualty of the changing landscape.
When politics turned into a lucrative sporting match In 1987, Hart was the front-runner to be the Democratic nominee for president.
While no reporter thought it appropriate to disclose the well-known indiscretions of President Kennedy decades earlier, Hart wouldn't enjoy the same treatment.
Hart was asked about his marital infidelity and he famously challenged reporters to follow him. The result for Hart and his family wasn't good.
Within weeks, he was caught red-handed committing monkey business on the boat literally named "Monkey Business."
While flawed, Hart did prove prophetic. In his speech announcing his withdrawal from the race he said: "Politics in this country — take it from me — is on the verge of becoming another form of athletic competition or sporting match. We all better do something to make this system work or we're all going to be soon rephrasing Jefferson to say: I tremble for my country when I think we may, in fact, get the kind of leaders we deserve."
Political coverage had officially stepped onto the stage of entertainment.
By the late '80s and '90s, Americans were changing how they consumed their news.
Walter Cronkite and the New York Times were being replaced with political talk radio and partisan leaning cable news.
Social media changed everything The launch of Facebook and Twitter took the dissemination of political information to a whole new level and the polarization of our political dialogue became even more extreme. A long list of digital-based news sites sprang up and providing accurate information wasn't their goal.
Often, these social media giants target a particular partisan audience, right or left, and write what their readers want. Frequently these "news sites" appeal to the extreme base of both political parties because those are the people who will keep coming back. More readers equal more advertisers and more profit.
As the rapper Puff Daddy famously sung, "It's All About the Benjamins." Understand this and you will understand why politics morphed into entertainment and why political debate is now financially rewarded for seeking the extremes instead of compromise.
The more outlandish the partisan topic on TV, radio or social media, the more people will watch, listen or click. All those actions result in more money for the entertainment/news venue and more popularity for the politician who delivers a scathing red-meat message. In the name of big ratings and profits, moderation is punished while extremism is enriched.
Political consultants have learned this too. Get your client on national TV, have him or her say hyperpartisan things and watch the money flow into the campaign.
People are getting rich in politics just like other entertainers are getting rich in movies and music.
The entertainment value of politics and the money that follows has turned our national dialogue into bitter partisanship that makes it almost impossible for members of different political parties to ever work together.
The vast majority of Americans who don't obsess about politics 24/7 are the losers in this contemporary politainment system. (And yes, I just invented a new word fusing politics and entertainment.)
Politicians, consultants and the news media largely ignore these Americans. These constituents don't watch, listen or contribute (as often) so their opinion immediately becomes less valuable.
Our Republic is in desperate need of people like the late Sen. John McCain who frequently reached across the partisan divide to do what was best for the country.
The current field of applicants to fill that role is small. God help us that we learn the virtue of dialogue over yelling; the purity of seeing the good in our political opponents and the desire to maintain our Republic for future generations.
Benjamin Franklin was famously asked shortly after the Constitution was ratified what type of government had been created. He replied, "It's a Republic, if you can keep it."
Wise words then and wise words now.

Texto completo: Here's a favorite (rejection letter) from a 1983 butt-kicking, sent to me by a New York literary agent: "I read five pages and wondered if you've ever been scared by a performing flea; read 10 more and developed a severe case of vertigo." That said, I've had an excellent run since then, and I'm very grateful for my good fortune, which is, all things given, pretty darn surprising.
Martin Clark
Devoting decades to his life to the rough-and-tumble field of law has been pure inspiration for the fictional stories that have made Martin Clark one of the most awarded and acclaimed legal thriller writers today.
The latest evidence of that claim: "The Substitution Order," Clark's newest novel, crafting a tale that embraces, at times, despair, hope, and unanswered questions about a lawyer who's hit rock bottom after an unrestrained summer of bad choices leaves him broke and broken-hearted.
Martin is a retired Virginia circuit court judge of 27 years whose previous novels ("The Jezebel Remedy," "The Legal Limit," "Plain Heathen Mischief" and "The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living") have garnered awards including a New York Times Notable Book, A Washington Post Book World Best Book of the Year, a Bookmark Magazine Book of the Year, a Boston Globe Book of the Year, a winner of the Library of Virginia's People's Choice Award in both 2009 and 2016, and many more.
He and his wife Deana, a photographer, live on a Virginia farm with dogs, cats, chickens and three donkeys.
After graduating from law school 35 years ago and going on to serve as a Virginia circuit court judge for 27 of those years, the law – and writing novels with law-related stories – must have become somewhat second nature for you. Your first book, "The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living," was published in 2000, followed by three others and now "The Substitution Order." All have garnered much attention. Has it surprised you that your books were immediately met with such success, which continues today?
I probably shouldn't admit this – your version sure makes for a better history – but my books were definitely not "immediately met with success." Like so many other writers, I collected years and years of rejection letters, until 1999, when Knopf took a chance on "The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living." To this day, at every gig I do, I read from those rejection letters. Here's a favorite riff from a 1983 butt-kicking, sent to me by a New York literary agent: "I read five pages and wondered if you've ever been scared by a performing flea; read 10 more and developed a severe case of vertigo." That said, I've had an excellent run since then, and I'm very grateful for my good fortune, which is, all things given, pretty darn surprising.
Your works carry a dry sense of humor that is built into the twists of the plots and the personalities of the characters. Have you found that to be one of the most appealing aspects of writing – does it come naturally to you?
Pretty much. Plus, there's so much sadness and heartbreak in the court system that occasional levity helps all of us get through the days. Eighty percent of my job as a judge was sentencing people for theft, drug charges and probation violations – a smile or a wry comment or quiet joke often made some weeks just a tiny bit more tolerable.
In "The Substitution Order," you place a likeable, down-and-out attorney in the position of combatting scam artists trying to undo his career for good, even as he struggles to win it back by playing by the rules. His journey plays out amidst health issues, relationship foibles and legal loopholes. How do you go about developing characters and their circumstances, and do you tend to base the substance of your plots on what you've seen during years of law and court experience?
I absolutely draw on my time in the courtroom – write what you know, correct? But the characters and the plots are largely fictionalized, given that much of what happens in court is frequently mundane and routine. More to the point, if, as a reader, you invest in a book, you don't want a legal primer, you want a good ride, some entertainment, some twists and turns, and maybe a very small instruction at the end. And, to be clear, in "The Substitution Order," Kevin Moore certainly knows the rules and how to use them, but I wouldn't say he follows them to the letter.
The end of "The Substitution Order" was a bittersweet surprise. Is that in sync with your experience of handling legal cases that may not have turned out as you expected?
Thank you for mentioning that. As writers, we hope to tell a realistic, entertaining story, create likeable characters that readers will root for, and then provide a payoff over the last few pages. "Bittersweet surprises" is a great way to put it and exactly what I hope "The Substitution Order" delivers. As for handling court cases and how I've seen them turn out, virtually any lawyer will tell you that you just never know. Plus, as I highlight in the book, sometimes it's a victory for a litigant when things don't go totally and completely sideways, and you sneak out with minor wounds and not a full-blown bloodletting.
What have you enjoyed most about creating these stories, and what would you say is your biggest challenge when writing?
My biggest writing challenge these days is finding the stamina and focus to slog through all the technical, picayune final edits. I love writing, but debating commas and preferred spellings and capitalization rules is tedious. Necessary, but tedious.
You can check behind me, and you'll discover I've never said anything like this before – I generally don't care to praise my own writing – but "The Substitution Order" is by far the best novel I've ever put on paper. On December 30, 2015, I almost died, and it took me about a year to fully recover. I was lucky enough to have a steadfast wife and a godsend, genius surgeon, and now I'm fixed, totally normal. So, truthfully, I enjoyed simply being able to sit down and write this novel, being able to do it. Brushing against ruin tends to make you slightly wiser and a little more thoughtful. As my editor told me about this book: "You've always had a great story to tell, but now you actually have something worthwhile to say."
Here's a favorite (rejection letter) from a 1983 butt-kicking, sent to me by a New York literary agent: "I read five pages and wondered if you've ever been scared by a performing flea; read 10 more and developed a severe case of vertigo." That said, I've had an excellent run since then, and I'm very grateful for my good fortune, which is, all things given, pretty darn surprising.

Is Trump stressing us out? Increasing numbers of Americans report being worried or angry, at rates similar to the residents of countries like Iran and Rwanda.

Texto completo: Political Science 101 says that Donald Trump should be running on the economy for 2020. Political Science 201 says matters are not that simple. The stress of being an American under Trump is getting worse.
The economy is doing pretty well. Economic growth is a shade under 3 percent, unemployment is well below 4 percent, and inflation is below 2 percent. These are great top-line numbers, thanks to the Trump administration's unwitting discovery of Keynesianism.
These numbers do not tell the whole story, however. The New York Times' Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman note that while voters give Trump decent marks on the economy, there's a soft underbelly to those numbers: "Most workers are still gaining less under Mr. Trump than they did during previous times of low unemployment, such as the late 1990s, and fewer than two in five respondents to a SurveyMonkey poll for The New York Times this month said their family was better off financially today than a year ago."
If the economy is doing well but average Americans aren't feeling it, that is bad news for Trump. And looking beyond the economy, there is an awful lot of evidence suggesting that Americans are not feeling too well. The polling data is one obvious metric. According to Gallup, in 2018, more Americans were stressed, worried and angry than at any point in the last 12 years. That is extraordinary when you consider that the past dozen years includes the 2008 financial crisis and multiple terrorist attacks. Furthermore, American stress levels are among the highest in the world. Seriously, Americans were as stressed as Iranians and more stressed than citizens of Rwanda, Turkey, and Venezuela. That's nuts.
Does Trump have anything to do with this? It is difficult to determine causality, but the data is pretty suggestive. Trump inspires a whole host of negative reactions in most Americans. Pew polled Americans in the spring and asked them to describe how Trump's comments and statements made them feel. The top seven responses, in order: concerned (76 percent), confused (70 percent), embarrassed (69 percent), exhausted (67 percent), angry (65 percent), insulted (62 percent) and frightened (56 percent). I am not a psychologist, but I would reckon that there might be something going on here. If these are the dominant emotions that Trump elicits, and if Trump is everywhere, then hey, it's going to stress a lot of Americans out!
Even more concrete evidence has come to light in the past week. As The Washington Post reported July 19, "Researchers have begun to identify correlations between Trump's election and worsening cardiovascular health, sleep problems, anxiety and stress, especially among Latinos in the United States." One disturbing JAMA study looked at premature births, an easily quantifiable metric of stress during pregnancy. After analyzing approximately 33 million births between 2009 and 2017 researchers found 3 percent more preterm births than expected among Latina women in the nine months after the election.
It's not just Latina women who are feeling the stress of America under Trump. The Boston Globe's Zoe Greenberg reports that psychologists are having to treat a number of anxiety-related maladies among minority clients, including insomnia and hypervigilance. When they dig deeper, the underlying cause becomes apparent:
"As Trump doubles down on attacks against the four women of color in Congress known as 'The Squad,' which includes [Minnesota's Ilhan] Omar and Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, some people of color in the Boston area describe a psychological toll that the episodes, and Trump's frequent overt hostility, have had on their daily lives - not just this month, but in the many months since the 2016 presidential campaign began.
"Some have tried to guard themselves against the everyday tumult coming from the White House; others have become more vocal in politics. Some have found a grim silver lining, because the scourge of racism that some white people recently claimed had disappeared is now impossible to ignore or explain away. Many said it reminds them of other dark moments of personal and national history, when racial hostility and tension reared up.
" 'We have now 20 years of research that connects racism with just about every mental health issue that has been studied,' said Monnica Williams, a professor and the director of the laboratory for Culture and Mental Health Disparities at the University of Connecticut.
"The effect of 'vicarious racism' - seeing, for example, videos of police shootings of unarmed black men, or hearing chants of 'Send her back!' - has not been studied as much, according to Jessica Graham-LoPresti, an assistant professor of psychology at Suffolk University, but social media indicates the experience is certainly on the rise.
" 'People are being now not only exposed to their own experiences of racism, but they're being vicariously exposed to everyone's experience of racism,' she said, adding that patients often exhibit symptoms very similar to those from post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as depression and social anxiety."
There are a lot of drivers of stress. A robust economy should lessen a primary driver. But the data is pretty clear. The U.S. economy is not benefiting as many citizens as one would expect. More significantly, Trump's racial divisiveness and bellicose rhetoric are stressing out an awful lot of Americans.
There are multiple ways to help alleviate this national anxiety. More social capital will be needed. More balanced economic growth would be nice. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that the best palliative care for U.S. stress levels will be to make sure Donald Trump exits the White House as expeditiously as possible.

Texto completo: People are always changing their minds, day to day. But over the past 20-odd years one group has shifted to an astounding degree: highly educated white Democrats. I'm not sure I understand why this group has undergone such a transformation, but it has, and the effects are reshaping our politics.
The easiest way to describe the shift is to say that educated Democrats have moved steadily to the left. In 1994, only about a sixth of Democrats who had gone to graduate school said they were consistently liberal. In 2015, more than 50% did. In 1994, only 12% of Democrats with college degrees said they were consistently liberal. Eleven years later, 47% did, according to the Pew Research Center.
One of the results is that, as my colleague Thomas B. Edsall put it this week, there are now three Democratic Parties. The most moderate faction is the most nonwhite and focuses on pocketbook issues like jobs and taxes. The most left-wing segment is the most populated by whites. It focuses on issues like abortion, global warming, immigration and race and gender equity.
To say that white educated Democrats have moved left is true, but it's not the essential truth. The bigger truth is that this segment is now more likely to see politics through a racial lens. Racial equity has become the prism through which many in this group see a range of other issues.
For example, immigration is now seen through the lens of race in a way that simply wasn't true two decades ago. As Zach Goldberg noted in an essay in Tablet Magazine, between 1965 and 2000, the percentage of white liberals who wanted higher immigration levels never deviated far from 10%. During the Obama administration, the number rose to the range of 20 to 30%. Now, more than 50% of white progressives want to see higher immigration levels.
Many progressives see barriers to immigration as akin to unjust racial barriers. Many want to dismantle the border enforcement agencies and eliminate criminal sanctions against undocumented crossings precisely because they are seen as structures of oppression that white people impose on brown people.
The racial lens also affects views on foreign policy topics. For most of the 20th century, for example, white liberals consistently sympathized with Israel more than with the Palestinians. But that has reversed. White progressives are much more critical of Israel than ever before. What had once been seen as an intractable regional conflict between a democracy and a series of authoritarian regimes trying to destroy it is now seen as a conflict between a white colonialist power and the brown people it oppresses.
In this new dispensation, the concept of white privilege is on everybody's lips. As Goldberg points out, in 1996 and 2010 about a quarter of white liberals thought racial discrimination was a very serious problem. By 2016, 58% did. White liberals have warmer attitudes toward other races than they do toward their own.
In this dispensation, more white progressives view society as basically unjust. In last year's Hidden Tribes survey, for example, 86% of progressive activists said that people's life outcomes are outside their individual control.
This shift in outlook has yielded several paradoxes. As many researchers have pointed out, white progressives are now farther left on immigration and race and diversity issues than the typical Hispanic or African American voter.
Second, two of the great marks of privilege in our society are skin color and education levels, and yet in the Democratic Party it's the highly educated whites who express the greatest alienation with the system that benefits them so directly.
Third, the progressive framework is egalitarian, but the shift has opened up wider opinion and cultural gaps between this highly educated elite and less educated groups.
Why have white progressives moved so far so fast? There are several theories.
The most direct theory is that America is a land of systemic racism. Highly educated white progressives have woken up to this fact and are out in front of other groups. This is, after all, the nation that elected Donald Trump and that puts children in cages at the border.
The more cynical take starts with the observation that the creed of wokeness is mostly centered on the super-prestigious universities and the affluent progressive enclaves along the coasts. In this take, if you're a rich white child of privilege you have to go to extraordinary lengths to prove you're one of the good children of privilege and not one of the bad ones. In this take, white progressives don noble clothing to make themselves feel good without really dismantling the structures that keep them in lifestyle bubbles and on top.
For me, it's a good idea to assume that people adopt their positions for honest, well-intentioned reasons. The crucial question then becomes: When is the racial lens (with its implied charge of racism against those who disagree) the right lens to use and when is it not? When does it illuminate an issue and when does it conceal?

TOLEDO EXPRESS; Mayor eyes renaming airport for Gene Kranz; He tried to get it changed last year

Texto completo: Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz often cracks wise during his monthly radio segment on WSPD 1370, but he meant what he said on Wednesday regarding the name of Toledo's airport.

The mayor, speaking on the Scott Sands Show, said the name of Toledo Express Airport should be changed to honor Gene Kranz, the Toledo-born flight director for Apollo 11.

Mr. Sands mentioned it was the 50th anniversary of the first lunar mission when the mayor said he tried to get the name changed last year in time for the anniversary.

I'm very serious about it, Mayor Kapszukiewicz said in an interview Friday with The Blade. I've been talking about it publicly for a year and a half and I'm glad someone is paying attention. It's such an obvious way to recognize one of the most important people in the history of flight. If he's not someone you name an airport after, I don't know who is.

The mayor said conversations have taken place with the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority about changing the name, but he didn't get the feeling the idea was well-received. He said the process would likely require cutting through red tape and take some time.

The city owns the airport, but it is operated by the port authority. Mayor Kapszukiewicz said he has spoken to the law department about asking city council to change the name, but said that could get legally murky, and would prefer to go a different route.

When the 50th anniversary happened last week, I found myself biting my tongue when Gene was quoted in the New York Times and on CBS Evening News, the mayor said. He was being treated as a national hero. A part of me was a little frustrated our local leadership didn't share my vision a year ago. Maybe we can re-engage.

A request for comment from the port authority's board of directors was referred to airport manager Joe Rotterdam, who said Toledo Express would be open to the idea of changing the name. He said paperwork would need to be filed with the Federal Aviation Administration to make the switch. Pilots' documents would have to be updated as well.

The biggest component is a full rebranding, Mr. Rotterdam said. Changing out signs, logos, signs around the facility, and working with ODOT and the city to change the signs directing people to the airport.

Mr. Rotterdam said it would take six to 12 months to implement necessary changes, and there would be a cost involved, but wasn't sure on an exact amount.

There was an effort in 2006 and 2007 to name the airport after Martin Luther King, Jr.

Mr. Kranz, 85, was born in Toledo and graduated from Central Catholic High School. He also directed the successful rescue mission of the Apollo 13 crew.

Texto completo: ZIMMERMAN, MINN. - Wearing a white cowboy hat and a black rain jacket, Yvette VanDerBrink banters with the soggy crowd clustered around her on a wet July morning.
She waggles a hand. She points a finger. She scans the faces of the burly, bearded men in ball caps, searching for the look that tells her, yes -- he really, really wants the rusty motorcycle parts in the cardboard box at her feet.
"Sold for $600," she calls out as the crowd shuffles on to the next item.
This is VanDerBrink's comfort zone: a barn full of rare treasures from a bygone age, lovingly assembled over decades by eccentric collector Roger Dickenson and now going to new homes. From her base in tiny Hardwick, Minn., a town of 190 residents some 215 miles southwest of the Twin Cities, she's built a thriving auction business, specializing in vintage vehicles and farm equipment.
At 54, she's overcome cancer, several brushes with death and prejudice against women in her field, making her way with grit, energy and a no-bull attitude.
"I'm pretty ballsy," she said. "I'm pretty fearless."
This isn't like those auctions you see on cable TV, where shiny collector cars roll across a dazzling stage and fetch prices of more than $100,000. VanDerBrink sells "regular stuff to regular people," said Jeff Stumb, a vintage car expert with Coker Tire, a Tennessee company that sells tires for the classic-car market.
"The museums are fine, the high-end things are fine," VanDerBrink said. "But those barn finds are my bread and butter."
VanDerBrink typically handles anywhere from 20 to 30 sales a year and has held auctions in 18 states.
"She's always pretty busy. She doesn't let any grass grow under her feet, that's for darn sure," said Frank Imholte, executive vice president of the Minnesota State Auctioneers Association. "She's cut a pretty wide path when it comes to collector cars. She's good at it."
The prophet speaks
VanDerBrink grew up on a dairy farm in Garretson, S.D., about 5 miles from the Minnesota state line. She was always involved with cars; her dad collected and sold '57 Chevys and helped run races at small-town tracks.
She married, went to work as a hospital lab technician and had two kids. To make extra money, she and her husband, Steve, bought old farm tractors, fixed them up and sold them.
Sometime after the family moved to Hardwick, life at the hospital started getting too hectic.
"They changed how we did things," she recalled. "It was night shift-day shift, and after a while you even forgot if you had underwear on."
Going to work one night, she thought about auction school.
"It came out of the blue," she said. "So I got information from the auction school in Billings, Mont., and I didn't tell a soul." She also didn't send in her application.
"There was no way I could do it," VanDerBrink recalled. "I was a mom. And if I left, surely the dog would die and the house would burn down."
Six months later, her mother invited her to a local church, where a Pentecostal prophet was appearing.
"He called me up [on stage]," she said. "And he said, 'How come you haven't sent in those school papers that are in the cupboard in your kitchen?' "
That night, her husband asked if she had papers in the cupboard. Yes, she replied.
"And he said, 'You need to send them in.' "
VanDerBrink got her auctioneer certificate and went to work. She lined up her first auction in the fall of 2001.
'Make me a sandwich'
In the early days, she faced scorn from men who didn't think she belonged.
"One guy told me, 'Honey, why don't you go make me a sandwich and let the boys do this?' " she said. But the farm girl knew how to handle an ornery critter.
"I didn't take any bids from him," she said, laughing at the memory. "And he wondered what was going on. And I said, 'Hey … I don't have to take any bids from you!' "
In those days, seeing a female auctioneer "was like spotting an alien or Bigfoot," VanDerBrink said. "Like, a woman doing this? That's like a white buffalo."
Now that she's established, her critics have backed off, and she has, too.
Today, between 10 and 20 percent of the licensed auctioneers in Minnesota are women, Imholte said.
In 2007, VanDerBrink was in Colorado, booking an auction, when she felt a lump in her breast. It was breast cancer.
Over the next three years she went through multiple surgeries -- including a double mastectomy -- chemotherapy and radiation. Several times she became infected and nearly died. But she kept working.
"I just knew that if I quit, that was going to be the end of it," she said.
She had a wig made, but every time it rained or snowed, "I looked like a wet clown," she said. "So I threw it away and did it in a pink hat.
"One of my competitors was telling people, 'Don't hire Yvette -- she's dying.' And that pissed me off."
She came out of her illness and landed the auction that really put her on the map.
Ray Lambrecht ran a small-town Chevrolet dealership in Nebraska. Over the years, he stashed hundreds of barely driven, unsold cars on his farm. In 2013, when he finally decided it was time to sell, VanDerBrink won the job.
The sale was a sensation, among old-car hobbyists and beyond. More than 10,000 people showed up in Pierce, Neb., as news helicopters flew overhead. The auction was covered by national media -- the New York Times labeled it "Field of Low-Mileage Dreams" -- and it landed on more than 100 newspaper front pages, VanDerBrink said proudly.
Her experiences have strengthened her faith. The bid cards at her auctions carry a message calculated to reach the heart of an automotive enthusiast.
"Who's driving in your life? With the Lord Jesus at your side, you'll never need a map," she reads, sobbing as she nears the end. "Put your trust in Him and let Him steer your life."
A week after the Zimmerman auction, she closed the books and declared it a success. The trove of cars, motorcycles, parts and assorted household goods brought "just shy of a million," she said. "I'm happy, and the family is very happy."
She savors the thought that one man's passion will live on with others.
It's what she loves, VanDerBrink said: "Bringing ordinary people's collections to life."

Texto completo: We met singer and author Julian Lennon when he was in Manhattan recently. He just finished his book "Love the Earth," the last in his "White Feather Flier" trilogy, and we talked to him about that and his career as a photographer and musician.
Was one of your life goals to write a book series?
No, not at all. Four years ago I didn't have a clue. Actually, the co-writer, Bart [Davis], he was a dear friend of mine. He was a New York Times bestseller, so he's written some incredible books. And we were talking about doing a biography on my life and what I've been up to. And as he was researching my life, he discovered the White Feather Foundation. And he said to me, you love the work that you do, but what about the kids? And I said, what do you mean? He said, you haven't done anything directed specifically towards kids. And I said, well, you know I taught them music. Perhaps photography to some degree, I had some reach. But then we talked further, and we came up with the idea of doing the children's books. We talked about - rather than just doing one, let's have a bit of a journey with the concept. And then it took a year each time to write each book because you want to make sure that when you're writing, you want to say things in the right way so that things aren't misconstrued or misunderstood.
When you were younger, was writing always your dream job, and what age did you start writing?
I guess writing to me came in the form of writing lyrics for music. That was a version of poetry - it's a version of storytelling. I think most of the things that I've done in life are versions of storytelling, whether it's through music, whether it's through documentaries I've made, whether it's through books.
What do you like to do most in your spare time?
I love to travel. Whether it's for work or for otherwise, I think seeing such diverse cultures around the world, meeting such incredible people that do so many different things around the world, that's one of my favorite things to do. And if I can't do that, then I love to power-walk through cities and take pictures as a photographer. I like motorcycles. I'm a biker. I have been since I was 11 years old. If the weather is OK, I'll get on a bike and just drive and go places I've never been before. You know, just open a map and go. And discover along the way - that's part of the glory, of the journey. Those are my favorite things to do.
If you had to choose between a writer or a musician, which would you choose?
I don't like the concept of being pigeonholed in any way, shape or form. I would fight against that in every way. For me it's about freedom of expression in every way possible. So if you want to be a painter, you want to be a photographer, singer, musician or writer, director, you should go for it all.
Is it harder writing a book or dealing with your fame?
Well, I'm pretty low-key on the fame front. I've learned over the years to deal with whatever consequences I'm confronted with in regards to being a public person. I try not to do the fame thing. It's not important to me. To me it's about being an artist and true to myself. So I don't have any problems with that. I think writing is probably, again, harder just getting it right. Getting it right and getting what you want to say across in the best way possible.
Do prefer being in the United States or England?
I prefer everywhere. I grew up in England until I was about 20 years old and then I moved to America. I lived in New York. I've lived in Los Angeles. I now live in France in a place called Monaco. I feel fortunate that my work carries me all over the world, whether that's America, Europe and/or Asia. It's nice to go home to where you live, where you have a home, but I love to see the world. There is no favorite except my own bed. There's nothing like getting back into your own bed after long, long travels.
Is it true you were an inspiration for some of the Beatles' songs?
Apparently, I was. There's a few songs out there, but the main one being "Hey Jude." Paul McCartney, my father's writing partner, when my father separated from my mother - that's another story - he felt sorry for me and my mom, so he wrote, originally it was "Hey Jules." Which is why my nickname is Jules. But it didn't rhyme so well, so "Hey Jude" worked better for him. And yeah, I think I've heard that song more than probably anybody else in the world. But still thankful, you know.
Do you sing in the shower, and if you do, do you wish that you could write in the shower?
Write in the shower? I think there are waterproof pens and things, work boards and things out there. Actually, I don't sing in the shower. But often ideas come to me in the shower. So if the phone is nearby with a voice recorder on it, I'll jump out of the shower just to put something in there, whether it's a musical idea or a lyrical idea or even a project idea. Why not?
In the past you worked with Bart Davis. Do you plan to work with Bart in the future?
I think so. Again, the whole reason he and I started writing was initially to write a biography about my life so far. So that is probably in the cards. But there are other projects, I'm sure.
What is your next project going to be?
I've got some music and photography projects coming up. In fact, one of the main projects coming up is that Bart and I are trying to get the book series made into an animated TV series. Once I've done the promotional book tour in L.A., I've got meetings with the likes of Apple, Disney and all of those guys to bring that to life. So, fingers crossed on that one, but that's one of the main next projects.

Texto completo: To treat blockages in his heart vessels, Neil Armstrong underwent bypass surgery, the most common open-heart operation in the United States.
The first man on the moon died of post-surgery complications, but overall the chances of death after the procedure for most Americans have dropped to close to zero.
"By and large with bypass surgery, the chances that you will have prolonged good outcome are quite high," said Dr. Todd Rosengart, the DeBakey Bard chair of surgery at Baylor University College of Medicine in Houston. He said he has performed more than 4,000 heart procedures in his 30-year career.
"The reason we recommend it is that for the properly selected patient, they will do better with bypass surgery than without bypass surgery," he said.
This week, The Enquirer reported that the hospital system then called Mercy Health paid $6 million to Armstrong's family to settle claims that caregiver errors at Mercy Health Fairfield Hospital hastened his death Aug. 25, 2012. The system name now is Bon Secours Mercy Health.
The Enquirer asked Cincinnati hospital systems with heart-surgery programs to speak generally about the risks of bypass surgery, not about the Armstrong case. All declined.
The American Heart Association reports that nearly half of all Americans have some degree of cardiovascular disease. About 90% of men over 80 have the condition. Armstrong, of Indian Hill, had just passed his 82th birthday when he underwent the procedure at the Butler County hospital.
The Society of Thoracic Surgeons has for three decades compiled a ratings system to help patients understand how well hospitals perform heart operations. From the volume of data, the society also developed an online calculator for patients and doctors to estimate risk.
The good news is, "Nowadays, there are abundant data and information, with beautifully done studies a number of years ago, based on the anatomy of the blockages of the arteries, so we can very carefully predict the outcome," Rosengart said.
In the society's ratings for June 2017 to June 2018, 97.9% of patients at Mercy Health Fairfield Hospital, where Armstrong was treated, survived bypass surgery. The rating found 88.5% of Mercy Health patients did not suffer major post-operative complication.
The website Hospital Compare, run by the federal health program Medicare, said the national death rate after bypass surgery is 3.1%, and the rate at Mercy Health Fairfield is "no different than the national rate."
The Society of Thoracic Surgeons ratings are only fractionally different at other hospitals in metro Cincinnati.
Rosengart said that for bypass surgery, "We talk about a risk of death of about 1%, which is better than even five or 10 years ago. We've gotten better at what we do."
What happened to Armstrong appears to be a rarity. Rosengart was not involved in Armstrong's care and has not seen the medical record. But, "Anything that can go wrong with the human body can go wrong after bypass surgery."
On July 20, 1969, Armstrong was the first man to set foot on the moon, commanding the Apollo 11 mission. After leaving the space program, he returned to Southwest Ohio and lived a quiet life. In August 2012, after testing suggested the need, Armstrong underwent bypass surgery to reroute blood around his heart in four places.
The Enquirer and the New York Times reported this week that at the request of Armstrong's sons, an outside doctor reviewed the medical file in 2014. He concluded that the cascade of complications began when a nurse, working according to hospital protocol, pulled two wires attached to Armstrong's newly installed pacemaker.
The wire pull tore the sac around Armstrong's heart. Caregivers took steps to stop the bleeding, but more than an hour passed until the damage was repaired. By then, Armstrong's brain had been starved of oxygen. He died about two weeks later.

Texto completo: At the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, the rule is sacrosanct: Never publicly disclose client advice. And for the most part, adherence to that rule has served the company well.
But in recent months, as government officials seek to assign blame for the opioid crisis that has strangled large parts of the nation, McKinsey's advice is surfacing in ways that are deeply embarrassing for the influential firm, whose clients include many of the world's most admired companies. One lawsuit stated that McKinsey advised a pharmaceutical company to "get more patients on higher doses of opioids" and study techniques "for keeping patients on opioids longer."
And in a civil trial that wrapped up last week, Oklahoma joined two other states -- Massachusetts and New Jersey -- in showing that McKinsey offered advice to a drug company on how to increase opioid sales at a time when abuse of its pain medicine was widespread.
Although McKinsey is not a defendant, Oklahoma used McKinsey consulting records to help build its case against Johnson & Johnson and a subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, for what the state said was irresponsible marketing of a fentanyl patch called Duragesic.
The Oklahoma case differed from those in the other states because it focused on Johnson & Johnson, a company that had largely avoided the spotlight during the opioid epidemic. Before the trial, two other defendants, Purdue Pharma and the Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, settled with Oklahoma for $ 270 million and $ 85 million.
Johnson & Johnson chose not to settle, making it the first of hundreds of civil opioid cases across the nation to go to trial. Judge Thad Balkman of Oklahoma state district court heard the case without a jury and said he planned to report his findings before the end of August. Oklahoma is seeking up to $ 17.5 billion to address the opioid crisis in the state.
The cases in Massachusetts and New Jersey also highlighted McKinsey's hand in marketing opioids. Those cases are still being litigated.
Earlier this month, the State of Massachusetts released new documents from 2013 that detailed McKinsey's recommendations on how Purdue Pharma could "turbocharge" sales of its widely abused opioid OxyContin. The state said McKinsey advised Purdue to sharply increase sales visits to targeted doctors and to consider mail orders as a way to bypass pharmacies that had been tightening oversight of opioid prescriptions.
In a statement released to The New York Times on Wednesday, McKinsey said it had gotten out of the business of giving advice related to opioids. The company declined to say how much it was paid working for opioid manufacturers.
"Our historical work for clients in this industry was designed to support the legal prescription and use of our clients' products," it said. "Opioids have had a devastating impact on our communities, however, and we are no longer advising clients on any opioid-specific business on a global basis."
Purdue Pharma denies the allegations in the lawsuits and says it has done more than any company to address the opioid epidemic.
John Sparks, a lawyer for Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary Janssen, said the manufacturer made "F.D.A.-approved pain medicines" and "took steps to educate doctors so they could make informed treatment decisions," adding, "That's what you'd expect a responsible company to do."
In Oklahoma, a lawyer for the state, Bradley Beckworth, accused Janssen of being "the kingpin" of opioids because it owned two companies that produced and refined Tasmanian poppies into a narcotic for other drug manufacturers, including Purdue.
Janssen rejected that characterization, saying that it operated its poppy business -- which it has since sold -- legally and that it was overseen at all stages by the government regulators.
Johnson & Johnson also developed its own opioid pill, which it no longer produces, but said it constituted only a sliver of the national opioid market.
During the trial, Mr. Beckworth introduced a PowerPoint presentation, prepared by McKinsey for Johnson & Johnson in 2002, that raised the issue of whether the company had been sufficiently aggressive in courting patients for its fentanyl patch. In one slide, McKinsey asked, "Are we properly targeting and influencing prescription behavior in pain clinics?"
McKinsey recommended "targeting and influencing" doctors who specifically treat back pain in the elderly and those in long-term care. The consultants also advised the company to move physicians who were "stuck" in prescribing less potent opioids into prescribing stronger formulations.
McKinsey, in its statement, said its work for Johnson & Johnson "was designed to support the legal use of a patch that was then widely understood to be less susceptible to abuse."
In court testimony, Johnson & Johnson's corporate representative, Kimberly Deem-Eshleman, tried to distance her company from McKinsey's advice. Twice she told the judge that these were "McKinsey's words," not Johnson & Johnson's.
Mr. Beckworth, the state lawyer, asked Ms. Deem-Eshleman if her company fired McKinsey because of its recommendations. She replied no.
"Still use them today?" he asked.
"Yes, for different projects," she replied.
Ms. Deem-Eshleman said that Johnson & Johnson's sales representatives had called on doctors to educate them on the Duragesic patch, and that there was nothing nefarious about those visits. The company said it no longer promoted the patch.
Oklahoma's legal case rests on the claim that the company violated a public nuisance law by harming patient health. In doing so, the state tried to contrast Johnson & Johnson's opioid sales practices with its credo: "We believe our first responsibility is to the doctors, nurses and patients, the mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services."
In his closing statement, Mike Hunter, the Oklahoma attorney general, described the efforts as egregious.
"What is truly unprecedented here," he said, "is the conduct of these defendants on embarking on a cunning, cynical and deceitful scheme to create and feed the need for opioids, engineer a mutant poppy to amplify the need they created, overstate the effectiveness and minimize the risk of these drugs."
Johnson & Johnson's lead lawyer, Larry Ottaway, dismissed the state's contention that the drug company had created the opioid crisis in Oklahoma. "We have never denied the effects of opioid addiction on the citizens of this state," Mr. Ottaway told the judge. But the company acted legally in trying to help patients seeking relief from debilitating pain, he said. He added that the company did that by introducing a fentanyl patch that, statistics show, was less prone to abuse.

DoorDash to change its policy on tips after consumer outcry

Texto completo: DoorDash, the nation's leading food-delivery app, is taking a tip from frustrated employees and customers - and actually passing along their drivers' hard-earned tips.
In a series of tweets Tuesday, CEO Tony Xu said the company would overhaul its controversial tipping policy. Under the current rule, a tip left through DoorDash's app is used to meet the minimum payment promised to the delivery crew. Customers, workers and advocacy groups accused DoorDash of using gratuities to underwrite drivers' paychecks.
"From recent feedback, DoorDash realized that "some customers who did tip would feel like their tip did not matter, Xu wrote. The new rule: Workers' earnings "will increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order.
Take The New York Times reporter who recently set out as a food deliveryman and was guaranteed $6.85 for his first DoorDash order. A customer tipped $3 through the app. But the reporter only received $6.85. The company in turn reduced its own payment to $3.85 and used the $3 tip to meet the deliveryman's minimum guarantee. Issues with how delivery services tip have also been covered by NBC News.
Countless actual DoorDash workers have aired the same grievance, often on online forums. One worker posted on Reddit that DoorDash "technically doesn't steal' your tip. They give it to you . . . but they use it to subsidize what they pay out of pocket which is basically the same thing at the end of the day.
Advocacy groups are pushing for more explanation from Xu, too.
In a statement, Rachel Lauter, executive director of the labor organization Working Washington, said DoorDash "has been swiping customer tips since they first deployed their deceptive pay model in 2017. The company needs to explain how it will ensure those two years of tips are "accounted for and redistributed to the workers who should have received them in the first place, Lauter said.
Tipping has been a controversial battle for other delivery giants.
Last year, Instacart implemented a new policy that guaranteed drivers a $10 minimum payment for each delivery batch.
But workers found that some of their tips went toward that $10 minimum and said their earnings quickly dropped. In February, Instacart reversed its payment policy and said tips would separated from Instacart's minimum guarantee and that delivery workers would be retroactively reimbursed for when their tips went toward those minimums.
Postmates and Uber Eats say tips aren't used to subsidize workers' minimum guarantees, the Verge reported. Grubhub and Seamless told the Verge that drivers keep all tips, and that "their per-order earnings are set independent from gratuities. In February, the Los Angeles Times reported that Amazon sometimes used tips earned by contracted delivery drivers to meet their guaranteed earnings.

Leonard Pitts: Honorary whiteness must be one powerful drug

Texto completo: You had to become an “honorary white.”
<img class="size-full wp-image-2657490" src="https://i1.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Leonard-Pitts-Color.jpg?resize=290%2C193&ssl=1" alt="" width="290" height="193" data-recalc-dims="1" />
That was the status South Africa used to bestow upon black performers from the United States who visited the apartheid regime. The O’Jays, Tina Turner, Ray Charles and Eartha Kitt were among those who received that designation, allowing them access to hotels and restaurants from which black Africans were barred.
It was, as you might expect, a controversial thing. Or as Eddie Levert of the O’Jays later observed, “We’ve been apologizing ever since.”
While there is no official “honorary white” status in this country, American politics has evolved a rough analog. As lily-white conservatism has lurched deeper into a brazen racism and xenophobia reminiscent of the 1950s, black and brown people willing to use their color to give it moral cover have seen themselves eagerly embraced by those whose sins they abet.
It’s not quite access to “whites only” hotels and restaurants, but it is acceptance into white spaces otherwise closed and hostile to people like you. Sometimes, it even brings a kind of petty stardom in the murky world of right-wing bloggers, social media and cable news. Racist xenophobes get to feel that they’re not racist or xenophobic at all because, hey, “Diamond and Silk” agree with them.
But ultimately, the joke is always on you. In recent days, we’ve seen that lesson learned painfully and publicly by two men: a black Donald Trump voter named Kevin Martin and a Donald Trump friend of Puerto Rican heritage named Geraldo Rivera.
The former told CNN last week that when Trump told four congresswomen of color to “go back” to their countries, it “just came out of left field” and “hit a lot of us in the gut.” The latter, while loyally insisting Trump has “been treated unfairly,” conceded to The New York Times that, “As much as I have denied it and averted my eyes from it, this latest incident made it impossible.”
To which, the only appropriate response is: Wow. Just … wow.
After the housing discrimination suits, the quote about black laziness, the persecution of the Central Park Five, now it’s suddenly “impossible” for Rivera to deny Trump’s bigotry? After the Mexican rapists crack, the smear against a Mexican-American judge, the Muslim ban, the “very fine people on both sides,” Martin thinks Trump’s latest rancid spew “came out of left field”?!
One can only conclude that honorary whiteness must be one powerful drug. Side effects include cultural amnesia and inability to process reality.
It’s not that people of color can’t or shouldn’t be conservative, as that term was once understood. But this modern iteration doesn’t care about small government or muscular diplomacy. Rather, it is working to normalize racism and enshrine xenophobia, and if you’re black or brown and still don’t realize that, well, again, wow.
The thing is, honorary whiteness has its limitations. Consider Barry Martin, an honorary white black dancer who toured South Africa in 1983 and was in a single-car accident while there. An ambulance picked up the white driver, but left Martin in the wreckage. A black motorist happened by and took him to a white hospital where he was refused admission. Eventually, Martin wound up in the black section of another hospital.
Somewhere in all that jostling, his injured spine was severed. Martin became a quadriplegic. He never walked, much less danced, again.
Take his story as an object lesson, you honorary whites of American politics: You are not special, only useful.
You’d be wise to learn the difference.

Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard sues Google for $50 million

Texto completo: Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is suing Google alleging that the tech giant harmed her bid for the presidency and infringed on her free speech when it briefly suspended her campaign’s advertising account after the first Democratic primary debate in June.
Following her debate performance on June 26, Gabbard briefly became one of the most searched presidential candidates online. But as Gabbard was trending on Google, the company suspended her Google ads account for six hours. Gabbard says her campaign never received a clear answer as to why. Google messages referenced potential problems with billing information, suspicious payment activity or violations of their advertising policies.
The lawsuit says that the six-hour suspension of Google ads irreparably harmed Gabbard’s presidential campaign.
“Interest and searches for Gabbard during the post-debate timeframe had skyrocketed,” according to the complaint filed today in federal court. “Ads directing searchers to her campaign page would have brought Tulsi Gabbard’s unique message to millions of Americans — and would have undoubtedly increased the campaign donations Gabbard received.”
Gabbard suggests that the account suspension was retaliation for voicing her concerns about the power wielded by companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, and her advocacy for breaking up big tech companies, an allegation Google denies.
“Since at least June 2019, Google has used its control over online political speech to silence Tulsi Gabbard, a candidate millions of Americans want to hear from,” according to the complaint. “With this lawsuit, Tulsi seeks to stop Google from further intermeddling in the 2020 United States presidential election.”
Gabbard’s complaint describes Google as an “out-of-control tech giant looking to play favorites.”
Google said in a statement that the account suspension was triggered by automated systems that flag unusual activity on advertiser accounts, including large spending changes that are meant to prevent fraud and protect customers.
“In this case, our system triggered a suspension and the account was reinstated shortly thereafter,” according to the statement. “We are proud to offer ad products that help campaigns connect directly with voters, and we do so without bias toward any party or political ideology.”
Gabbard, who on average has polled at about 1% throughout the Democratic primary, has complained throughout the campaign that establishment figures have sought to undermine her presidential bid. In addition to accusing Google of trying to muffle her campaign message, she has blamed the political establishment and mainstream media for ignoring or smearing her, suggesting in campaign materials that they are in the “pocket of the establishment war machine.”
The lawsuit was filed on Gabbard’s behalf by Los Angeles firm Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht. Gabbard is seeking damages of $ 50 million, according to the New York Times.

Texto completo: Headlined "Tennis, everyone?", a 1973 story in The New York Times noted that the number of indoor courts had grown from 30 to more than 1,000, and even suburbs and rural towns were making room to build outdoor tennis courts in parks.
Tennis is still a thing, of course, but many of the courts built during the tennis boom gave way to basketballers, skateboarders or kids on bikes, when kids riding bikes also was a thing.
In the past decade, some tennis courts have been adapted to let people play pickleball, another sports craze that swept across the nation. Played with a paddle and plastic ball with holes, pickleball is a hybrid of tennis, badminton and table tennis played on a smaller court with a lower net. According to the USA Pickleball Association, there now are more than 15,000 pickleball courts in all 50 states.
Just as tennis is hard on the joints and requires too much running and strength for some people, pickleball is too demanding for some folks, according to the email from Yoram Ariely, a Florida man encouraging me to write about Beckyball, his new game that is a hybrid version of pickleball and tennis.
Seeing many empty tennis courts, Ariely designed Beckyball (named after his wife) to be played on existing tennis courts with no need for new nets. It can also be played on softer courts, usually cushioned with some sort of rubber, which is ideal for him because his bad knees act up on hard surfaces.
Beckyball uses pickleball paddles but a reduced-pressure junior tennis ball, which makes it quieter.
Inventing easier versions of popular games is something we do all the time. On vacation years ago in Michigan, the beach volleyball court was occupied by a family that clearly didn’t understand the rules of volleyball, as they were catching the ball, passing it to teammates and eventually just heaving the ball back over the net. They told us they were playing "Nuke ’em," which we assumed was their made-up name for people who can’t play volleyball. Turns out, Newcomb is a game invented at the end of the 19th century and is still popular with people who find volleyball too difficult.
Hoover-ball, named after President Herbert Hoover, is a variation of Newcomb using a heavy medicine ball. As with Hoover, its popularity was limited, but the 32nd Annual Hoover-Ball National Championship takes place Aug. 3 in West Branch, Iowa.
Suburban kids in summer camps know all about games that have been tweaked to make them more accessible and more fun.
Dodgeball, the staple for my generation during gym class, was coach-approved bullying, where real bullies could pick out weaker children and pummel them with kickballs. I remember one shirtless, nonathletic chubby boy begging kids to quickly hit him with a ball and send him to the bench before a bully could get the chance to nail him so hard that his belly sported a painful, red "Voit" tattoo for the rest of the day. Even among the bullies, the game would feature unsportsmanlike conduct from kids who said the ball never hit them.
Today’s kids play a kinder version called Crossover, where kids who get hit with a ball simply switch to the other team. This will frustrate people who demand that children learn that life has winners and losers, but the game ends as soon as every kid ends up on the winning team. Sprout ball lets kids who are hit with the ball sit on the floor, pass balls to friends and rejoin the game as soon as the person who got them out is also out. Gaga is played with a soft foam ball in an octagonal pit, with the players batting the ball as in volleyball in an attempt to hit opponents below the knees and get them out.
One of the most physically and emotionally damaging games when I was a kid was Red Rover, where opposing teams hold hands to form human chains and take turns barreling through the puny arms of the weakest links. Amoeba is a game where kids still hold hands but must quickly hold hands with new kids or fewer kids depending on the number called out by the leader.
A game called Baseball 5 is a fast-paced, miniature version of baseball with only five players and no pitching. Golf now has venues where people stand in one place and hit balls toward targets, which doesn’t require acres of space and is easier on the environment.
It’s great to see camp counselors, PE teachers and sports executives develop new games that utilize underused spaces and inspire physical activity in kids, adults and seniors who might be turned off by more demanding games.
And if you do invent a new game, you can always name it after someone you love.

Reparations Reveals a Sense of "White Fragility"

Texto completo: Headnote Editor's Note: Leo Bazile, a former city councilmember and scholar on reparations issues has published articles in the Post and has proposed that Oakland "remain in the vanguard of direct action and advocacy on the issue. He says, The leadership shown by Barbara Lee and Lynette McElhaney makes it possible for the community to participate through a commission to present our plans to congress."
Opinion
When Katrina Browne testified before the June 19 congressional hearing on the H.R.40 Reparations Legislation introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and co-sponsored by Rep. Barbara Lee, she addressed the very important threshold issue of White Fragility.
She testified about her discovery that she was a descendant of one of the largest and most powerful slave trading families in the history of this country.
Browne said she, as a 27-year old Seminary student studying theology and ethics, received a family history brochure from her grandmother that pointed out that she is a descendant of the De Wolf family of Rhode Island slave traders that brought more enslaved Africans to the Americas than any other U.S. family. Her calm and sincere testimony revealed their family's relationship of wealth and political power. When she said:
"Over 12,000 men, women and children were taken across the middle passage in their ships." The family's leading slave trader, James De' Wolf, was reported to have become the second richest man in the nation at the time of his death - and he served in the U.S. Senate."
Browne's testimony should be read by all who are concerned about the political and moral questions that the Reparations issue raises for the upcoming 2020 elections.
Since Black Democrats are being told by some leaders that raising the Reparations issue could jeopardize the election, Browne's White Fragility issue rubs up against the political reality of when and how to address this moral imperative.
So is the moral imperative more important to African Americans than who the next president is going to be?
Browne testified:
"I want to acknowledge rightaway that the very idea of this REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY AND RACISM is to assault their sense of what this nation has been, of how we achieved our national greatness and perhaps even the role their families and communities played in this history. To weigh a national effort at acknowledgement and repair is to discount what they believed were hard sacrifices of previous generations. And to question the sources of their prosperity is to connect them to the history of slavery."
In her New York Times bestseller on the subject of "White Fragility," Robin Diangelo wrote about how whites enjoy benefits from this separate and unequal society "We are insulated from racial stress, at the same time we can come to feel entitled to and deeply deserving of our advantage. Given how we experience racial discrimination in a society we dominate we haven't had to build our racial stamina. Socialized into a deeply internalized sense of superiority that we either are unaware of or never admit to ourselves, we become "highly fragile" in conversations about race.
We consider a challenge to our racial worldview as a challenge to our very identities as good, moral people. Thus we perceive any attempt to connect us to the system of racism as an unsettling and unfair moral offense.
" To connect us to the system of racism triggers a range of defensive responses such as anger, fear and guilt And behaviors such as argumentation, silence and withdrawal from the stress-inducing situation.
These responses work to reinstate white equilibrium as they repel the challenge. They return our racial comfort and maintain our dominance within the racial hierarchy. I conceptualize this process as "White Fragility."
" Though white fragility is triggered by discomfort and anxiety, it is born of superiority and entitlement. White fragility is not a weakness per se, in fact, it is a powerful means of white racial control and protection of white advantage," Di Angelo writes.

Biden, who backed '94 crime bill, offers plan to cut incarceration

Texto completo: Joe Biden, whose long record on criminal justice matters has cast a shadow over the early months of his presidential campaign, has unveiled a comprehensive plan aimed at combating mass incarceration and reducing “racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system."
In his more than three decades as a senator, Biden was a tough-on-crime Democrat who could be impatient with concerns about the societal dynamics that contribute to crime, and he championed the 1994 crime bill that many experts now associate with mass incarceration.
That history has presented a challenge for Biden as he mounts his third bid for the presidency, with many progressives questioning his commitment to reforming a criminal justice system that disproportionately ensnares people of color.
But Tuesday, Biden, the former vice president, introduced a wide-ranging criminal justice reform proposal that his campaign said sought to reduce incarceration, and the toll it takes on poor communities and communities of color, at every stage, from addressing “underlying factors" that start as early as childhood to calling for the elimination of the death penalty.
Biden's proposal includes plans to address societal dynamics that affect children and are linked with crime and future incarceration, along with a heavy emphasis on reforming the juvenile justice system.
In proposals that would aim to reverse the legacies of the 1994 crime bill, Biden called for eliminating discrepancies in sentencing between powder and crack cocaine and for the elimination of mandatory minimum sentencing. He also called for an end to cash bail.
And the plan supports eliminating the death penalty through legislation at the federal level and incentives at the state level, a position that is a sharp departure from the position that Biden vocally embraced in the 1990s and throughout his Senate career.

Coal magnate to host Trump fund-raiser; miners seek aid
Coal magnate Robert Murray will host a fund-raiser for President Trump Wednesday, even as dozens of disabled miners pressure Congress to restore a higher tax on the fossil fuel that pays for treatment of black lung disease.
Murray, a longtime Trump benefactor and the chief executive of Murray Energy Corp., is hosting the event at the WesBanco Arena in Wheeling, W. Va. A spokesperson for the company confirmed event details but did not answer questions about who else was attending and the expected cash haul.
The miners from Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia were in Washington Tuesday trying to persuade lawmakers to revive a tax of up to $1.10 per ton of coal that helps pay for medical care of black lung disease, amid a resurgence in the respiratory ailment caused by inhaling coal dust.
Congress last year let that tax rate lapse and revert to 1977 levels of up to 50 cents per ton, after industry leaders argued the expense could further disadvantage coal.

Sanders campaign workers agree on pay raise plan
WASHINGTON — Unionized organizers for the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders approved a pay raise proposal from management late Monday, following a tense internal standoff in which employees had argued they were not being paid the wages Sanders advocates in his rhetoric.
Sanders confirmed the deal in an interview Tuesday on CNN, saying he was "happy to tell you . . . that offer was just accepted." Details of the plan were not immediately known.
The arrangement came after organizers battled Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir for higher salaries. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that campaign employees had argued to Shakir that the compensation levels did not meet the principles Sanders advocates, invoking his campaign speeches as they made their case.
It was unclear whether the changes would satisfy most of the field organizers for the long run, or whether future tensions would arise with management. It also was unclear what if any role Sanders played in the process and when he first learned about the dispute.

Trump says he has 'right to do whatever I want'
Donald Trump believes being president means he has the right to do what whatever he wants. That's the message he delivered — not for the first time — on Tuesday while addressing a crowd of teenagers and young adults at the Turning Point USA Teen Student Action Summit in Washington.
"Then, I have an Article II, where I have to the right to do whatever I want as president," he said.
Trump appears to be discussing Article II of the Constitution, which at no point indicates that the president has the power to what he or she chooses.
Speaking to ABC in June about allegations that he wanted to fire Robert Mueller, the president said, "Article II allows me to do whatever I want."

Robyn reveals how fans influenced her performance ahead of upcoming Forum concert: ‘I made the song, but they gave it the meaning’

Texto completo: Robyn took eight years to record her most recent album “Honey,” but when she called from Brussels last month on a European tour that all seemed like ancient history to the Swedish dance pop star. She returns to Southern California for her third date here this year on July 27.
“I feel like I have talked about it enough,” she says of the circumstances — the death of a close friend, a romantic partnership on the rocks — that led to the break from her acclaimed album “Body Talk” in 2010 and the follow-up that landed in October. “But I will say some things about it.
“It was a very particular time of my life, which I’m really thankful for,” Robyn says. “I was also in a privileged situation where I could take time off — a lot of people can’t do that. I really had the means and the space to explore things, and get to know myself better, which is such a luxury and something I really don’t regret at all.”
Her show at the Forum in Inglewood on Saturday, July 27 follows a pair of shows at the Palladium in Los Angeles in February where fans heard many of the songs on “Honey” live for the first time. It was clear then as it was on the record that with “Honey” she had taken the difficulties with which she’d wrestled and used that make music that over its dance beats and rhythms offered comfort, hope and joy.
“I think in order to talk about the things that are difficult, sadness and pain and stuff, sometimes you do it from a really unconscious place, but for me it was important to know what it was I wanted to talk about,” she says. “I wanted it to have that depth because I think it’s like the thing you can do as an artist for the people that listen to your music.
“You can make discoveries about yourself, and then you can present them to people in a way where they can explore things that they might recognize they felt before, or things that they haven’t felt before but when you describe it to them they know.”
We should note that Robyn’s music isn’t sad or bittersweet so much as cathartic. Singer Sam Smith, who works a similar vein in the pop mines, told the New York Times in a story about Robyn last year that what makes her brilliant is her “mixture of sadness and euphoria,” two sides of life that Robyn says are essential to each other.
“It’s just how I experience life,” she says. “For me, it’s not a constant. It’s kind of like I think melancholy, and also happiness or sadness or whatever, they don’t feel as good if the other thing isn’t there.
“Only sadness, it can be really, really painful,” Robyn says. “Only happiness can be really weird as well. There’s always the other side and I think those are the most interesting moments, when you can feel both of those things together.”
On “Honey,” though, she consciously moved in a lighter direction, she says.
“I think there’s another space which I’m exploring now, and I think a little bit more on this record, which is not as dramatic,” Robyn says. “I may have people thinking I’m not doing well” — she laughs — “but for me it'[s important to find something that’s less dramatic, that’s more about fun.
“Not fun like no problems, but like playfulness, like a sense of relaxation,” she says. “Which I think (the title song) ‘Honey’ is about and other things on this album as well.”
The Forum show will be similar to the Palladium dates, though the set has changed in the five months since then.
“When we played the Palladium, we were still adding and changing things, so it will be different,” Robyn says. “A lot is similar but we’ve played so many shows since then, so to me the show has matured.”
One constant highlight is how she and her band include the crowd in the performance of “Dancing On My Own,” a song from the “Body Talk” album on which the band drops out for the chorus to let the crowd sing, a truly chills-inducing moment in her show. That song, in which its protagonist is in the club watch an ex-lover dance with another, has been taken over by her fans in ways she says she never imagined.
“I really didn’t know or understand what ‘Dancing On My Own’ has meant to my fans,” she says. “But I understand from people telling me. So whether it’s me watching, like, people dance in a subway or Instagram about a night out listening to my music, those are things I see, and then, of course, I feel the response from the audience when I’m touring.”
On the “Body Talk” tour there were moments where the audience sang so loudly she could hardly hear herself, so sometimes Robyn and the band simply stopped playing for a few bars. For this tour, they decided to make it a feature of the song.
“It’s like they’re singing the song back to us, which is also a way of acknowledging them, and what they have done with the song in their lives,” she says. “(It’s) what happens when I’m not there. What happens when they’re in a karaoke bar or with friends, or they’re listening to the song at home.
“That’s something that I never get to see,” Robyn says. “It’s like a moment to share that. I made the song, but they gave it the meaning or whatever it has in their life.”

Texto completo: En un operativo llamado “Cross Check” (“Verificación Cruzada”) , la oficina de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) logró la captura de 899 inmigrantes en dos meses, afirmó el director interino de la agencia Matt Albence .
El funcionario especificó a The New York Times que esa movilización ocurrió entre el 13 de mayo y el 11 de julio, es decir antes de las llamadas “grandes redadas” anunciadas por el presidente Donald Trump .
“Lo que descubrimos es que la mayoría ni siquiera se presentó a su primera audiencia” , dijo Albence. “Además les enviamos cartas para que tuvieran la oportunidad de entregarse y organizar un proceso de salida más ordenado, lo que incluía el tiempo para organizar sus asuntos y programar vuelos en aerolíneas comerciales”.
Sin embargo, un reporte de ICE dado a conocer en Twitter se indica que fueron 934 las personas capturadas, aunque la agencia no dio detalles al respecto.
Como parte de un enfoque múltiple para frenar la inmigración de indocumentados, Albence dijo que el Gobierno también intensificó las inspecciones de las compañías sospechosas de contratarlos.
La propia agencia reportó que se hicieron operativos en 3,300 empresas , aunque los detalles serían revelados en cualquier momento de este martes.
“Parte de nuestro objetivo es reducir las oportunidades económicas” , dijo Albence. “No podemos tener individuos que ingresen ilegalmente al país y luego vayan a buscar trabajo de manera ilegal”.
En las grandes redadas anunciadas en 10 ciudades, ICE solamente capturó a 35 inmigrantes y Albence acusó la difusión de la información, además de criticar a los activistas por orientar a los extranjeros sobre cómo protegerse.

NASA Practices Space Gardening To Pack Lunch For Long Trip To Mars

Texto completo: Ham salad from a tube. Apricot cereal cubes. Thermostabilized cheddar cheese spread.
These delicacies and more were packed inside Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s lunar lunchbox when Apollo 11 hurtled them into space 50 years ago this month, landing humankind on the moon for the first time.
A little unpalatable, perhaps, but it was enough to get them through their eight-day excursion in space.
The next time astronauts make a giant leap in space travel, it could be with a mission to Mars, making the question of nutrition a lot more difficult. The round-trip journey is expected to take up to three years, and the astronauts may have to grow some of their own food.
Enter the Espanola pepper.
As the race to the red planet heats up - NASA hopes to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, and a private rocket venture, SpaceX, is aiming for sooner - scientists are working on building a garden in space. The goal is to grow fresh produce to supplement packaged foods.
NASA has harvested a variety of edible leafy greens, grown without earthly gravity or natural light. Soon, researchers plan to expand to a more difficult crop - Espanola improved chiles - in their quest to answer one of the most pressing questions of a Mars mission: How will astronauts get enough nutritious food to survive years in the unforgiving depths of space?
Scientists believe the project, if successful, could open the door to growing similar crops in space - think tomato plants and strawberries - and perhaps eventually to more advanced foods, like potatoes.
“This is the most complex crop we have done to date for food purposes,” said Matthew W. Romeyn, who is leading the pepper experiment for NASA.
The peppers are being tested on Earth, he said, and could be sent to space as early as next spring.
Scott Kelly, a retired astronaut who set an American record in 2016 when he returned after spending 340 days in space, said he received a shipment of fresh fruit and vegetables every few months while on the International Space Station. But that would not be possible on a trip to Mars.
“It’s not like you can just run out to the store,” he said. “To have fresh food, it helps with nutrition. It also helps with morale.”
Options have changed
The first moon landing took place in the “tube and cube days” of space food, when a typical menu included items like peanut cubes, turkey and gravy wet packs and brownies that were described as an “intermediate moisture bite.”
The beverage Tang also had a long association with spaceflight. Many people mistakenly believe NASA invented it.
Today, about 200 food and drink items are available on the International Space Station, according to Stephanie Schierholz, a NASA spokeswoman.
The food, which is much like camping food and has to be reheated or rehydrated with water, ranges from your basics, like cereal and eggs, to more complex dishes like chicken fajitas, macaroni and cheese and blueberry crumble. “Shrimp cocktail is a longtime popular dish,” she said.
Tortillas are also a staple, Schierholz said, because NASA does not use bread in microgravity in order to avoid pesky crumbs.
While scientists use the space station as a test kitchen for long-term space travel, there is another necessity to consider: water.
The station uses a sophisticated water recycling system, which collects humidity, sweat and even urine and turns it into drinking water. (In 2008, a New York Times reporter was brave enough to test it: “How does distilled urine and sweat taste? Not bad, actually.”)
Schierholz said the system would need to be smaller and to work more reliably on a mission to Mars, because there would be no option to send shipments of water from Earth. But the same ethos would hold true: “Yesterday’s coffee,” she said, “is tomorrow’s coffee.”
No matter how many options there are, packaged food alone would not be enough to fuel a mission to Mars.
Certain vitamins break down over time, leaving astronauts at risk of inadequate nutrition, said Gioia D. Massa, a scientist who works on space crop production for NASA.
“We don’t really have a food system that we are confident will be good for the entire duration of a Mars mission,” she said. “We feel plants are a very good way to help solve that problem.”
Growing goodness
Scientists have experimented with growing plants on board the International Space Station for years. The Russians grew peas in the early 2000s, for example. More recently, NASA harvested red romaine lettuce, which had been nurtured under the purplish, LED lighting of a special vegetable garden known simply as “Veggie.”
For a tasting in 2015, astronauts used extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dress the leaves. “Kind of like arugula,” Kelly said at the time.
NASA has since grown other types of leafy greens, including Chinese cabbage and mizuna mustard.
The Espanola improved chile, a durable pepper native to New Mexico, represents the next frontier.
The peppers are, in many ways, the perfect test case: They are more difficult to grow than lettuce. They are a good source of vitamin C. And they pack a punch in spice, great for astronauts who have reduced senses of smell and taste in space.
If this space gardening plan works, scientists say, it could help combat “menu fatigue” among astronauts, who typically lose weight while spending months in space.
Maintaining a garden could also serve as a hobby for crew members during monotonous months. “It’s kind of like, why do people like flowers?” Kelly said. “When you are living in an environment that is very antiseptic or laboratory-like, or on Mars, it would be pretty devoid of life with the exception of you and your crewmates. Having something growing would have a positive psychological effect.”
And it could also help the crew become more autonomous, in case something goes wrong.
“If the next supply ship from Earth doesn’t land properly, can you do enough with your own systems already in place?” said Raymond M. Wheeler, a plant physiologist at NASA.
So what might a menu for Mars look like one day?
It is a little soon to tell, but it would probably include a variety of packaged food, with fresh greens on the side.
“It might be having some lettuce on your cheeseburger,” Massa said, “or having a handful of tomatoes to go in your hummus wrap.”

The sugar snap pea turns 50

Texto completo: In the spring of 1969, in Twin Falls, Idaho, Calvin Lamborn, a young plant breeder at the Gallatin Valley Seed company, crossed a snow pea with a thick-podded rogue type pea — yielding a most unusual new plant whose plump pod was as delicious as its little green pearls. Lamborn's creation would become known as the sugar snap pea. That cult legume — once hailed as the vegetable of the century — turns 50 this year.
Lamborn died in 2017, but Bill Albers, now owner-president of Albers Enterprise, a snap pea seed production and marketing firm, was also in the field on the fateful day in 1969.
“They handed me a pod, and I started to shell it — out of ignorance," Albers, at the time assistant manager of Gallatin Valley Seed, recalls. “They told me to eat it pod and all, so I reluctantly took a bite."
Today, we have forgotten how transgressive that first bite would have been. Our cultural amnesia is, in fact, proof of the sugar snap's rise to dominance.
Built up from nothing only 50 years ago, sugar snap peas are now an international, multi-million-dollar industry. The total fresh sugar-snap market in the United States is currently valued at $153 million, according to Mann Packing Company (a division of Del Monte Produce), which controls 51 percent of the market. Maine-based seed purveyor Johnny's Selected Seeds, whose customers include small-scale commercial farmers as well as home gardeners, now sells more sugar snap seed than any other type of pea.
Like many of humanity's great inventions, the sugar snap pea cleaves history into two distinct eras.
I was born in 1986, squarely in the post-sugar snap age. This means, among other things, that I've never had to shell a single pea.
“My dear, you have missed an experience," Bonnie Lamborn, Calvin Lamborn's widow, told me.
Born in 1943, she grew up in Shelley, Idaho, where her father grew shell peas in the family garden.
“I would sit under the elm tree in the front yard in the shade and shell them," she recalls. “I would just have a bucketful all shelled, and here came Dad with another bucketful." She laughed at the memory of the Sisyphean chore.
My own food-obsessed, millennial set has so fully embraced romantic visions of kitchen labor that everywhere one reads of the great pleasure of cooking: the joy of chopping and frying and roasting and basting; the true ecstasy of dinner prep in the upper-middle-class kitchen. Rarely do we read of work.
Looking back, I suspect that for an earlier generation of American women — who, after all, did most of the pea shelling and pea cooking and pea serving — the sugar snap must have been a liberation.
Even the 1950s English food writer Elizabeth David — usually a true friend to veg, and not shy of kitchen work, either — once confessed that “shelling peas is certainly a good deal of trouble."
Bonnie Lamborn, who refers lovingly to the sugar snap as “really quite a nice little vegetable," has not shelled a single pea since 1969.
“After they were invented, I never went back to the old English pea," she admits.
Her children grew up in a new world where pea pods were edible.
Rod Lamborn, now CEO of Magic Seed, a company started by his father in 1997, remembers his first, confusing, childhood encounter with a conventional shell pea at a neighbor's house.
“I couldn't understand why you just couldn't eat the pod," he recalls.
“I eat the pod," he'd protested at the time. “We eat the pod."
“You don't know what you're talking about," the grown-ups had insisted.
“It definitely was a revolution," he told me by phone recently. “The idea of eating the pod . . . really kind of changed the system."
Everyone did not, it turned out, want to join the revolution. During the sugar snap's long development before commercial launch, resistance was institutional, as well as cultural.
“Our biggest opponents were our own upper management," Albers recalls. “People wanted the research department to focus on the real bread-and-butter breeding programs of peas and beans for canning and freezing. That was the company's business."
In 1979, when the sugar snap was finally introduced to America, it caused a national sensation. The York Daily Record of Pennsylvania raved, “New pea almost as sweet as candy." “So insipid a comparison," argued the food critic at The New York Times, “does not do justice to the sophisticated verdant flavor of this new vegetable." For The Washington Post it was “a super legume . . . [that] might revolutionize children's attitudes towards vegetables," and, furthermore, such a sweet feat with “only three calories in each pod — less than conventional peas." By the end of its first growing season, the sugar snap had been “a rage across the U.S.," according to one Canadian writer.
There have been many other varieties since — including a now ubiquitous stringless pod that Mann Packing stocks at Star Market, 7-Eleven, Walmart, and Target, among other places — but for Rod Lamborn no subsequent snaps have ever matched the first for flavor.
His father had once told The New York Times the luxury of breeding for flavor was part of what made his new pea unique.
“You can't breed for everything at once," he'd told the Times, “and flavor is usually what is considered last."
Not so with the original sugar snap.
Bill Albers still remembers his reaction to that very first bite.
“Jesus Christ, this tastes good," he'd said that day. “This tastes like a fruit. Kids will love it."
“And it was true," he told me 50 years later.

Texto completo: The phrase "America, Love It or Leave It" has a pedigree dating back at least to the McCarthy Era. In the '70s, the phrase was employed again against those protesting America's involvement in the Vietnam War. The left has its own version, vowing to leave the country if a Republican is elected president. They rarely do.
On Monday, President Trump resurrected the phrase as he again publicly slammed four freshman congresswomen for their criticism of the United States and his policies. He suggested they "go back where you came from," though they are all American citizens.
Whatever one thinks of the president's remarks — the predictable "racist" charge was leveled at him because the four are women of color and two are Muslim — the president is setting Democrats up for what could be a major defeat in the 2020 election by forcing them to embrace (probably) these people and their statements, thus causing further fallout within the party, or denounce them (unlikely) and risk electoral harm. It's a lose-lose for Democrats.
AXIOS, a nonpartisan news and information company, shared the results of a small, exclusive poll taken in May of a "crucial group of swing voters." Respondents, "1,003 likely general-election voters who are white and have two years or less of college education" put their approval of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley in low double or single digits.
Only last week did Speaker Nancy Pelosi, discussing the congresswomen's opposition to the emergency border aid bill — a bill the leadership supported — seem to dismiss them in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, "They're four people and that's how many votes they got." After the president's comments Monday, Pelosi felt obligated to defend the four congresswomen, but that may come at a cost.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) took things a step too far when he called the four "anti-America" communists on "Fox and Friends," another throwback to the McCarthy Era, which Graham has previously denounced.
Still, this is likely to play well with people who believe too many politicians spend most of their time criticizing America instead of defending it.
The four congresswomen have been critical of the nation they were elected to serve and some have even made anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements.
The left swims in a deep sea of hypocrisy when it uses buzzwords like "diversity" and "racism." A recent example was in Monday's Washington Times. The newspaper reported that congressional Democrats are opposing four "people of color" nominated to federal courts by President Trump. If a Democratic president had nominated these people and Republicans opposed them, is there any doubt the "racist" slur would be hurled at them?
Still, Sen. Graham was right when he also said it would be helpful if the president would "aim higher" and speak of their policies, rather than engaging in personal attacks. But their hatred for Israel and anti-America statements ARE their policies. Graham is correct in this sense: President Trump has the issues on his side. He is winning on things most people care about, especially the economy. Yes, he frequently touts successes, but they are often overshadowed by his personal attacks.
Winning an argument is better than winning a fight. Winning the argument proves your policies are correct. Winning a fight proves nothing, except who is able to beat up another person. It does not advance an agenda.
There is no excuse for calling detention centers "concentration camps" and likening the Border Patrol to Nazi prison guards, especially since the four freshmen and other Democrats have the power to fix the migrant crisis, but won't because it appears they prefer having the issue to batter Republicans.
If this keeps up, House Democrats who defend such outrageous statements are likely to find themselves in the minority again. Many Americans are fed-up with hearing this stuff and are likely to take revenge at the polls.

Texto completo: Andrew Dibner was shaving one day in the early 1970s when he had a moment of inspiration that would save countless lives. If someone who is disabled or elderly falls, he wondered, what if some technology could summon emergency assistance, even if a phone were out of reach?
He was a psychologist and a Boston University psychology professor at the time, and it took a few years for his inspiration to become an invention — and ultimately a ubiquitous phenomenon.
The medical alert system he pioneered with his wife, Susan Schmidt Dibner, and the Lifeline Systems company they cofounded to market the device, led the way for other manufacturers to enter what is now the field of personal emergency response systems. At the outset, however, persuading investors was difficult.
“We had no money," Dr. Dibner told the Globe in 1988. “I found an unemployed engineer who built the first model, then a small manufacturer who made burglar alarm equipment. It was hard to get venture capital."
Dr. Dibner, whose inspiration created a segment in the health care industry, died July 6 in a memory care facility in Peoria, Ariz. He was 93. His daughter Dr. Robin Dibner told The New York Times the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease.
He and his wife, Susan, a sociologist who died in 1988, were partners in Lifeline Systems Inc. The system they devised provided at-risk people with transmitters that are worn as pendants or bracelets. Someone who is immobilized by a fall or an illness can press a button on the transmitter, which sends a signal to a console linked to a home telephone, which in turn automatically dials a central monitoring station.
Once the connection is made, an operator can assess the situation, possibly by speaking to the person through the console's speakerphone and then calling for help from a designated neighbor or relative or, ultimately, an ambulance.
The Dibners believed the device would offer comfort and reassurance to people who might otherwise have to live in nursing homes or who felt vulnerable after being discharged quickly from a hospital.
“Even if they didn't use this," Dr. Dibner told the Times in 1984, “people will have the psychological assurance that they're not alone."
Reassuring those in medical need had been on his mind since he was young.
As a boy, Dr. Dibner had often turned to his grandmother for encouragement, he recalled in a 1988 interview with Jean Dietz, the Globe's Senior Set columnist. When he was 12, he awoke one night to find his grandmother in the hall. She was having a heart attack and clutching her chest.
Subsequently, he added, an older family friend had a stroke while living alone. Four days passed before she was discovered by a neighbor. The family friend was still alive, but too much time had elapsed for successful treatment. “She died within six months in a nursing home," he told the Times.
In a 1983 Globe interview, he described Lifeline Systems as initially a “mom and pop" operation that the couple launched with a $12,000 stake.
For their accomplishments in health and education, the Dibners were among recipients of the Charles A. Dana Foundation's “pioneering achievements" award in 1986. They received $10,000.
Andrew Sherman Dibner was born on May 30, 1926, in Brooklyn, N.Y., to Harry Dibner and Masha Goldberg, immigrants from Russia. His father sold insurance, and his mother was a seamstress.
After serving stateside in the Army during World War II, Dr. Dibner enrolled at Brooklyn College. He did not do well in engineering courses and, guided by an aptitude test, shifted to psychology. After receiving a bachelor's degree, he attended the University of Michigan, where he graduated with a master's and a doctorate in psychology.
He moved between teaching and clinical work for a decade before settling at Boston University in 1964 as a psychology professor. He was a founder of the school's gerontology center.
An engineer built the first Lifeline prototype. But 25 venture capital firms turned down the Dibners for financing. “They liked the idea," Dr. Dibner told The Wisconsin State Journal in 1983. “They didn't trust us as managers."
After they brought in an experienced businessman as the company's chairman, venture capital money came in.
Initially, Lifeline's target customers were not users but institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes, and health care agencies, which would buy monitoring stations and charge fees to individuals who wanted the service. The business model was eventually augmented to include selling directly to consumers.
Dr. Dibner continued to teach at Boston University until the mid-1980s.
He also was among the so-called BU Five — faculty members who refused to cross picket lines set up by striking clerical and technical workers in 1979. Instead, they held classes on lawns or off-campus sites.
Then-BU president John R. Silber and the university's administration announced their intent to fire or suspend the five faculty members. In November 1979, Silber said that the five — who included Howard Zinn and Caryl Rivers — could avoid disciplinary action if they submitted written apologies. All refused. A few months later, BU decided not to seek sanctions against them.
Lifeline went public in 1983, and Dr. Dibner remained with the company until retiring in 1990. In 2006, when Lifeline had more than $100 million in annual revenues, 470,000 individual subscribers, and business relationships with many health care organizations, it was acquired by Royal Philips Electronics for $690 million.
The company, now called Philips Lifeline and based in Framingham, says it is the leading medical-alert service in the United States.
Dr. Dibner's invention has evolved since his retirement to include modern twists such as a technology that can detect falls and send help even if the person can't push the transmitter.
In addition to his daughter Robin, a rheumatologist, Dr. Dibner leaves his wife, Jean Proulx Dibner; his son, Steven; two other daughters, Nina Dibner and Lora Dibner Garcia; two stepdaughters, Jennifer and Suzanne Proulx; two stepsons, Thomas and Jonathan Proulx; five grandchildren; and 10 step-grandchildren.
His first marriage, to Iris Miroy, ended in divorce.
Lifeline prompted other companies to enter the business, most famously LifeCall, whose well-known TV commercial featured an older woman lying on the floor, saying, “I've fallen and I can't get up!"
Dr. Dibner credited that ad with boosting his company's sales, because it brought national attention to the growing market for Lifeline.
“I feel very fulfilled," he told the Globe in 1986, “because I was able to come up with an idea that turns out to be so helpful to people."

More than 30 Dubuquers - the powerful and marginalized alike - gathered Saturday to discuss implicit bias, a topic that impacts them all.
Implicit bias refers to unconscious assumptions and preferences. Event leaders stressed that holding such biases does not make someone a bad person, but biases should be acknowledged to combat inequality.
"These are naturally uncomfortable issues to talk about," said Collins Eboh, coordinator of Inclusive Dubuque and equity coordinator at the Community Foundation of Greater Dubuque.
He facilitated the From the Inside Out: Creating Change event, hosted by nonprofit Fountain of Youth. The organization works with underprivileged Dubuque residents at its Central Avenue space.
Caprice Jones, Fountain of Youth executive director, invited the attendees personally. Six such events will occur throughout the summer, with the intention to host a handful of officials each time.
"Any opportunity to engage the public on everyday issues that they're facing is where I want to be," said Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, who attended Saturday.
The group watched six videos, most of them from the New York Times. Suggestions the videos made for correcting implicit bias included hanging out with diverse people, slowing down decision-making and acknowledging your own "racial anxiety" to reduce awkwardness.
Dubuque City Council Member Brett Shaw said he found the videos helpful. He said he sees bias, both implicit and explicit, too often in the city.
"There's got to be a correction to that," he said.
After attendees spent some time mingling, the group circled up for what Jones called "real talk."
During the discussion, attendees shared their diverse personal experiences with bias.
Deandre Daniels, a participant in some Fountain of Youth programs, shared his experience as the only black person at his high school. He said he went in assuming classmates would discriminate against him.
Instead, he found that they were mostly just curious.
"I came to that school for a reason," Daniels said. "To learn them, and for them to learn me."
Carissa Daniel, a resident at a Dubuque correctional facility, said people often look at those who have been to prison as "the low of the low." She said she thinks she does not look like the "stereotypical" incarcerated person and thought that could help her make change.
"I feel that having those positive biases is going to put me in a better position to have a voice for some of us," she said.
Liang Chee Wee, president of Northeast Iowa Community College, said the conversation resonated with his immigrant experience.
Growing up in Singapore, tattoos were associated with gang activities. In the U.S., he has had to adjust his snap assumptions, he said.
Stephen Broxton, a local entrepreneur and Fountain of Youth participant, spoke about biases between officials and marginalized groups.
"If I was to walk in a room full of city officials, I would have felt out of place," he said, citing his assumptions about their assumptions.
Perhaps the greatest theme to emerge from the conversation was the need for people with different experiences to get to know each other. Broxton spoke about the value of open conversation between diverse people.
"No matter where you're from, you should feel comfortable walking up to a fellow human," Broxton said.
Jones said the event was a good example of what can happen when people of different backgrounds come together.
"I think it was a great start," he said.

Texto completo: La historia de amor de Emma Coronel y Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera tuvo su más reciente capítulo el último día que se vieron en la Corte del Distrito Este de Nueva York, con sede en Brooklyn, pero tuvo diversos momentos en que ella le envió mensajes de apoyo incondicional.
Lo primero que hizo el líder del Cártel de Sinaloa al ver a su esposa el día de su sentencia fue un “saludo militar” y enviarle un beso con la mano, pero luego no dejó de buscarla con la mirada, incluso en momentos clave, como cuando una de sus víctimas Andrea Velez , narraba que el mexicano intentó matarla.
Durante ese último día, la exreina de belleza portó joyas estimadas en $86,000 dólares , incluido un juego de pulseras Cartier de la colección Love, creada en 1970 por el diseñador Aldo Cipullo, que supone un mensaje “mensaje secreto” a su esposo sobre el amor que le tiene.
La casa Cartier define a su colección Love como un símbolo “de amor eterno”, tienen pequeños círculos formados por dos semicírculos que simbolizan la unión de los enamorados y supone un símbolo entre parejas cuyos sentimientos no pueden romperse , afirma la revista Quién.
La relación entre Guzmán Loera y Coronel ha sido complicada ante las condiciones de encierro del primero, aunado a que han decidido no escribirse más, luego de que sus primeras cartas no fueron entregadas por los fiscales federales y utilizadas como pruebas.
Sin embargo, la exreina de belleza ha enviado varios mensajes a su esposo para mostrarle su amor, todos en público, señales que parecía que solo ellos podrían entender, pero que fueron evidentes.
Uno de los momentos clave fue cuando decidieron lucir el mismo tipo de saco, uno de terciopelo color púrpura, como una forma de confirmarle al mundo que estaban juntos a pesar de cualquier situación . Lo lucieron cuando declaraba Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López , mejor conocida como la “ Chapodiputada ”, examante de Guzmán Loera.
Coronel también envió mensajes a su esposo en Instagram, aunque difícilmente él podría verlos, ya que no tiene acceso a internet.
“Todo va estar bien, tal vez hoy no, pero sí con el tiempo” , escribió a pocos días de iniciar el juicio.
Una vez iniciado el proceso en la Corte de Brooklyn, Coronel volvió a escribir.
“Cuando de ti se trata, la luna siempre será mi cómplice” , publicó Coronel en su cuenta en noviembre, a pocos días de iniciado el juicio.
Hay diversas interpretaciones sobre los mensajes “ocultos” que ella ha enviado, pero para José Reveles, autor del libro El Chapo, Entrega y Traición, podrían ser una forma de para mostrar al mundo que la vida sigue para una mujer joven .
“Tal vez quiere demostrar una liberación de que su vida más allá de lo que pueda pasar con su marido”, consideró.
En una entrevista a The New York Times, Coronel expresó que admiraba a su esposo y que lo amaba, un mensaje que es claro y ella no ocultó al acudir casi todos los días al juicio.

Vinalhaven restaurant in its 2nd season is still finding its sea legs As The Nightingale transforms from fast-casual to upscale-casual, its wine list impresses and its food shows both promise and problems.

Texto completo: A few hours before noon, my 6:30 p.m. dinner reservation at The Nightingale became unmoored.
I had booked a table nearly four weeks earlier - as always, under a fake name to try to ensure that my experience is no different from that of any other customer's.
Yet on the morning of my meal at the upscale-casual Vinalhaven fish shack, my pseudonym received a voicemail confirming the reservation for four people ... for 6:15.
Strange. I double-checked the online reservation and called the restaurant to let them know they had made an error. "Oh, I'm glad you called back. There's no mistake," the general manager said. "In order to give you great service, we have to get you out of the busiest time for us. 6:30 is right in the middle of that. So we changed it for you."
Thanks?
This isn't really how reservations work, I thought to myself. People book tables so that they can plan their days, schedule appointments, arrange baby sitters. Mine was made long in advance for that very reason. Plus, shuffling reservations willy-nilly without even bothering to ask is a recipe for disaster, especially ones that have been in the books for close to a month.
Something else was afoot, but I couldn't put my finger on it.
Then, as we were speaking, my mouth dropped as it happened again. "Well, actually it's not really 6:15 anymore, sir. Now we need you to come in at 6," she said.
We bargained a bit, eventually compromising on a much later table. Two of my dinner guests - summer residents of the island for decades - just stared at me, stunned, when I explained that our plans had unexpectedly changed. "That's a first!" one exclaimed.
At 8 that night, we sat in the sleek, neutral-white dining room of the harbor-front restaurant, nibbling on our first bites of chef/co-owner Lauren Weisenthal's delightfully oniony, dill-forward Green Goddess salad ($9/$15), watching the still-roaring space heave and pulse as new visitors stopped by for a drink.
Despite the presence of two new cocktail-and-wine venues on the island, The Nightingale remains among the top spots for a glass of wine, thanks to certified sommelier Weisenthal's keen nose (and palate) for seasonally appropriate wines. She is especially fond of Rieslings and pinot noirs, including offbeat subvarietals like Andreas Diehl's barnyardy, dark-berry-flavored SpÃ¤tburgunder ($35/bottle). In the cool, cool, cool of a July evening, it's pure liquid contentment.
A few late arrivals also showed up for something else: a serving of that evening's dessert special, a strawberry-and-vanilla-pudding pavlova ($10). Weisenthal intentionally overbakes her meringue, making her version tawnier and crisper than most. And as much as I love a fragile meringue that shatters when you stick a fork into it, this version lacked a chewy, marshmallow-esque center - the hallmark of the best pavlovas.
If a meringue-based dessert sounds out of place in a fish shack, that's because, in its second season, The Nightingale is undergoing a significant evolution. "Last year, we were sensitive that people here had lost the counter-service restaurant they loved," Weisenthal said. "We felt pressure to continue a lot of what The Harbor Gawker was doing. So it was fast-casual, but I think still a good restaurant. This year, it is much more natural. We're making most things from scratch, using local ingredients, and we are also starting to cook experimental foods and the foods we (Lauren Weisenthal and her husband, co-owner/cook-and-builder Brian Weisenthal) really miss eating."
Among those dishes: a lush lobe of Vermont burrata ($14) bathing in a tart green-garlic pesto alongside a handful of raw, starchy English peas that begged for a quick blanching to sweeten them up; an iceberg wedge salad ($9) drizzled with a too-savory, bleu-cheese-and-buttermilk dressing and served without a sharp knife to cut it cleanly; and decent, if imperviously beer-battered fish-and-chips ($21) featuring fat, juicy cubes of haddock. Slathered in tangy lime crema and garnished with red cabbage, that very same haddock also make its way into bland flour tortillas as part of the fish tacos ($16).
While the iffiness of these dishes signal the slow, incremental progress of The Nightingale's evolution, others suggest the restaurant's promise, like deep-fried green tomatoes ($14) dredged in corn starch, cornmeal and flour, and topped with fresh-picked Vinalhaven crabmeat so delicately dressed, I suspect the staff only murmured the word, "mayonnaise" to it as it was being spooned onto the plate.
I chose the naked, homegrown version of this dish as one of my favorite dishes of 2018, and I'd wager that when local tomatoes start sagging languidly from their vines, it will be even better than it was last year, especially since Vinalhaven crab improves just about anything.
Improbably for a restaurant moving away from fast-casual roots toward life as a table-service business, The Nightingale's best offerings may be its sandwiches. The lamb burger ($14) is a good example. On a juicy, grill-seared ground lamb patty, the kitchen mounds a thick plank of feta, slices of pickled red onion and a bright, dill-scented tzatziki. It's more savory than most other lamb burgers, and with a glass of red wine, it's exactly what a summer evening demands.
For the fried chicken sandwich ($12), the kitchen batters a boneless thigh with the same beer batter it uses on its haddock, then runs it through a crunch-generating dusting of seasoned flour to produce a constellation of crags and ridges that crackle with every bite. The sandwich strikes a gorgeous balance between the feral funk of dark meat and snappy tang of McClure's dill pickles.
If the bun used for both sandwiches - a potato roll Weisenthal herself called "not very interesting"- got an upgrade, they'd go from great to knockout.
As our meal wound down, one of my guests confessed that the GM had pulled her aside when we walked in, apologizing when she realized that our previously anonymous party actually consisted of two longtime islanders. "If I had known it was you, I would have done something," she apparently told my friend.
Suddenly, we all understood what caused my original reservation to drift like an unanchored skiff.
My pseudonym had worked exactly as intended - and perhaps too well. I had been treated just like any other diner. Maybe more to the point: any other diner "from away."

Texto completo: Eight artists have asked the Whitney Museum of American Art to remove their works from this year's Biennial, citing what they describe as the museum's lack of response to calls for the resignation of a board member with ties to the sale of military supplies, including tear gas.
Four of the artists withdrew on Friday; the rebellion continued throughout Saturday as four more followed suit. There are 75 artists and collectives in the Whitney Biennial, which closes on Sept. 22.
Since March, there have been protests at the museum and calls from artists and scholars for the museum to remove the trustee, Warren B. Kanders, who owns a company that distributes law-enforcement equipment, the Safariland Group. Mr. Kanders has vigorously defended the company. One artist selected for the Biennial declined to participate before the exhibit opened because of Mr. Kanders's business. Dozens of others called for Mr. Kanders to resign, even as they took part.
In a letter to the Whitney Biennial curators that was first reported on Friday by Artforum, the four artists, Korakrit Arunanondchai, Meriem Bennani, Nicole Eisenman and Nicholas Galanin, said they were angry when they learned of Mr. Kanders's ties to Safariland, but "were well into fabrication of major pieces" for the Biennial and decided to forge ahead.
"The Museum's continued failure to respond in any meaningful way to growing pressure from artists and activists has made our participation untenable," the four wrote in a copy of the letter provided to The New York Times. "The Museum's inertia has turned the screw, and we refuse further complicity with Kanders and his technologies of violence."
On Saturday morning, three additional artists said they were withdrawing work in solidarity. Eddie Arroyo and Agustina Woodgate announced through their gallery, Spinello Projects, of Miami, Fla., that "the request is intended as condemnation of Warren Kanders' continued presence as Vice Chair of the Board and the Museum's continued failure to respond in any meaningful way to growing pressure from artists and activists."
A seventh artist, Christine Sun Kim, said in an email to The New York Times on Saturday that she, too, had asked for her work to be withdrawn from the Biennial.
"As a mother to a 2-year-old daughter, it terrifies me that my work is currently part of a platform that is now strongly associated with Kanders' teargas-producing company Safariland," she wrote to curators. "I do not want her to grow up in a world where free and peaceful expression is countered with means that have left people injured and dead."
The eighth to ask that work be withdrawn was Forensic Architecture, a London-based research group, which produced a 10-minute video that directly addressed the controversy over Mr. Kanders, called "Triple-Chaser." (It was made with Praxis Films, run by the filmmaker Laura Poitras.) The title comes from a type of tear-gas grenade manufactured by Safariland that has allegedly been used against civilians at the United States-Mexico border and elsewhere during protests.
Eyal Weizman, the founder and director of Forensic Architecture, said in an interview that the group had written to the curators on Saturday to remove "Triple-Chaser" and accompanying films. He added that Forensic Architecture asked that those films be replaced by a statement from the group about its new investigation suggesting that bullets made by a company, Sierra Bullets -- which it alleges has ties to Mr. Kanders -- were used by the Israeli forces against civilian protesters in Gaza in 2018.
Mr. Kanders declined to comment Friday and Saturday through a spokesman.
In a written statement on Friday, Adam D. Weinberg, the Whitney's director, acknowledged the four artists' letter to the curators.
"The Whitney respects the opinions of all the artists it exhibits and stands by their right to express themselves freely," the statement said. "While the Whitney is saddened by this decision, we will of course comply with the artists' request."
Tom Eccles, the executive director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, said that the artists who had asked for their works to be withdrawn appeared to have the upper hand. "The artists won this one," he said.
"The latest salvo by artists is a surprisingly devastating move at rapid speed," he added.
The Whitney paid a $ 1,500 honorarium to participating artists, including six of the artists who have asked to have their work withdrawn. (The museum said the additional payments were underway.) It is not known if any of the eight artists intend to return the fees.
The Biennial, which began as an annual show in 1932 and adopted its current schedule in 1973, has often included politically tinged works. This year's exhibition addressed, among other topics, N.F.L. players taking a pregame knee to protest police violence against African-American men and women; and the 1989 Central Park jogger case, in which a group of black and Latino teenagers were wrongly accused and convicted of assaulting and raping a white woman.
The last time work was publicly withdrawn from a Biennial was 2014, when the YAMS, a collective of artists, removed their video on race and black identity, contending another project in the show was racially insensitive. In 2017, Dana Schutz's painting "Open Casket" drew sustained protests for its abstracted portrayal of the corpse of the black teenager Emmett Till, whose lynching in 1955 helped spur the civil rights movement. The work, however, remained on view.
Friday's letter from the four artists withdrawing their work came on the heels of an essay, "The Tear Gas Biennial," in Artforum two days earlier that called on artists to boycott the exhibition.
The museum said it had reached out to artists over their requests to remove works, among them a large-scale sculpture by Nicole Eisenman called "Procession," which sprawls across the sixth-floor terrace. Also outside on the fifth floor is a "video viewing" station by Meriem Bennani called "Mission Teens," which follows a group of teenage schoolgirls in Rabat, Morocco.
Some Biennial artists said Saturday that they respect the decision by fellow artists to withdraw from the exhibition but wanted their work to remain in the Whitney.
Sofía Gallisá Muriente, from San Juan, said in an email that her work addresses the "colonialism of Puerto Rico," and that she believes "in the power and importance of that piece to speak to our current political situation."
Another artist, Brendan Fernandes, who created a sculptural installation animated at times by dancers, said his work is "a form of protest within the system."
He added, "The institution will only change when you're in it."
Attention was focused on Mr. Kanders late last year, when the art website Hyperallergic published photos showing metal canisters marked with Safariland's name. The canisters were said to have been found where the American authorities used tear gas to disperse hundreds of migrants running toward a crossing from Tijuana to San Diego.
Many Whitney employees signed a letter expressing dismay. Mr. Kanders replied with a letterexpressing pride in Safariland, which also sells protective suits and armor, adding that the company plays no role in deciding how its products are used.
In a letter last winter to staff members and trustees, Mr. Weinberg wrote that the museum has "a critical and urgent" role in recognizing "unheard and unwanted voices," but added that it "cannot right all the ills of an unjust world."
And about two weeks before the Biennial opened in mid-May, roughly two-thirds of the 75 participating artists and collectives added their names to the letter urging the museum to remove Mr. Kanders as vice chairman of the board.
On the opening night of the Biennial, protesters draped a black banner reading "When We Breathe We Breathe Together" from an upper floor of the museum. Later they marched to Mr. Kanders's home in Greenwich Village, taking with them a rolling installation in the form of a five-foot-tall silver cylinder emblazoned with the words "tear gas."

Texto completo: America’s landing on the moon now stands as such a stunning success that, 50 years later, we have trouble imagining that it could have gone terribly, tragically wrong.
But in the days before the landing, on July 20, 1969, there were acute fears of a mishap. Officials in the White House and at NASA laid out lugubrious contingency plans in case astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon but then were unable to get off the surface and back to the space capsule. Had that happened, they would have been doomed to die there, either by slow asphyxiation or perhaps by suicide.
The White House chief of staff instructed William Safire, then a White House speechwriter (and later a New York Times columnist), to draft a remarkable speech for President Richard Nixon to deliver to the nation if the astronauts were stranded. Along with the speech, Safire included instructions for other actions that should be taken. In particular, he wrote, Nixon should telephone the wives of the astronauts, whom he chillingly referred to as the “widows-to-be.” At a certain point, NASA would “end communications” with the astronauts, Safire wrote, and a clergyman should then conduct the equivalent of a burial at sea, ending with the Lord’s Prayer.
Safire’s undelivered speech lay hidden for nearly three decades before I found it. In the late 1990s, researching a book on America’s opening to China, I was rummaging through the archives of the Nixon administration (then in the Washington suburb of College Park, Maryland) when my eyes suddenly fell on something I wasn’t looking for. It was a memo from Safire to White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman titled, “In event of moon disaster.”
The short text still brings tears to the eyes. It begins, “Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace.” It ends with the words, “For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.”
What Safire wrote would have qualified as the most eloquent speech Nixon ever gave - and one of the most poignant by any American president. Thankfully, it never had to be delivered.

Self-driving cars are 'way in the future'

Texto completo: Ayear ago, Detroit and Silicon Valley had visions of putting thousands of self-driving taxis on the road in 2019, ushering in an age of driverless cars.
Most of those cars have yet to arrive - and it is likely to be years before they do. Several carmakers and technology companies have concluded that making autonomous vehicles is going to be harder, slower and costlier than they thought.
"We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles," Ford's chief executive, Jim Hackett, said at the Detroit Economic Club in April.
In the most recent sign of the scramble to regroup, Ford and Volkswagen said last week that they were teaming up to tackle the self-driving challenge.
The two automakers plan to use autonomous-vehicle technology from a Pittsburgh startup, Argo AI, in ride-sharing services in a few urban zones as early as 2021. But Argo's chief executive, Bryan Salesky, said the industry's bigger promise of creating driverless cars that could go anywhere was "way in the future."
He and others attribute the delay to something as obvious as it is stubborn: human behavior.
Researchers at Argo say the cars they are testing in Pittsburgh and Miami have to navigate unexpected situations every day. Recently, one of the company's cars encountered a bicyclist riding the wrong way down a busy street between other vehicles. Another Argo test car came across a street sweeper that suddenly turned a giant circle in an intersection, touching all four corners and crossing lanes of traffic that had the green light.
"You see all kinds of crazy things on the road, and it turns out they're not all that infrequent, but you have to be able to handle all of them," Salesky said. "With radar and high-resolution cameras and all the computing power we have, we can detect and identify the objects on a street. The hard part is anticipating what they're going to do next."
Salesky said Argo and many competitors had developed about 80% of the technology needed to put self-driving cars into routine use - the radar, cameras and other sensors that can identify objects far down roads and highways. But the remaining 20%, including developing software that can reliably anticipate what other drivers, pedestrians and cyclists are going to do, will be much more difficult, he said.
A year ago, many industry executives exuded much greater certainty. They thought that their engineers had solved the most vexing technical problems and promised that self-driving cars would be shuttling people around town in at least several cities by sometime this year.
"There was this incredible optimism," said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Navigant Research. "Companies thought this was a very straightforward problem. You just throw in some sensors and artificial intelligence and it would be easy to do."
The industry's unbridled confidence was quickly dented when a self-driving car being tested by Uber hit and killed a woman walking a bicycle across a street last year in Tempe, Arizona. A safety driver was at the wheel of the vehicle, but was watching a TV show on her phone just before the crash, according to the Tempe Police Department.
Since that fatality, "almost everybody has reset their expectations," Abuelsamid said. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death involving a self-driving vehicle. Elsewhere in the United States, three Tesla drivers have died in crashes that occurred while the company's Autopilot driver-assistance system was engaged and both it and the drivers failed to detect and react to hazards.

Texto completo: In 2000, the Broward County Public Schools in Florida hired a consultant and physicist named Bill P. Curry to explore a nerve-racking question: Would installing wireless networks pose any health risks to the district's 250,000 students?
Yes, he replied, in a report that included an alarming graph suggesting students' brains would be exposed to significant amounts of radiation.
Much of the anxiety over the risks of cellphones and emerging 5G technology can be traced back to that single graph. But as the New York Times recently pointed out, there's one problem: Curry, who lacked biological expertise, got it wrong.
Experts say he failed to account for the protective effect of human skin, which shields organs, including the brain, from higher radio frequencies.
So go ahead. Give your teen all the smartphone time she wants. Her brain is safe from radiation — even if it's not safe from Instagram.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES – Children's television has made heroes out of a bookish aardvark, a singing dinosaur and pizza-munching turtles. It's about time a Native American girl got a shot.

"Molly of Denali," new this week on PBS, breaks new ground with its casting, furthering the case that, when it comes to diversity, kids' programming leads the way.

"Dora the Explorer," which Nickelodeon premiered in 2000, cleared a path for more Latino representation on the airwaves. Disney's "Doc McStuffins," wrapping up its fifth and final season, triggered more than $500 million in merchandise sales in 2013 -- a record for a toy line based on a black character, according to the New York Times. TPT's "Hero Elementary," a science series due to premiere in 2020, will pay just as much attention to diversity as it does to brainpower.

But Molly Mabray is the first star of an animated children's show to be a proud, contributing member of a Native American tribe, sharing her adventures from her Alaska home with young viewers across the country.

"We're going to see Molly and her friends doing everything from dogsledding to working in her garden to traveling with her mom, who is a bush pilot who can't land the plane because there's a moose in the runway," said Lesli Rotenberg, PBS' chief programming executive for children's media and education.

"We're highlighting important values, like knowing who you are, accepting what life brings and honoring your elders. While these values are specific to the Alaskan Native community, they're also universal."

Kids from all backgrounds can relate to Molly's obsessions with the internet, sports, animals and music.

But there's almost always a twist.

The 10-year-old uses the computer to monitor a bald eagle watching over her eggs. She may shoot baskets, but she'd rather be competing in a birch-canoe race.

She's determined to heal her grandpa's emotional wounds after she learns that he lost his love of music after the boarding school he was forced to attend as a child forbade him from playing his people's songs.

She bonds with an intimidating aunt after the two of them come up with a new tribal name for her.

No lemonade stand for Molly; instead, she answers phones at the family's trading post.

"She's learning these traditional practices, like snowshoeing or hunting for agate stones, but she's also just an everyday kid that's super-relatable," said the show's creative producer, Princess Daazhraii Johnson.

Johnson, a 13-year Hollywood veteran who grew up in Alaska, is uniquely qualified to lead the series.

Her younger brother, Evon Peter, was the youngest chief in Arctic Village, Alaska. She also has two children at home who are members of the show's target audience.

"Every once in a while when I'm looking at clips for the show," Johnson said, "my 8-year-old will come along and say something like, ‘Mom, that's our Native food.' Or there will be a scene where Molly is cutting with an ulu (an all-purpose knife) and he's like, ‘You have one of those!'

"I live for those moments. We get to see ourselves represented in this beautiful, positive light, and we are informing what our image looks like."

Texto completo: [ Read all Times reporting on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing .]
On the phone with his interview subjects, J.T. Rogers had to keep hitting the mute button. He was weeping, and he didn't want them to hear.
The conversations were research for his new play, "One Giant Leap, 50 Years On," about the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969 -- not, on the face of it, a tear-jerking topic.
But Mr. Rogers, 51, whose historically inspired peace-accords drama "Oslo" won the 2017 Tony Award for best play, was talking with people who'd experienced the mission up close. As he asked what it meant to them from a distance of five decades, the humanity of their responses got to him.
It wasn't just their thoughtfulness or eloquence, he said one afternoon last week. It was also that many of them, having been present for such a hopeful human moment, were "so crushed about where they see our world politically now versus then."
Those interviews form the heart of "One Giant Leap," whose reading on Sunday evening at the Town Hall -- part of a New York Times-sponsored celebration of the 50th anniversary -- will be a starry affair. Directed by Bartlett Sher, the Tony winner who helmed "Oslo," it will include three actors from his current Broadway production of "To Kill a Mockingbird": Jeff Daniels, Dakin Matthews and LaTanya Richardson Jackson -- whose husband, Samuel L. Jackson, will also be part of the 10-person "Giant Leap" cast.
[Read a roundup of events related to the Apollo 11 anniversary .]
The play, which Mr. Rogers described as a 45-minute "theater oratorio," was commissioned about six months ago by The New York Times. He decided it should be cast across lines of race and age and gender, turning a story about what he called "white dudes with the same haircut" into a story that belongs to everyone.
Though he's borrowed from Apollo 11 mission transcripts (sparingly) and Times coverage (likewise), he emphasized that the play is not pure documentary. In shaping and polishing its text, he's taken some artistic liberties.
Last week, Mr. Rogers was still revising the script, whose characters include Michael Collins, the astronaut who flew the command module while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin explored the moon; Margaret Hamilton, the computer scientist who led NASA's team of software engineers; and John Wolfram, a Navy frogman who recovered the capsule after the three astronauts splashed down. (Mr. Collins is slated to be on hand on Sunday for a post-performance panel discussion moderated by Michael Barbaro.)
Sitting in Mr. Sher's office at Lincoln Center, Mr. Rogers said that only one of the "Giant Leap" actors already knew which role he had been assigned. Mr. Matthews will play John Noble Wilford, the Times reporter whose coverage of the race to the moon -- "that desolate realm of dream and scientific mystery," he once called it -- blended pristine wonkery and warm human detail with touches of poetry.
The play, whose emotional punch depends upon its tracing the history of the space program leading up to the Apollo 11 mission, has a lot of explaining to do, placing the events in the context of the time.
Mr. Wilford, 85, has "sort of become the Virgil of the story," Mr. Rogers said, because of "his ability to step back and paint the larger picture."
In a phone interview from his home in Bellport, Long Island, that's exactly what Mr. Wilford did, conjuring the excitement of the era, the rapid pace of scientific progress and the relative youth of the Apollo 11 astronauts -- like him, then all in their 30s.
NASA's arrival on the moon made good on John F. Kennedy's vow that the United States would be there before the '60s were done. But it was a turbulent decade. Mr. Wilford remembers 1968, when Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated, as "one of the worst years in my lifetime from the standpoint of the public, of being an American."
That December, when the Apollo 8 astronauts triumphantly circumnavigated the moon, taking the famous photo of the Earth with the moon in the foreground, "It was the first hopeful thing that had happened all year," Mr. Wilford said.
Mr. Rogers was only 14 months old the next summer when Apollo 11's lunar module Eagle landed. His parents woke him from his crib to watch it on TV -- his first memory, he says, unless he just heard the story enough times that he burnished it into recollection.
He didn't grow up to be "a space head," as he put it; he wasn't wild about all things astronaut. Still, reading the Apollo 11 transcripts made him optimistic. Reminded that people working together can achieve astonishing things, and fast, Mr. Rogers intends "One Giant Leap" as a patriotic act in our turbulent time, to pass that feeling on.
"It is a piece about hope and wonder," he said. "And I could use a little hope and wonder right now."

BERKELEY BANS NATURAL GAS IN NEW BUILDINGS

Texto completo: BERKELEY >> Keeping its reputation of leading the country in environmental policies, Berkeley is banning natural gas in new buildings starting next year, becoming the first city in the country to do so.
The move unanimously approved by the City Council on Tuesday comes as part of Berkeley's move to become greener and do its part to fight climate change. The city had adopted a lofty plan in 2009 to cut down its greenhouse gas emissions to 33% of what they were in 2000 by 2020, but the city has only managed to reduce emissions by 15%, said Councilwoman Kate Harrison, who proposed the ordinance.
Natural gas appliances account for 27% of the city's greenhouse gas emissions, Harrison said.
"We often talk about climate change as this scary terrible thing, and it is, but at the end of the day when we tackle this challenge, we're going to have cleaner, healthier, more efficient, safer, cheaper homes and places of business," Harrison said at the meeting.
Sierra Club campaigner Rachel Golden called Tuesday's council vote a historic moment in the state, adding that more than 50 other cities in California are also looking to phase out natural gas infrastructure. According to the Building Decarbonization Coalition, San Jose, San Francisco and dozens of other cities are considering similar legislation to accelerate zero-emission buildings.
"Berkeley has a long history of leading the world in climate, environment and social justice," Golden said. "This is one of those moments where we are going to show our leadership and inspire other cities in California and states across the country that we could phase out gas, and do so economically, with attention to environmental justice and in a way that's going to support our communities to be safer and healthier."
Eliminating natural gas could have other benefits. A 2018 study by the University of Queensland that analyzed asthma cases among children younger than 14 in 2011 blamed 12% of childhood asthma on gas stoves used for cooking.
Harrison said the ordinance also will help prevent deadly home fires that start from an open flame and are fueled by gas lines, and it would make homes safer in case of a major earthquake. She cited a 2017 study by the 2017 U.S. Geological Survey that found that a 7.0 magnitude earthquake on the Hayward fault line with the epicenter in Oakland could result in 450 large fires, and the destruction of thousands of homes, and that ruptured gas lines would be a "key fire risk factor."
The devastating 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake resulted in ruptured gas mains that caused huge fires.
Pacific Gas and Electric spokesman Darin Cline, at the meeting, spoke in favor of the ordinance, saying the company is in favor of all-electric construction.
"We welcome the opportunity to avoid investments in new gas assets that might later prove underutilized as the local governments and the state work together to realize our long-term decarbonization objectives," he said.
Exemptions to the rule include new units built in the basements or attics of existing houses, which will be allowed to use whatever fuel source already is used in the home, and in construction that will "serve the public interest" as determined by the City Council or the zoning adjustments board.
The ordinance would apply to restaurants as well as homes, but Harrison assured those at Tuesday's meeting that the city could "maintain its rich culinary culture" through the use of electric induction cook tops and ranges. She demonstrated this by having one of her staffers melt a chocolate bar in a pot over a hot plate during the meeting. The staffer put a piece of paper in between the hot plate and the pot to show how that it wouldn't catch on fire, and handed out chocolate-covered strawberries in a demonstration that tasty food does not require a gas stove.
Cline said PG&E owns a 9,000-square-foot commercial kitchen in San Ramon that has all induction appliances, which company officials show developers and restaurateurs as proof that it can be done. A 2010 New York Times article said chefs are flocking to induction cook tops and ranges for their power and precision, saying they may become "the iPad of the kitchen."
Some setbacks identified in the article are that they are generally twice as expensive as gas appliances and that learning how to control the powerful heat can be tough to figure out.
The council also voted to earmark $273,341 during the upcoming November budget process to hire a staffer for a two-year position in the city's Planning and Development Department to implement the ordinance.

Among the big names featured will be former UN ambassador Samantha Power , poet Reginald Dwayne Betts (“Bastards of the Reagan Era"), Candace Bushnell (best-selling author of “Sex and the City"), novelist Susan Choi (“Trust Exercise") and poet and memoirist Saeed Jones (“Prelude to Bruise").
Power kicks off the festival Oct. 18 with a discussion of her new memoir, “The Education of an Idealist." Events continue Oct. 19 in Copley Square with a street fair, live music, and food trucks.
All told, the 2019 BBF will include 300 presenters on topics ranging from ethics, climate change, and politics to aging, sex, and romance.
“We are excited to offer a variety of programming for people of all backgrounds that celebrates the mix of rich history, forward-thinking intellect and cultural diversity of Boston," executive director Norah Piehl said in a release.
BBF will release a full list of presenters later this summer. For now, the program's confirmed list of presenters also includes historian David Blight (“Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom"), Akwaeke Emezi (“Freshwater") , Jasmine Guillory (“The Wedding Party"),and Martha Minow (“Between Vengeance and Forgiveness") .

Texto completo: In his ably assembled and appropriately respectful New York Times review of David Maraniss' "A Good American Family: The Red Scare and My Father," novelist Kevin Baker praises the author for revealing "a fascinating confluence of America" and marvels at how often "one is bowled over by the vibrancy of that vanished nation."
The book, as readers of this newspaper are well aware, is a memoir and a history that reflects on the journey of David's father, Elliott Maraniss, from 1930s radical to 1950s target of anti-communist zealots to his distinguished tenure at The Capital Times where in the late 1970s and early 1980s he served as the editor.
Baker ruminates on the evocation of time and place that makes "A Good American Family" such a fine read, observing, "It's a world where David's sister listens to a new song called 'Shake, Rattle and Roll,' and the family watches mesmerized as exquisite lines of Detroit cars appear every summer. Elliott's wanderings take him to an Iowa newspaper that grew out of a strike by union typographers.
Later, he sees his revered new publisher, William T. Evjue of The Capital Times, in Madison, talking and laughing in his office with Carl Sandburg and Frank Lloyd Wright. Did we ever live in such an America? Did we just dream it?"
Of course, it existed. I grew up in it.
I remember wandering around the old Capital Times offices on South Carroll Street as a 10-year-old, when it was still possible to imbibe the mixture of grit and idealism that characterized the newspaper Evjue led from its 1917 founding until his death in 1970. I remember playing in the fields around Wright's Taliesin. I learned from my friend Frank Zeidler that Sandburg had gotten to know Evjue when both were newspapermen in Milwaukee Sandburg as a contributor to the Social Democratic Herald, Evjue as an ideologically frustrated writer for the conservative Sentinel. Zona Gale, an acquaintance of Evjue and Sandburg from those Milwaukee newspaper days, would in 1921 become the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for drama. Like Gale, Edna Ferber wrote for the Journal and, in 1925, Ferber collected her own Pulitzer for fiction writing.
Evjue, the son of Norwegian immigrants, was born in Merrill. Wright, a descendant of Welsh immigrants, was born in Richland Center but spent most of his childhood in the towns across the Wisconsin River from Spring Green where my mother's family settled.
Sandburg grew up on the other side of the Wisconsin-Illinois line in Galesburg but came into his own as a young socialist in Milwaukee. Gale was from Portage. Ferber spent her teen years in Appleton before heading to Milwaukee.
For the most part, these men and women were known for their journalistic and literary accomplishments. Yet they were all intensely political people. They were products of a remarkable moment in Wisconsin history when Robert M. La Follette and his allies ushered in an era of radical progressivism that advocated for economic and social and racial justice, opposed imperialism and colonialism, and recognized a need to preserve rather than exploit our natural resources. And, for a time, they made Wisconsin the embodiment of those values. This work was never easy; it was always a fight.
Evjue and his acquaintances and allies, including my great-grandfather and the Capital Times-reading progressives of rural Grant County, maintained their militant faith in a politics that rejected the empty compromises of centrism and corporatism. They made this place over as America's "laboratory of democracy."
States choose their destinies. They are as glorious or as miserable as they decide to be. Wisconsin was not the wealthiest or most well-positioned state during the Gilded Age. In fact, it was exploited rather mercilessly by the grain merchants and the railroad companies of the late 19th century.
But generations of Wisconsinites were inspired by La Follette, a son of the town of Primrose in southwestern Dane County, to throw off what "Fighting Bob" described as the "invisible hand" of "these corporations and masters of manipulation in finance heaping up great fortunes by a system of legalized extortion."
"Think of the heroes who died to make this country free; think of their sons who died to keep it undivided upon the map of the world. Shall we, their children, basely surrender our birthright and say: 'Representative government is a failure'? No, never," declared La Follette when he issued his great call to arms on July 4, 1897, in Mineral Point. "Let us here, today, under this flag we all love, hallowed by the memory of all that has been sacrificed for it and for us, dedicate ourselves to winning back the independence of this country, to emancipating this generation and throwing off from the neck of the freemen of America, the yoke of the political machine."
La Follette died in 1925, having transformed Wisconsin and made it a North Star for the nation. Evjue lived on to 1970. Their legacies have been battered by politicians without conscience, the Scott Walkers and Paul Ryans who used Wisconsin as a springboard for their national ambitions, but they have not been erased. We can still point to them. More importantly, we can renew them. The place of beginning is to recognize that we once lived in an America such as the one Elliott Maraniss witnessed on that afternoon in the late 1960s. It was not a dream. It was Wisconsin.

NASA can still inspire through exploration

Texto completo: Even beyond its ambitious plans to send human beings to other worlds, NASA can still inspire.
The space agency sparked imaginations again recently when it announced the next of its unmanned missions to other worlds. This time it will send a car-sized helicopter called Dragonfly to explore the frigid surface and atmosphere of Titan, an intriguing moon that orbits Saturn.
Everything about the adventure is appealing. For a man-made machine to touch down on Titan, to imagine its cameras looking overhead at the belt of rubble that rings Saturn, to be able to probe greater distances than a wheeled rover — this is dazzling stuff.
For scientists, the real draw of Titan is the promising stew of compounds that make up the moon's environment.
"We have all these ingredients necessary for life as we know it, and they're just sitting there doing chemistry experiments on the surface of Titan. That's why we want to send a lander there," Dr. Elizabeth Turtle told The New York Times this spring. She will be the principal investigator for the mission, which will be led by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University.
There are reservoirs of liquid methane. There is methane in the atmosphere, too, suggesting that the ingredients for life exist on Titan, or that life once existed there.
Said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine: "Visiting this mysterious ocean world could revolutionize what we know about life in the universe."
As NASA missions go, this one is a relative bargain. It's part of the agency's New Frontiers program, which sends probes to new destinations at a program cost of less than $1 billion each. Previous missions in the program included sending a solar-powered spacecraft to Jupiter, sending a spacecraft and instrument bundle to skim past Pluto and, remarkably, launching the Osiris probe that is expected to return an asteroid sample to Earth after touching down on the rocky Bennu.
Of course, even at $1 billion, this won't be an easy crosstown hop. The plan for Dragonfly is to launch in 2026 and land on Titan in 2034, then prowl around for more than 2½ years before winking out. It will travel about 108 miles around Titan — more than twice the distance covered by the Mars rovers combined. Its communications with Earth will lag by 43 minutes — the time it will take a light signal to cover the vast distance between here and there. Titan is about 10 times farther from the sun than Earth.
While the spacecraft's eight rotors may cause it to resemble drones you can buy on Amazon, this one will be able to cover miles per hop, flying as high as two miles above the surface. On Titan, gravity is lighter and the atmosphere is thicker, and each local day takes 16 Earth days. The good thing, according to Dr. Turtle, is that "it's actually easier to fly on Titan."
Imagine that — "It's actually easier to fly on Titan." It's like a driver saying it's easier to drive on the highway than through town, or a pilot saying it's actually easier to fly a jet than a propeller-driven aircraft.
This is what humans can do, given the time, resources and spirit of adventure. Americans remain a remarkable people in many ways, including in their capacity to explore the frontiers of the imagination.

Salinas native, 7, lauded for bottle cap challenge

Texto completo: In attempting a video challenge performed by famous actors, musicians and mixed martial artists, 7-year-old Salinas native David Lomeli has reached viral stardom on a national level.
He's also earned a new nickname.
"Our friends started calling him 'Hollywood,'" David's father Robert said Monday with a laugh. "Which is funny because he doesn't really know what Hollywood is."
David's fame stems from attempting the bottle cap challenge, a viral challenge originally from Instagram that typically involves a person roundhouse kicking the cap off of a bottle.
Instead of a kick though, David roped off the bottle cap in a video now viewed online more than 150,000 times as of Monday.
According to the New York Times, the bottle cap challenge possibly started with Taekwondo champion Farabi Davletchin three weeks ago.
He posted a video on Instagram of him roundhouse kicking the cap off of a water bottle and called out Jason Statham, Conor McGregor, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jackie Chan to do it.
It caught on quickly with the likes of John Mayer, Ryan Reynolds, Lizzo, Mariah Carey, Sophie Turner, Statham and other celebrities either doing the challenge or doing their own variation.
Robert had seen the challenge going around on Instagram with videos of UFC fighters McGregor and Max Holloway kicking caps off in slow motion. He thought there was an opportunity for him to do something a little different, too.
"We rope and ride horses so I thought I could do it with a rope," he said. "I tried it first before he did and gave it a couple shots. I didn't get it to work but then (David) came over and wanted to give it a go."
It took David just three attempts to knock the cap off.
"Something like that takes a lot of skill to get that control," Robert said. "The timing and release is really tough to hit that target."
He later upped the challenge from plastic bottle caps to roping the caps off of Coors beer bottles.
David has been roping "since he was born," Robert said. That's a lot of time to build up the skill required to knock the top off of the bottle.
Within a few days, the likes of Professional Bull Riders (PBR) shared Robert's video to their social media pages, and it has since been viewed over 150,000 times.
But the fame hasn't gone to his head at all.
"He's still just a little guy and what's going on really hasn't hit him," Robert said. "He's pretty humble about it."
He may have his first wave of fame this week at the California Rodeo Salinas. Both father and son will be attending the event this weekend.

NBA superstars' new strategy: Tag team a title

Texto completo: The NBA has fractured into an assortment of tag teams vying for the crown, while general managers keep their eyes peeled for who is next to ask out. Superteams are now dynamic duos. It's not the Avengers fighting Thanos anymore - Batman and Robin are taking on Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze.
A wild - by any measure - offseason has changed the landscape of the league.
LeBron James and Anthony Davis are in Los Angeles. Kawhi Leonard and Paul George are there, too: Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are in Brooklyn.
And let's not leave out the Warriors. Even though Klay Thompson will miss several months of the season with an injury, they still have a powerful pairing of their own: Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.
But the question is: Will any of these duos actually work?
Los Angeles Lakers
LeBron James and Anthony Davis
There is a strange perception that James had a down year last season in Los Angeles, despite his recording more points, rebounds and assists per game than his career averages. Consistent greatness has caused James to, in a way, be taken for granted, and recency bias - meaning a James-led team missing the playoffs for the first time since the Bronze Age - . has shaded his personal success.
But make no mistake: Anthony Davis in his prime is the best teammate James has ever had, and we are going to be reminded why James is one of the greatest basketball players in history. Davis is better than Dwyane Wade at 29, Kyrie Irving in his early 20s, and Shaquille O'Neal at 37. He is an exceptional player on both ends of the floor. But it is around the rim where Davis does most of his damage, finishing better than 70% within 5 feet of the basket.
James and Davis will be a lethal pick-and-roll combination.
Los Angeles Clippers
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George
Fresh off a championship, Leonard will play with the best teammate of his career, as well. (Before you throw a chair, Tim Duncan wasn't in his prime when Leonard was with him on the San Antonio Spurs.) Both Leonard and George have made multiple All-Defensive teams. Top scorers will have to go up against one or both of these two for 48 minutes, not including the professional annoyance that is Patrick Beverley.
Leonard and George immediately turn the Clippers into a juggernaut. Offensively, George and Leonard have different games that should complement each other. George is more of a long-range bomber (9.8 3-point attempts a game last season) and Leonard has the stronger midrange game.
Even if they take some time to feel each other out on that end of the floor, who is scoring on them?
Brooklyn Nets
Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant
Durant (Achilles tendon) is most likely out for most, if not all, of next season. But once he is healthy, the Nets may still have a problem.
Irving and Durant are both ball-dominant, scoring-focused players. Despite how bizarre his last year with Boston was, Irving put up the best numbers of his career - and showed a willingness to create for others, averaging a career-high 6.9 assists. The ball has a tendency to stick to Irving's hands, though, especially late in games. Because of his exceptional ball-handling ability, Irving thrives in isolation: 63% of his field goals last season were unassisted. (In contrast, Durant, another player who enjoys playing in isolation, scored only 51% of his makes unassisted.)
Durant can score anytime and anywhere in any number of ways. And he knows it. How will he react when Irving pulls up for a 3-pointer with 20 seconds left on the shot clock, even though Durant is open? Durant and Irving are known to be temperamental when things don't go well. Will they be patient about who is handling the reins on offense? Will they opt for hero ball?
Coach Kenny Atkinson has built a culture of sharing in Brooklyn. But if Irving wouldn't buy in with that culture in Boston, is there any chance he does so with the Nets?
Irving's history tells us: no.
Houston Rockets
James Harden and Russell Westbrook
No NBA star's stock plummeted after the playoffs the way Westbrook's did after another first-round exit. His critics went after his shot selection, ball dominance and demeanor. But people have forgotten just how good Westbrook is.
He's great.
He's undeniably one of the best players in the league, an exceptional playmaker and an elite rebounder. That matters. It was clear that Chris Paul and Harden didn't enjoy playing together in Houston, so something had to change. Westbrook is the change.
Like Irving and Durant, this is a risky pairing: Two alpha dogs who have changed how traditional basketball is perceived, even while being criticized as ballhogs. But each is motivated to prove doubters wrong.
Westbrook's defense is suspect. His shooting is nonexistent, even though his shots aren't. The Rockets' offense, for the last couple of years, has been based on isolations and 3-point shooting. That will have to shift to accommodate Westbrook's open-floor ability (and his weakness from outside).
At a base level, two former most valuable players in their primes are playing together in a wide-open league. The Rockets will be good next year. But good enough? That's the question.

Texto completo: Corporate lobbyists, Democratic lawmakers, and Wall Street-type Republicans will all tell you that the U.S. Export-Import Bank helps U.S. companies export. They’ll castigate subsidy opponents as free-market ideologues who don't care about actual U.S. companies.
But here’s the thing: The best economic research debunks all of their arguments.
Economists Natasha Agarwal and Zheng Wang have conducted the most detailed and meticulous studies ever of government-backed export finance, the kind that Ex-Im provides.
Ex-Im subsidizes U.S. exporters by extending taxpayer-backed loans or loan guarantees to foreign buyers of U.S. goods, primarily Boeing jets. The agency’s charter expires at the end of September, and Democrats and the swampier folks in the Trump White House are pushing for reauthorization.
These subsidy advocates assert that Ex-Im creates jobs. They say it again and again, without evidence, and much of the media believe it without evidence. “America’s jobs are being lost,” White House trade official Peter Navarro complained when Ex-Im was hobbled, “by the hundreds of thousands.”
Subsidy champions get away with these unfounded claims because a credulous media believes them. “I get philosophical opposition to #ExIm,” tweeted the New York Times reporter who covered Ex-Im during the last major debate over it, “but how could ending loan guarantees for US exporters not cost jobs?”
Great question. With just a tiny bit of economics, it’s easy to posit many ways in which ending these subsidies might not cost jobs. For one thing, subsidizing exports might not really result in more exports, but only different exports. Or maybe Ex-Im doesn’t change the makeup of exports that much, it just pads profit margins. Or maybe it shifts financing from domestic sales to exports. And maybe, just maybe, the private sector would allocate financing more efficiently than the bureaucrats on Vermont Avenue.
Whatever theoretical mechanism you prefer, the empirical data all suggest that Ex-Im does not significantly boost exports, especially not among small businesses.
Economists Agarwal and Wang studied detailed data on how much certain U.S. industries exported to certain countries, and how much Ex-Im financing appeared to affect those exports. “In a given year,” the economists found, “EXIM authorisations do not have a sizable impact on U.S. exports with its partner countries.”
In short, more export subsidies from Ex-Im doesn’t significantly yield more exports.
The economists got much more granular. Ex-Im defenders always tout the agency as helping small businesses export. But this study found that “EXIM authorisation to small businesses does not have an impact on their exports. On the contrary, it is the businesses that are not classified as small by the Bank that witness a positive impact of EXIM authorisation on their exports.”
Translated: The main effect of Ex-Im is to subsidize Big Business. “EXIM support is not a lifeline to small businesses’ exports as claimed by the EXIM Bank proponents,” Agarwal and Wang wrote.
How could this be? Perhaps Ex-Im simply drives a small business to Ex-Im-favored exports instead of others. Perhaps Ex-Im picks winners and losers, and so some U.S. small businesses win export sales at the expense of others.
Also, there’s the fact that much of the “support” Ex-Im brags about for small business never comes into being. More than 40% of small businesses with export-insurance plans from Ex-Im in 2016 never got coverage on a penny of exports, it turns out. What happens is that Ex-Im brokers rope small businesses into Ex-Im plans, but then they never export anything that gets coverage. This allows Ex-Im to boost its small-business numbers and justify its existence to Congress and to credulous journalists.
The Export-Import Bank, then, has only a tiny effect on exports. It is entirely for Big Business exports. This hardly seems like the sort of thing that the U.S. taxpayers should be forced to back. Congress could right this wrong by refusing or even just failing to reauthorize Ex-Im.Story URLPhoto Caption:In this photo taken on Aug. 5, 2010, a container are being load into a cargo ship at the Tianjin port in China. China's exports grew strongly in July but import growth fell as its rapid economic expansion cooled, possibly hurting global demand.

Export growth eased from June's 43.9 percent rate while import growth tumbled from June's 34.1 percent expansion.

Texto completo: An Alabama company is planning to strip mine for titanium and other heavy minerals in an area of Charlton County bordering the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, an idea that the DuPont Co. abandoned in the late 1990s after government and public outcry against it.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers posted a joint public notice with the state of Georgia on Friday indicating it had received a Clean Water Act permit application from Birmingham, Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals. The corps is asking for public comments on the permit.
In the application, the company indicated it plans to extract "high quality heavy mineral reserves" for "export by truck, rail and eventual barge to national and international customers."
"Mineral sand-derived products, particularly those containing titanium dioxide and zirconium, are in high demand worldwide in the pigment, aerospace, medical, foundry, and other industrial products," the document states. "Elemental components, chiefly titanium, are used as the white pigments. Titanium dioxide is nontoxic and has replaced lead as the predominant pigment in paints and coatings."
Twin Pines is proposing to operate its mining facility in stages on about 19 square miles along a ridge of land bordering the refuge, digging to variable depths that will average 50 feet below the land surface on two of the three tracts and 25 feet below the surface on the third. The company is proposing to backfill and grade the mined land within about 30 days following excavation with replanting during the appropriate planting season.
Impact to ecosystem
The first phase of the project will bring permanent impacts to 65 acres of wetlands and nearly a mile of tributaries, the company predicted. Gopher tortoises, a threatened species that is considered a "keystone" species on which other animals depend, will be impacted due to construction of facilities and mining activities.
The 635-square-mile Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the largest blackwater swamp North America, drew more than 600,000 visitors from the U.S. and 40 other countries over the last year and a half, said Susie Heisey, the supervisory refuge ranger. They experienced what National Geographic named one of the 100 most beautiful places on the planet.
"One of the coolest things about the Okefenokee is that it's basically an intact ecosystem," said Refuge Manager Michael Lusk, noting that the Everglades, while larger, had been ditched and drained. And while there once was logging in some parts of the Okefenokee, the swamp has been protected for more than 80 years. "What we have now is a large intact, functioning ecosystem and that is so rare, especially in the eastern U.S."
The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, which operates the refuge, will prepare formal comments on the permit application, Lusk said. Concerns will focus on the effects of a strip mining operation on the area's hydrology, the underground movement of water.
""e'll have similar concerns as when the DuPont mining proposal was made," Lusk said.
That proposal resulted in no mining and an eventual expansion of the refuge.
In the spring of 1997, then Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt opposed the strip mining in advance of hearing DuPont's arguments for it.
''You can study this, you can write all the documents in the world,'' Babbitt was quoted in the New York Times, ''but they are not going to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there will be no impact.''
Later that year the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service pulled out of discussions over the mining, saying compromise was not possible, the Savannah Morning News reported. DuPont eventually agreed to abandon its plans to mine titanium and in 2003 the company donated all 16,000 acres to The Conservation Fund, which in 2005 transferred nearly 7,000 acres to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an addition to Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
The Georgia Conservancy has been following plans to mine near the Okefenokee and will request a public hearing from the corps, said Coastal Director Charles McMillan III. The conservation group has two major concerns. First there's the potential harm to the Okefenokee, especially if the underground flow of water is altered. McMillan, who founded a civil and environmental engineering firm before joining the Georgia Conservancy, pointed back to the for Interior Secretary's remarks two decades ago.
"Babbitt mentioned concerns about the hydrology," he said. "That's pretty chilling, isn't it?"
Then there's the land to be mined, which is located on Trail Ridge. It's an ancient beach that runs from the Altamaha River 130 miles south to the Santa Fe River in Florida and a valuable habitat itself.
"Trail Ridge is an important component of the State Wildlife Action Plan," he said. "It has critically important species."
Like the gopher tortoise. McMillan is concerned that even if individual tortoises were rounded up and conserved, altering Trail Ridge will isolate groups of them, leaving them less genetically diverse.
"There needs to be on-site mitigation so you can leave them there afterward," he said.
Asked for comment on the application, a lobbyist for Twin Pines Minerals, Steve Allen of Joe Tanner & Associates, responded with a written fact sheet that reiterated much of the material in the application. It added an anticipated start date for mining activities, however, of January 2020. It is anticipated that the proposed facility will have an operational life of eight years, the fact sheet stated. It also changed the estimate of workers from the "full-time employment of approximately 150-200 workers from the local area" listed in the application to "this activity will result in the full-time employment of approximately 300 workers."

Texto completo: It would seem that the band of young progressives in Congress driving the Democratic Party to the left have struck a chord in American politics.
Our Question of the Week for readers: Is it a symphonic G major, or a flat discord?
Even the Executive Branch Tweeter in Chief seems to be fascinated by the group.
Are especially the members of “The Squad” — the four young women members of Congress President Trump told to “go back” to ancestral home countries over the weekend — creating important new policy discussions that will add oomph to the Democrats’ brand?
Or are they a danger to their party, increasing the chances that Trump will easily be re-elected by an American people worried about radicalism under the banner of “democratic socialism”?
In a recent New York Times interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was fairly critical of The Squad, which is made up of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts.
The irony of course is that Pelosi has long been viewed by many Americans as a stalwart liberal from elitist San Francisco. If she is instead the leader of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, does that mean the center cannot hold?
The four were the only Democrats to vote against the House version of a border funding bill backed by Pelosi. The speaker angrily said they had supporters in “their Twitter world” but not on Capitol Hill.
But after the racially tinged tweets from the president, Pelosi spoke out in support of her junior colleagues.
Some note that The Squad and other newly elected House Democrats are really more representative through their youth of the Millennial generation than of their ethnic backgrounds.
Will they energize young people who haven’t been involved in the political process before? Will they bring to the polls some minority voters who stayed out of the Hillary Clinton-Trump election in 2016?

PBC migrant community ‘very tense’

Texto completo: WEST PALM BEACH — “Guerra avisada no mata soldado,” said West Palm Beach-based immigration attorney Aileen Josephs on Sunday.
A war forewarned won’t kill a soldier.
While reports said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids were to begin Sunday in nine U.S. cities, the day carried on quietly in Palm Beach County.
Even without reports of local raids, the day was not without worry.
“The community is very tense,” Josephs said, hearing that some people were afraid to leave their homes.
Manolo Diaz, who is involved in St. Ann Catholic Church, said it appeared many Palm Beach County residents were “living their normal life,” as evident in the full congregation during the church’s afternoon Spanish Mass or the customers shuffling in and out of Mi Pais Express on Broadway Avenue.
“I see a lot of people in the streets,” said Mickey Fernandez, the convenience store’s owner. “I was told I was going to have an empty business.”
Fernandez thought that because the raids were said to be taking place in major metro areas like Miami, not in the West Palm Beach area, people might not be as concerned. The Miami Herald did not report any raids as of Sunday afternoon, but ICE agents were reported in Immokalee on Friday, according to the Naples Daily News.
But another test will be to see how the fear proliferates throughout the week. Fernandez and Diaz said they had heard some in the landscaping or farming industry were fearful to go to work tpday.
“This will impact business people,” Diaz said. “They are trying to do the best they can, how they can help people.”
The Guatemalan-Maya Center continued to promote information on social media that let immigrants know what to do if approached by ICE agents.
“It’s unfortunate that this announcement puts people on edge, makes people fearful,” said Daniel Morgan, a case manager with the center. “The good thing is we haven’t heard of any families being separated.”
President Donald Trump had temporarily suspended the raids on immigrant communities for two weeks in June, urging Democrats and Republicans to work together on border issues. The New York Times reported Thursday that at least 2,000 immigrants with deportation orders would be targeted in these raids.
In a statement released Sunday afternoon, U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, encouraged all South Florida residents to know their rights.
“Removal raids that target families instead of serious criminals are inhumane and disrupt peaceful communities,” she said. “Instead of playing politics, the president should work with Congress to pass immigration reform that strengthens border security and creates a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who work hard and pay taxes.”
Josephs hoped that these raids would make Congress come to a consensus on border security, legal immigration and “humanely dealing with people who are already here.”
Morgan wondered if these raids were “another scare tactic, more for publicity or political reasons rather than to do something about immigration policy in the country.”
“If it is, the administration is playing with people’s lives,” he said.

Like it or not, Democrats, Trump is on a roll

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The agonizing fact for Democrats this summer is that President Trump appears to be gaining ground on domestic and foreign policy, while his potential challengers are quarreling and mostly spinning their wheels.
Trump is taunting allies and defying Congress - and seemingly getting away with it. He isn’t just rewriting the political rulebook, he’s tossing it aside. And the painful fact is that the Democrats haven’t figured out a way to stop his forward momentum, even when they believe it’s taking the country over a cliff.
Trump remains a divisive and unpopular leader who is vulnerable in 2020. But a Washington Post-ABC News poll released last weekend was the clearest warning yet for Democrats that Trump is gaining strength beyond his core base of support.
Trump’s approval rating has risen 5 points since April, to 44%, according to the Post-ABC News survey. His disapproval rating is 53%, but his support is still the highest he’s had as president. The RealClearPolitics average of major polls shows a similar trend.
Trump would probably be doing even better if so many people weren’t turned off by his crass behavior. Commentator Steve Rattner recently noted the gap between the 56% predicted support for an incumbent with this record, as modeled by Yale economist Ray Fair, and Trump’s much lower actual support in polls.
Trump’s best issue is the economy. Last week’s employment report showed sharp job growth, led by manufacturing. There are caveats: The distribution of rewards is grossly unequal, and growth has been pumped by deficit spending. There are signs of weakness ahead, too, but even The New York Times Editorial Board agrees with Trump that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates, perhaps extending the recovery longer.
Trump anti-immigrant policies are appalling, but they don’t seem to be costing him politically. The Democrats, in their indignant response, have moved so far toward what critics argue is a policy of open borders that they may unintentionally make this issue a net winner for Trump.
Trump’s foreign policy has been a disruptive megaphone, with little real success to show, but here again, he gets away with it. His approach has become predictable: He threatens fire and fury, imposes economic sanctions, and then starts bargaining a deal that produces only modest gains. That’s been the case so far with North Korea, China and Mexico -- and it’s probably where Trump wants to head with Iran.
If you were to do a cost-benefit analysis of Trump’s foreign policy, the damage he’s done to allies would far outweigh any gains against potential adversaries. But Trump doesn’t pay the cost because, for all his belligerent “America First” talk, he’s avoiding new wars and says he wants to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan.
Polls suggest a continuing public distaste for Trump’s erratic, egoistic personal style, with 65% finding his behavior “unpresidential” in the Post-ABC News poll. The daily Trump show leaves the country exhausted and frazzled, and you can hypothesize a Democratic challenger who would be calming, trustworthy and unifying.
But looking at the Democratic field, it’s not clear yet who could actually deflate Trump’s balloon. The Democrats appear increasingly divided; they’re skewing further left as candidates compete for the party’s base; young progressives seem eager to pick fights with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other leaders. The public sadly seems almost as weary of Democrats’ investigations as of Trump’s scandals.
A Democrat who could, in theory, put a stopper in Trump’s bottle is former Vice President Joe Biden. He has experience, talented advisers, support from labor and some other traditional Democratic constituencies, and money. What he doesn’t have is pizzazz.
Biden gave a solid foreign-policy speech Thursday that was a reminder of what “normal” sounds like. His call for American leadership in the world was a reminder of how much damage Trump has done in abdicating that role.
Democrats should wake up: Like it or not, Trump is on something of a roll. Twenty candidates bickering onstage looks worryingly like a recipe for four more years.
Hillary Clinton thought Trump would beat himself, but she was wrong. The Democrat who can win in 2020 will be the one who presents a reassuring contrast to this loud but chronically insecure president. The polls say Trump is beatable, but it will take a strong, sensible campaign that can pull voters in the middle, where this race will be won or lost.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's emotions must have spiked big time when he sneaked a peek at a news screen during the G-20 summit in Osaka -- and discovered his new all-time favorite reality TV moment.
Shockingly, Trump loved it even though he didn't see his own face anywhere on the screen. What he saw was that the Democratic presidential hopefuls had just given him a gift -- in the form of a freeze-frame photo that's guaranteed to keep on giving. You'll see it many times more in social media shares, video punditry and even old-fashioned TV campaign ads.
So, reaching for his smartphone, Trump tweeted his joy to the world:
"All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare. How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That's the end of that race!"
Basically, Trump is right. Of course this isn't actually the end of the race. But Trump knows the people who are his base. They are about one-third of U.S. voters, blue-collar workers who once voted Democratic but in 2016 made him what he is today. And they'll be furious to hear that, while they are paying for their family's health care insurance, Democrats want immigrants who broke our laws to get free health care.
Now, as 20-plus Democratic candidates -- and another set of TV journalist questioners -- are prepping for a second round of debates later this month, July 30 and 31, it's time for somebody to try to help them figure out how to sharpen their respective crafts. Here goes:
First, some thoughts for the interrogators (they'll be from CNN this time): As MSNBC's panels showed us last month, we get nowhere when questioners dish out tabloidy, made-for-TV photo-op questions that ask presidential candidates to perform like obedient preschoolers. As in: Please raise your hands or how many of you ....
This becomes especially obvious when the questioner's topic is complex and requires thoughtful consideration, not just campaign debate combat. Such as: How can we improve and safeguard our health care insurance?
Panelists need to ask questions that will permit each candidate not just to raise a hand but to raise a new solution, or discuss the plus-and-minus trade-offs of old alternatives. On the difficult topic of health care treatment for immigrants in the U.S. illegally, instead of that glib, show-of-hands approach, why not ask candidates: What happens now when an uninsured immigrant in the United States without legal status becomes sick -- say, has a heart attack? And what should our future policy be?
Immigrants in the country illegally presently cannot obtain coverage under Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act), Medicare or Medicaid (in most states). So when they get sick, they go to hospital emergency rooms, where they must receive treatment -- because doctors cannot tell them to go out, sit on the curb and die.
So we all end up paying the bill -- and that's by far the most expensive form of treatment. (The Pew Research Center estimates that of 10.5 million immigrants in America illegally, as many as 6 million lack health insurance. Ka-ching!)
Hopefully, one presidential candidate may know how things are really done now: Six states and Washington, D.C., allow Medicaid to cover immigrants under age 18 residing there illegally (California just raised the age to 25) and 16 states cover low-income pregnant women, regardless of their immigration status.
While Trump has called for "American Citizens first!" it is uncertain whether he knows that under his presidency, there are 1,400 federally funded health care centers in 11,000 urban, suburban and rural communities in all 50 states where people can get treatment, even if they are are in the country illegally and destitute.
Hmmm, I also wonder if the lefties and most devout democratic socialists know that Scandinavia's socialist countries maintain tough restrictions on treating immigrants who entered illegally.
And while we are looking at all the failings we see on our TV screens, let me add one more. The only reason I know all this is that I just read most of it in a terrifically well-researched piece by The New York Times' Jan Hoffman.
But it wasn't a well-circulated story, and you might not have seen it.
Maybe we'll all learn together when the Democrats debate next.
Let me see a show of hands: How many of you would like to hear your presidential hopefuls really discuss what they will do to safeguard your health care?

Texto completo: Feisty Bay Area-bred film critic Pauline Kael is among the subjects profiled in the 39th San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, a slate of some four dozen movies from around the world opening this week in The City and continuing in the East Bay, Palo Alto and San Rafael.
Making its local debut is "What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael," a documentary about the writer who was raised in the Bay Area and known for her no-holds-barred, captivating movie reviews at The New Yorker that reverberated on an international scale.
Kael was born on a chicken farm in Petaluma to a Jewish immigrant family from Poland (June 19 would have been her 100th birthday), but moved to San Francisco at age 8 when her parents lost their farm (later becoming grocers). She attended UC Berkeley, where she studied art, literature and philosophy until 1940.
"Most of her youth was as a member of a blue-collar family, and that outlook definitely affected the way she wrote and her taste," says Rob Garver, who directed, wrote and produced "What She Said," which screens at 4 p.m. July 20 in Palo Alto, noon July 28 in San Francisco and 4 p.m. Aug. 4 in Oakland. "You can see that in her writing, that she appreciates the stories that are honest about working-class people and people overcoming challenges."
A single mother in the 1950s, Kael was writing books and reviewing films for magazines such as City Lights, for the Berkeley Cinema Guild, and on the Berkeley radio station KPFA, where her pithy critiques gained a significant following. With the Bay Area a hotbed for independent, alternative thinking, many of the era's intellectuals found a hospitable environment at Kael's home, where she invited them for screenings and exchange of ideas.
"When she became a critic and interested in movies, she felt she was fighting against the East Coast establishment," Garver says. "She was in San Francisco, which was a much smaller market then, and you can see in her first books her railing against Bosley Crowther, who was the most respected film critic at The New York Times. She had an opinion different from his, and it was wasn't just with him, it was with a lot of other critics. She battled them."
In 1968, The New Yorker hired Kael as a film critic, a post she would remain at almost continuously until 1991. (Kael died in 2001.) Throughout that period, her combative, highly readable style reached and entertained an immense audience, even as her punchy reviews left her unpopular with the directors, actors and writers whose movies she unabashedly skewered, stimulating what she called a "conversation" she thrived on.
"She loved the friction and received a lot of blowback from directors and actors and was afraid to go out alone, often bringing a male companion with her because she would run into somebody who was upset with something she wrote," Garver says. "Kael said if people like you, you're not doing your job, and she realized her job was to be a critic, be honest and find flaws in a work if they were there; it was completely subjective and that was her approach."

The Sunshine State should be a leader in solar power

Texto completo: A Times editorial

The Sunshine State? Not for solar energy. Florida lawmakers have blocked those efforts for years, protecting the investor-owned utilities at consumers expense. No wonder voters are taking the petition route to try to change the Florida Constitution and deregulate the electric power industry in a way that could make solar more accessible and affordable. Changing the constitution is not the best way to create a smarter statewide energy policy. But the movement reflects the publics frustration with having such an abundant resource so out of reach.

Floridas failure to realize its solar potential was highlighted again in a report last week by the New York Times, which chronicled the nagging barriers consumers still face in tapping this clean energy source. While the states investor-owned utilities have been expanding their own production of solar, the newspaper reported, Florida is still one of only a handful of states that prohibit the sale of solar electricity directly to consumers unless the provider is a utility. And many factors restraining the market continue to hold back consumers, from a state rule requiring expensive insurance policies for home solar arrays to practices by the utilities aimed at frustrating solar customers.

Ive had electric utility executives say with a straight face that we cant have solar power in Florida because we have so many cloudy days, Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, told the paper.

While Florida leads the nation when it comes to the expansion of the utilities own solar arrays, the Times reported, solar still accounted for only 1 percent of electricity generation in Florida last year, far less than its double-digit share in California and several northeast states. Floridas utilities have spent tens of millions of dollars in recent years on political spending aimed at blocking any loosening of their grip on the market. As the Times reported, Florida utilities make money at virtually every turn  producing power, transmitting and selling it  and they have a vested interest in preserving the status quo. Thats another reason why Florida lawmakers have frustrated efforts across a broader front to expand the use of renewable energy sources.

State regulators opened a window last year by determining that one of the countrys largest residential solar companies, San Francisco-based Sunrun, was allowed to lease solar energy equipment for homes in Florida. The company charges a fixed amount for the equipment, which is leased for 20 years. Advocates hailed the move as a step toward breaking down the up-front cost of solar, making it more affordable for many families to realize long-term savings. Across the state, communities have launched dozens of solar co-ops, enabling homeowners to receive discounted pricing when they hire installers by using their bulk purchasing power. A third opened in Hills-borough County in April.

Consumer advocates are pushing a constitutional amendment proposed for the 2020 ballot that would allow Floridians to pick their electricity providers from a competitive market or give them more options to produce solar energy themselves. As of Wednesday, the proposal had almost 340,000 signatures of the 766,200 it needs to make the ballot. The ballot language still must be approved by the Florida Supreme Court, with oral arguments scheduled for Aug. 28.

Policy choices are best left to the political arena. But the constitutional amendment effort shows hundreds of thousands of Floridians want more energy choices. Solar is a natural, promising resource for Florida that should shape the states energy future.

ICE raids: Southern California not seeing stepped up enforcement

Texto completo: Jose Rodriguez stocked his food cart with fewer fresh fruit cups Sunday, figuring many in Santa Ana’s Latino community might stay home for fear of much-touted immigration raids.
But his sales were brisk.
Immigration arrests were not.
“I wasn’t expecting any crowds,” said Rodriguez, who has worked his cart at the same corner for 26 years, selling fresh fruits, cold drinks and Mexican treats. “There’s been so much fear in the community.”
That fear, for a day at least, seemed to be unfounded.
Immigration rights advocates from around the region said Sunday they hadn’t heard of any large operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. And while some arrests occurred in Los Angeles, Riverside and Lake Elsinore over the past few days, it’s unclear if those were related to the announced sweeps or part of typical ICE work.
President Trump this month announced, initially on Twitter, that on Sunday, July 14, ICE agents would pick up some 2,000 immigrants around the country who are living in the United States illegally and have deportation orders.
He’d made a similar claim in June, saying “millions” of people would be removed from the country. The June raids never happened.
The plan slated for Sunday would focus on criminals and recent arrivals from Central America. They could also include “collateral” arrests of people who happen to be in the area of the intended targets, according to news reports.
The publicized sweeps were supposed to take place in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Miami, New York and San Francisco. Two other cities originally on the list, Houston and New Orleans, were reportedly postponed because of tropical storm Barry.
It’s possible the raids were only delayed, not abandoned.
Instead of a large, simultaneous sweep, immigration officials created a secondary plan for a smaller and more diffuse scale of apprehensions to roll out over roughly a week, the New York Times reported Sunday. Individual ICE field offices were given the discretion to decide when to begin those sweeps.
Immigration officials have declined to say what their plans are, saying it could threaten the safety of agents and jeopardize their operation.
In Southern California, immigration arrests, they pointed out, are made every day.
“This is what we are. We are a law enforcement agency,” Lori Haley, an ICE spokeswoman based in Orange County, said Friday.
Many immigrant-rights advocates said they were not surprised by the low-key rollout of the so-called sweeps.
“I think they’ll do their usual ops today. They want that element of surprise,” said Jennaya Dunlap, deportation defense coordinator for the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.
Even through 2,000 arrests or so – spread across Los Angeles and the other cities – are not necessarily unusual for ICE raids, the president’s words and the media’s coverage of his plan have created considerable anxiety, advocates said.
“It’s not about the numbers. It’s about the fear,” said Guillermo Torres, who spearheads the immigration campaigns of the Los Angeles-based Clergy & Laity United for Economic Justice.
“Words are powerful and they impact families. And that’s what this president has done, for political purposes, because he’s running for re-election,” Torres said.
In downtown Santa Ana, the number of visitors appeared typical. Some said business was a little slow, but most said it was about the same.
In other heavy Latino locations, some residents were reportedly keeping a low profile.
“We were in Lake Elsinore yesterday (Saturday, July 12,) and the stores were empty. People were telling us they don’t come out until evening,” said immigration rights advocate Dunlap.
“That’s the kind of fear people are living” with, she added.
On Sunday, Dunlap was at a swap meet in Winchester, a small town close to Hemet in Riverside County. Normally, the swap meet would be very crowded – but not this Sunday.
“We’ve come here before and given out a couple of thousand hotline cards,” Dunlap said. “But I’m standing here and literally no one is walking past.”
Another swap market that had much lower attendance Sunday was one outside Cypress College, said Anaheim resident Dariana Diaz, whose father has a stand. “People are scared of the raids.”
In Indio, Coachella and Moreno Valley, advocates noted that local supermarkets frequented by Latino customers had considerably fewer shoppers on Sunday, according to Luz Gallegos, community programs director for the Training Occupational Development Educating Communities (TODEC) Legal Center.
Yet, at least 160 people turned out Sunday for information forums in Perris, Coachella and Victorville, she said. A few attendees had deportation orders.
“People were very interested in identifying the official documents and understanding the difference between an ICE warrant and a search and seizure warrant signed by U.S. magistrate judge,” Gallegos said.
In recent weeks, starting after Trump initially tweeted about deportations, local groups have held numerous seminars, sometimes called “know your rights” forums, telling immigrants how to handle potential contact with ICE officials and how to prepare their families, legally, in case adults are removed from the country without their children.

Texto completo: Why, some say, the moon?
-- John F. Kennedy, 1962
Always, it was metaphor, emblem
of our seeking. So why not land
on the Sea of Tranquillity? In 1969
we are a nation at war, even
with ourselves. In photographs
from the launch, you can see
so many ways of seeing, altering
our vision: binoculars, cameras,
sunglasses, a boy with a telescope,
everyone shoulder to shoulder,
gazes upturned to the sky--
the moment's grand myopia.
There is no strife, Kennedy said, no
prejudice, no national conflict
in outer space as yet. As yet. Even
the photographs seem to show
a nation united, the old divisions
nearly gone from view. How easy it is
to overlook what's there, to forget
what is not. Even today, they show us
ourselves: as in the image of a man
and woman on a motorcycle, backs to us,
their faces in the side-view mirror--
how, even looking ahead, we carry
a vision of what's behind us. See it
in the photograph's middle ground:
a man raises his arm, directs my gaze
to the periphery just coming into focus.
There, nearly out of the frame, another man
lifts his symbol for the day, as if to carry it
into our future: the Confederate flag
brandished in the electric air.
That summer
I am 3, and I am old enough to know
the word nigger; I hear it again and again--
sometimes joined with lover--most places
we go: the grocery store, the movie theater,
whispered in a restaurant on the beach.
In 1969, we are only two years since Loving
v. Virginia struck down the laws against us,
my parents' marriage; only a year since
my white father fought in a bar when
other servicemen cheered at the news
King had been shot. I can tell you this:
I don't remember the moon landing,
but maybe it was a day without the word,
a day we went downtown without armor
and my dark-skinned grandmother
tried on hats at the department store.
The day after, the headlines blared unity.
A generous thought, my father once said,
is the idea of justice taking root.
She is farther from us now than then,
our moon, symbol of our seeking,
once seemingly unattainable--that
Sea of Tranquillity--toward which
we set our course, then reached.

Texto completo: These should be the best of times for working people.
After all, the unemployment rate is just 3.7 percent, near its lowest level in almost 50 years. If that were our only guide, then we might conclude that virtually every adult in the United States who wants to work is either doing so or is diligently looking for a job.
The problem is that the unemployment rate, which is publicly updated by the Labor Department on the first Friday of every month, is an insufficient statistic, despite all the attention it gets. Sure, it tabulates the number of men and women who are actively job-hunting. But it leaves out the growing numbers who have stopped actively looking.
In the federal government's scheme of things, those who stop looking for work aren't listed as unemployed. The Labor Department has a broader monthly statistic that accounts for the dropouts, but it doesn't get equal billing with the unemployment rate. It is called the labor force participation rate, and if it received the attention that it deserves, then the June job numbers, published and broadcast in early July, would have been stripped of some of the glow they seemed to have.
A more complete approach -- and, under current conditions, a more accurate one -- would give equal billing to both statistics: The unemployment rate was only 3.7 percent in June, near its lowest level since 1969, as tens of thousands of people gave up actively looking for another job. But in doing so, the dropouts meant the labor force participation rate was stuck at 62.9 percent, near its lowest level since 1977.
Most accounts of the June job numbers didn't use that double-barreled, and sobering, approach to reporting the figures. Yet a falling participation rate suggests a growing accumulation of men and women who are neither working nor unemployed, but rather disengaged.
For example, if 300 people look for work -- thus participating in the labor force -- and 290 find jobs, then the unemployment rate is just 3 percent (10 divided by 300). Going a step further, let's posit that an additional 300 people would like jobs but aren't actively hunting, or so they tell government pollsters conducting the monthly household survey on which the employment figures are based.
The failure to actively seek a job bars the 300 from being listed as unemployed, as the Labor Department has traditionally defined the concept. They are in a different category -- let's call it the passively unemployed -- and their existence is often played down, when it is mentioned at all.
But that distorts reality. If the passively unemployed were added to the standard rolls of the unemployed in this example, then the official unemployment rate would be a much higher 48 percent (290 divided by 600). Increase the denominator and, presto, the unemployment rate is worse.
President Trump is not likely to authorize a change that would increase the unemployment rate on his watch simply by altering the rules the Labor Department uses. No president would, or has. But journalists could give equal billing each month to the currently low unemployment rate (the good news) and the low participation rate (the bad news).
A more accurate statistical picture would emerge of all those who wanted jobs even though only some of them were actively looking. A low participation rate -- the current situation -- is a serious matter. It undermines the production of goods and services in the United States, and may also signal deeper issues.
"You run into the problem of losing economic output when people drop out of work," said Richard B. Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard and at the National Bureau of Economic Research. "If you are not in school and not in work or actively searching for a job, you are not involved in society, and you are more likely to engage in antisocial activities."
With the appropriate focus on both the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate, Americans would be fully aware that while nearly everyone who has actively sought a job recently has one, an awful lot of people aren't bothering to look at all. Perhaps a spouse is earning enough, or the wages on offer for available jobs are too low, or the commute to an acceptable job is too long, or child-care is too expensive or the working conditions are too difficult.
The decline in the labor force participation rate stems partly from demographic change: Older people typically don't participate in the work force to the degree that younger people do, and the American population has been aging. Several economists, including Jason Furman, the former chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, make this point.
But whatever the reason, many people who once yearned for work now no longer openly do so, much less seek paid employment.
Many of the dropouts in recent years have been women. Since April 2000, the participation rate among women has fallen 3.2 percentage points, to 57.1 percent from 60.3 percent. That is the largest decline since women started entering the labor force in large numbers in the 1960s. Men, in contrast, have been dropping out gradually since the 1960s, although the decline accelerated slightly a decade ago.
We don't entirely know why this has been happening for either gender, but the failure to highlight both the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate in reporting on the monthly employment figures contributes to a failure to fully recognize and explore a source of discontent in the country.
That has been a gift to Mr. Trump, who has given himself and his administration credit for the 3.7 percent unemployment rate while failing to note that it would have been noticeably higher if more people who wanted jobs had actively looked for paid employment, thus "participating" in the economy.
But he isn't the first president to pat himself on the back for a low unemployment rate while failing to spotlight the swollen corps of non-participants. Most recently, President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama also tolerated the practice, although the labor force participation rate fell quite noticeably during their administrations.
From a politician's point of view, it's desirable to sidestep bad news. But journalists don't need to accept the practice. We've been following the government's lead, headlining the latest unemployment rate and consigning the participation rate to a later paragraph or ignoring it altogether, as if it didn't much matter. It does.

Unlikely Pilgrim is one convert's incredible journey

Texto completo: Ninety years ago, Evelyn Waugh wrote a travel book called Remote People. You couldn’t do that today. Those remote people are now your Facebook friends. But Al Regnery has found a way to write a travel book about remote places that will never be mentioned in the New York Times travel section. That’s because he visited ancient Christian sites in Europe and the Middle East and wrote about them in a wonderful new book, Unlikely Pilgrim (Beaufort Books, 2019).
Some of the places he visited will be generally familiar to us, but even there, he takes us to places the guidebooks will have missed — the small abbey in France, the forgotten church in Romania. Some places, like pre-Sept. 11 Syria, are still more foreign still and tragically will never be seen again.
It’s also a hiker’s book, about what it’s like to walk 25 miles a day with a pack on your back, dealing with shin splints and not knowing where you’ll sleep that evening. Sometimes, it would be in a humble pension, where you’d get the equivalent of a four-star dinner; sometimes it would be an outpost of the Empire, like the Baron Hotel in Aleppo, where T.E. Lawrence and Churchill stayed and where Agatha Christie wrote Murder on the Orient Express.
One of the book’s most fascinating chapters deals with his visit to Syria in early 2001. Today, it’s a dangerously forbidden country, wrecked by a civil war that is about to be concluded with the victory of Bashar Assad. A murderous thug, as seemingly one has to be to stay on top in that part of the world, Assad is nevertheless to be preferred to some of the alternatives. He is a member of the minority Alawite sect of Islam and formed alliances with other minority groups, especially the Christians.
In 2001, nearly a quarter of Syria’s 10 million people were Christians. The country had been Christian since the first century, back when my ancestors were living in trees and eating their young. There were vibrant churches and monasteries, and places like Straight Street in Damascus, where the apostle Paul was let down from the wall in a basket. There were even villages that still spoke Aramaic, Christ’s language. The people were friendly, whatever their religion, and were happy to talk to a visiting American.
It wasn’t all roses. Regnery describes a visit to Homs, the scene of a 2011 opposition uprising and a 2014 pro-Assad victory. He stayed at a fifth-floor walk-up hotel, at $6 a night. The Arab toilets were free, and the Western toilet was an extra 50 cents — “the best fifty cents I spent on the entire trip.”
What happened since then is a historical tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians were killed, Christian sites were destroyed by ISIS, and millions of people became refugees. It took 4,000 years to build Aleppo, writes Regnery, and only four to destroy it. Today, there are about a million Christians in Syria. In 2001, there were 2.5 million of them.
Regnery’s travels in Slavic countries invite a comparison to Patrick Leigh-Fermor’s account of his walk from Holland to Constantinople, far-away countries of which we know little. The author visited the forgotten places that held Christian artistic treasures, like the painted monastery in Romania’s Voronet. Built in 1488, its walls and interiors are covered with hundreds of frescoes, and it’s called the Sistine Chapel of the East. I had never heard of it and, fascinating though they were, virtually every place Regnery visited was new to me.
The book’s title might seem odd. Unlikely Pilgrim, it’s called. Pilgrim I get, but unlikely? Yet, there aren’t many well-known political figures like Regnery whose religion would draw them to eleven different pilgrimages over the last 20 years, or who have the stamina to do so, for that matter.
What drew the author to the obscure churches and monasteries he visited was a growing Christian faith, and during his travels, he converted to Catholicism. The book describes a spiritual odyssey, as well as an account of visits to remote places, that takes it out of the realm of ordinary travel books, and makes it a classic that deserves to be long remembered.

Immigrants wait anxiously as ICE raids delayed

Texto completo: Parks and other gathering areas in the immigrant enclaves of East Boston were desolate Sunday, Patricia Montes observed, as many braced for federal immigration raids that were largely delayed after news reports tipped off immigrant communities about what to expect.
“We hope nothing is going to happen," said Montes, executive director of the immigrant rights group Centro Presente. “We know some members are at home because of the raids and are even afraid to go to church."
ICE had announced that it would target 2,000 undocumented immigrants in 10 major cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco.
The plan to fan out in unison across immigrant communities Sunday morning was changed at the last minute because of widespread publicity, according to several current and former Department of Homeland Security officials.
Montes said the raids help keep President Trump's supporters angry about immigration and that discussing racially charged topics is better for the president's political strategy than talking about topics like the economy or infrastructure issues.
Although Boston was left off the list of cities, and only a handful of arrests appeared to happen Sunday, many immigrants nationwide and in Boston remain on edge, advocates said.
Montes said an undocumented East Boston mother of three was so scared of the announced raids that she almost didn't go out to buy medicine for her sick 1-year-old child. The woman, a member of Centro Presente, already has a deportation notice, and one of her children recently was temporarily held in a detention center, Montes said.
Diego Low, director of the Metrowest Worker Center, said he received many calls over the three days leading up to Sunday and was asked about what the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity meant and how they should deal with the ramped-up campaign.
“People interpreting what I describe as the usual level of ICE activity as part of the raids is . . . a reflection of the fact that there was a public announcement of the raids," Low said.
“[Immigration arrests are] a regular drip, drip, drip, so if they're doing exactly what they say they're doing, I wonder how much of a spike in detentions 2,000 actually is," he added. “Not that I want them to — not that I'm challenging to spike it — but I just think maybe the point is something else."
Low added that even arrests last Tuesday were interpreted as part of the raids, although deportations have been a regular occurrence for years.
What is different this time is that the most recently announced raids are targeting children as well as parents, while previous raids targeted undocumented adults. Even so, in most such ICE operations in the past, only 20 percent to 30 percent of the targets were apprehended.
“During Obama, the overwhelming majority of enforcement actions targeted criminal aliens," said John Cohen, former acting undersecretary at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. “This operation apparently specifically targets families who for the most part present no risk."
Cohen said the raids were impractical and not likely to improve the situation at the border — where holding facilities have been overrun recently, and as a result, migrants have been living in substandard and sometimes unhealthy conditions.
As the Trump administration continues aggressively pursuing undocumented immigrants, advocates are informing them of their rights and offering support where they can.
“We let people know that if they have problems and hear something, they have cellphones and can send us messages at any moment; they all know what to do if something happens," Montes said. “We're just waiting for our members."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s opponents accused him of xenophobia and racism Sunday after he posted tweets calling on an unspecified group of Democratic congresswomen to “go back and help fix” the countries he said they “originally came” from before trying to make legislative changes in the USA.
"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run.
"Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can’t leave fast enough. I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!" the president said in three connected tweets.
Who are the tweets about?
Four liberal freshman congresswomen known as “the Squad” – Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib – presumed Trump's tweets were directed at them. Three of them were born in the USA; Omar came as a refugee from Somalia more than 20 years ago and has been an American citizen since 2000.
"Mr. President, As Members of Congress, the only country we swear an oath to is the United States. Which is why we are fighting to protect it from the worst, most corrupt and inept president we have ever seen," Omar replied to Trump's tweet.
"Mr. President, the country I 'come from' & the country we all swear to, is the United States. But given how you’ve destroyed our border with inhumane camps, all at a benefit to you & the corps who profit off them, you are absolutely right about the corruption laid at your feet," Ocasio-Cortez said.
"Yo @realDonaldTrump, I am fighting corruption in OUR country," Tlaib said in a tweet. "I do it every day when I hold your admin accountable as a U. S. Congresswoman. Detroit taught me how to fight for the communities you continue to degrade & attack. Keep talking, you’ll be out of the WH soon. "
"THIS is what racism looks like. WE are what democracy looks like," Pressley said.
Hours later, Trump renewed his criticism without mentioning names, again. He referenced Omar's controversial comments on Israel and their disagreements with House Speaker Nancy Pelos. Without proof, Trump also accused Democrats of speaking negatively about the country.
"If the Democrat Party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior, then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020!" Trump tweeted.
The four House members have had some public squabbles with Pelosi, for her support for a bill funding border security measures and comments Pelosi made about their disagreements in a New York Times column.
The Democratic infighting was the subject of a "Fox & Friends" segment Sunday that mentioned the four congresswomen by name, which ran shortly before Trump posted his tweets.
Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley have been frequent targets by conservative media figures.
Since taking office in January, Omar sparked anger with her rhetoric criticizing the Trump administration and U. S. foreign policy – both past and present. Her remarks about Israel and the influence of the pro-Israeli lobby were condemned as anti-Semitic by both Republicans and Democrats.
Last week, Fox News host Tucker Carlson called Omar "living proof that the way we practice immigration has become dangerous to this country. "
Carlson accused her of not being "grateful" for being welcomed into the USA and instead having "undisguised contempt for the United States and for its people. "
"I believe as an immigrant, I probably love this country more than anyone that is naturally born," Omar said at a Netroots Nation event Saturday.
Omar said it is because she is "ashamed" that the United States continues to "live in its hypocrisy" that she fights to make it live up to its ideals.
Reaction to Trump's tweets
Pelosi said Sunday that she rejects Trump's "xenophobic comments meant to divide our nation" and said they reaffirm that "his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again. "
"Our diversity is our strength, and our unity is our power," she said.
"Let’s be clear about what this vile comment is: A racist and xenophobic attack on Democratic congresswomen," tweeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , one of two dozen Democrats running to unseat Trump in 2020
"This *is* their country, regardless of whether or not Trump realizes it. They should be treated with respect. As president, I’ll make sure of it," Warren said.
"Unfortunately, there is an American tradition of telling people to go back where they came from," said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, another presidential hopeful, during an interview on CNN's "State of the Union. "
The New York mayor tied Trump's tweets to the deportation raids by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency expected to begin this weekend, saying, "It is all one political strategy, to keep people divided to the maximum extent possible" and "gin up his base. "
Pelosi also tried to connect the tweets and Trump's immigration policies.

"Rather than attack Members of Congress, he should work with us for humane immigration policy that reflects American values. Stop the raids – #FamiliesBelongTogether!" she tweeted.
"Trump’s latest racist tweets echo the bigoted shouts of 'go back where you came from' heard daily by American Muslim women and children, immigrants and members of other minority communities across our nation," said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "If Trump shouted the same thing at a Muslim woman wearing hijab in a Walmart, he might be arrested. "
"That's a racist tweet," said Rep. Ben Ray Luján, D-N. M. , when he was informed of the president's post during an interview on "Fox News Sunday. "
"Telling people to go back where they came from? These are American citizens elected by voters in the United States of America to serve in one of the most distinguished bodies in the U. S. House of Representatives," Luján said
Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa. , said he has a great deal in common with Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley and Tlaib but noted that he had not been similarly attacked by the president. Boyle, a white male, implied that race or gender might explain the different treatment: "Like some of my Democratic colleagues, I’m young, from an immigrant family, also very critical of Trump. Funny thing though, he never tells me to 'go back where I come from. ' Hmm I wonder why?"

Politico reporter Alex Thompson shared a clip of the hosts on "Fox & Friends" laughing in response to Trump tweets, saying Trump was feeling "very comedic today. "
Ryan Saavedra, a reporter for the conservative Daily Wire, assumed Trump was referring to Omar and was amused by the president's tweet.
"LOL, Trump is telling Ilhan Omar to go back to Somalia," Saavedra said.
Other voices on social media did not find humor in the president's tweets.

Texto completo: When Ariel first splashed onto movie theater screens nationwide nearly 30 years ago, the heroine of Disney's animated film "The Little Mermaid" had a distinctive look. Enormous blue eyes dominated a porcelain-skinned face framed by a luxurious mane of bright red hair. Her only article of clothing was a purple bra top made of seashells, and instead of legs, she sported a light green fish tail.
But in the studio's new live-action remake of the 1989 movie, the rebellious undersea princess will depart from her classic appearance.
Last week, Disney announced that Halle Bailey, a black actress and R&B singer, will play Ariel in the upcoming film, which is slated to begin production in early 2020. The 19-year-old's casting marks the first time Disney has selected a woman of color to play a traditionally white princess in one of its live-action adaptations, NBC News reported.
The news was met with a flood of praise from celebrities including Mariah Carey, Halle Berry and Chrissy Teigen, and many fans. However, it also prompted protests from some who were upset by the deviation from the animated character's image, launching hashtags such as #NotMyAriel and #NotMyMermaid.
While the studio has yet to respond to the smattering of backlash over casting Bailey, Freeform, a Disney-owned TV network, issued a scathing statement on Sunday defending the decision. The actress, who is also half of the R&B duo Chloe X Halle, stars on the network's series "Grown-ish."
In an Instagram post titled, "An open letter to the Poor, Unfortunate Souls," Freeform wrote that while Hans Christian Andersen, the original author of the fairy tale, was Danish, "Ariel ... is a mermaid" and a fictional character.
And even if Ariel is Danish, the network wrote, "Danish mermaids can be black because Danish *people* can be black," adding, "Black Danish people, and thus mer-folk, can also genetically (!!!) have red hair."
The fiery post continued: "So after all this is said and done, and you still cannot get past the idea that choosing the incredible, sensational, highly-talented, gorgeous Halle Bailey is anything other than the INSPIRED casting that it is because she 'doesn't look like the cartoon one', oh boy, do I have some news for you ... about you."
The debate over a black Ariel is the latest example of how attempts to diversify cultural icons can be polarizing. In 2016, "Saturday Night Live" comedian Leslie Jones weathered racist and sexist online attacks after the release of the all-female "Ghostbusters" reboot. As The Washington Post's Abby Ohlheiser reported, the abuse led to Jones taking a temporary break from Twitter, just days after her movie hit theaters. Last year, Kelly Marie Tran, the first Asian American actress to have a leading role in a "Star Wars" movie, deleted all her Instagram posts after facing a relentless online bullying campaign following her appearance in "Star Wars: The Last Jedi."
"Their words seemed to confirm what growing up as a woman and a person of color already taught me: that I belonged in margins and spaces, valid only as a minor character in their lives and stories," Tran wrote in an August 2018 New York Times op-ed.
The decision to cast Bailey as Ariel was the result of an "extensive search," the film's director, Rob Marshall, said in a statement to NBC News.
"(I)t was abundantly clear that Halle possesses that rare combination of spirit, heart, youth, innocence, and substance - plus a glorious singing voice - all intrinsic qualities necessary to play this iconic role," Marshall said.
On Wednesday, Bailey wrote on Twitter and Instagram that the casting was a "dream come true," sharing an edited image of Ariel that showed her with dark skin, brown eyes and black hair.
The outpouring of congratulations from fellow celebrities and fans was instant.
"My kids and I are so excited for the emancipation of Ariel," tweeted Carey, the Grammy Award-winning singer.
"(Can't) wait to surround my future daughter with powerful iconic women like you Halle, I'm so proud of you," another person tweeted.
The casting also received support from Jodi Benson, who voiced Ariel in the original animated film. When asked about a woman of color playing Ariel during an event in Florida over the weekend, Benson said Disney wants "to communicate with all of us in the audience so that we can fall in love with the film again."
"The spirit of a character is what really matters," she said. "What you bring to the table in a character as far as their heart and their spirit is what really counts."
Benson added: "The most important thing for a film is to be able to tell a story. We need to be storytellers, no matter what we look like on the outside."
Whether Bailey embodies the spirit of the headstrong teenage mermaid, however, appeared to not matter to critics, who instead fixated on the animated character's physical look.
"You are the worst choice that Disney has ever made," one person tweeted, using the hashtag #NotMyAriel.
"You will never be Ariel," another person tweeted.
Though Bailey's supporters hit back at detractors, calling them "racists," several people said their dissatisfaction had more to do with what one user described as "wanting an accurate representation of Ariel's character."
"(L)eave the classics ALONE, if everyone wants princesses from different ethnicities and colors etc, make new tales," the person tweeted.
In a lengthy statement, another person compared "The Little Mermaid" casting to Disney's approach for this year's live-action remake of "The Lion King."
"It was a HUGE issue that the lion king had to have an African cast right?" the person wrote. "Well it's a HUGE issue that Ariel isn't an accurate ginger."
In response, several people likened Bailey's casting to singer Brandy portraying the role of Cinderella in the 1997 TV film that also starred Whitney Houston as the Fairy Godmother.
Some argued that because Ariel is a fictional character, unlike Pocahontas and Mulan, who have historical roots, her ethnicity isn't central to the story.
Meanwhile, others mocked the outrage.
"I'm offended by the casting of a woman of colour as Ariel," a person tweeted. "They should have used an ACTUAL, real mermaid. Sick and tired of this human privilege."
But amid the heated social media war, at least one person appeared to suggest that the #NotMyAriel camp had a point.
"You're right, she's not your Ariel," the person tweeted. "Because it's someone else's turn to see themselves in The Little Mermaid. You've had yours."

Texto completo: What is the Florida Climate Reporting Network? Julie Anderson, editor-in-chief of the Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel, helps supply answers on CNN's "Reliable Sources" and its podcast.
The network, which debuted in June, is a collaboration among the Sentinel, Sun Sentinel, Tampa Bay Times, The Miami Herald, The Palm Beach Post and WLRN Public Media, which is based in South Florida.
"Reliable Sources" airs at 11 a.m. Sunday.
"We're trying to pull together as many resources as we can to do dedicated reporting on the climate crisis in Florida," Anderson tells Brian Stelter on the podcast. "We felt like none of us could do the job alone, but we thought we could do a pretty good job if we pulled our resources together, or at least amplified our voices together."
She is featured with Mark Katches, executive editor of the Tampa Bay Times, and Alex Harris, climate change reporter for The Miami Herald.
"People say we're ground zero down here. We should kind of act like it, right?" Harris tells Stelter.
Katches says the network is "a way to harness the power of great reporting firepower in the state to create something special." He described the network as a "story sharing arrangement."
Anderson explains the network's approach. "We're reporters, we're editors and we are reporting on the situation, but we're not an advocacy group," she said.
The podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, TuneIn and Stitcher.
"Reliable Sources" on CNN this weekend also features a panel on President Donald Trump's meeting with social media provocateurs. The panelists are Jane Coaston, senior politics reporter, Vox; Samantha Vinograd, CNN national security analyst; and Robby Soave, associate editor, Reason, and author of "Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump." Other guests are Renee DiResta, research manager, Stanford Internet Observatory; Oliver Darcy, senior media reporter, CNN; and Katie Rogers, White House correspondent, The New York Times. The Florida panel will be in the program's second half.

Increasing political partisanship; Exploring judicial appointments

Texto completo: Federal judges are supposed to be neutral decision-makers. But any pretense of neutrality has slipped away as the appointment process for Supreme Court justices and prominent lower-court judges has become mired in political partisanship.
President Donald Trump seems to expect his appointees to automatically side with him, just as he expects judges selected by President Barack Obama to be against him. His administration has allowed conservative advocates to play an outsize role in picking nominees. And the Senate, with its power to confirm or reject those choices, has sunk deeper into partisan score-settling.
Republicans and Democrats alike have contributed to today's hyper-politicized process. But nothing approaches the muscle that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell exerts. McConnell thwarted Obama's opportunity to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia in 2016 and, once Trump took office in 2017, began directing the swift approval of a record number of appeals court judges, as well as two Supreme Court justices.
In his new book, "Confirmation Bias," journalist Carl Hulse delves deeply into recent confirmation battles, describing the Senate's advice-and-consent power as "corrupted to what appears to be the point of no return."
The book is an absorbing, if dispiriting, look at the maneuverings of inside players like McConnell and Donald McGahn, Trump's first White House counsel, and outside advocates like Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, who appears to have steered judicial selection as much as anyone at the White House.
Hulse, a New York Times correspondent and Illinois native, probes moments of escalation over the years and the backroom machinations of the Trump strategy now transforming the courts and the law. Inevitably, he covers previously reported ground, but "Confirmation Bias" is an important guide at this crucial time for the stature of America's judiciary.
Chief Justice John Roberts, himself a Republican appointee, has lamented the current state of affairs. In November Roberts pushed back on Trump. Roberts issued a statement saying: "We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."
Yet individual judges have sometimes reinforced the notion that they are bent on favoring the president who appointed them. Of equal concern, the selection process appears patently designed to produce men and women who will do just that.
Tracing the origins of the Trump plan for the federal bench, Hulse recounts McGahn's early interaction with the candidate. They were introduced by David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United. Trump inscribed a copy of "The Art of the Deal" to McGahn's young son, Don III, writing, "You've got a great dad." McGahn then helped draw up Trump's spring 2016 list of possible Supreme Court nominees.
Once Trump became president, McConnell and McGahn formed an early partnership to place ideological soul mates on the bench. McGahn engineered the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. In 2018 he managed the resignation of Justice Anthony Kennedy and his replacement by Brett Kavanaugh.
Back in 2008, Kavanaugh, then an appeals court judge, swore in McGahn after his confirmation to the Federal Election Commission. "That guy's going to be on the Supreme Court someday," McGahn said privately. Nearly a decade later, in 2017, Hulse writes, McGahn confided to Trump strategist Steve Bannon his continued interest in Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court choice.
During the televised Kavanaugh confirmation hearings last year, McGahn coached the nominee on his response to Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegation. As Ford testified before senators, Hulse reveals, McGahn received "worried texts from his circle" and then urged Kavanaugh to respond aggressively: "He wanted to see the nominee push back, cut off his interrogators, and turn their questions back on them." Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegations dating back to their teen years in suburban Maryland, chalked them up to partisan critics and challenged senators about their drinking habits after they suggested that Kavanaugh drank to excess as a young man.
For decades, Republicans in Washington, dismayed at the judicial liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s, have made judicial appointments a higher priority than Democrats have. There have been exceptions, of course, when Democrats went on the offensive. In 1987 the Democratically controlled Senate rejected Robert Bork, and in 2013 Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid instigated a change in filibuster rules to win confirmation of stalled Obama nominations. A decade earlier, Reid helped block several nominees of President George W. Bush.
Yet Republicans such as McConnell have more recently been in control and ready to play hardball, partly as retribution. On Feb. 13, 2016, when Scalia died, McConnell received early word. When the death became public, McConnell was ready with his statement that an appointment to the seat should be saved for the next president, to be elected in November. On that same Feb. 13 McGahn called Trump to advise him on addressing the vacancy and offering names of possible successors.
Hulse writes of the ensuing angst among some on Obama's team that the president moved too slowly on a successor. Ron Klain, then chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, wanted the president to quickly name presumptive nominee Merrick Garland, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit. The well-regarded moderate's name had been kept in reserve for just such a moment.
Within a few days of Scalia's death, Hulse reports, Klain told White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough: "The president ought to go to the Rose Garden tomorrow and name Merrick Garland. Tomorrow. Not a month from now. Tomorrow. Every day that ticks by is a day that you are letting McConnell consolidate his position."
Obama announced the Garland choice a month later. Senators never held a hearing.

Texto completo: The sidewalks outside the Santa Fe Bridge filled with protesters chanting, "Free the children now," as they marched up El Paso Street toward Cleveland Square Park in Downtown on Friday.
Protester Yvonne Nieves said dehumanizing conditions that children faced in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility in Clint, Texas, led her to demonstrate.
"It seems like bringing attention to the situation helps, so that it stops," she said.
The demonstration was one of more than 700 planned around the world to protest the treatment of immigrants in detention centers, organizers said. Lights for Liberty planned the vigils with local organizers, including the El Paso Coalition to End Child Detention, the Border Network for Human Rights, the ACLU of Texas, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the Hope Border Institute.
Nieves said she first started protesting at the facility in Tornillo, Texas, adding she has become a more active protester since then because she believes it brings attention to the conditions in the detention centers.
Nieves said she has been attending candlelight vigils at the Clint facility on Monday nights and she noticed the attention the situation received when the El Paso Times and New York Times collaborated on a report about it.
Marisa Limón of the Hope Border Institute said reports on the Clint site sparked global concern over the immigration situation.
"That really signaled the alarm and, I think on a national level, kind of woke people up, and it's made people more conscious," she said. "So, in that consciousness, really, the public had asked, 'How can we respond? What can we do? How can we stand up?' "
After the march arrived at Cleveland Square Park, there were several speakers and a candlelight vigil for migrants in detention camps.
Dr. Nanette Nuessle, a pediatrician, traveled from Las Vegas, New Mexico, to attend the vigil. She said she has been trying to get a job working in one of the detention centers in San Antonio for about a year.
"It's like any other time you work with kids that you know aren't getting the right care — except for this time I can't call child services," Nuessle said. "Our hands are tied. We cannot get child services in there to make a report. They're being blocked from going in, just like the reporters are being blocked from going in."
She said she thinks the conditions children are being held in are appalling, including being inappropriately touched and abused, caring for other children, and being told they can't hug one another, as well as not being given blankets, clean diapers or medical clearance by physicians.
At the vigil, an accredited immigration representative from San Diego, California, Luis Guerra, took the stage to tell the story of a woman in detention.
He said after the judge decided she would spend one more month in detention at her final hearing, she screamed and said, "I want to be deported now."
Guerra said her story was similar to "the stories of thousands and thousands of individuals that have to endure government-sponsored torture to be able to win their asylum cases."
He said people shouldn't have to work so hard to get asylum, that it should be clear in the laws, but it's much different in practice.
'Asylum is like winning the lottery' "I usually explain this to individuals south of the border that asylum is like winning the lottery, and that is not right," Guerra said.
He said there has been a call for more resources in El Paso, and with the Migrant Protection Protocols, known as the "Remain in Mexico" policy, the number of people in need of help has skyrocketed.
"I come from an immigrant family, Mexican-American, and I acknowledge the privileges I had awarded to me and believe that I need to use those privileges to help other individuals that didn't have that opportunity," Guerra said. "I don't think that our country is going in the right direction and believe that we can do better."
Protester Melissa Teausant said she traveled from Seattle because she needed to see the migrant camps for herself.
She said that seeing the images on TV or online isn't enough: People need to go places and see things for themselves, so they can take action.
"Once you see it and then you turn your back on it, that's on you," she said. "That's for you to grapple with, your own moral compass and your own humanity at that point."

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES – A major supplier of body cameras to law-enforcement agencies across the country has decided to forgo selling facial-recognition technology with its products.
Axon, which supplies 48 police departments in major cities with body cameras, made the decision after the company's ethics board concluded the technology was not accurate enough to be implemented in the field and could potentially cause major trust issues between law-enforcement officials and their communities.
In a 42-page report, the ethics board detailed concerns with the inaccuracy of the software, saying results showed it was less accurate when identifying women, younger people, and "worsens when trying to identify people of color compared to white people, a troubling disparity that would only perpetuate or exacerbate the racial inequities that cut across the criminal justice system."
The board is composed of experts from different professions, including law enforcement, robotics and policy, and advises Axon on the potential effects its technology could have on society.
"Some police departments are sophisticated and would understand the limitations on (facial recognition) and would put their own guardrails in place around the use of that technology by their officers.
"But there are some police departments that would not take those same precautions and may not appreciate the implications of using a technology that's not ready yet for prime time," said board member Jim Bueermann, who was a police officer for more than 30 years and is now president of the National Police Foundation.
Axon CEO Rick Smith said the company is "moving cautiously" because of these implications.
"There are companies out there actively promoting using facial recognition on body cameras," Smith said. "From our perspective, we believe taking the time to do the ethical analysis up front in the product design process will have much better outcomes in the long haul."
Smith says the company might reconsider incorporating the technology in their products in the future once the inaccuracies are solved, but must balance that with privacy and safety and put in "safeguards" to avoid misuse of facial recognition.
"We don't believe that the right answer is that the police should deploy face recognition with no controls and go wild with it, but similarly we don't believe that it makes sense to say police should never use face-recognition technology because there's many cases where it's pretty universally known that it will be a good thing," Smith said.
Facial recognition has been a hot-button topic around the country as concerns about privacy and accuracy have made some cities skeptical of the technology, leading San Francisco to ban it altogether, with cities such as Oakland and Berkeley considering following suit. California may enact a statewide ban if Gov. Gavin Newsom signs the Body Camera Accountability Act this summer. The Somerville City Council in Massachusetts banned facial recognition just last week.
While these cities are turning their backs to this technology, others are welcoming it. The Orlando Police Department is testing Amazon's 'Rekognition' software, although not in public or for investigative use.
According to The New York Times, Detroit signed a $1 million deal to set up facial recognition in the city's surveillance cameras with broad rules on how law enforcement can use the footage.
Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, compares facial-recognition software to when law enforcement started using DNA testing as an investigative tool.
"There was a lot of concern then as well about 'the government is going to have my DNA, they're going to know all about me, how is this going to be used?' and I think today those fears have generally gone by the wayside," Johnson said.
Johnson says facial recognition can be used in the same way DNA testing is — to confirm identities, solve crimes and exonerate the innocent.
"I don't think it's providing the government any more identification (information) than they already have," said Johnson. "I think if people are concerned about surveillance, they've kind of missed the boat."
Facial recognition is being used by more than law enforcement.
The New York school district will be the first in the country to deploy the software for added security, including to identify potential school shooters and sex offenders.
"AI is so powerful, it is going to be either the greatest or the worst thing we as a human species has ever developed, and using such a powerful tool, I think the developers of that should have a mechanism of objective, interested people they can rely on to say, 'Just because we can do this, should we?'" Bueermann said.
Privacy fears have made some cities skeptical of facial recognition.

Texto completo: By Jill Martinson
“Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.” – Neil Armstrong
Those iconic words were received by a very tense Mission Control on the afternoon of July 20, 1969. A collective sigh of great relief and amazement swept through the room as the realization came that NASA and the astronauts of Apollo 11 had just accomplished one of the greatest technological advancements of the 20th century. They successfully landed a man on the moon. As we approach the 50th anniversary of the historic moon landing, take time to appreciate the following new books here at A.K. Smiley Public Library honoring this celebrated achievement.
Detailing the development of NASA’s space program and the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions, “Shoot for the Moon: the Space Race and the Extraordinary Voyage of Apollo 11” by Jim Donovan is an exciting look behind the race to put a man on the moon. The knowledge, equipment and technological innovations that were necessary to reach this goal were nearly insurmountable. Not to mention the years of training and risks the astronauts themselves undertook. Donovan shares the compelling stories of NASA, the astronauts, their selection process and personalities. Interesting anecdotes fill the book. For instance, Buzz Aldrin, in his ingenuity, used his felt-tipped pen to push in and enable a broken circuit breaker essential for lift off from the moon’s surface, saving them from being stranded. This is an absorbing read of the journey to man’s first footprint on the moon.
Getting the astronauts to the moon and back safely was not the work of a few; there were hundreds of thousands of people behind the scenes that contributed countless hours of their talents and energies. “Safely to Earth: the Men and Women Who Brought the Astronauts Back Home” by Jack Clemons, former lead engineer on NASA’s Apollo Program and senior engineering software manager on the Space Shuttle program, shares his personal story. Engineers, scientists, mechanics, software developers and numerous others were key contributors to the NASA programs. With great responsibility on their shoulders, not only were the fates of the missions in their hands, but also that of the astronauts themselves. The book is an excellent background on the inner workings of the missions from someone who lived it.
The moon landing was not without controversy. Although many believed it to be a valuable endeavor, others were convinced that the massive amounts of funding could better have been spent supporting social welfare programs. Some believed the whole thing was a hoax. “Apollo’s Legacy: Perspectives on the Moon Landings” by Roger D. Launius examines these different viewpoints, both positive and negative, and how they shaped its legacy. It’s an engaging read for those interested in the politics behind the moon landing.
Even more options include New York Times best-selling author Douglas Brinkley’s latest “American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space Race” and “The Book of the Moon: A Guide to Our Closest Neighbor” by Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a self-proclaimed “lunatic” who gives a crash course on all things moon-related.
Fifty years ago this month, man stepped on the moon. Learn the fascinating stories behind this monumental feat and check out one of our new books today.

Protesters against separation at the border show out at weekly demonstration

Texto completo: Groups of peaceful protesters held signs and sang songs to raise awareness of what's happening at the border of Mexico and the United States.

Activists from the group Central Mainers to End Family Separations stood on the corners of Main Street in Waterville on Friday afternoon to show solidarity against the crisis at the border.
The group, which drew a crowd of 15 to 20 local residents, works with the Witness Shut Down Homestead Movement, a larger group of activists who are based out of South Florida. These organizations work to draw attention to the separation of migrant families attempting to cross the border from Mexico into the United States and have the ultimate goal of getting migrant detention centers shut down.
Central Mainers to End Family Separations also operates under the protest group #StandonEveryCorner, a growing national movement of local communities organizing to hold peaceful protests for an array of causes.
According to Mary Dunn, one of the directors for Central Mainers to End Family Separations, the group is laser focused on one goal.
“We’re here to close the camps,” Dunn said.
Dunn was the catalyst behind bringing the protests to Waterville back in March and says the support continues to grow by the week.
“It started with just two of us, but every week we do this more people show up. I think the start of the presidential debates has gotten people more involved now,” Dunn said. “And we get a lot of support from people passing by, people will honk or give thumbs up. Of course we have some hecklers but the response overall has been mostly positive.”
After news of family separation happening at the border began to circulate nationwide last year, Dunn knew she had to get involved.
“I couldn’t believe it at first, I thought the news was wrong I thought they had incorrect information,” Dunn said. “I was just in complete shock.”
Family separation at the border between Mexico and the United States took a turn in April 2018 when new policies were introduced that criminally charged adult migrants attempting to cross the border, where before they were treated as civil violations.
Because children under the age of 18 couldn’t be with their relatives in prisons or detentions centers, the practice of separation has come about.
According to The New York Times, an estimated 700 families have been separated since 2018.
Dunn works remotely from her home in Oakland as a travel organizer with the Witness Shutdown Homestead Movement. She organizes trips for activists to visit the Homestead Air Force Reserve Base where a child detention center is being occupied by the protesters. According to Dunn, the group has been continuously protesting the facility for the better part of 100 days now.
One notable attendee at Friday’s rally was former Waterville Mayor Karen Heck, who has been involved with the Central Mainers to End Family Separation since the beginning.
According to Heck, the issue of separating children from their families runs deeper than political party.
“This isn’t a Republican or Democrat issue,” Heck said. “This is an issue of how we’re caring for children. … If these people are willing to risk everything in order to escape their situations in their home country to come here, that’s the kind of people America needs.”
Heck was distributing sheets of paper explaining the group’s next call to action: getting Maine’s senators and representatives to take action against the migrant camps.
Dunn further explained the group’s intentions in contacting state officials.
“Next week were going to call, email, write, communicate with Susan Collins, Angus King, Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden and demand that they go down to the border and do what they can to shut down these camps.” Dunn said.
Dunn said though the separation of families is still happening, she is hopeful for the future.
“Were going to do it. We’re going to stop this,” Dunn said. “Were better than this. This country is better than taking children away from their parents.”
Central Mainers to End Family Separations rallys from 4 to 5 p.m. every Friday on the corner of Main and Temple streets in Waterville.

Is the political cartoonist an endangered species? That would be a threat to our civic health, which is strengthened by insight and wit.

Texto completo: Here's how I define unnerving times: When professionals who write, draw or talk about current events for a living worry that if they dare create anything satiric, mocking or funny, they'll be laid off, shut down, let go or put through the wringer.
America's - and the world's - increasing inability to tolerate irony, dissonance and humor is enough to make you bite your tongue or, worse, put your pencil down, as if democracy's test has just been declared at an end.
I'm particularly worried about the future of political cartoonists.
The best political cartoonists, like gunslingers, have always been able to hit their mark every time they draw. They've been doing this for hundreds of years. But as of this spring, they're no longer doing it for the pages of the international edition of The New York Times.
Even one frame of a single political cartoon is considered too dangerous for traditional sources to risk running them. Newspapers apparently fear being hit in the crossfire when The Outraged fire back.
In the Middle East (I'm thinking particularly of Saudi Arabia, where you can go to prison for criticizing the royal family), and now in North America (I'm thinking particularly of the brouhaha over Michael de Adder's cartoon depicting a golfing Donald Trump "playing through" the bodies of the father and daughter lying dead in the water at the U.S. border), The Outraged are what Mr. Trump calls "cocked and loaded."
Most often they fire back through the internet, either acting like robots or using actual robots to send what are often exactly the same messages to editors, editorial board members or advertising departments, promising to bring upon their heads the full force of destruction, either metaphorically or literally.
"The internet is the world's biggest bully - and a stupid one, like Bluto." Invoking Popeye's huge and dumb antagonist, my friend Gene Weingarten, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner who writes for The Washington Post, said that the internet "derives this power both because of its sheer size, and because of the cowardly license conferred by anonymity. The best cartoonists are still good and the great cartoonists are the most fearless ones - a stance that is harder and harder to take because of a sad third variable. The news industry is financially distressed, meaning threats by the Blutos carry extra menace."
Longtime and influential political cartoonist Bob Englehart - who was once a regular at my hometown paper and whose work is now available at Patreon - is quick to add that "the internet is not the only thing killing newspapers. Newspapers are doing it from the inside. To be sure, there are plenty of courageous editors and publishers still on the watchtower of the First Amendment, but they're dwindling fast."
Ed Wexler, a political cartoonist whose work I've written about in earlier columns not only because he is renowned but also because we've been friends since high school, told me that he, too, "sometimes has concerns" when his Trump cartoons are extreme. "I've received some hate mail - but there's still a lot of fun in having a platform in the national discussion."
I feel the same way Ed Wexler does, and I don't think that's only because we attended Oceanside (New York) High School in the mid-1970s. As a woman who writes humor, I also get hate mail but nevertheless get a kick out of being in the conversation.
Yet I don't want those kicks to become literal. And I want to be able, with a clear conscience, when talking to the most disengaged and cynical young people, to argue that creativity, originality, insight and a quick wit are essential to our nation's civic health.
Mary Lou Solomon, who taught art for more than 20 years, put it this way: "Artists, regardless of the medium they choose, are the rebels of their times, and they instantly and viscerally 'show people what they didn't know they needed to know.' "
Finally, Mark Twain's Mysterious Stranger argued that "power, money, persuasion, supplication, persecution" can be weakened a little over centuries, "but only laughter can blow it to rags and atoms at a blast" because "against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand."

Texto completo: [Want to get this by email? Here's the sign-up .]
A few months ago, I began taking a screenshot of the show's opening words and posting it on Twitter as a tease for the next day's episode. I've been noticing the same questions each time from listeners, so herewith, an explainer:
What's with the capital letters? Do you have poor eyesight?
No. Or, at least, I don't think I do. I find it much easier to read capital letters than lowercase letters, so everything that's read on the show, including my questions for guests, is written that way. It's an old TV news trick -- scripts for anchors often show up on the screen above the camera (and in the printed scripts on their desks) in all-capital letters.
So those pauses are ... actually written ... into the script?
Yup. Our secret is out. We write these introductions (we call them billboards) with every anticipated pause built in, marked by an ellipsis. When I hit an ellipsis, I remember to pause, if only for a millisecond.
What's up with the bold and italics?
We've developed a visual code for how to emphasize words in the billboard. Bold tells me when I should emphasize a particular word. Italic (like here) reminds me how I should say a specific word that's important in the sentence. A slash (like here) indicates a longer-than-usual pause.
When are these written and recorded?
Generally, between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. We labor over these sentences, writing and rewriting them until they feel just right. We want to convey the most important element of the show without giving away the entire point of the episode. It's part summary, part trailer, part mystery. Our producer Michael Simon Johnson, whose skills and patience are infinite, coaches me through the delivery most nights. I usually need three to four takes to get it right.
I've noticed a few episodes do not begin with a billboard. What gives?
You're right. From time to time, we begin the show without a billboard. In that case, we put the billboard lower down, after you've been dropped into a conversation. We do this pretty rarely, because we know it can be a bit disorientating. The billboard is the audio equivalent of a welcome mat. But sometimes, it's more compelling to be tossed right into a scene.
What's your favorite billboard?
I'm partial to this one, from Sept. 27, 2017. It's on the long side, but I love how it tells a story unto itself and employs a play on words.
TODAY ...
TWIN FALLS, IDAHO WAS A TYPICAL AMERICAN TOWN. THEN ... AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, RUMORS SURROUNDING A BRUTAL LOCAL CRIME SIMMERED TO A BOIL ... AND TURNED THE WHOLE TOWN UPSIDE DOWN.
A FAKE NEWS STORY ... AND ITS REAL-LIFE CONSEQUENCES.
IT'S WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27TH.
Surely the host knows his name, right? So why is that in the script? And please tell me "From The New York Times" is not recorded every night. Don't you have that on file?
Nope. Every word is recorded every night, so that the show sounds like a coherent whole, delivered fresh from start to finish. It may not be the most efficient system, but that's what we do.
Have other questions? Ask Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb .

An outtake from Wednesday's show
In Wednesday's episode, Julie Davis walked us through the stakes of a primary runoff in a conservative district in North Carolina, where Republicans tested a strategy for electing more women. In an outtake from the show, we asked Julie why this district had such important implications for the party. Listen or read the transcript below.
Michael: Why is a conservative district where Republican seats are safe -- why is that the place where Republicans feel like they have a great opportunity to elect a Republican woman?
Julie: Well, for one thing, it's a timing issue -- this is when this race is. It happens to be the first race since the midterms. But secondly, the safe seats, the seats that are solidly Republican, are the base to build on. Democrats have a huge crop of women in safe Democratic seats that are reliably in that party's column, that they don't have to worry about from year to year. They also now have a new crop of women and men, but many women, in competitive seats, who -- people like Abigail Spanberger in Virginia -- who won a close race in a Trump district. She's very vulnerable. It's very possible that she gets voted out in 2020. So those seats are important, and the Republicans are absolutely trying to recruit more moderate women to run in some of those districts as well. But they're also more transient. And so if they want to really build a base of lasting Republican women, they're going to have to start and build from the conservative, deep red places as much as they are from the middle.
For more on Republican efforts to recruit and support women candidates, read Julie's piece on how party leaders are responding to the outcome of the election.

What we're reading
Who: Jazmín Aguilera, a producer for "The Daily"
What: "The City of Palaces," a novel by Michael Nava
A line that stuck: "The road to dictatorship is paved with temporary measures."
Beginning as a love story between an atheist and a Catholic in belle epoque Mexico, "The City of Palaces" is a beautiful, tragic epic that spans an era of opulent corruption to the start of the Mexican revolution. It brings you through a complex time of upheaval as President Porfirio Díaz's control crumbles and the country crashes into the era of the Zapatista. There's a grab bag of characters who feel familiar yet original: a judgmental grandma clinging to tradition, a curious gay son coming of age, an idealistic, do-gooder mother who nurses the sick among the indigenous poor.
As an avid reader of historical fiction, I loved being able to absorb the nuance of this moment through the emotions and memories of the characters. In one chapter, we encounter the world through the fierce resistance of a Zapatista; in another, through the moral anguish of an atheist doctor. But even with its prism of perspectives, the story is refreshingly linear and easy to follow. For those who like to learn through stories, the book is a captivating introduction to Mexican history that will inspire many Wikipedia searches. You might find yourself disoriented, as I was, when you close the book and realize you can no longer hear the clanging of the brass church bells in the distance.

It’s time to check NASA’s astronomical spending

Texto completo: For a government website, NASA’s homepage is an exciting place. Americans can read news releases brimming with all sorts of interesting announcements. For example, on June 3, Pennsylvania students had “an opportunity to speak live with a NASA astronaut aboard the International Space Station.” The agency also lets taxpayers know that NASA is pro-small business, and willing to hand out dollars to startups to develop solar panels. But NASA is less than forthcoming about its mounting cost overruns and schedule delays — which are costing taxpayers billions of dollars and jeopardizing future missions. Taxpayers deserve better.
You wouldn’t know it unless you checked it out for yourself, but NASA has a serious spending problem. According to a report released in May by the Government Accountability Office, NASA’s major projects have veered nearly thirty percent over budget, as average launches are typically delayed by over a year. One of the chief culprits behind exploding cost figures is the James Webb Space Telescope, which was originally supposed to cost upward of $3.5 billion and launch by 2011. The latest estimates (but probably not the last) have the telescope launching in 2021 and costing $9.7 billion — a 177 percent increase.
In a 2018 report, NASA’s inspector general pointed out that NASA has a persistent, reckless culture of misplaced optimism, which prevents it from soberly assessing costs on the novel technologies it dreams up. After proposing the project, NASA had to invent 10 technologies in order to even make the JWST viable. In popular discourse, a proposal that precedes available technology is called a “pipe dream” — these are fun to have, but shouldn’t be dependent on the taxpayer’s dollar.
The JWST is not a one-off. The Hubble Space Telescope itself followed a similar fiscal path. NASA’s go-to star searcher was supposed to cost $200 million when it was proposed, but, by the end, costs ballooned to more than $1 billion. In 2008, former NASA science chief Alan Stern warned in a New York Times op-ed that “A CANCER is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects.”
At the very least, taxpayers can take solace in the fact that these expenditures aren’t that big compared to the rest of federal budget. But, still — NASA’s 2019 budget of $21.5 billion is one of the highest since the Apollo Program (after adjusting for inflation). And its spending is even about to surge “bigly.” The Trump administration is determined to bring the U.S. back to the moon, and, right now, NASA doesn’t have enough funding for that. Depending on the report cited, another voyage to the moon could cost taxpayers anywhere from $53 billion to $86 billion (after adjusting for inflation from initial reports). Again, the mission is delayed — the Space Launch System tasked with bringing humans to the moon is roughly three years behind schedule. Too, it’ll cost double the originally-projected amount. The next trip to the moon seems to be more of a silly competition with China or Russia rather than a quest for scientific knowledge.
Robotic probes exploring new worlds would be a much better idea. Besides, robotic exploration can be done at a fraction of the cost, and without the risk of radiation to astronauts devoid of Earth’s atmospheric protections. Regardless of the future missions that NASA chooses to undertake, the agency should work with lawmakers, watchdogs and independent auditors to ensure that initial budget estimates are not too rosy. For taxpayers’ sake, America’s space agency should stop shooting for the moon and try getting its spending under control.

Prosecutors Claim Lavish Bribes Oiled Taxi Industry Corruption

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
For decades, Alan S. Kaufman and Tony Georgiton held immense power in New York City's taxi industry. Mr. Kaufman led a major credit union that lent money to thousands of drivers. Mr. Georgiton co-owned a fleet that operated 550 cabs. Together, they controlled the fortunes of more cabbies than almost anybody else in the business.
But behind the scenes, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said, they orchestrated a bribery scheme to enrich themselves at the expense of their clients. On Thursday, authorities arrested both men, accusing Mr. Kaufman of accepting bribes in return for lending money to Mr. Georgiton under sweetheart terms.
"Lavish vacations, rent-free housing and even naming rights to a ballroom were among the high-ticket items Kaufman received in this alleged scheme," William F. Sweeney Jr., an assistant director of the F.B.I., said in a statement. "Today's charges highlight a series of fraudulent behaviors that raised red flags along the way."
Mr. Kaufman, 60, the former chief executive of Melrose Credit Union, and Mr. Georgiton, 61, the president of Queens Medallion Leasing, did not respond to requests for comment; Mr. Kaufman's lawyer also did not respond to a request for comment.
Michael Jaccarino, a lawyer for Mr. Georgiton, said on Thursday night: "Tony has been a respected businessman and valued member of the transportation industry in New York City for over 30 years, all without a blemish on his record. He has already pleaded not guilty, and we are confident that we will be able to present a very strong defense to these accusations that will ultimately show that he did not commit a crime."
Mr. Kaufman denied similar charges during an interview last year with The New York Times, saying he was being used as a scapegoat for problems in the taxi industry.
Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Georgiton were among the politically connected leaders of the taxi industry who were highlighted in a recent Times investigation. The investigation, published in May, found that the leaders made hundreds of millions of dollars by artificially inflating the price of the permit that allows a driver to own a cab -- called a taxi medallion. At the same time, they channeled thousands of immigrant buyers into reckless loans to buy the medallions.
The price of a medallion skyrocketed to more than $ 1 million in 2014, from $ 200,000 in 2002, before crashing, leaving thousands struggling to pay off their loans, the investigation found. More than 950 medallion owners have filed for bankruptcy.
Industry leaders have long denied any wrongdoing and blamed problems in the taxi industry on the unexpected emergence of ride-hailing apps, such as Uber and Lyft.
In the wake of The Times's series, New York Attorney General Letitia James opened an inquiry into the lending practices, and Mayor Bill de Blasio launched an investigation of taxi brokers. Last week, the city arrested a notorious industry debt collector and promised more enforcement action.
Thursday's charges mirrored allegations that had long been known to at least some authorities. Melrose fired Mr. Kaufman in 2016, and last August, the National Credit Union Administration, the federal agency that oversees the nation's credit unions, closed Melrose and brought civil charges against Mr. Kaufman, saying that he accepted bribes and demanding that he pay $ 3.5 million.
Before that, Mr. Kaufman was one of the largest players in the taxi industry. His grandfather founded Melrose in 1922, and for decades thereafter, the nonprofit credit union was among the biggest lenders to New York taxi drivers and medallion owners.
At its height, Melrose's books included more than $ 1.5 billion in loans collateralized by thousands of medallions -- including some owned by Michael D. Cohen, President Trump's former personal lawyer. In 2015, when Melrose made $ 80 million in interest and fees, Mr. Kaufman took home $ 2.3 million, more than virtually any other credit union leader, financial disclosures show.
Mr. Georgiton's fleet, which he co-owns with Basil Messados, a fellow Greek immigrant, is the third-biggest fleet in the city, according to the latest available government records. In addition to operating cabs, the company provides insurance to drivers and loans that allow some drivers to buy their own medallions. In 2015, Mr. Georgiton had a net worth of about $ 26 million, according to records filed as part of a legal case.
The co-owner of the fleet, Mr. Messados, did not respond to requests for comment.
Both Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Georgiton have had wide connections in the world of New York City politics and contributed to campaigns. Mr. Georgiton's Instagram account features photos of him with Mr. de Blasio at four events as well as photos of him posing with Hillary Clinton, a former presidential candidate and secretary of state, and the Queens borough president, Melinda Katz, among others. After The Times put up an Instagram post from Mr. Georgiton showing him and Mr. Messados flanking Mr. de Blasio, the picture was removed late Thursday.
The indictment accused Mr. Georgiton of allowing Mr. Kaufman to live rent-free at a home in Jericho, on Long Island, between 2010 and 2012. During that time, the charges claimed, Mr. Kaufman personally approved the refinancing of more than $ 60 million of loans for Mr. Georgiton's firm at terms that were so favorable that the head of the credit union's lending department refused to sign off on them.
According to the indictment, Mr. Kaufman also directed Melrose to spend about $ 2 million to obtain naming rights to a ballroom owned by Mr. Georgiton. While Mr. Kaufman sought approval from the credit union's board of directors for that move, he did not disclose that he was living rent-free in a house owned by Mr. Georgiton, the indictment said.
Later, prosecutors claim, Mr. Kaufman purchased the home from Mr. Georgiton, using an unsecured personal loan provided by Mr. Georgiton.
The indictment accused Mr. Kaufman of accepting free spa treatments, rounds of golf and trips to Paris, Hawaii and the Super Bowl in exchange for leading Melrose to increase its advertising spending with an unidentified media company. The N.C.U.A. charges had identified the company as CBS Radio.
Both men were charged with bribery of a financial institution officer, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, and conspiracy to commit bribery, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.
Alain Delaquérière contributed research.

Texto completo: The agonizing fact for Democrats this summer is that President Trump appears to be gaining ground on domestic and foreign policy, while his potential challengers are quarreling and mostly spinning their wheels.
Trump is taunting allies and defying Congress - and seemingly getting away with it. He isn't just rewriting the political rulebook, he's tossing it aside. And the painful fact is that the Democrats haven't figured out a way to stop his forward momentum, even when they believe it's taking the country over a cliff.
Trump remains a divisive and unpopular leader who is vulnerable in 2020. But a Post-ABC News poll released last week was the clearest warning yet for Democrats that Trump is gaining strength beyond his core base of support.
Trump's approval rating has risen 5 points since April, to 44 percent, according to the survey. His disapproval rating is 53 percent, but his support is still the highest he's had as president. The RealClearPolitics average of major polls shows a similar trend.
Trump would probably be doing even better if so many people weren't turned off by his crass behavior. Commentator Steven Rattner recently noted the gap between the 56 percent predicted support for an incumbent with this record, as modeled by Yale economist Ray Fair, and Trump's much lower actual support in polls.
Trump's best issue is the economy. Last week's employment report showed sharp job growth, led by manufacturing. There are caveats: The distribution of rewards is grossly unequal, and growth has been pumped by deficit spending. There are signs of weakness ahead, too, but even the New York Times' editorial board agrees with Trump that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates, perhaps extending the recovery.
Trump's anti-immigrant policies are appalling, but they don't seem to be costing him politically. Democrats, in their indignant response, have moved so far toward what critics argue is a policy of open borders that they may unintentionally make this issue a net winner for Trump.
Trump's foreign policy has been a disruptive megaphone, with little real success to show, but here again, he gets away with it. His approach has become predictable: He threatens fire and fury, imposes economic sanctions and then starts bargaining a deal that produces only modest gains. That's been the case so far with North Korea, China and Mexico - and it's probably where Trump wants to head with Iran.
If you were to do a cost-benefit analysis of Trump's foreign policy, the damage he's done to allies would far outweigh any gains against potential adversaries. But Trump doesn't pay the cost because, for all his belligerent "America First" talk, he's avoiding new wars and says he wants to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan.
Polls suggest a continuing public distaste for Trump's erratic, egoistic personal style, with 65 percent finding his behavior "unpresidential" in the Post-ABC News poll. The daily Trump show leaves the country exhausted and frazzled, and you can hypothesize a Democratic challenger who would be calming, trustworthy and unifying.
But looking at the Democratic field, it's not clear yet who could actually deflate Trump's balloon. The Democrats appear increasingly divided; they're skewing further left as candidates compete for the party's base; young progressives seem eager to pick fights with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other leaders. The public sadly seems almost as weary of Democrats' investigations as of Trump's scandals.
A Democrat who could, in theory, put a stopper in Trump's bottle is former vice president Joe Biden. He has experience, talented advisers, support from labor and some other traditional Democratic constituencies, and money. What he doesn't have is pizzazz.
Biden gave a solid foreign policy speech Thursday that was a reminder of what "normal" sounds like. His call for American leadership in the world was a reminder of how much damage Trump has done in abdicating that role.
Democrats should wake up: Like it or not, Trump is on something of a roll. Twenty candidates bickering onstage looks worryingly like a recipe for four more years.
Hillary Clinton thought Trump would beat himself, but she was wrong. The Democrat who can win in 2020 will be the one who presents a reassuring contrast to this loud but chronically insecure president. The polls say Trump is beatable, but it will take a strong, sensible campaign that can pull voters in the middle, where this race will be won or lost.

De Blasio's Uber cap will create new medallion system-and drivers will suffer

Texto completo: There's an expression that bad ideas never die. For a while it looked like the medallion system that governed taxicabs in New York might be an exception to the rule. Over the past decade, companies such as Uber and Lyft made it easier for people of color to hail a ride and offered earning opportunities to communities often left behind by New York's rapid growth. They broke up the monopoly held by taxi kingpins and bankers who had saddled drivers with mountains of debt while simultaneously resisting any attempt to improve service.
Sadly, however, the medallion system and all its flaws could soon be back under a new name.
Mayor de Blasio's proposal to extend the cap on app-based vehicles aims to recreate the medallion system that failed millions. While it will protect the big banks and taxi kingpins who profited off the old system, it's bad news for everyone else.
Drivers who simply want to support their families are stuck paying more to rent vehicles, and fewer cars eventually means less service in places outside of midtown Manhattan. The result is fewer earning opportunities for first generation immigrants-and people of color generally-plus worse service for those of us who depend on Uber and Lyft.
Few people who lived in New York in the '80s and '90s recall the medallion system fondly. Unless you were a wealthy New Yorker living below 96th street, or a taxi exec like Michael Cohen, the medafiion system didn't work.
It didn't work for drivers who were forced to either pay exorbitant fees for the privilege of renting a yellow cab or took out mountains of debt to buy a medallion. Drivers who rented worked 12 hour shifts in the hope of making enough money to cover the cost of the vehicle and still have a little left over for their families.
Those drivers who decided to buy a medallion ended up even worse off. Hundreds of drivers were tricked by bankers into signing shady loans that crippled them with millions of dollars of debt they could never repay. In a shocking New York Times exposé, one leading financial expert referred to medallion loans as modern day "indentured servitude." For decades a small handful of bankers and taxi kingpins got rich at the expense of immigrants and people of color just trying to make a living.
To be clear, riders didn't fare much better.
Yellow cabs rarely ventured into upper Manhattan or the outer boroughs. Most of us can remember stepping into a cab only to get kicked out when we whispered, "I'm going to Brooklyn." Transit deserts in areas like Ozone Park and unreliable mass transit made the problem worse. Broken subways in the Bronx meant a nearly impossible commute to work in the central business district.
Of course it was even worse for New Yorkers of color. Hailing a cab was humiliating and frustrating. Vacant lights suddenly turned off when a driver noticed your skin color or just drove by without even bothering to pretend they were occupied. It got so bad that New Yorkers coined the phrase, "hailing while Black."
This made reliable transportation not a right, but a privilege out of reach for most New Yorkers.
The arrival of app companies finally broke up the monopoly that enriched bankers and taxi kingpins at the expense of riders and drivers. For once working class people didn't have to spend hundreds of dollars a week for the chance to earn a living. New Yorkers in the outer-boroughs, and especially New Yorkers of color, finally had access to affordable and reliable on demand transportation. The companies flourished in places forgotten about by taxis-more than half of all Uber trips happen outside of Manhattan.
This feat was no small detail, and for once the system worked.
While it might not happen right away, the mayor's proposal will slowly move us back to the bad old days. Over time service will decrease along with earning opportunities for drivers. New Yorkers of color and first generation immigrants shouldn't have to suffer at the expense of a handful of special interests. Every community deserves access to safe reliable transportation options, but a modern medallion system makes that impossible.
It's time for the mayor to bury this bad idea.

Texto completo: Altos funcionarios del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) confirmaron que, a partir del domingo, agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) realizará redadas en 10 grandes ciudades.
El anuncio fue revelado a The New York Times, aunque Univision también informó de las movilizaciones con fuentes que hablaron bajo la condición del anonimato.
Activistas y defensores sugieren a todos los inmigrantes indocumentados mantenerse alerta ante los operativos, sobre los cuales se conoce:
1. Inicio.- El presidente Donald Trump afirmó que después del 4 de julio comenzarían las readas, las cuales son confirmadas para iniciar el 14 de julio . Cabe recordar que ICE no concreta sus operativos en un día, sino que hace movilizaciones en distintos días.
2. Objetivos.- “La Migra” estaría dirigida a extranjeros con órdenes finales de deportación que no acudieron a su audiencia en la Corte , por lo que un juez entregó su orden de expulsión “en ausencia”. Abogados y activistas señalan que estas personas, aunque sean detenidas, todavía podrían defenderse, pero deberán consultar su caso con un abogado. Cada que realiza operativos, ICE se enfoca a ciertas personas, pero puede detener a “cualquier sospechoso” de estar en el país como indocumentado, como lo ha informado en otras ocasiones.
3. La ciudades.- Los arrestos se planificaron originalmente en Atlanta , Baltimore , Chicago , Denver , Houston , Los Ángeles , Miami , Nueva Orleans , Nueva York y San Francisco , metrópolis donde se concentra el mayor número de inmigrantes legales e indocumentados. Diversos estudios señalan que las personas sin permiso de estancia en el país deciden vivir entre comunidades de inmigrantes legales como un factor de seguridad y pertenencia.
4.- El alcance.- La rama de Operaciones de Ejecución y Remoción (ERO) de ICE tiene una lista de objetivos inicial de 2,500 adultos y niños, pero el plan contempla la captura de hasta 10,000 migrantes , reportó The Washington Post. La gran mayoría de las familias, según reportes, han cruzado la frontera en los últimos 18 meses en busca de asilo y permanecen en el país, esperando una fecha de audiencia o desafiando las órdenes de deportación.
5.- Armar un plan.- Activistas y abogados sugieren a los inmigrantes en riesgo de deportación armar un plan de acción que contemple como mínimo : ayuda legal , cómo pagar una fianza y con quien dejar a sus hijos , en caso de tenerlos. También se sugiere a los indocumentados NO RESISTIRSE a la detención, pedir su llamada telefónica y NO FIRMAR documento alguno.

Expansion of Secrecy Law for Intelligence Operatives Alarms Free Press Advocates

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The C.I.A. is quietly pushing Congress to significantly expand the scope of a law that makes it a crime to disclose the identities of undercover intelligence agents, raising alarms among advocates of press freedoms.
The agency has proposed extending a 1982 law, the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, which makes it a crime to identify covert officers who have served abroad in the past five years. Under the C.I.A.'s plan, the law would instead apply perpetually to people whose relationships with the intelligence community are classified -- even if they live and operate exclusively on domestic soil.
Lawmakers have attached the C.I.A.'s proposed language to defense and intelligence bills moving through Congress. The provisions have sparked objections among press freedom and government transparency advocates. Potential amendments to the House intelligence bill must be submitted by Thursday to be considered when it comes to the House floor.
The C.I.A.'s proposal "seriously expands the felony criminal penalties that could be used against journalists, against whistle-blowers and against public-interest organizations," said Emily Manna, a policy analyst for Open the Government, a group promoting accountability. "It opens the door to a ton of abuses and secrecy to a much greater extent," she said.
The proposal would also outlaw the identification of American citizens who serve as classified agents or informants for intelligence agencies, or otherwise help them. Currently, the identities law covers only classified informants who reside and act abroad.
The push was aimed at protecting clandestine officers, said Timothy Barrett, the C.I.A. press secretary. In the past five years, he said, "hundreds of covert officers have had their identity and covert affiliation disclosed without authorization," and under current law, the identities of officers who are based on domestic soil but travel frequently overseas are not protected.
"C.I.A. officers place themselves in harm's way in order to carry out C.I.A.'s mission regardless of where they are based," Mr. Barrett said. "Protecting officers' identities from foreign adversaries is critical."
The C.I.A. also argued that lawmakers' original rationale for only protecting agents abroad -- that they faced special physical danger -- was "no longer valid" because "organizations such as WikiLeaks" are willing to go to great lengths to publish government secrets, and because of the fallout from revelations about the C.I.A.'s defunct torture program, according to a copy of the agency's written justification for the proposal obtained by The New York Times.
Still, critics said that the agency's proposed language is too broad, covering people who have not been in harm's way abroad for years.
The proposal also comes at a time when defense lawyers at the military commissions system at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, are trying to identify eyewitnesses from the C.I.A. black sites whom they could potentially call to testify about their clients' treatment, including in the case against Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four other detainees accused of aiding the Sept. 11 attacks.
Last month, when the Senate Intelligence Committee unveiled its annual intelligence bill, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, flagged his concern that the C.I.A. provision would allow the protections for undercover identities to apply indefinitely.
"I am not yet convinced this expansion is necessary and am concerned that it will be employed to avoid accountability," he wrote.
The C.I.A.'s push comes against the backdrop of a sharp increase in the prosecution of current and former officials accused of providing government secrets to the news media in recent years. It also comes against the unprecedented Justice Department decision in May to expand the criminal case against the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, to include Espionage Act charges for soliciting, obtaining and publishing classified information -- including files that identified people in dangerous countries who had helped Americans.
Congress enacted the identities law after Richard S. Welch, the C.I.A.'s station chief in Athens, was murdered in 1975 and Philip Agee, a former C.I.A. officer who had grown to oppose American foreign policy, revealed numerous covert officers' identities.
The identities law supplemented the Espionage Act, which more broadly makes it a crime to disclose potentially harmful defense-related information to someone not authorized to receive it. The identities act is narrower but easier to use in some respects: Prosecutors need only prove that the disclosed identity met the definition for "covert."
Prosecutors have only rarely used the law, but they won a conviction under it in a 1985 case involving a C.I.A. clerk in Ghana and in the 2012 case of John Kiriakou, a former C.I.A. officer who pleaded guilty to telling a reporter the name of a covert officer involved in the agency's interrogations.
Another part of the identities law, which prosecutors have not used, might apply to journalists under some circumstances. It covers outsiders who do not have authorized access to classified information but learn about and disclose covert identities anyway, "in the course of a pattern of activities intended to identify and expose covert agents."
It is possible that the law needs to be updated because of technological advances since 1982, like the arrival of the internet, said Steve Aftergood, a government secrecy specialist for the Federation of American Scientists. But he portrayed the legislative push as premature.
"I don't see a justification for this," he said. "Because it affects public access to information, it requires a public justification, and that has not been presented. I'm open to being persuaded, but the case had not been made."
In a House committee report accompanying the 1982 bill, lawmakers stressed that they intended to limit its coverage to clandestine agents abroad, or agents who may be "temporarily in the United States for rest, training, or reassignment" before returning abroad, because they face special dangers.
The 1982 report also said that the public should be able to discuss intelligence informants living in the United States, saying they "may be employees of colleges, churches, the media, or political organizations. The degree of involvement of these groups with intelligence agencies is a legitimate subject of national debate."
But in its justification to Congress, the C.I.A. wrote that changes since 1982, including "cyber threats," meant Congress's rationale for limiting protections to overseas agents was obsolete.
"Thirty-seven years later, the threats undercover agency officers face are evolving and are no longer limited to those officers who are serving abroad or have done so recently," the C.I.A. wrote.

Texto completo: Two summers ago, it was nearly impossible to avoid hearing about Michelle Carter, the Massachusetts woman found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for urging her suicidal boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, to kill himself a few years prior, when they were both in high school. The case had unfolded in a juvenile court and concerned a relationship formed over thousands of private text messages. It held the attention of strangers across the country - including filmmaker Erin Lee Carr, perhaps known most for her 2017 documentary "Mommy Dead and Dearest," about the murder of Dee Dee Blanchard.
Carr's earliest recollection of the texting suicide case setting off an alarm in her documentarian brain is when she came across a Washington Post headline in 2015 that included one of Carter's texts to Roy: "It's now or never." It was a relatively early glimpse into the disturbing incident, which permeated the national consciousness that spring when Carter, who is serving a 15-month sentence and whose lawyers filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court Monday, was first charged.
"I don't know if you can be a woman who covers crime and technology and not be interested in the Michelle Carter case," Carr tells The Post over the phone. "When somebody texts something like that, it's almost like we used to say: A picture is worth a thousand words . . . I had to know what the story was."
But it was another phrase that wound up at the center of the guilty verdict: "Get back in," which Carter later told a friend she said to Roy in July 2014 after he got out of the truck he'd rigged with a gasoline-powered water pump. He was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning the next day. Both messages, along with a slew of others, play a significant part in "I Love You, Now Die," Carr's two-part HBO documentary that aired Tuesday and Wednesday night.
While the tide of public favor was arguably against Carter from the start, Carr made a point to avoid indicting anyone through her storytelling and instead tried to approach each side of the story with empathy. Carter's texts to her long-distance boyfriend in the weeks leading up to his death paint a horrific portrait of someone exacerbating another's suicidal ideation. But Carr also looks beyond that incident, to the time when Carter still tried to dissuade Roy from harming himself, or even to traumatic events that occurred before they met.
"What were the moments that led to this?" Carr says. "In explaining that, you come away with an understanding of why Conrad Roy was suffering, what it feels like, that it was not the first time he had tried to commit suicide and that Michelle Carter had her own mental health struggles. Some might say that explains everything and excuses nothing, but the way that we consider these arcs in these documentaries is, how can we explore these things so it doesn't happen again?"
It's an approach the filmmaker says she inherited from her father, the late New York Times media columnist David Carr. Having struggled with addiction, David taught his daughters that people should not be equated with their best or worst actions, Erin says. "I think that coming from a place of understanding and thoughtfulness has always been baked into how I approach stories, and how he approached stories," she continues. "It definitely defined and helped shape the way I do my job."
Thoughtfulness is especially important when it comes to true crime, Carr says, a genre where the line separating journalism and biased commentary is "deeply fine." Her filmography - which also includes 2015's "Thought Crimes: The Case of the Cannibal Cop" and the May release "At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal" - is notable in how it emphasizes Carr's ability to deconstruct her subjects' motives.
With "I Love You, Now Die," Carr does so by devoting equal attention to the defense and prosecution. The defense argued that Carter was mentally ill and, therefore, also at a great level of risk at the time of Roy's death. Carr looks into these claims, interviewing a psychiatrist who had evaluated Carter and noted that she, like Roy, was on psychiatric medication - medication that could have clouded her judgment.
Prosecutors argued that Carter, who had struggled to connect with peers, was trying to garner attention by creating a situation where she could play a grieving girlfriend. They pointed to her obsession with the television show "Glee" and its lead actress Lea Michele, whose co-star and boyfriend, Cory Monteith, died of a drug overdose in 2013. Carter used to quote Michele's character verbatim in texts she sent to Roy and, shortly after his death, in those she sent to concerned friends.
The documentary features some of Roy's video diaries and interviews with his family as a way to elucidate his struggles with anxiety and depression, but it must rely on courtroom footage and the texts themselves to explore Carter's behavior. (She and her family declined to be interviewed.) Carr and her team pored through the thousands of texts Carter and Roy exchanged in the two years they knew each other - "with lots of coffee on board," Carr notes of the strenuous process - and highlighted the ones they found particularly indicative of the unusual relationship the teenagers shared.
Although Carter and Roy only met in person a handful of times, it felt as though they "didn't have a thought that they didn't express in a text message," Carr says of the exchanges. In one scene, the idea for which she credits her editor Andrew Coffman, texts flash on screen in the quick manner in which the teenagers presumably sent them.
"How was your day?" Carter asks.
"peachy," Roy responds.
"Coral"
"copy"
"Paste?"
"tomato"
"Onion"
"pickles"
Word games and free association are unusual styles of texting, Jesse Barron, a reporter who covered the case for Esquire, says in the film. But it was typical for Carter and Roy. Carr points to this specific back-and-forth as an indication of the comfort and ease with which Carter and Roy corresponded: "Yes, there are big moments and they're riveting and provide anguish," she says. "But these smaller moments inform who these people were as humans."
The documentary ends with footage from Carter's court appearance in February, where she learned that her appeal had been denied by Massachusetts's highest court. But the upheld conviction doesn't mandate how viewers might feel after watching "I Love You, Now Die." Carr says a good number of people, many of whom saw the film at its South by Southwest premiere in March, have told her it completely altered their perception of Carter's guilt.
"I like . . . changing people's opinions and making them think of [Carter and Roy] not as avatars who said a couple sentences that will forever be cemented in our brains, but to turn them into fully dimensional people where you understand why on earth she might have said those sentences," Carr says. "That's always been the goal."

Texto completo: DAMARISCOTTA — Skidompha Library’s Chats with Champions will feature Arlie Russell Hochschild at 10 a.m. Thursday in the Skidompha Library’s Porter Meeting Hall on Main Street. Please allow time for parking.
Hochschild is a renowned professor emerita of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her Chat with Champions at the library will focus on her latest title, “Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right,” a New York Times Best Seller and finalist for the 2016 National Book Award, according to a news release from the library.
In an era in which most of us live in our own “political bubble,” Hochschild dared to venture from liberal Democratic Berkeley, California, to conservative Republican Lake Charles, Louisiana. By the time Donald Trump had won election to the United States presidency in 2016, Hochschild had spent five years immersed in the “deep story” of a nation grappling with its identity. Her Chat with Champions will unpack the political trends that elected Trump and offer solutions for moving forward.

Texto completo: In an effort to ease access to college, the University of Texas pledged Tuesday to provide full scholarships to undergraduates whose families make $65,000 or less annually.
The University of Texas System Board of Regents voted to establish a $160 million endowment from the state's Permanent University Fund in order to offer the scholarships by fall 2020, according to a press release from the university. The money will supplement existing federal and state financial aid programs.
The move will allow the university to fully fund the education of more than 8,600 in-state students, or about a quarter of the university's undergraduates, the release said.
The endowment will also help alleviate some financial burden for an additional 5,700 in-state students from families with incomes of $125,000 or less. Some of that funding comes from oil and gas royalties earned on state-owned land in West Texas, the release said.
"We all know the struggles that hardworking families are having putting their kids through school," Board Chair Kevin Eltife told the Texas Tribune. "What we've done here is repurposed an endowment into another endowment that will provide tuition assistance to a lot of the working families in Texas. "
The university's decision comes as the idea of a free college education continues to gain legitimacy in the public eye. Multiple 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have pushed for both free public college and student debt forgiveness as part of their platforms.
Those plans have been met with a mix of skepticism and support — proponents have said a free college education would level the playing field, while critics question where the funding to cover thousands of students' expenses will come from.
'Free the generations to come': Bernie Sanders unveils plan to forgive $1. 6 trillion in student loan debt
The new program at Texas will cover students' tuition and fees, but not additional living expenses — estimated to be nearly $17,000 for the 2019-2020 academic year. Tuition and fees alone were estimated to be $10,314 for Texas residents.
“There is no greater engine of social and economic mobility than a college degree, and this initiative ensures that more Texans will benefit from a high-quality UT Austin education," said Chancellor James B. Milliken.
Behind the numbers
The gold standard for universities is to have need-blind admissions, meaning that institutions don't consider a student's financial circumstances when deciding admission. Colleges that employ the policy sometimes promise to cover 100% of students' financial need through scholarships instead of loans.
For example, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg donated a record $1. 8 billion to Johns Hopkins University last year to make the university "forever need-blind," according to an opinion piece he penned for The New York Times.
"This will make admissions at Hopkins forever need-blind; finances will never again factor into decisions," Bloomberg wrote, adding that he believed the contribution would make the school more socioeconomically diverse and would ease the burden of debt on graduates.
Despite this, even universities that offer to cover students' demonstrated financial aid might leave students with lingering expenses, meaning that students might still have to take out loans or go into debt to fully finance their education.
This typically happens when a student's financial need, calculated by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, overestimates their actual ability to pay for college. Because of this, the "expected family contribution" has been criticized as an unrealistic assessment of how much money students, or their families, should be expected to shell out for school.
But not all universities exclusively rely on the EFC to calculate how much students might owe — UT Austin is among the institutions that may be setting their own standard for financial aid, even if they use information submitted through FAFSA to determine eligibility for tuition support.
The cost of college: Most parents, students have no idea how much college really costs. Here's how to find out
It's unclear if UT Austin employs a need-blind approach to admissions. But the school appears to be one of several selective institutions that have begun offering full tuition scholarships to students below a certain income — for example, the University of Michigan began offering free tuition to in-state students from households making less than $65,000 in January 2018.
And Rice University, a private institution in Texas, announced in 2018 that it would cover the full cost of tuition with grants instead of loans for students making less than $130,000 annually.

Paying to deter nuisances Business owners to get help for spending on cameras, fences, lighting

Texto completo: When the "slab" was removed, things changed.
It was just a simple concrete loading dock on the north side of the American Legion Building in downtown Spokane, but it became a nuisance as young men gathered and drank, said Dan Hall, director of the Downtown Spokane Partnership's clean and safe team.
When the building was rehabilitated in 2003, the slab was removed, the daily drinking dried up and the calls stopped coming in, Hall said.
"It changed immediately," Hall said.
Now, DSP is trying to replicate the successful slab removal with a program aimed at decreasing nuisance and criminal behavior in the city core through the design of buildings and landscaping. In short, the program will offer up to $2,500 in matching rebates for property owners who make changes to their building's exterior. The group has set aside $26,000 for the program, paid for with the business association's members' dues.
Overgrown hedges and trees, deep shadows, doorway alcoves and lack of security cameras can all add to a building's use for "nefarious" activities, said Mark Richard, DSP president, adding that the program will discourage "everything from vandalism to assaultive-type behavior."
"This is a national, probably global, best practice on how you can strengthen your surroundings in such a way that you discourage crime and nuisance activities from occurring," Richard said, adding that design can also give people the perception of safety, which is equally important.
Using environmental design to discourage certain behaviors is nothing new to Spokane. In 2013, several business owners installed devices that emitted a steady, high-pitched squeal generally heard by younger people to discourage loitering around the buildings.
Behind the Fernwell Building, fencing has been installed to keep people away from the building's heating and air-conditioning units.
"People would come in and sleep on the heaters during the winter, or stay cool in the summer," Hall said. "Once they put the fencing in, the problems stopped."
Asked what problems he was referring to, Hall pointed to a syringe on the ground.
An alcove in the Parkade garage plaza is now blocked by an iron gate, but it "used to be notorious. Now it just has trash."
"People sleeping," Hall said. "Fornicate is probably the best way I can put it."
The best use of the rebate money, Hall said, is for surveillance cameras, which could not only record but also deter nuisance behavior. Both he and Richard said swaths of downtown Spokane don't have camera coverage.
Hall said he doesn't equate homelessness with lawlessness, and notes that most situations he responds to involve people who aren't homeless. Still, the program and potential proliferation of cameras comes at a contentious time, as concerns about homeless people downtown have taken center stage in this year's mayoral race, and debates about the role of surveillance rage in San Francisco and Detroit.
As the New York Times reported Monday, "video from thousands of cameras stationed around Detroit, at gas stations, restaurants, mini-marts, apartment buildings, churches and schools, streams into the Police Department's downtown headquarters," prompting public outcry over the use of facial recognition software. In May, San Francisco banned the use of facial recognition software by police and other city departments, the first city to outlaw the surveillance technology.
Spokane City Council President Ben Stuckart promoted the use of deterrent design in 2017, when tons of boulders were placed below Interstate 90 in an effort to stop homeless people from camping there. Stuckart said the move was part of a larger project to get homeless people to take advantage of homeless services the city provided. Now, as a candidate for mayor, Stuckart describes the complex nature of homelessness, and argues it's in large part to due to the city's and nation's affordable housing crisis.
Nadine Woodward, a former TV news anchor who is also running for mayor, speaks in starker terms about the "criminal homeless." She has suggested the city should consider forcing drug addicts into treatment for addiction, which she blames for much of Spokane's homeless population.
Recent statistical crime reports from the Spokane Police Department show that downtown crime is down 17%, including drops in both property crimes and violent crimes, from last year. Aggravated assaults are also down, from 61 to 46, a 25% decrease from 2018. Still, that drop comes after a year in which aggravated assaults went up significantly downtown, and remains higher than the total number of such reports from 2017, which counted 28.
Richard, at the DSP, said the design program is intended for nuisance crimes, such as graffiti or car prowling. He warned that such crimes can lead to more serious offenses.
"This will discourage everything from vandalism to assaultive-type behavior, if somebody is engaged in an activity that is frightening employees, or verbally accosting them or all the way to property theft and even car prowling," he said. "Behavior that is unbecoming of a person, whether they're just harassing or intimidating."
Richard also pointed to drug use as a problem downtown.
"When people have drug addictions, they're not in their right mind. They're shouting," he said. "That definitely leads all the way into misdemeanor and felony crimes."

Texto completo: U.S. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta should quit or be forced out for having coddled a sex trafficker.
Monday's indictment of Jeffrey Epstein by a federal grand jury in Manhattan stands as a rebuke of the plea deal given this sexual predator 11 years ago when Acosta was U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida.
For several reasons, Epstein finally may face true justice, rather than the sweet deal he got from Acosta, with the help of then-Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer.
Reason One is the Miami Herald's series last November called "Perversion of Justice." Reporter Julie Brown revived interest in Epstein's case. The series detailed how Epstein lured underage girls - some in junior high school, some still in braces - to his Palm Beach home and sexually abused them.
It took courage for these young women to finally go public. It wouldn't have happened without a dogged reporter encouraging them to do so. "We were assisted" by "some excellent investigative journalism," Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a Monday morning news conference.
The Herald also revealed how Epstein's legal team quietly worked with Acosta to turn what could have been a life sentence in federal prison into just 13 months in the Palm Beach County Jail. Even then, Epstein got to spend 12 hours a day at an office, six days a week, under the terms of his work-release privileges.
Those lawyers included former Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz and Jay Lefkowitz, who has represented President Donald Trump and is a former colleague of Acosta's in private practice.
Reason Two is Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Berman was a federal prosecutor in the 1990s and earlier worked for the Iran-Contra special prosecutor. Like so many others, Berman could have passed on Epstein. He did the opposite.
The indictment charges Epstein with sex trafficking and sex-trafficking conspiracy. It alleges abuses at his Palm Beach home and at his $56 million townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side. As the billionaire money manager arrived from Paris on Saturday, federal agents were using a crowbar to carry out a search warrant of that townhouse. The New York Times reported they had seized "possibly thousands" of "sexually suggestive" photos of underage girls.
"The alleged behavior shocks the conscience," Berman said.
Epstein didn't just recruit the girls and then pay them, the indictment states. He told the girls to recruit other girls. He "created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and Palm Beach."
The scope of Epstein's perversion may turn out to be staggering. The Herald cited dozens more victims than were listed during the first investigation. Berman asked any others also to come forward. "They deserve their day in court, and we are proud to stand up for them by bringing this indictment."
Acosta showed no such allegiance to the first group of victims. In February, a federal judge ruled that Acosta had violated the Crime Victims Rights Act by not telling the young women about the ludicrously light plea deal he had signed. However, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra's ruling let Epstein's slap on the wrist stand.
Thankfully, Berman says the deal doesn't apply to his office. "That agreement, by its terms, binds only the Southern District of Florida."
Intriguing questions remain. Will Epstein's alleged recruiters - whom the indictment calls "Employee-1," "Employee-2" and "Employee-3" - also face charges? The indictment notes that when Epstein traveled to Palm Beach on his jet, "an associate or employee would ensure that minor victims were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida."
Also, Berman's public corruption unit has this case, even though it's about sex trafficking. Legal analysts said that assignment could allow for a wider range of charges against Epstein, such as money laundering. It also could mean charges against current and/or former government officials.
There's no telling how far this could reach if everything comes out. Epstein's circle includes Bill Clinton - a frequent passenger on Epstein's jet - Trump and Prince Andrew. Epstein owns homes in the U.S. Virgin Islands and New Mexico, in addition to those in Palm Beach and New York. Every investigation has shown that Epstein constantly needed new supplies of victims.
We hope all of it comes out, no matter who was involved. Though consequences are long overdue, it can't start without Reason 3 - a new attitude from the Trump administration.
On Monday, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz called again for Acosta's resignation. But Wasserman Schultz is a Democrat.
If Acosta won't go on his own, Trump or other Republicans should pressure him to leave or the president should fire him. Since the labor secretary helps to monitor sex trafficking, the Epstein agreement undermines Acosta's credibility, and thus, the department's.
Epstein could get 45 years in prison. It may take a long time - if it happens at all - for everyone in the Epstein conspiracy to face punishment.
For Alex Acosta, however, it can happen now. He should go.

Texto completo: NANTUCKET, Mass. -- A judge said on Monday that a sexual assault case against the actor Kevin Spacey could be dismissed after the young man who accused Mr. Spacey of fondling him invoked the Fifth Amendment during a hearing over his missing phone.
The man was asked to testify on Monday regarding text messages he sent and received on the night in July 2016 that he encountered Mr. Spacey at a Nantucket restaurant. Mr. Spacey's lawyer contends that the young man had deleted text messages that could back up Mr. Spacey's assertion that whatever happened that night was consensual flirtation.
After the lawyer, Alan Jackson, told the man that he could be charged with a felony for deleting evidence, the man invoked his constitutional right to protect himself from self-incrimination.
Judge Thomas S. Barrett of Nantucket District Court then said the case "may well be dismissed" if the accuser continues to refuse to testify.
"The case revolves around this individual and without him the commonwealth will have a tough row to hoe," Judge Barrett said. He did not dismiss the case on Monday, but gave prosecutors a chance to decide how to respond to the accuser's invocation of the Fifth Amendment.
Mr. Spacey, 59, who was not in court on Monday, faces one count of indecent assault and battery. He is accused of rubbing the young man's penis at a Nantucket restaurant called the Club Car, where the man, who was 18 at the time and is now 21, was working as a busboy.
In trying to prove Mr. Spacey's innocence, the defense lawyer has sought access to the man's phone, but last month, the man's lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, told the court that the phone was missing. Judge Barrett had ordered that if the phone could not be located by Monday, the young man and his parents would have to appear in court to explain its whereabouts.
On the night of the encounter, the accuser had told the police, he was star-struck and eager to get a photo with Mr. Spacey, and texted his girlfriend throughout the night to update her on what was happening. At one point, according to court documents, he texted her that Mr. Spacey had grabbed his penis "like eight times."
Mr. Jackson used records of these text messages to conclude that parts of conversations with his girlfriend, and from another group chat, had been cut out.
In the courtroom on Monday, Mr. Jackson grilled the accuser about the missing messages. The young man said he had noticed that a part of a text conversation was missing but that he did not know how it disappeared, saying, "I did not manipulate any of that."
Mr. Jackson then asked the young man whether he realized that altering evidence that could be used in a prosecution is a felony punishable by prison time.
"I was not previously aware of that law," the young man replied.
Mr. Jackson doubled down, asking, "Deleting text messages from your phone before you give them to police would be a felony, right?"
The hearing then went into a break. Afterward, it was announced that the accuser would be pleading the Fifth.
Brian Glenny, a prosecutor with the Cape and Islands district attorney's office, seemed taken aback by the sharp turn of events, and asked the judge for time to decide how to respond.
"I'm not prepared today to say what we're going to do," he said.
Mr. Garabedian wrote in a court filing that the accuser's mother, Heather Unruh, delivered the smartphone to the police in December 2017, toward the beginning of the investigation. The police said that the phone had been returned to the young man's father, Mr. Garabedian wrote, but the father did not remember receiving it.
The family had searched "all the places where such a phone may have been stored," Mr. Garabedian wrote, but they were not successful. At Monday's hearing, Mr. Garabedian said they had recovered a backup of the accuser's phone on his laptop that covered the time of his encounter with Mr. Spacey. It was not immediately clear if the backup preserved any of the potentially missing messages.
After being given the opportunity to follow her son's lead and plead the Fifth, Ms. Unruh, a former television news anchor in Boston, waived that privilege and took the stand.
"I have nothing but the truth to tell," Ms. Unruh told the judge, her voice cracking.
Ms. Unruh testified that she had looked at her son's phone before she gave it to the police and deleted some content that "concerned" her as a mother. The state trooper who received the phone from Ms. Unruh testified that Ms. Unruh had told him that she had deleted some content regarding "frat boy activities" that she did not want investigators to see.
She said that she had never instructed her son to delete any messages, and never deleted any messages herself from the conversations that Mr. Spacey's lawyer was concerned about.
"I didn't touch anything that was relevant to the case," Ms. Unruh said.
The accuser's father also took the stand, testifying that he did not remember ever getting the phone back from police. (The New York Times is not identifying the father, who has the same surname as his son, to avoid naming an accuser in a sexual assault case.)
He denied that he, his wife or his son had gotten rid of the phone. The questioning by Mr. Spacey's lawyer quickly grew tense, with the father snapping, "I think you have had way too many questions that have gone way too far."
That prompted a terse response from Judge Barrett, who threatened to hold the father in contempt if his confrontational behavior continued.
Judge Barrett scheduled the next hearing for July 31.
Last week the accuser dropped a lawsuit against Mr. Spacey only six days after filing it. At Monday's hearing, Mr. Garabedian said the lawsuit was dropped because the young man was on an "emotional roller coaster."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump loves big foreign policy events that draw the nation's attention to — well, President Donald Trump.
He went to London recently for the spectacle of dining with the queen, ignoring the fact that he could have no meaningful discussions with her government, which is in a state of transition. He also savors his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin because the outrage they draw merely amps up the attention. But nothing is like his approach to North Korea, where he'll apparently do anything, potentially even undermining America's interests, for the coverage it brings.
As the result of a tweet, the foundation of a lot of his on-the-go policymaking, Trump met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to announce the reopening of nuclear talks.
To Trump, the get-together was a grand spectacle. Not only has he already become the first U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader, he did so this time on North Korean soil, also a first. But he has been down this road before with little result. When Trump first met with Kim, in Singapore, he also drew the world's attention. Then after a second meeting in Vietnam, the talks broke off. Now he's at it again.
There's more here than self-promotion, though. In constantly providing a stage for Kim, Trump is giving him legitimacy and global standing that he most assuredly does not deserve.
Making matters worse, Trump is, according to The New York Times, considering recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power and merely asking for it to freeze its arsenal, rather than giving it up. That's a step back from last year, when Kim promised to denuclearize.
Not that it is likely Kim would follow through with either. North Korea has a long history of reneging on pledges to eliminate or freeze its nuclear weapons program. These pledges go back to 1985, when it joined a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and 1992, when North Korea and South Korea signed a pact to denuclearize the peninsula. In 1994, it negotiated a deal with former President Jimmy Carter to freeze its program.
To give Kim so much upfront now, in hopes that he'll reform his ways, is unwise. Other rogue nations will be encouraged to develop their own nuclear arsenals.
Indeed, Iranian leaders, who signed a deal to freeze their nuclear program in 2015, have to see the way their nation is being treated even as Trump coddles North Korea. Making a nuclear deal without weapons in hand has left Iran vulnerable to renewed sanctions from an administration hellbent on blowing up the agreement. On Monday, Iran's foreign minister announced that his country had exceeded the enrichment caps set down by the accord.
Now, instead of one nuclear headache in North Korea, Trump's diplomacy has resuscitated a second, making each more difficult to address. So far, Trump's diplomatic moves in Iran and North Korea have shown great success in focusing international attention on the White House, but they show little sign of tangible nuclear progress.

Prosecutors should stop the scare tactics. Reforming felony murder rule improves our justice system

Texto completo: In January, California ended a decades-old legal doctrine that put numerous people behind bars for murders they did not commit.
Yet six months after the new state law—Senate Bill 1437—took effect, some prosecutors are trying to overturn it, resorting to scare tactics and false distortions.
We are the legislators who wrote and supported this critical reform, and we need to set the record straight about it.
SB 1437 passed the Legislature last year with bipartisan support and was signed into law by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. It reformed California’s outdated and unfair felony murder rule, which had allowed people who did not kill to nonetheless be charged, convicted, and sentenced as murderers.
The old felony murder doctrine allowed prosecutors to charge all accomplices to a crime with first degree murder. It did not matter if there was no intention to kill, if the death was accidental, or if the accomplice had no knowledge that someone else would kill. Everyone was just as responsible, as if they had planned and committed the murder themselves.
The California Supreme Court, in a 1983 ruling, termed the state’s felony murder rule “barbaric.” And yet it remained on the books, and people were unfairly sentenced to long prison terms under this law.
We studied this issue for over a year before passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 48 in 2017. That measure recognized “the need for statutory changes to more equitably sentence offenders in accordance with their involvement in a crime.”
Then in the following legislative session we introduced SB1437 to correct what we concluded was a grave and needless injustice.
As SB1437 moved through the legislative process, we made significant improvements to ensure it was fair and that our reform did not let people who are responsible for a murder off the hook.
Based on input from district attorneys and other public safety advocates, we amended SB1437 to ensure that a criminal was held accountable for murder if they:
* Are the actual killer.
* Aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer with the intent to kill.
* Were a major participant in the underlying crime and acted with reckless indifference to life.
And so it’s been disappointing to see some of California’s district attorneys now working to block the law’s implementation. They remain intent on pursuing murder convictions for people not guilty of that crime, despite the fact that it’s not in the interest of public safety nor is it just.
Yet they have challenged SB1437 in court arguing it’s unconstitutional on the grounds that it’s allegedly inconsistent with two ballot initiatives California voters passed decades ago.
Before introducing SB1437, we spent over a year carefully reviewing past statutes, court decisions, and, yes, voter-approved ballot initiatives, to ensure that the provisions in SB1437 did not overstep our role.
SB1437 falls squarely within the Legislature’s broad authority to make policy.
Prosecutors have also challenged SB1437 in the press with mischaracterizations. The president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County, for example, recently told The New York Times that under SB1437, “We’re literally talking about letting murderers go free.”
That’s a false claim designed to stoke fear.
Thankfully, many prosecutors have properly applied the law, and courts around the state have upheld the reform as constitutional. As a result, many deserving people have been able to go home—some after serving decades in prison for murders they did not commit.
It’s not just those newly freed and their families who have recognized the justice served in these cases. In San Luis Obispo County, after a judge found SB1437 constitutional, a reporter went to the parents of the victim.
They said that while they still endure the pain of their son’s death, it did not justify an unfair sentence: “It certainly wouldn’t bring closure to me to see him punished as if he were the murderer,” the parent of one murder victim was quoted as saying
SB1437 is a just and overdue reform. We’re confident that California’s courts will uphold it.

Cutting cybersecurity post was 'shortsighted,' R.I.'s governor told

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE — Government watchdogs say it is “shortsighted" for Governor Gina M. Raimondo's administration to eliminate the state's first cabinet-level cybersecurity officer position at a time when cyberattacks are on the rise and the 2020 presidential election is on the horizon.
In April 2017, the administration trumpeted the hiring of Mike Steinmetz as the state's first cybersecurity officer and its homeland security adviser, saying that “in the ever-changing technology ecosystem, it is imperative that Rhode Island stay up to speed."
But the administration slashed his $184,446 salary from the budget and at the end of June Steinmetz left to join a Providence venture capital firm. Administration officials said Steinmetz had recently completed a “Rhode Island State Cybersecurity Strategy" and that other parts of state government would now handle cybersecurity and homeland security duties.
John M. Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, said the move runs counter to efforts by other states to bolster election cybersecurity. With the 2020 election approaching, the state's Board of Elections lacks in-house cybersecurity expertise, he said.
“It's not a time to be letting down your defenses," Marion said. “It is said cybersecurity is a journey, not a destination. It's shortsighted to eliminate an important position while on the cusp of an election. No less than our democracy is at stake."
Watchdog RI founder Ken Block, a software company owner who has run for governor as a Republican and a member of the Moderate Party, called the decision to eliminate the cybersecurity position “classic Rhode Island shortsightedness."
He said Rhode Island has had a poor track record with recent technology projects, including the state public benefits computer system known as UHIP (United Health Infrastructure Project). He pointed to the rising number of ransomware attacks against cities such as Atlanta, Baltimore and, as noted in Sunday's New York Times, Lake City, Fla.
“The complete nightmare scenario is happening in governments as we speak," Block said. “This is not something you can paper your way out of. You have to invest. You need the right people doing the right assessments. You need to implement changes, and those implementations can be expensive and extremely technical."
Raimondo's press secretary, Josh Block, said he did not know of any plans to replace Steinmetz. He said Steinmetz was “primarily tasked with" developing the state's cybersecurity strategy, which was released last month. He said cybersecurity “absolutely" remains a priority for the administration “and we have a dedicated team of people working to improve the state's cybersecurity efforts."
Rhode Island National Guard Adjutant General Christopher P. Callahan will assume homeland security responsibilities with a focus on cybersecurity, while Bijay Kumar, the state's chief information officer/chief digital officer, will continue to work on cybersecurity, along with the information technology division, administration officials said.
“Collectively, the Department of Administration has been working with the State Police, the National Guard and the Emergency Management Agency on a lot of these goals and recommendations, and that work is going to continue," said Brenna McCabe, director of public affairs for the state's Department of Administration.
In a June 7 letter to cabinet members, Director of Administration Michael DiBiase wished Steinmetz luck in his new role as director and general partner of College Hill Ventures in Providence.
DiBiase said Steinmetz “led statewide efforts to craft a cyber incident response plan with our agency partners, improved cybersecurity monitoring processes, and partnered closely with the Secretary of State's Office in leading a multi-agency group to enhance protection of the State's election systems."
Steinmetz produced the state's 36-page cybersecurity strategy document, DiBiase noted, saying the state's information technology division “will continue to improve the cybersecurity of our state's enterprise systems to ensure resiliency and protection of our data and assets."

Texto completo: Lauren Tarshis' New York Times-bestselling 'I Survived'series features resourceful young characters and heart-pumping action. Read the novels; then check out these great nonfiction titles to learn more about historical events.
"I Survived the Great Chicago Fire, 1871" by Lauren Tarshis; illustrated by Scott Dawson
Oscar Starling does not want to move to Chicago. It is ugly and smelly — nothing at all like the Minnesota farm where he lived happily with his mama and papa, until his papa died and his mama remarried an artist from Chicago.
The shock of moving from the country to a big city is bad enough, but Oscar has to set his feelings aside when a fire breaks out and threatens to engulf the whole of Chicago. Oscar doesn't have time to feel homesick — he has to find his family and run for his life.
Tarshis' fast-paced novel includes loads of cliffhangers. Readers will race through the pages to see whether Oscar and his friends survive. Historical notes nicely complement the story. This is a great installment in a great series.
"The Great Fire" by Jim Murphy
Newbery Honor author Jim Murphy brings his trademark writing style to this gripping nonfiction book that reads like a horror novel. Chicagoans' personal accounts and the city's history are masterfully woven into a compelling tale that shows the resiliency of the human spirit and the strength of community in the aftermath of a tragedy. Murphy even dispels the myth that the fire started when Catherine O'Leary's cow kicked over a lantern. (Fact: No one knows how the fire started.)
Loaded with maps, drawings and photographs, "The Great Fire" is a real page-turner. Want to read more thrilling books by Murphy? Check out "Blizzard! The Storm That Changed America" and "An American Plague: The True and Terrifying Story of the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793."
"The Great Peshtigo Fire: Stories and Science from America's Deadliest Firestorm" by Scott Knickelbine; illustrations courtesy of Wisconsin State Historical Society
Unexpected. Frightening. Tragic. Those are just three words to describe the Great Peshtigo Fire, one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history.
Although the Great Chicago Fire — which received much more publicity — happened on the same day as the Peshtigo Fire, the latter was far deadlier. By the time the blaze had died out, more than 2,000 people had perished.
Knickelbine's fascinating book is packed with facts, photos, paintings and Peshtigo residents' firsthand accounts of their terrifying experiences. A timeline and glossary round out this horrible, historical event. After reading the book, visit the Peshtigo Fire Museum (400 Oconto Ave., Peshtigo; peshtigofiremuseum.com).

Texto completo: "I feel that there is some sort of double standard for females in sports to feel like we have to be humble in our successes and have to celebrate, but not too much or in a limited fashion."
Alex Morgan
U.S. national team
The Women's World Cup final on Sunday will be one for the books.
The faceoff between the United States and Netherlands is expected to be an explosive finale after four weeks of some of the most competitive matchups in the tournament's 28-year history. And, it's likely that the impact from this year's tournament will be felt long after that final whistle blows inside France's Parc Olympique Lyonnais.
This summer's tournament is being hailed as a watershed moment for women's soccer and women's sports, with the U.S. national team steering the course.
The popularity of the women's game has grown in record-breaking ways in a matter of weeks, especially in the United States. The U.S. women's home jersey just became the best-selling soccer jersey, men's or women's, ever sold on Nike.com in one season, Nike executives said in an earnings call ahead of the United States quarterfinal game against France last week. Then on Thursday, ESPN announced it would bring the National Women's Soccer League, which features 55 players who competed in the World Cup, back on television, with plans to air 14 games beginning July 14 through the remainder of its season — capitalizing on soccer's momentum.
The league, which is the top professional women's soccer league in the United States, had been without a national TV partner since the beginning of its current season after A&E Networks and Lifetime prematurely ended a three-year deal that included weekly national broadcasts.
Sarah Killion, a midfielder and captain of New Jersey's Sky Blue FC, which plays in the NWSL, said teams should try and build off the momentum from the World Cup, and take advantage of the national attention.
"This is a time where we really have to seize the moment coming up because this could have so much impact on future generations of women's soccer and just the next couple of years," Killion said in a phone interview Friday, while traveling with her team to Chicago for a Saturday game. "If we can keep building the numbers and comradery around the sport, then it's only going to help women's sports and especially women's soccer just get into the next level."
In July 2015, after the previous Women's World Cup ended, Killion recalled the influx of fans who descended to Yurcak Field in Piscataway, where Sky Blue plays. She said fans flooded the stadiums to see some of their favorite World Cups stars competing for their local club. "It felt like we were playing in a World Cup in a sense," Killion said. "It was so much fun to play in that type of atmosphere."
One game could feel like another World Cup game in Piscataway. The Sunday, Aug. 18, match between Sky Blue FC, has Carli Lloyd on its roster, and Reign FChas Megan Rapinoe. That game will be broadcast on ESPNews at 1 p.m.
Bigger than soccer But this year's World Cup has the potential to propel women's sports beyond the field.
The U.S. team has made national headlines for weeks, all the while dominating on the pitch.
From the team's 13-0 victory against Thailand during group stages, to Alex Morgan's tea-sipping celebration after scoring on her 30th birthday in a semifinal match against England — several of the narratives around this team have shone a light on what it's like to be a female athlete competing at the highest level of your sport. "I feel that there is some sort of double standard for females in sports," Morgan told ESPN, "to feel like we have to be humble in our successes and have to celebrate, but not too much or in a limited fashion."
Rapinoe has arguably been one of the loudest voices on the team. The openly gay star forward has not shied away from speaking her mind. Her comments about not accepting an invite to the White House went viral early in the tournament, prompting President Donald Trump to tweet at her. Rapinoe has stood by her comments, and addressed critics in a thought-provoking, minute-long response to reporters this week.
Rapinoe has also been protesting the national anthem during the World Cup by refraining from putting her hand over her heart or singing along. She has been doing so since 2016, a nod to Colin Kaepernick, and in a recent Yahoo Sports interview called herself a "walking protest."
Once the tournament ends, the U.S. national team will be coming home to fight another battle: one for equal pay.
In March, all 28 members of the national team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit in United States District Court in Los Angeles against their employer, the United States Soccer Federation. The team alleges in the suit that, among other things, U.S. Soccer paid them less than their male counterparts, and denied them equal playing, training, and travel conditions. Last month, both sides agreed to begin a mediation process as soon as the women complete play in the World Cup, The New York times reported.
U.S. Soccer has long argued that any pay discrepancy is based on revenues generated by the teams — but a recent Wall Street Journal report, which examined the organization's financial reports, found that women's games reportedly generate more total revenue than U.S. men's games.
The outcome of the dispute, which has been a years-long spat between the team and its employer, could have ramifications well beyond the soccer world.
World Cup 2015, then and now This weekend, only one team will be left standing — the United States, who is vying for its fourth World Cup victory, or the Netherlands, who is playing in its first final ever.
Fans will have to wait another four years before they are able to experience it all again. The space between Women's World Cups, however, can be a time for growth for the sport. A lot has changed since the last Women's World Cup, some coaches have said.
Rutgers' head women's coach Mike O'Neill said during an interview at the start of the tournament that women's soccer has made strides since 2015, when the U.S. national team lifted the cup at the end.
"Women's football is in a better place today than it was back then," O'Neill said in June. "But it's also extremely important that they continue to put more resources in [women's soccer] ... After the World Cup is over, then expectations continue to rise. That will never change. I think that it's only going to get better, and better, and better."
Although fans will have to wait four years, the next tournament may be the largest rendition of the tournament in its history.
On Friday, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said he supported expanding the women's tournament from 24 teams to 32 teams, possibly as soon as 2023, the New York Times reported. The expansion would mean more opportunity for growth of women's soccer in new markets, and more prize money for the tournament's winners.
Another sign that women's soccer may be reaching new heights.
"I feel that there is some sort of double standard for females in sports to feel like we have to be humble in our successes and have to celebrate, but not too much or in a limited fashion."

How can presidential candidates be so silly?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- If California Sen. Kamala Harris is elected president in 2020 and reelected in 2024, by the time she leaves office 114 months from now she might have a coherent answer to the question of whether Americans should be forbidden to have what 217 million of them currently have: private health insurance.
Her 22 weeks of contradictory statements, and her Trumpian meretriciousness about her contradictions, reveal a frivolity about upending health care’s complex 18% of America’s economy. And her bumblings illustrate how many of the Democratic presidential aspirants, snug in their intellectual silos, have lost -- if they ever had -- an aptitude for talking like, and to, normal Americans.
Seven days after announcing her candidacy in January, Harris, appearing on CNN, endorsed “Medicare for All” and was asked: So, people “who like their [private] insurance, they don’t get to keep it?” She answered: “The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don’t have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. ... Let’s eliminate all of that.” More government, less paperwork. Really.
She subsequently, as The New York Times -- not an unsympathetic auditor of her campaign -- says, “waffled” regarding private insurance. But at the second Miami debate she raised her hand (“just as quickly as Mr. Sanders,” the Times reported) when a moderator asked: “Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private insurance in favor of a government-run plan?”
Harris also raised her hand just as quickly as Sen. Elizabeth Warren had done the night before, who exclaimed “I’m with Bernie.” Sen. Bernie Sanders is the purest advocate of a government-only health care system.
The next morning on MSNBC, Harris said “No, I do not” support ending private health insurance, claiming that she heard the pronoun “their” in the debate moderator’s question (see the paragraph above) as an ungrammatical reference to each individual candidate. This alibi might be less implausible if she had not recently said, in a detailed response to a Times inquiry about her health insurance policy, that she favored abolishing private insurance.
One cannot unring a bell and Harris cannot erase the fact that she has repeatedly said she wants to take from 217 million Americans -- 80 million more than voted in 2016 -- something most of them like. And she is striking at a core function of organized labor, which is to negotiate employer-provided health care as untaxed compensation.
Equally maladroit was her debate decision to wrap herself in an unpopular policy that ended 20 years ago. Nothing did more to fuel the conservative ascendancy in the 1980s than the 1970s enthusiasm of some judges and politicians for the compulsory busing of (other people’s) children away from their neighborhood schools, assigning children to schools on the basis of skin color in order to engineer a desired racial balance. In a 1973 Gallup poll, just 4% of whites and 9% of blacks chose busing from among a variety of means of achieving integration.
Yet Harris chose this issue as a cudgel with which to bludgeon Joe Biden. He, evidently lacking the courage of what once supposedly were his convictions, had neither the gumption nor the mental nimbleness to ask her whether, as president, she would favor reviving the compulsory busing of children away from homes that many parents, black and white, purchased because of their proximity to desirable neighborhood schools.
Biden is becoming a conviction contortionist, as with his retreat from 40 years of support for the Hyde Amendment. Suddenly he favors federal funding of abortions -- forcing many taxpayers to be complicit in a practice they abhor.
Many Democrats striving to replace Donald Trump are, while execrating him, paying him the sincerest form of flattery: imitation. He prepared to campaign for president by calling America a “hellhole” and he began his presidency with an inaugural address that his would-be replacements are mimicking with their versions of his trope about “American carnage.”
The day the Supreme Court held that “partisan gerrymandering” is not a justiciable issue, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, yet another presidential candidate, tweeted: “Make no mistake: the partisan gerrymandering SCOTUS just allowed is also racial gerrymandering -- modern-day Jim Crow. Just look at what happened with Stacey Abrams last cycle in Georgia.”
Abrams lost a gubernatorial race. How can a statewide race be gerrymandered? How can presidential candidates be so silly?

They begged Frank Lloyd Wright to build them a home they couldn't afford

Texto completo: Pope-Leighey House in Northern Va. remains an architectural landmark
Not far from the Pentagon in Northern Virginia, there is a small house nestled into a woodsy and green background - the kind of serene setting you'd imagine on a postcard.
Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Pope-Leighey House, as it's known in architectural circles, is a single-story home with a history both odd and a little sad.
While not nearly as famous as Wright masterpieces such as Fallingwater and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the story of the home is a remarkable, revealing tale that foreshadowed how many Americans live today.
It begins with a journalist at a now-defunct newspaper.
His name was Loren Pope.
In the 1930s, Pope was a copy editor at the Washington Evening Star.
"He's making $50 a week," said Peter Christensen, a longtime tour guide at the Pope-Leighey home.
That's certainly not enough to afford a Frank Lloyd Wright house - at least the ones he had been designing at the time, which would run about $650,000 in today's dollars.
But in 1938, Pope saw Wright on the cover of Time magazine. The splashy story inside was a celebration of Wright nearly completing Fallingwater, a summer mansion in rural Pennsylvania built over a waterfall.
In passing, the article also mentioned that Wright wanted to create Usonian-style homes for middle-class, regular folks - people such as Pope and his wife.
The couple, as it happened, were in the market for a home. They had just bought a plot of land in Falls Church, Va. Pope wasn't sure what style of house he wanted to build there. Maybe a classic Cape Cod with a white picket fence.
"Loren reads the article. He is smitten," Christensen said. "He no longer wants that Cape Cod. He wants something more interesting."
He wants a Frank Lloyd Wright home. Then, he lobbied the architect to build him one, appealing to Wright's extraordinary ego.
Pope sent a letter. "There are certain things a man wants during life, and, of life," he wrote. "Material things, and things of the spirit. It is for a house created by you. I feel that you are the great creative force of our time. Will you create a house for us?"
Three weeks later, Pope received a letter composed of one sentence. It read: "Dear Loren Pope, Of course I'm ready to give you a house."
There was just one problem: Pope couldn't afford its $7,000 price tag. No banks would give him a loan, so Pope persuaded his employer, the Washington Evening Star newspaper, to lend him the money.
(It is not known whether employees of The Washington Post have asked its owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for a similar favor, or what his answer might be.)
Once construction began in 1940, strangers would show up. In 2006, Pope told Blueprints Magazine that people would walk onto the property to see the construction.
"Architects would come by and try to pick up any sets of drawings lying around," he said.
The house - just one story - has two levels. A few steps down from the entryway is an open room with windows up high that fill the room with light.
The room is a combination of library and living room, with in-wall bookshelves on one end and a fireplace on the other. Nearby is a table for meals, playing cards or reading.
The floor-to-ceiling windows are also doors that lead directly to a patio, extending and combining the inner and outer worlds, a Wright obsession.
"He has this idea that houses shouldn't be a series of little rectangles," Christensen said. "He wants to break the box. He wants to integrate space."
In other words, he aimed for the kinds of open floor plans many home buyers seek today.
With its windows and vents strategically placed, and with the floor a concrete slab, the house lights and moderates temperature on its own. It was green before going green became a thing.
Pope's mind was blown.
"I thought Mr. Wright was a genius," he told Blueprints.
"That's what's so amazing about Wright," Christensen said. "He was doing this stuff 100 years before anybody else."
But even within the walls of an innovative home designed by a master architect, there are still the trappings of life - sadness, tragedy, regret.
Loren and Charlotte Pope, along with their 3-year-old son, Ned, moved into their dream house in March 1941. A few months later, Ned was playing outside one day and wandered off.
"That was my day off," Pope told The Post in an interview decades later. "I was walking outside, digging on something. He just sort of got away. I wasn't paying attention, I guess."
Ned drowned in a neighbor's pond. Pope blamed himself for the rest of his life.
He and Charlotte had two more children, but after five years of living in the house, they sold it. They had outgrown it. But the walls were closing in in other ways, too. There was a sadness no architectural detail could soothe.
"The day we left," Pope told the New York Times, "I sat on the fireplace hob and wept."
The new buyers were a young couple named Robert and Marjorie Leighey, who paid $17,000 for the house. They, too, faced challenges.
In the early 1960s, the Virginia Department of Highways sent a letter saying it was building a new road - Interstate 66 - and it would go right through the house. Robert Leighey had recently died, so saving the house was left to Marjorie.
She banded together with community members and even took her case to Interior Secretary Stewart Udall. Udall backed the endeavor, and in 1964, Majorie donated the house to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
I-66 was going to be built no matter what, so the National Trust did what any dedicated preservation organization would do - it moved the house about 20 miles away to Alexandria, on land once owned by George Washington's family.
That's right: They took everything apart, then loaded pieces of the house on flatbed trucks and put it back together. Amazingly, that wasn't the only time the house was disassembled.
In the mid-1990s, preservationists discovered the base of the house was cracking. So, the whole thing was taken apart a second time and moved 30 feet to sturdier ground.
No one lives there now. Everyone involved with the home - Pope, his wife, the Leigheys and, of course, Wright - is deceased.
The National Trust preserved most of the original furniture, appliances and decoration. Being in the house, you can understand how it might feel to live there - peaceful, quiet, even a little spiritual.
That is, until the phone rings. The original landline is still in the house. Christensen answered.
It was a robocall.

Texto completo: Moderate Republican Susan Collins generated both praise and blowback last year when she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a decision she says she doesn’t regret.
“I do not regret my vote in the least,” Collins told the New York Times.
Collins, 66, has served as a senator from Maine for more than two decades, easily winning her last election with 68% of the vote. Collins, a Republican in a blue state, has made a name for herself by reaching across the aisle. She is anti-abortion and a supporter of gay rights, but she faced scrutiny in Maine for backing Kavanaugh.
Collins’ seat has become a target for Democrats looking to make gains in 2020, with Maine’s high-profile Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon announcing that she would challenge Collins. In the interview, Collins defended her decision to vote for Kavanaugh, whose selection Democrats feared would spark a fresh battle over Roe v. Wade. His nomination was also beset by accusations of sexual misconduct.
She pointed out Kavanaugh’s record on abortion as proof she made the right decision. Although he voted to uphold a restrictive Louisiana abortion law, he voted against taking up a case that would have posed a threat to Roe v. Wade.
Collins said there needed to be more moderation in the U.S. Senate and said she was surprised that top Democrats were putting such an effort into challenging someone so willing to work across the aisle.
“I’m an important voice for the nation in an increasingly polarized environment,” she said. “There are so few members left in the center.”
“It’s ironic to me that I am among Chuck Schumer’s top targets when there is no one who works more across the aisle,” Collins said, referring to the Senate’s Democratic minority leader.
Despite the millions raised to oppose her reelection, she still is polling above the 47-year-old Gideon in what is a closely watched race. Story URLPhoto Caption:Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, speaks to reporters as she arrives at the U.S. Capitol building on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Chief During Turmoil At Children's Hospital Is Poised to Lead UNC

Texto completo: As the University of North Carolina begins its formal search for a permanent president, a likely top candidate is the former head of the state-owned medical system, which is now being investigated over turmoil at its children's hospital during his tenure.
Dr. William L. Roper, who since January has been interim president of the university, was chief executive of UNC Health Care when doctors at the institution's Chapel Hill children's hospital warned administrators that their young heart patients seemed to be dying at higher-than-expected rates or faring poorly after surgery.
An investigation published in May by The New York Times gave a detailed look inside the institution in 2016 and 2017, when cardiologists -- captured on secret audio recordings provided to The Times -- grappled with whether to keep sending patients to their own hospital for surgery and pressed administrators to provide mortality data they said they had not been able to get for several years. Since the article ran, UNC Health Care has temporarily suspended the most complex heart surgeries at the hospital -- a measure some of the doctors urged years earlier.
Dr. Roper, 71, said in a recent interview with The News & Observer in Raleigh that he and other top-ranking hospital officials had been "very much involved" in an internal investigation of the pediatric heart surgery program in 2016. UNC Health Care has said it determined at the time that the doctors' concerns were "unfounded." Dr. Roper has repeatedly declined to speak to The Times.
Harry Smith Jr., chairman of the university's board of governors, which chooses the president, said in an interview the group would "certainly encourage" Dr. Roper to apply for the university's top position. He noted that Dr. Roper had done a "great job" as interim president and had had a "very robust career."
Last month, UNC Health Care said that as part of its effort to "restore confidence" in the heart surgery program, it would create an external advisory group, made up of experts from several medical institutions, that would report to the medical system's board of directors. Dr. Roper sits on the board.
UNC Health Care also released data showing that the mortality rate for children undergoing heart surgery at the hospital rose in the years after Dr. Roper and other administrators say they did an investigation. The death rate was especially high among children with the most complex heart conditions -- nearly 50 percent. The health system had previously fought to keep the mortality data hidden, and released it after a yearlong legal battle with The Times.
The medical system is facing multiple inquiries and potential lawsuits related to the pediatric heart surgery program. The state's health secretary opened an investigation in conjunction with federal regulators from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Joint Commission, an accreditation body, recently visited the hospital as part of its own investigation. The results of both reviews are pending.
The parents of several children who died or suffered complications after heart surgery at UNC have said in interviews that they are meeting with lawyers to determine whether they have a legal claim against the hospital.
While Dr. Roper has not said whether he is vying for the job that would solidify his place at the helm of the entire UNC system -- which has 17 campuses with nearly 250,000 students and affiliated medical institutions -- he is expected to be in the running given his long tenure at UNC and his strong ties in Republican circles. The state's Republican-controlled legislature elects the two dozen members of the university's board of governors, who in turn select the UNC president. The board voted last month to begin the search process.
Dr. Roper joined UNC's Chapel Hill campus in 1997 as dean of the school of public health. In 2004 he became chief executive of UNC Health Care, dean of the medical school and vice chancellor for medical affairs -- positions he held until assuming his current temporary post this year.
Dr. Roper previously had a senior role at Prudential Health Care and led The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the early 1990s. He was director of the White House Office of Policy Development under President George H. W. Bush, after overseeing Medicare and Medicaid during the Reagan administration.
Dr. Wesley Burks, who replaced Dr. Roper as head of the UNC health system and dean of the medical school, has said the children's hospital will resume the most complex pediatric heart surgeries only after regulators and the external advisory board agree it is appropriate.
Dr. Burks, who serves with Dr. Roper on the medical system's board, was also involved in the 2016 internal investigation of the heart surgery program, Dr. Roper told the Raleigh newspaper. At the time, Dr. Burks held senior positions at the medical school and in the health system. He has also declined to speak with The Times.
Charlie Owen, chairman of the UNC Health Care board, declined to comment on Dr. Roper's and Dr. Burks's involvement in either the 2016 investigation or the current inquiry.
In an email, Mr. Owen said the board would "be waiting on the external review of the program" from the advisory board.
UNC administrators denied that there were any problems affecting patient care at the children's hospital in 2016 and 2017, saying only that there were difficult team dynamics at the time of the doctors' warnings, and that those problems were resolved by staffing and leadership changes.

Texto completo: Chris Cline, billionaire coal mining entrepreneur from West Virginia, died in a helicopter crash that killed everyone aboard in the Bahamas on Thursday. He was 60.
Six other people also died in the helicopter that crashed off Grand Cay island on its way to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Bahamian police said.
A statement from the Royal Bahamas Police Force said the helicopter went missing shortly after leaving Big Grand Cay and authorities and local residents later found the crash site two miles off Grand Cay.
According to a Facebook post by West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Evan Jenkins, Cline’s daughter also may have been one of the seven passengers who died in the crash.
“His selfless and generous support for programs and projects throughout the state improved the lives of countless West Virginians,” Jenkins wrote on Facebook. “His life’s story was one of hard work, love of family and caring support for others. ”
Heartbreaking: Newlyweds killed in helicopter crash while leaving their wedding in Texas
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice and Jerome A. Gilbert, president of Cline’s alma mater Marshall University, also expressed their sympathies on social media.
“Today we lost a WV superstar and I lost a very close friend,” Justice tweeted Thursday. “Chris Cline built an empire and on every occasion was always there to give. What a wonderful, loving, and giving man. ”
“Our hearts are heavy with the terrible news this evening of the passing of prominent Son of Marshall Chris Cline,” Gilbert wrote on Twitter. “Chris’s generosity to our research and athletics programs has made a mark on Marshall University. I am praying for his family. ”

Bahamian police did not provide a cause of the crash but said an investigation with civil aviation authorities was underway.
Cline began working in the coal mining industry in West Virginia in 1980 at the age of 22, according to The New York Times. He founded the Cline Group in 1990, an energy development group, and Foresight Energy in 2006, the Times reported.
In addition to creating a coal mining empire, he was also a well-known philanthropist and donor to the Republican party.
He donated $1 million to President Donald Trump’s inauguration event, according to the Open Secrets site run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign donations. He also donated $1 million to a super PAC supporting the presidential campaign of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in 2015, according to Bloomberg News.

Help the feds put a stop to the scourge of robocalls; CHICAGO TRIBUNE EDITORIAL

Texto completo: Robocalls come in all manner of teeth-gnashing manifestations. One of the latest: We answer a call, but suspecting a robocall, we say nothing. After a moment's pause, a voice says, "Hello?" with an intonation meant to entice a reply, a hello as in, "Hello? Why aren't you saying anything?" Then you reply "Hello" and the recorded robocall embarks on its spammy spiel. You'd slam the phone down if it didn't mean breaking the device's screen.
Federal and state authorities feel your pain. Teaming up with officials in Florida and other states, the Federal Trade Commission has announced a new crackdown on robocallers, targeting them with a series of lawsuits and settlements that included hefty fines and cease-and-desist orders. Defendants in those cases were responsible for placing as many as a billion robocalls, the FTC said. No, you did not receive the majority of these, it only seems that way.
In Congress, a bill called the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act has been introduced that would require phone carriers to offer to customers technology that would identify and block spam calls at no extra cost, The New York Times reports.
It's good that government is taking action, but we've heard this dial tone before. Authorities in the past have trumpeted crackdowns on the unscrupulous generators of robocalls. And? Like an epidemic unloosed, the robocalls continue. Which ones are on your hit parade? The credit card scam? The "can't miss" business investment? The caller pretending to be an elderly target's grandchild who needs money to escape some crisis? The "spoofers" who use your area code and prefix to hoodwink you into answering? "Hi! You've just won a free cruise!"
Robocalls do more than annoy. They trick people into giving up sensitive information, like Social Security numbers and credit card data. They scam people out of hundreds or even thousands of dollars. The volume of robocalls is eye-popping. An estimated 4.7 billion robocalls were made to mobile devices in May, The Washington Post reports. The FTC says it gets about 10,000 complaints about robocalls daily.
"We're all fed up with the tens of billions of illegal robocalls we get every year," Andrew Smith, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. Battling "this scourge remains a top priority for law enforcement agencies around the nation."
That's heartening, but it's going to take more than intervention from law enforcement agencies and governments to whittle down the scourge of robocalls. All of us potential marks must play our part.
How? There are call-blocking apps that you can download (some are free, some charge a fee). You can also sign up for the federal Do Not Call Registry, though the FTC reports that robocallers have figured out how to access phone numbers on that list. You can report robocalls to the FTC at ftc.gov/calls. And, of course, there are common-sense steps - hang up immediately on automated recording calls, and allow unfamiliar phone numbers to go to voicemail.
Marc Rachman, an intellectual property expert, told the Tribune's Corilyn Shropshire that federal authorities' efforts to combat robocallers is "like whack-a-mole." Shut down one robocall enterprise, another pops up. Authorities and telecom companies should keep up the vigilance, but so should consumers. Block robocallers, and report them. Let's all help put a stop to the scourge.

Texto completo: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Under pressure from the United States and a global watchdog group, Pakistan is prosecuting the founder of the Islamist terrorist group that carried out the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks on charges of terrorism financing, along with several of his close aides.
Officials said 23 cases had been registered against the man, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, and more than a dozen of his associates in Punjab Province, after investigations looked into two charities that act as a front for the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba group he founded: Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation.
Counterterrorism officials said these charities were involved in raising money for terrorism. A security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Saeed and more than a dozen of his associates would be prosecuted in antiterrorism courts on charges of terrorism financing and money laundering.
Pakistan formally banned the two charities this year. The prosecution of Mr. Saeed this week was described by officials as a renewed effort by the country to comply with the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force, an international terrorism-financing watchdog.
Pakistan is on the task force's so-called gray list, and risks being blacklisted, which would result in global sanctions if it fails to curb terrorism financing within the country.
It remained unclear whether Mr. Saeed, who was set free by a court in 2017, would face an immediate arrest. Mr. Saeed, who faces a bounty of $ 10 million by the United States for information leading to his conviction, is based in the eastern city of Lahore. India and the United States both accuse him of being the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, but several cases against him in the past were dismissed by Pakistani courts for lack of evidence. More than 160 people were killed in the attacks in multiple locations around Mumbai.
Pakistani officials say that India still has not provided enough evidence for Mr. Saeed to be charged and arrested.
Mr. Saeed remains a revered figure to many Pakistanis, and his followers have recently waded into politics, also. But electorally, his political party, Milli Muslim League, has not been able to gain much traction.
Earlier in May, the financial task force, known by the abbreviation F.A.T.F., issued a warning to Pakistan, urging the country to take decisive action against terrorism financing.
"The F.A.T.F. expresses concern that not only did Pakistan fail to complete its action plan items with January deadlines, it also failed to complete its action plan items due May 2019," the task force said in a statement. "The F.A.T.F. strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its action plan by October 2019, when the last set of action plan items are set to expire."
Western countries accuse Pakistan's military of continuing to nurture extremist groups as proxies against neighboring countries, including the Taliban against Afghanistan and Lashkar-e-Taiba against India.
Publicly, Pakistani officials insist that the country has changed and no longer follows that strategy. Both civil and military officials are on record as saying that the militant groups pose more of a threat to Pakistan's interests than they are worth.
In an interview with The New York Times in April, Prime Minister Imran Khan said that the decision to clamp down on militant groups was independent of any outside pressure. "We have decided, for the future of our country -- forget the outside pressure -- we will not allow armed militias to operate anymore," Mr. Khan said.
But there is still skepticism about those assertions. Pakistani officials have made similar promises in the past, but militant groups continue to survive various crackdowns.

Texto completo: A battle continues to rage between superstar Taylor Swift and the Nashville record label that introduced her to the world.
Big Machine Label Group announced Sunday that pop industry mega-manager Scooter Braun and his company Ithaca Holdings purchased the label for a reported $300 million. This includes the rights to the rich six-album catalog that catapulted Swift to becoming one of the world's modern pop icons.
The star wasn't pleased with the deal, posting Sunday to Tumblr a lengthy statement that accused Braun of past "incessant, manipulative bullying." Swift's digital megaphone snowballed into a celebrity division — Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato rising to Braun's defense; Halsey, Brendon Urie and Iggy Azalea joining team #WeStandWithTaylor.
Drama? In the music business? No, never ...
Here's how Swift, Braun and Big Machine became entangled in the latest saga of musical rights ownership.
What is Big Machine? In 2005, Music Row veteran Scott Borchetta launched a record label venture with three artists: Danielle Peck, Jack Ingram and a promising, albeit unknown 14-year-old he spotted singing in the round one night at Nashville's famed Bluebird Cafe: Taylor Swift.
Thirteen years, six Swift albums and dozens more chart-topping releases later and Big Machine now boasts a roster that includes some of country music's biggest names — Thomas Rhett, Reba McEntire, Florida Georgia Line, Lady Antebellum, Midland and more.
A decade into its tenure and the label expanded into a "music-media empire," the Tennessean wrote in 2015. By 2019, the label grew into digital radio, music publishing and cohort of imprint labels that crossed into pop and rock, representing artists from Sheryl Crow to Cheap Trick to alternative breakout Badflower.
All this, including the masters to Taylor Swift's first six studio albums (more on that later), comes with the $300 million purchase. Billboard estimated the label revenue ranges from $80 million to $120 million — averaging roughly $90 million to $95 million — in the last four years.
Borchetta, who started the label with the help of a $3 million investment, remains president and CEO of BMLG while earning minority interest in Ithaca.
Who is Scooter Braun? Braun leads SB Projects, an entertainment company that develops technology products and programs for television and film while managing pop stars Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepsen, among others.
Among stars with Nashville ties, Braun's company represents the Zac Brown Band and co-manages "Tequila" hitmakers Dan + Shay with Nashville-based Sandbox Entertainment. Braun's Ithaca Holdings renewed a financial partnership with Sandbox earlier this year, Billboard reported. Sandbox represents Kacey Musgraves, Little Big Town, Kelsea Ballerini and others.
Back to Taylor Swift ... Swift outlined her distaste to the $300 million deal in Sunday's Tumblr post, calling it her "worst case scenario."
Under the newfound partnership, Swift said that her "musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it."
Detailing that she learned of the news "as it was announced to the world," Swift writes: "This is what happens when you sign a deal at fifteen to someone for whom the term 'loyalty' is clearly just a contractual concept. And when that man says 'Music has value', he means its value is beholden to men who had no part in creating it."
Borchetta responded late Sunday with a Big Machine blog post that outlines text messages he sent to Swift ahead of the public announcement, contesting she heard of the sale as news outlets reported it.
Swift, who left Big Machine last year following her contract completion, "pleaded for a chance to own my work," but said that the label offered her "the chance to 'earn' one album back at a time" for each new Swift record produced.
Borchetta argues against Swift's claim by posting sections of what he describes as "deal points" to an offer for her to return to the label.
"As you will read, 100% of all Taylor Swift assets were to be transferred to her immediately upon signing the new agreement," Borchetta wrote. "We were working together on a new type of deal for our new streaming world that was not necessarily tied to 'albums' but more of a length of time."
Why is she in this battle? Masters! Owning a "master" of a song means owning the original recording of a song — and all copies that come from the original recording. As explained in the New York Times:
"The owner of a master controls all rights to exploit it, including selling albums or licensing songs for movies or video games. The artist still earns royalties from those recordings once associated costs are fulfilled, but controlling the master could bring greater income, as well as a level of protection over how the work is used in the future."
In owning her masters, Swift would reap the financial benefit and contain the creative control of how each song gets used in popular media. Under Braun's control, Swift argues the legacy of songs such as "Tim McGraw" and "Shake It Off" would be "dismantled."
Is it just about masters? As with most bad blood in Swift's universe, the riff between her and Braun spirals back to Kayne West and Kim Kardashian West. Braun managed West in 2016, the same year Kardashian West leaked the infamous "Famous" and West later featured a nude Swift lookalike in the song's music video.
On his accused bullying, Swift writes: "Like when Kim Kardashian orchestrated an illegally recorded snippet of a phone call to be leaked and then Scooter got his two clients together to bully me online about it. ... Or when his client, Kanye West, organized a revenge porn music video which strips my body naked."
What's next? The latest Swift music doesn't fall under Braun control. The songwriter announced last November a blockbuster deal with Republic Records and Universal Music Group where she'll own her future master recordings. Swift shed the typical two-year album cycle under her new deal, announcing earlier this month that, in August, the 17-song album "Lover" would follow late 2017 Buig Machine release "Reputation."
At Big Machine, Billboard reports Borchetta made a statement to employees that "the [label] will continue to operate at full power in our current image and completely autonomous in my agreement with the new entity. There will not be any staff changes."

Texto completo: Kitchen Social's many stations are warmed up and ready to go.
Since the south Fort Myers cooking school opened in May, students have gathered each week — couples on date night, girlfriends, corporate groups — to boost their kitchen skills and have a good time.
"I want people to come out and have a fun cooking experience with a professional chef," Kitchen Social's owner Charlie Ragle said.
"I want it to feel like they're at a nice dinner party, and the amazing meals they make at Kitchen Social they can duplicate at home."
That's one reason Ragle went with a kitchen setup that feels like most home kitchens, just larger. His cooking suites, tucked into the rear corner unit of the same plaza as Bonefish Grill on Andrea Lane and U.S. 41, has residential-style refrigerators and the same appliances that can be found in many home kitchens.
"I've taken a lot of cooking classes in the past that have that industrial feel," Ragle said. "People don't come here to get a cooking degree. They come to get some cooking skills, some knife skills, and to have a good time."
Ragle puts a high value on comfort at Kitchen Social. Each station is equipped with a professional J.A. Henckels knife set, an induction burner and a comfortable chair.
"I've been to cooking classed at other places where we were expected to stand on the concrete floor for three straight hours." Ragle said.
"That was not the fun date night I'd hoped for."
Ragle's been an entrepreneur his whole life, and though he worked in broadcasting and owned a trolley tour company in St. Louis, he's been attending cooking classes for years.
And taking notes.
"I kept a list of what I liked and what I thought should be improved upon," he said.
When he found himself in Fort Myers — drawn by the climate and a good friend who lived locally — he started thinking about his next business endeavor.
"A cooking school had been in my mind for years," he said.
"I kind of was taking a bit of a sabbatical, trying to figure out what next. I love fishing and boating. I love the water. I love the environment of Fort Myers. But I thought there was a lack of a variety of things to do."
So he pulled out his old cooking-school notes, drew up a list of ways to make the concept better, and started plans to launch Kitchen Social.
But first he'd need a chef.
After a cooking class in Naples, Ragle found a lead. He approached Chef Ed Fischer, explained his concept and asked if he knew any chefs in Fort Myers who might want a teaching gig. The two hit it off, and Fischer volunteered. Now, he's executive chef at Kitchen Social.
"Ed likes to say he's worked in every cooking capacity except for fast food," Ragle said.
"Cruise ships, golf resorts, hotel restaurants. He's very hands-on. Chef Ed makes it clear that people can ask anything. It doesn't have to be a class-specific question. He even gives out his phone number so that if people have a problem duplicating what they did in class at home, they can call him."
Most meals are four courses, and the appetizers are prepared ahead of time so people have something to nosh on while they cook.
A recent menu: white bean and vegetable salad with balsamic dressing, fennel and garlic pork-loin chops, rice pilaf and lemon sorbet for dessert. The school also offers homemade pasta classes, pizza classes, vegan classes and an entire class on preparing a proper English high tea.
Cooking students are welcome to bring their own wine, beer or other beverages, and Kitchen Social has plenty of wine glasses and bottle openers.
"It's comfortable, it's entertaining, it's delicious," Ragle said.
"I love people coming to me to have fun."

Texto completo: La Corte Superior de Nueva Jersey evalúa la posibilidad de juzgar como adulto a un menor que abuso sexualmente de otra menor en el año 2017, reporta The New York Times.
De acuerdo al relato, el juez encargado del caso decidió no juzgar al agresor como adulto ya que el joven tenía “buenas calificaciones y provenía de una buena familia”.
El agresor de 16 años para ese momento, abusó sexualmente a otra menor de la misma edad en una fiesta en Nueva Jersey. No bastando con eso, grabó la escena y la compartió con sus amistades acompañado de un texto que decía: “Cuando la primera vez que tienes sexo es una violación” .
Sin embargo, al juez no le pareció tan impotante ya que aleba que solo se trata de violación algún tipo de ataque hecho con pistolas por extraños.
El juez del caso, llamado James Troiano en ese momento aseguró que: “Este joven proviene de una buena familia que lo ubicó en una escuela excelente en que se encontraba excelentemente bien” , asimismo, manifestó que sus puntajes para ingresar a la universidad fueron muy altos, por lo cual, ingresaría a una “buena universidad” , relata la nota.
El juez, refieriéndose al mensaje de texto envíado a los amigos dijo: “Es solo un niño de 16 años diciendo estupideces a sus amigos” .
El caso ahora da un nuevo revés debido a que una corte de apelaciones de la entidad a través un fallo de 14 páginas recomendaró “no mostrar prejuicios hacia adolescentes privilegiados” , publica el The New York Times.

Trump and RNC report raising record $105 million in 2nd quarter of 2019

Texto completo: President Trump and the affiliated committees raising money for his reelection bid said Tuesday that they drew in $105 million in the past three months - a record-breaking amount that significantly widens their fundraising lead over Democrats.
The second-quarter fundraising haul reported by the campaign, the Republican National Committee and affiliated committees on Tuesday shatters his previous record of $39 million in a three-month period. It brings the money raised for the president's reelection effort to more than $270 million.
"Eye-popping numbers," Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Trump's campaign, tweeted Tuesday morning. "Shows the incredible strength of support for the President, his policies, and successes. On to victory!"
The official figures will be released publicly in federal campaign finance filings on July 15.
GOP officials said Trump's reelection campaign had $100 million in cash on hand.
Trump was expected to post his best fundraising quarter, especially given the big push around his official 2020 campaign launch announcement in June. His campaign announced drawing in close to $30 million in less than two days of his reelection kickoff last month.
The second-quarter figures were first reported by the New York Times on Tuesday morning.
Trump's reelection operation is financially dominating the Democratic field of two dozen primary candidates, who during last week's Democratic National Committee debate had their first national opportunity to break out from the crowded pack and gain fundraising momentum.
Incumbents always have a built-in fundraising and messaging lead. But Trump is unique in that he began raising and spending money toward his reelection far earlier than his predecessors.
In a show of force, Trump's campaign ran a banner video ad on the YouTube homepage on the first day of the Democratic debate last week.
Cheryl Hori, who runs the San Francisco-based Democratic digital strategy firm Pacific Campaign House, said Democrats need to pay attention to the types of advertisements Trump is spending his money on and how he is targeting his message.
"It was a power play," said Hori, former deputy digital director for Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action. "The amount of money he's willing to spend on the day of the Democratic debates at a time when all eyes should be on the Democrats is really significant."
The difference is especially stark given how fractured the Democratic presidential field is and how much harder each candidate has to work to raise money, she said.
So far on the Democratic side, two candidates announced their second-quarter figures.
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $25 million in the second quarter, a large sum for a newcomer to national politics. His campaign said it had $22.6 million in cash on hand.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) reported raising $18 million in contributions to his presidential campaign in the second quarter and transferred another $6 million from other accounts.
Former vice president Joe Biden suggested at a private Manhattan fundraiser last month that his campaign had taken in close to $20 million, which probably has gone up after a major fundraising trip he made to San Francisco at the end of June.
GOP officials said Tuesday that Trump and the two joint fundraising committees raising money for the RNC and the reelection campaign were responsible for drawing in $54 million of the haul in the second quarter, from April 1 through June 30. The RNC raised a separate $51 million, they said.
They said Trump's online fundraising spiked in the second quarter, with the committees raising more from digital fundraising appeals than it did over the entire first half of 2018.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES – A major supplier of body cameras to law-enforcement agencies across the country has decided to forgo selling facial-recognition technology with its products.
Axon, which supplies 48 police departments in major cities with body cameras, made the decision after the company's ethics board concluded the technology was not accurate enough to be implemented in the field and could potentially cause major trust issues between law-enforcement officials and their communities.
In a 42-page report, the ethics board detailed concerns with the inaccuracy of the software, saying results showed it was less accurate when identifying women, younger people, and "worsens when trying to identify people of color compared to white people, a troubling disparity that would only perpetuate or exacerbate the racial inequities that cut across the criminal justice system."
The board is composed of experts from different professions, including law enforcement, robotics and policy, and advises Axon on the potential effects its technology could have on society.
"Some police departments are sophisticated and would understand the limitations on (facial recognition) and would put their own guardrails in place around the use of that technology by their officers.
"But there are some police departments that would not take those same precautions and may not appreciate the implications of using a technology that's not ready yet for prime time," said board member Jim Bueermann, who was a police officer for more than 30 years and is now president of the National Police Foundation.
Axon CEO Rick Smith said the company is "moving cautiously" because of these implications.
"There are companies out there actively promoting using facial recognition on body cameras," Smith said. "From our perspective, we believe taking the time to do the ethical analysis up front in the product design process will have much better outcomes in the long haul."
Smith says the company might reconsider incorporating the technology in their products in the future once the inaccuracies are solved, but must balance that with privacy and safety and put in "safeguards" to avoid misuse of facial recognition.
"We don't believe that the right answer is that the police should deploy face recognition with no controls and go wild with it, but similarly we don't believe that it makes sense to say police should never use face-recognition technology because there's many cases where it's pretty universally known that it will be a good thing," Smith said.
Facial recognition has been a hot-button topic around the country as concerns about privacy and accuracy have made some cities skeptical of the technology, leading San Francisco to ban it altogether, with cities such as Oakland and Berkeley considering following suit. California may enact a statewide ban if Gov. Gavin Newsom signs the Body Camera Accountability Act this summer. The Somerville City Council in Massachusetts banned facial recognition just last week.
While these cities are turning their backs to this technology, others are welcoming it. The Orlando Police Department is testing Amazon's 'Rekognition' software, although not in public or for investigative use.
According to The New York Times, Detroit signed a $1 million deal to set up facial recognition in the city's surveillance cameras with broad rules on how law enforcement can use the footage.
Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, compares facial-recognition software to when law enforcement started using DNA testing as an investigative tool.
"There was a lot of concern then as well about 'the government is going to have my DNA, they're going to know all about me, how is this going to be used?' and I think today those fears have generally gone by the wayside," Johnson said.
Johnson says facial recognition can be used in the same way DNA testing is -- to confirm identities, solve crimes and exonerate the innocent.
"I don't think it's providing the government any more identification (information) than they already have," said Johnson. "I think if people are concerned about surveillance, they've kind of missed the boat."
Facial recognition is being used by more than law enforcement.
The New York school district will be the first in the country to deploy the software for added security, including to identify potential school shooters and sex offenders.
"AI is so powerful, it is going to be either the greatest or the worst thing we as a human species has ever developed, and using such a powerful tool, I think the developers of that should have a mechanism of objective, interested people they can rely on to say, 'Just because we can do this, should we?'" Bueermann said.

TEAM LOST DURANT, BUT STILL MADE SPLASH IN FREE AGENCY

Texto completo: Even if they lost Kevin Durant, the Warriors still made a splash in free agency. It involved a familiar star player that is often referred to as one of the "Splash Brothers." The Warriors and Klay Thompson officially agreed to a five-year, $190 million max deal after free agency began on Sunday. The New York Times first reported the news.
It is not immediately clear why the Warriors and Thompson did not agree to the deal as soon as the official free agency period started on Sunday at 3:00 pm PT. It is also not immediately clear if Thompson has any options or no-trade clauses on his deal. Nonetheless, the Warriors and Thompson kept their partnership as expected.
Though Durant left the Warriors for the Brooklyn Nets, the Warriors at least ensured they will have a third All-Star to complement Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. It also prolongs the likelihood that Thompson and Curry, the other Splash Brother," will spend their entire NBA career together with the Warriors. While Curry is under contract through the 2020-21 season at age 34, Thompson will under contract with the Warriors through the 2023-24 season at age 34. Unlike the unanswered questions about Durant's future, it appeared inevitable that Thompson would agree to a deal with the Warriors without any drama or problems to iron out. In an interview with Bay Area News Group last summer, Thompson said he wanted to be a "Warrior for life."
And why wouldn't he?
After the Warriors selected Thompson with the No. 11 pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, he won three NBA championships, became a five-time All-Star, set numerous shooting records and cemented himself as one of the league's best two-way players.
He downplayed any desire to have a bigger role on another team both in productive and attention, something that is not always possible on a star-studded Warriors team that also has featured Curry, Durant and Draymond Green. Thompson also loves living in the Bay Area, citing the region's people and outdoor sites as most appealing.
Thompson had even said during the 2017-18 season that he would entertain taking a hometown discount after seeing Curry, Durant and Green sign team-contract friendly deals partly to help the team maximize its roster depth.
Thompson's views changed this year, however, amid stronger awareness that any discount would not help the Warriors sign or retain another free agent. Since the Warriors are well over the salary cap projected at $109.140 million for the 2019-20 season, the Warriors also can only sign a player with through a taxpayer mid-level exception ($5.3 million) and veteran's minimum deals. The Warriors will also play in San Francisco next season at Chase Center, a privately financed arena budgeted at around $1 billion that will generate more revenue streams for the franchise and help then absorb luxury tax penalties.
Therefore, Thompson held firm throughout last season that he expected the Warriors to offer a max contract. If not, he would entertain offers elsewhere. The Warriors had signaled they would meet Thompson's demands, even when he tore the ACL in his left leg in Game 6, an injury that is expected to sideline him for at least half of next season.

Federal wealth taxes and the incremental erosion of liberty

Texto completo: A federal wealth tax is seriously being considered in the current presidential campaign.
The concept has been embraced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, former Congressman Beto O’Rourke, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Further adding to interest in the wealth tax is support announced last week by California philanthropist Eli Broad, and nineteen other American billionaires upon whom the tax would fall. Broad’s letter was published in the New York Times under the remarkable title, “I’m in the 1%. Please, Raise My Taxes.”
Sen. Warren estimates the tax will raise $2.75 trillion dollars in ten years. Economists have split over whether that is a realistic number, especially given the ability of the ultra-wealthy to devise evasion schemes for virtually any tax government ever proposes. However, at 50% compliance, the tax would still increase the annual revenue available for the federal government by almost 5%.
Whether this concept is wise should be analyzed under economic, constitutional, and liberty considerations.
The economics of this proposal depends on two factors. The first is the uses to which this money is put. Not surprisingly, the Democratic presidential candidates all propose spending the wealth tax on new programs; none proposes to pay back federal borrowing to reduce the debt. The economic benefit of each expenditure provides fair ground for debate. Preschool education for children whose parents cannot otherwise afford it may well generate long-term economic benefits. Giving the money to politically favored constituencies is less likely to do so.
The second factor is the dampening effect on economic activity from such a tax. Here, the wealth tax has an advantage over an income tax. People do less of that which is taxed. So, we can expect wealthy people to consume more and save less, given that every year the amount they have saved will be taxed anew. Sen. Warren estimates that only 75,000 families will be subject to her wealth tax. If they save less and consume more, it might actually stimulate economic growth. By contrast, an increase in income tax would, at the margin, depress the process of creating income—a much more damaging result.
A federal wealth tax might run into Constitutional trouble under Article I, section 9, which forbids the federal government from imposing a “direct” tax, except in proportion to each state’s population. A wealth tax is not proportional to population. In 1895, the Supreme Court held the federal income tax unconstitutional as a direct tax, not proportional to population. Proponents then passed the 16th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913, allowing federal taxes on income. However, in 1921, the court ruled the federal tax on inheritance was not a direct tax. One of these two opinions must be wrong.
My prediction is that the court will define a direct tax as one that is imposed without a person choosing to do anything. A sales tax, for instance, is indirect: it is triggered by the act of buying something; but a wealth tax is direct, it requires no action at all.
The most important concern is from the point of view of liberty. Sen. Warren was asked after the debate how the federal government could assess the value of individuals’ shares in private companies, fine art, or jewels. She lit up almost with delight to say that it would be easy to keep tabs on only 75,000 families. She appeared to relish the concept of government agents who would, year in and year out, make an inventory of all that some Americans possess. She evinced no concern at all for this invasion of privacy, the unfairness of taxing the same income multiple times (once when earned, then every year it was kept), or the evisceration of a notion that once we acquire property, we can depend on keeping it.
There may be little sympathy for the 75,000 wealthiest families in America; but that is how liberty is lost — incrementally.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump loves big foreign policy events that draw the nation’s attention to — well, President Donald Trump.
He went to London recently for the spectacle of dining with the queen, ignoring the fact that he could have no meaningful discussions with her government, which is in a state of transition, if not outright paralysis. He also savors his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin because the outrage they draw merely amps up the attention. But nothing is like his approach to North Korea, where he’ll apparently do anything, potentially even undermining America's interests, for the coverage it brings.
As the result of a tweet, which seems to be the foundation of a lot of his on-the-go policymaking, Trump met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un on Sunday to announce the reopening of nuclear talks.
To Trump, the get-together was a grand spectacle. Not only has he already become the first U. S. president to meet with a North Korean leader, he did so this time on North Korean soil, which is also a first. But he has been down this road before with little in the way of results. When Trump first met with Kim, in Singapore a year ago, he also drew the world’s attention. Then after a second meeting in Vietnam in February, the talks broke off. Now he’s at it again.
OPPOSING VIEW: For reasons good and bad, Donald Trump seems to have an affinity with Kim Jong Un
There’s more here than self-promotion, though. In constantly providing a stage for Kim, Trump is giving him legitimacy and global standing that he most assuredly does not deserve.
Making matters worse, Trump is, according to The New York Times, considering recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power and merely asking for it to freeze its arsenal, rather than giving it up. That’s a step back from where Kim was last year, when he promised to denuclearize.
Not that it is likely Kim would follow through with either. North Korea has a long history of reneging on pledges to eliminate or freeze its nuclear weapons program. These pledges go back to 1985, when it joined a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and 1992, when North Korea and South Korea signed a pact to denuclearize the peninsula. In 1994, it negotiated a deal with former President Jimmy Carter to freeze its program.
To give Kim so much upfront now, in hopes that he will reform his ways, is unwise. Other rogue nations will be encouraged to follow suit, developing their own nuclear arsenals and forcing their way onto the U. S. president’s agenda.
Indeed, Iranian leaders, who signed a deal to freeze their nuclear program in 2015, have to see the way their nation is being treated even as Trump coddles North Korea. Making a nuclear deal without weapons in hand has left Iran vulnerable to renewed sanctions from an administration hellbent on blowing up the agreement. On Monday, Iran’s foreign minister announced that his country had exceeded the enrichment caps set down by the accord.
Now, instead of one nuclear headache in North Korea, Trump's diplomacy has resuscitated a second, making each more difficult to address. So far, Trump's diplomatic moves in Iran and North Korea have shown great success in focusing international attention on the White House — but they show little sign of tangible nuclear progress.

Cracker Barrel calls for inclusion, diversity

Texto completo: It was so bad at Cracker Barrel in the early aughts that the U.S. Justice Department forced the company into a plan to end discrimination that violated the Civil Rights Act, including turning away black customers.
Even as recently as the 2016 election season, political pundits used the company as shorthand, referring to Cracker Barrel vs. Whole Foods counties. The implication meant rural at best and backward or alienated at worst.
So it was a surprise to many this week when Cracker Barrel came out with a crystal-clear denunciation of LGBTQ discrimination, issuing a strongly worded statement about why it had banned Knoxville pastor Grayson Fritts and his church members from using a Tennessee Cracker Barrel as a meeting place.
"At Cracker Barrel, we work hard to foster a culture that is welcoming and inclusive — we have a zero-tolerance policy for discriminatory treatment or harassment of any sort," the release said. "We take pride in serving as a home away from home for all guests and in showing our communities and our country that the hospitality we practice is open to everyone."
Fritts seized the national spotlight last week after the Knoxville News Sentinel reported about a sermon the Knox County sheriff's detective delivered while off-duty that called for the government to arrest and execute members of the LGBTQ community.
The spotlight turned from Fritts to Cracker Barrel after the company's swift response this week to his plans for a meeting at a Cleveland, Tennessee, location, and it illuminated a company that has made a surprising cultural turnaround that rejects discrimination of the sort it practiced in the 1990s and 2000s.
"We believe it's crucially important to foster this environment for our employees for many reasons," Cracker Barrel spokeswoman Janella Escobar told the News Sentinel on Thursday. "The guest experience should never exceed the employee experience, because our success begins with the employee experience.
"Happy employees create happy guests," she added. "We want our employee community to reflect the diversity of the communities we serve."
Dollars flow as diversity grows Those aren't just PR-friendly words. Since CEO Sandra Cochran took over in 2011, Cracker Barrel's stock has skyrocketed from about $40 a share to around $170, an increase of about 325%. Cracker Barrel has opened 31 new stores in the past five years, including seven this year.
Some social media critics have pilloried the company for selling out to political correctness, but many more restaurant customers, political figures and even a soda company praised the restaurant for taking a stand.
In a letter to Cracker Barrel, state Democratic Party Chairwoman Mary Mancini praised the Lebanon, Tennessee-based chain's progress under Cochran.
"Since you have taken over as CEO of Cracker Barrel, there has been a noticeable improvement in the culture," Mancini wrote. "The restaurants have become a more hospitable place for all Tennesseans, regardless of who we are, what we look like, etc."
Not long ago, Cracker Barrel would never have been held up as a model for inclusivity.
In 1991, the chain made headlines for ordering the dismissal of LGBTQ employees, according to a New York Times article. The company did not adopt language including the LGBTQ community into its anti-discrimination policy until 2002.
Former employees and customers sued Cracker Barrel several times for racial discrimination and racial and sexual harassment.
A 2004 Justice Department investigation found 50 of the restaurant chain's stores were segregating customer seating by race, serving white customers ahead of black customers or altogether refusing service to black customers.
That led to the company's five-year agreement with the Justice Department to implement nondiscrimination practices.
Huge gains in diversity scores Now, each Cracker Barrel restaurant prominently displays nondiscrimination signs, and Escobar said the company "actively focuses" recruitment efforts on "ensuring a multicultural and diverse employee base at all levels of the company."
The restaurant chain's scores on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index have more than doubled, increasing from a score of 35 when Cochran joined the company to a score of 75 this year. In 2008, the company's score was 15.
Cochran is the second woman in Tennessee to hold the office of CEO in a publicly traded company, and was named the National Organization for Workforce Diversity's 2016 CEO of the Year.
Three of Cracker Barrel's 10 board directors are women, and one is a person of color. Three women are also on the corporation's executive team.
The company boasts several employee resource groups focusing on gender, cultural and generational diversity, veterans and LGBTQ awareness and inclusivity. The LGBTQ resource group was named Out & Equal's 2018 LGBTQ Employee Resource Group of the Year.
Diversity effort includes suppliers, too Cracker Barrel also advertises a supplier diversity program. Escobar said the company does not release specific data on its suppliers, but said it has increased its spending with female-owned businesses by 130% since 2013 through partnerships with women and multicultural-focused nonprofit supplier diversity groups.
The company sponsors conferences and summits for the NAACP and has been a partner for the Middle Tennessee Diversity forum.
Additionally, Escobar said, the company works with the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Conexión Américas, the National Urban League and the Nashville LGBT Chamber of Commerce.
The corporation participates annually in Nashville's Pride Festival and supports the Out & Equal Workplace Summit, Escobar said.

Texto completo: SOMERVILLE – An honor fit for a Downtown Somerville staple, Verve was named New Jersey's best bar in a contest held by NJ.com.
"Isn't it beautiful?" said Verve owner Rick St. Pierre. "I'm just happy for those that were the visionaries and those that took that mantle to show Somerville as one of the best communities in the state. So that's what I'm happy about, it's a win for all of us."
In a competition determined by nominations, then months of deliberating on behalf of NJ Advance Media Reporter Peter Genovese, Verve was selected for its' "top-notch bartenders, inventive cocktails, convivial atmosphere and food the equal of — or better than — any area restaurant."
Across the street from the Somerset County Courthouse, Verve caters to all of Somerville with its decadent fixtures and ornate atmosphere. Some bars may be known for the loud music and weak drinks, but Verve brings a level of class back to grabbing an after-work cocktail.
"We have such an eclectic array of people who come here," said St. Pierre. "We're exposed to everybody and this place was always considered, even before I owned it, 'the center of the universe.'"
Verve also does more than its fair share to support the local community. The bar and restaurant supports local organizations such as St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center, Project R.E.A.L., The Matheny School and Zufall Health Clinic, just to name a few. According to St. Pierre, there's a fundraiser going on 'almost every month."
"I think that's what sets us apart: the people and what we do and the opportunity of us constantly wanting to provide a community center," said St. Pierre. "For me, it's great to be a bar but it's better to be a service to the community, that's the best part."
"I realized early on, being in a county seat, that there are so many local nonprofits and organizations in need of support," said St. Pierre. "It comes from my background — my mom and my grandparents always talked about giving back, but it's a way to give meaning to what you do. The more that we can produce and the more that we can give, the better that it makes me feel. It makes me feel like we have a purpose."
Aside from serving the local community, Verve also hopes to be a leader in innovative cocktails.
"We're really interested in the movement of zero-proof cocktails," said St. Pierre. "We want to be trend-setters in going into other alcohol uses, where we'll be experimenting with a lot of fermentation, zero-proof and also the different colors."
According to St. Pierre, when Verve first opened in 1996, they received a New York Times review that asked if Somerville, much different than the bustling downtown area known today, was ready to handle such a high-end restaurant such as Verve.
"The comment from the New York Times was, "As goes Verve, as goes Somerville," said St. Pierre. "I love that mantra because as we keep trying to improve, you know we're just a micro-example of how good this town is and how good the county is, so that's what I'm very proud of."

Brittany Howard, 'History Repeats'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Instead of making another album as the singer and leader of Alabama Shakes, Brittany Howard will release a solo debut in September. "History Repeats" is a deep funk workout, thick and crunchy, with Howard's staccato guitar and Paul Horton's squawky clavinet tossing licks back and forth. "I just don't wanna be back in that place again," she sings, but whether she's talking about personal or societal trauma, she plunges in anyway. JON PARELES
Willie Nelson, 'Come on Time'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Willie Nelson, 86, defies but calmly acknowledges mortality in "Come on Time." His lyrics tease time itself with puns -- beating time, killing time -- but eventually admit its ravages. Upbeat but never rushed, "Come on Time" -- one of three of Nelson's own new songs on his latest album, "Ride Me Back Home" -- faces reality with grizzled nonchalance. PARELES
Ellie Goulding and Juice WRLD, 'Hate Me'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It's eerie how effective Juice WRLD's melancholy sing-rapping feels when aligned with the aspirated chill of Ellie Goulding, a singer with a keen melodic instinct but not much vim. In this duet, they're well matched. Goulding's resentment is a little distant and processed, which is her wont, and Juice WRLD's is characteristically raw: "Tell me how I'm trash and you could easily replace me/Tell me that I'm strung out, wasted on the daily/Probably 'cause there's nobody around me numbing all my pain." JON CARAMANICA
Julia Michaels, 'Hurt Again'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Of course she knows better. "You remind me of my past/That's why I know that this won't last," admits Julia Michaels, the songwriter who specializes in the self-destructive pop bummer. On this song from her EP "Inner Monologue Part 2," her breathy voice bounces across acoustic guitar chords and a looping beat; with eyes open, she's "ready to be hurt again," wishing for the best while expecting the worst. PARELES
Daniel Caesar featuring Brandy, 'Love Again'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The way Daniel Caesar sings his way through a lyric is signature and poignant: He shows up, is emotionally present, and as his voice trails off at the end of each line, he leaves a gut punch in his wake. Caesar just released his second album, "Case Study 01," which includes this duet with the R&B star Brandy. She's a much more forceful singer than he is, so it's intriguing to hear her emulate his gestures -- in this tale of a connection that never quite takes, he sounds resigned, while she sounds like she's seething, but trying to keep it under control. CARAMANICA
serpentwithfeet featuring Ty Dolla Sign, 'Receipts'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Vocal harmonies twist and turn, completely a cappella (overdubbed) at first, in "Receipts" as Josiah Wise -- a.k.a. serpentwithfeet -- ponders a series of grateful questions surrounding "Who taught you how to love me?" and Ty Dolla Sign poses even more. A fitful beat, a few piano chords and some strings -- pizzicato and sustained -- drift in and out. Although there's no rapping at all, the cadences and origami-folded wordplay -- "chlorophyll" rhymes with "skills to steal" -- of hip-hop thoroughly inform this song. PARELES
Gallant, 'Sharpest Edges'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Gallant revels in masochistic romance in "Sharpest Edges." The painful edges are in the lyrics, about an irresistible femme fatale he finds he's willing to suffer for: "Are those 10 knives or your fingertips?" he sings. The pleasurable payoff is in the music, harking back to the 1980s era of Michael Jackson's vocal harmonies and Prince's synthesizers, all sweet, glassy smoothness. PARELES
Graveyard Club, 'William'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Minneapolis quartet Graveyard Club makes moody synth rock befitting its name. "William," a standout from the group's album "Goodnight Paradise," out Friday, is a brooding, yearning electro-goth song about reflecting on death to learn something about life. If it hasn't been plucked to soundtrack "emotional realization" moments on screens of all sizes, music supervisors are sleeping on it. CARYN GANZ
Blink-182, 'Generational Divide'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Forty-nine seconds! Very punk! In case you forgot! Blink-182 was a punk band! Not one of the great pop acts of the turn of the century! Punk! Say it with me! Punk! CARAMANICA
The Hives, 'Good Samaritan'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Did you say something about punk, Jon? I'll be over here celebrating the return of rock with the Hives, the dapper Swedish band led by the charismatic, daring and always precise frontman Howlin' Pelle Almqvist. In case memories are foggy: the Hives' "Hate to Say I Told You So" joined the White Stripes' "Fell in Love With a Girl" and the Vines' "Get Free" as the backbone of many a rock 'n' roll dance party in the early 2000s. "Good Samaritan," half of a limited edition 7" out Friday on Jack White's Third Man Records, heralds the arrival of the band's first album since 2012, due later this year. The timing couldn't be better. GANZ
Nella, 'Voy'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Javier Limón, who has won a Latin Grammy as producer of the year, has worked with singers who draw on the vocal catch and cry of Moorish-Iberian tradition, among them Buika from Spain, rooted in flamenco, and Mariza from Portugal, rooted in fado. He chose Nella, a Venezuelan singer living in New York who can convey flamenco tension even in a near-whisper, to perform a full album of his own songs. They are poetic outpourings of longing and resolve accompanied mostly by pristine acoustic picking, with Iberian and Latin American underpinnings. The title song, "Voy" ("I Go"), is about leaving everything behind; there's proud determination behind its delicacy. PARELES
Chick Corea, 'Duende'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
On his new album, "Antidote," Chick Corea revisits the celebratory vibe and some of the repertoire from "My Spanish Heart," his 1976 love letter to the traditional sounds of Spain: classical, flamenco and Afro-Latin music. He originally recorded "Duende" for a different album, but this 10-minute-long, suite-like rendering underlines the tune's Iberian angles, particularly thanks to Corea's zipping, two-handed piano runs and the strutting waltz rhythm carried off by the drummer Marcus Gilmore, sounding at once punctilious and free. RUSSONELLO
Florist, 'Time Is a Dark Feeling'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Emily Sprague moved to Los Angeles, leaving Florist's other two members in New York, and recorded her latest songs by herself. The result is the straightforwardly titled album, "Emily Alone," due in July. "Time Is a Dark Feeling" meditates on a separation from "somebody you knew and now you don't," with a bedroom-recording quietude, cycling through three picked chords with occasional ghostly doublings of voice and guitar. "These are the days like the deepest caves you would never dare to descend into," Sprague sings, but somehow she's consoled. PARELES
Abdullah Ibrahim, 'Song for Sathima'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This joyful ballad is a highlight from Ibrahim's songbook, and he makes it the centerpiece of his latest release, "The Balance." Devoted to his late wife, the vocalist Sathima Bea Benjamin, it was originally recorded for the pianist's classic album "Water from an Ancient Well," but here it receives a loving restoration at the hands of Ekaya, his current septet. The alto saxophonist Cleave Guyton expertly fills the role once reserved for Carlos Ward, building a solo of praise that spirals upward. At the end he never returns to the melody; instead his saxophone just glides into the horizon: a gentle wail, then a warble, then a stealing away. RUSSONELLO

Campaign against hate targets rural Minnesota

Texto completo: Victoria McWane-Creek, an African-American college administrator in Fergus Falls, Minn., recalled one of the more blatant acts of racism she encountered in the past year.
Her family was preparing a Labor Day picnic when a group of white men shouted "hey n -- -- -" before speeding off in an SUV.
"It's not so much overt acts of racism, some folks face just an atmosphere and culture of society that reduces the humanity of the other," she said. "Being whatever while black here is more difficult."
This month, in a classroom at the Minnesota State Community and Technical College, where she is the housing director, McWane-Creek had a literal seat at the table as Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison asked for ideas on how he could leverage his office to address incidents like hers.
Facing a rising number of episodes of intolerance against immigrants and minorities, rural Minnesota is emerging as a key part of state officials' search for solutions to hate and bias-motivated crime.
Ellison gathered educators, health workers and civic leaders in Fergus Falls as he begins laying the foundation for a working group aimed at improving police responses to
crimes that appear motivated by racism or other forms of prejudice, which increased 22% from 2016 to 2017, the most recent year for which state data are available.
While gatherings that address intolerance are familiar fare for public officials in the more diverse Twin Cities, Ellison found himself in the town of 13,000 about 170 miles northwest of Minneapolis at the invitation of Mayor Ben Schierer, who described curbing a rising tide of hate crime as "one of the most important issues of our time."
"Along with climate this is one of the important issues: how we deal with hate," Schierer told a room of about two dozen members of an informal "inclusivity council" on the college campus.
The visit reflects a growing recognition by Ellison and other state and federal law enforcement officials of the need for rural participation in combating bias in Minnesota.
Ellison's stop, one of nearly 20 community visits since taking office, came a week after a newspaper editor in Pelican Rapids -- about 20 miles north of Fergus Falls -- felt it necessary to respond publicly to a racist comment that had been left on the newspapers' Facebook page featuring a photo from the local high school graduation of several Somali students in hijabs beneath their graduation caps.
The managing editor, Louis Hoglund, wrote a tongue-in-cheek column mocking the commenter's assertion that the paper was "anti-American" for running the photo of the Somali graduates.
Just before Ellison's road trip, St. Cloud drew unwanted national attention in a New York Times report on unwelcoming sentiment cast toward Somali immigrants in that city.
But Ellison was careful not to paint all of rural Minnesota with the same brush.
"I think there is as much tolerance and intolerance in Greater Minnesota as there is anywhere else," Ellison said in an interview. "There are people working on tolerance in Greater Minnesota every day and all the time. It's just that they don't really get known for it."
'It's a linchpin'
McWane-Creek leads Fergus Falls' inclusivity council and said she is also organizing a rural equity summit next year, planned on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, to try to bring more people from across the state in on the conversation.
"It's a linchpin," McWane-Creek said of Ellison's visit. "That is where we can actually move the needle on the experience of people who are being 'othered.' "
Schierer is also promoting the importance of rural communities in welcoming new Americans, who will be vital to sustaining small-town economies. The turkey plant in nearby Pelican Rapids, for example, has drawn waves of migrant workers from Hispanic, Asian, Bosnian and Somali communities that have boosted the town for decades.
Joan Ellison, a founding member of the Pelican Rapids Multicultural Committee, traveled to Fergus Falls for the attorney general's visit this month, one day ahead of her town's annual Friendship Festival. The multicultural celebration had been a regular event for two decades until going dormant in 2011. But Joan Ellison, no relation to the attorney general, explained that the community revived the event after the 2017 white nationalist rallies in Charlottesville, Va., as a way to "make sure what happened there does not happen here."
The attorney general also heard concerns over a lack of diversity among teachers at local schools with 40% students of color. And McWane-Creek described how less-than-overt examples of racism can still erode the fabric of a community. Taken together, the conversation represented a local approach to problem-solving that Schierer is counting on to address hatred.
"I see it every day, I see that it's real and I see that it is something we have to deal with at the local level," Schierer said.
New role for Ellison
Ellison told the group in Fergus Falls that while their work felt urgent, "bear in mind we've been fighting this fight a long time."
Taking the lead on talks around hatred and racism has been a more natural fit for Ellison than his experience as the country's first Muslim congressman.
"I was put in this role of having to speak for an entire community," Ellison said. "And now, I'm still who I am but now I just get to be the A.G. And here's the thing: Talking about hate crimes, talking about Islamophobia and anti-Semitism is not anything that another A.G. would not do."
Still, Ellison is taking a more active and public stance than his predecessors on the issue, meeting with state and federal law enforcement officials and gearing up for a working group to examine possible changes to the law and codifying standards for police when they respond to reports of bias crimes.
Ellison's introduction to white-power extremist movements came when he was a defense attorney in the 1990s, representing two men who were acquitted after being charged in separate cases involving altercations with local white-power and neo-Nazi sympathizers.
As a congressman, Ellison also wrote letters to the military to express concerns over white-power followers being enlisted in the armed forces. He also wrote to former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to express concerns about armed anti-Muslim demonstrations outside an Arizona mosque.
"What's clear is these people are organizing," Ellison said. "They're here in Minnesota and they are violent and they're willing to stab and hurt people while hiding behind the First Amendment."
Ellison frequently cites examples of hateful extremism turning to violence, most notably a series of deadly shootings at U.S. synagogues and the New Zealand massacre of 51 Muslims that was livestreamed online.
In Fergus Falls, Ellison described his talks with law enforcement across the state as a necessary response to such attacks -- part of what he called "an international movement."
"In the age of the internet, don't think it's just over there," Ellison said. "It can be anywhere."

Texto completo: The Clippers will have to woo Kawhi Leonard without offering him an opportunity to play with Kevin Durant, according to reports Sunday afternoon by a variety of NBA insiders indicating he will be signing with the Brooklyn Nets, where he will team up with fellow free agent Kyrie Irving.
Durant, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the NBA Finals, reportedly will sign with the Nets on a four-year $164 million deal while Irving will sign a four-year $141 million max deal, per multiple reports. Durant is scheduled to make an announcement via the Instagram of his sports-owned business channel The Boardroom.
NBA free agency is scheduled to open officially today at 3 p.m., PT.
A pair of players with Clippers connections – veteran center DeAndre Jordan, a pillar of the Lob City era, and guard Garrett Temple, who joined the team last season after the trade deadline – also reportedly are set to sign with the Nets.
Brooklyn is making a clean sweep tonight: Brooklyn will sign Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan, league sources tell ESPN.
— Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) June 30, 2019
The Clippers will wait to learn the truth of reports that Leonard was going to leave the Toronto Raptors only if he could be assured he’d be playing with a “top-flight free agent.”
The Clippers reportedly had their sights on Durant, for months. In Brian Windhorst’s report for ESPN in December, he broached the possibility of the duo teaming up and noted that the Clippers would be able to create two max slots to allow it to happen this summer.
Of course, even with the cap space, Windhorst equated pulling off the feat to “pulling the sword from the stone.”
Durant, a 30-year-old forward who won two titles with Golden State, went on the record earlier this month to make it clear that he would make his decision independent of any of his peers intentions: “I can’t be recruited.”
Not that the New York Knicks, Warriors and Clippers wouldn’t join the Nets in making their best cases.
Reports were that the Warriors were set to offer Kevin Durant a five-year, $221 max contract, $57 million more than any of his other suitors, and Stephen Curry was going to help deliver the pitch.
The Clippers’ pitch also will include people that Durant is known to admire, including Jerry West, whose 2016 call to Durant is said to have helped persuade him to join the Warriors, and owner Steve Ballmer, who appeared on the second episode of “The Boardroom with Kevin Durant,” an ESPN series that debuted in February.
Furthermore, Durant’s familiarity with the Clippers organization extends to general manager Michael Winger and assistant coach Rex Kalamian, whose tenures in Oklahoma City overlapped with Durant’s.
And Durant, remember, raved about several members of the Clippers this past season, including their then-rookie backcourt of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Landry Shamet.
But, according to reports, the Nets’ offer and the chance for Durant to play alongside his friend Irving proved most enticing.
On Saturday, the New York Times reported Leonard – who also is a target of the Lakers, who cleared cap space this week in order to offer him a chance to play beside LeBron James and Anthony Davis – wants to play with a “top-flight free agent” if he chooses to leave the Toronto Raptors.
The Clippers also are rumored to be among the teams vying for the 76ers’ Jimmy Butler — who also has been linked to the Houston Rockets and reportedly is most interested in playing for the Miami Heat. The 29-year-old wing was mentioned in various reports as another potential option. An excellent two-way player with a drive to win, on paper he seems like a fit for both Leonard and the Clippers.

Texto completo: MÉXICO – Al cumplirse un año de su victoria en los comicios, el presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, usa los micrófonos como si fueran bombonas de oxígeno.
El contacto diario con los medios de comunicación es esencial en su forma de gobernar y, por el camino, el mandatario ha dejado algunas frases memorables:
– “Abrazos, no balazos”
Todo un clásico desde la campaña electoral, casi un mantra de cara al público sobre el que levitan sus intenciones de pacificar el país. En contraste, la presencia de la Guardia Nacional -un nuevo cuerpo de seguridad- ha sido vista como una contradicción a esta frase mítica.
– “Me canso, ganso”
Un popular apunte del líder del Movimiento Regeneración Nacional (Morena) que provocó las risas -tanto cariñosas como hirientes- entre los mexicanos. La usa para dejar clara su perseverancia a la hora de conseguir su objetivo de transformar México.
– “Yo tengo otra información”
La favorita del presidente cuando la prensa espeta datos o información contraria a su Gobierno. Con total confianza se le ha visto poner en duda a calificadoras financieras como Moody’s, Fitch Ratings o incluso al prestigioso diario estadounidense The New York Times.
– “La mafia del poder”
Según describe el filósofo esloveno Slavoj Zizek en su libro “En defensa de la intolerancia” (1998), el ejercicio político es auténtico cuando una “no parte” minoritaria pide ser “parte” rebelándose contra el grupo dominante.
En el caso de López Obrador, ese grupo dominante -al que finalmente derrocó- es “la mafia del poder”, un grupo de políticos y empresarios que durante décadas, asegura, controló México.
– “La prensa fifí”
Un término muy usado desde el arranque de legislatura, identificado inmediatamente como los periódicos que califica de conservadores y adversarios del presidente, del izquierdista Morena.
– “Primero los pobres”
“Por el bien de todos, primero los pobres”, exclamó el presidente durante su discurso de investidura en el hemiciclo del congreso de los diputados el 1 de diciembre de 2018.
Toda una declaración de intenciones sobre las prioridades de su Gobierno: eliminar la pobreza es erradicar el resto de males de México. Y que ha repetido en multitud de ocasiones desde entonces.
– “Limpiar las escaleras de arriba a abajo”
Una de las frases más socorridas del mandatario. Hace referencia a la limpieza de las instituciones, empezando por las altas esferas, para acabar con la corrupción que ha dominado el país durante los últimos años.
– “Me producen ternura, ternuritas”
De las más recientes, lanzada a sus adversarios con una media sonrisa entre pícara y retadora desde su bastión en Palacio Nacional.
“Me producen ternura, ternuritas”, dijo el mandatario, cuando manifestó que sentía cierta pena por la labor que ciertos opositores hacen cada día difundiendo calumnias sobre él.
– “No es mi fuerte la venganza”
Ante todo, la paz. Desde que arrancó su mandato, el líder izquierdista ha defendido que no realizará una caza de brujas contra expresidentes o altos funcionarios por presuntos casos de corrupción, y dijo que prefiere hacer borrón y cuenta nueva.
– “No tengo derecho a fallar”
La consciencia de responsabilidad y el enorme peso que asegura que acarrea sobre sus hombros se desprende de esta frase del presidente mexicano.
López Obrador es el primer líder de izquierdas en décadas que gobierna el país, y su ascenso vino a romper la dicotomía existente entre el otrora hegemónico Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) -que estuvo en el poder casi 70 años- y el Partido Acción Nacional (PAN).
Para López Obrador, no existe la opción de fallar a las más de 30 millones de personas que le entregaron su voto en busca de un cambio

Texto completo: Although the Crystal Lake Barnes & Noble will be closing its doors at the end of August, they will be bringing in New York Times bestselling cartoonist and author Jeffrey Brown from 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday, June 29.
Brown is the author of "Darth Vader and Son," as well as the middle grade Jedi Academy series. He was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he grew up dreaming he would draw comics for a living.
After spending college focusing on fine art and then receiving his MFA in Painting & Drawing from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Brown began drawing autobiographical graphic novels and realized making comics was what he should have been doing all along.
His books include graphic memoirs for adults, all-ages humorous parodies, Star Wars adventures, and the "Lucy & Andy Neanderthal" series.
In addition to winning the Ignatz and Eisner awards for his work, his art has been exhibited in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris.
He currently lives in Chicago with his wife, two sons, and cat.
Brown will be promoting his newly released book, "My Teacher is a Robot," an imaginative picture book about a kid whose creative outlook has everyone at school seeing the world through new eyes.
Fred does not want to go to school because it’s boring. Especially since he thinks his teacher is a robot. If only Fred could imagine a way for his day to be more exciting. An inventively funny picture book that celebrates the boundlessness of a child’s imagination and celebrates the teachers, families, and friends who get wrapped up in their fantastic worlds.
Many of Brown’s other titles, including the "Jedi Academy" and "Lucy & Andy Neanderthal" series, will also be available for purchase and signings.
Advance registrations can be made by contacting Kerri Connor at (815) 444-0824 or crm2959@bn.com.

Texto completo: Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
Pop & Rock
JOJO ABOT at the Sultan Room (June 29, 8 p.m.). The newest addition to the bustling night life scene in Bushwick, Brooklyn, this club tucked behind the Turk's Inn restaurant -- a tribute to a onetime Wisconsin supper club whose name it shares -- has had a busy first week of programming. On Saturday, it will host a release party for Abot, a Ghanian-born singer, rapper and performance artist whose music is grounded in bold visuals and tinged with Afrofuturism. Her new EP, titled "Power to the God Within" -- part of a series of multimedia exhibitions -- ambitiously continues the explorations of oppression, blackness and divinity that drove her 2017 release, "Ngiwunkulunkulu" (which means "I am God" in Zulu).

DRIVE-BY TRUCKERS at Brooklyn Bowl (through June 29, 8 p.m.). Politics and contemporary country music have an uneasy relationship, to say the least -- artists inclined to speak their conscience often do so at the risk of being ostracized by the genre's radio gatekeepers. This alt-country group from Athens, Ga., has long bucked the expectation of apoliticism, but never more willfully than on their most recent album, 2016's "American Band." Its songs, like "What It Means" and "Ever South," address topics such as gun violence and immigration. This weekend, they will close out a six-night run at this concert hall in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

EMPATH at Pioneer Works (June 28, 7 p.m.). This Philadelphia-based quartet makes songs that are as catchy as they are unorthodox. On "Active Listening: Night on Earth" -- their debut album, released in May on the queer-forward punk label Get Better Records -- the group splices pop hooks with hardcore fervor and New Agey embellishments, to delightful ends. Their appearance at this art space in Red Hook, Brooklyn, is copresented by The Baffler and will kick off Press Play, a two-day book and music fair. Empath will be joined by their label mates Control Top, a postpunk trio.

LIZ PHAIR at Prospect Park Bandshell (June 29, 7 p.m.). In the mid-90s, this renowned singer-songwriter became, as she told The New York Times last year, an "accidental feminist spokesperson." That was due to the release of "Exile in Guyville," a collection of scrappy guitar songs noted for what was then considered a brazen expression of sexuality and its condemnation of male apathy, penned in response to the Rolling Stones' "Exile on Main Street." More than a quarter-century later, Phair's influence is manifest in young artists like Soccer Mommy and Lindsey Jordan (Snail Mail), who once played in a Phair cover band. In Prospect Park, she appears alongside the punk shape-shifter Ted Leo and the wry songwriter Caroline Rose.

PHONY PPL at Mercury Lounge (June 29-30, 7:30 p.m.). Though all five members of this Brooklyn-based group are under 30, they've been playing together for more than a decade. Since forming in 2008, the band has gone through lineup changes and lulls, and several members have explored side projects; still, their chemistry is stronger than ever on "mo'za-ik," their sixth album, released in October. The record traverses dreamy R&B ("Way Too Far"), playful hip-hop ("Before You Get a Boyfriend") and politically charged soul ("on everythinG iii love"). Expect them to play selections from the album during their two-night stand at this club on the Lower East Side. Saturday night's performance is sold out, but tickets remain for Sunday.

SCREAMING FEMALES at Industry City (June 28, 8 p.m.). Hailing from nearby New Brunswick, N.J., this experimental rock band has been a commanding presence in alternative music circles. Fourteen years after their founding and long after graduating to bigger stages, they retain the punk ethos of a group that came up through basements and other D.I.Y. hot spots. For this show, presented by City Farm as part of its summer series, they will be joined by Swearin', the band fronted by Allison Crutchfield and Kyle Gilbride. The group split in 2015 but reunited in late 2017 and last year released "Fall Into the Sun," a bright, galloping, guitar-driven album on which both singers ponder the passage of time.

OLIVIA HORN
Jazz
STANLEY COWELL at Smoke (June 28-29, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Cowell can make the piano dance by playing in a jaggy rhythm, or simply by manipulating the tone of his harmonies, or by throwing his right and left hands into a thrashing repartee. This weekend run is billed as a look back at his 60-year career, and there's a lot to celebrate: He came into the jazz consciousness in the 1960s, turning heads with his idiosyncratic style and bold compositional voice; co-founded the influential, independent label Strata-East; and has continued expanding ever since, composing short pieces and long suites, and sometimes experimenting with electronics. Joining him at Smoke are the trumpeter Freddie Hendrix, the saxophonist and flutist Bruce Williams, the bassist Tom DiCarlo and the drummer Vince Ector.
212-864-6662, smokejazz.com
JEROME HARRIS QUARTET at Bar Lunático (July 1, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). For much of the 1980s and '90s, Harris served as the guitarist in Sonny Rollins's band, while also establishing himself as a mainstay of New York's improvising avant-garde. Harris -- who doubles on bass and has conducted scholarly inquiries into some remote corners of the black-music lineage -- draws no clear lines of demarcation between African song, mainstream jazz and the avant-garde. He is most often heard as a side musician, but at Lunático he'll lead a group featuring Jeremy Udden on alto sax, Dave Baron on bass and Lucianna Padmore on drums, with Harris handling guitar and vocals.

SEAN JONES at Dizzy's Club (June 27-29, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). You're hard-pressed to find a straight-ahead jazz trumpeter with a more powerfully satisfying style: Jones plays with a smoky, magnetic grace, born of his boisterous disposition and almost total command. Through Saturday, he will celebrate the life and legacy of Dizzy Gillespie (the trumpeter for whom the club is named) with "Dizzy Spellz," a program he wrote with the dancer and vocalist Brinae Ali that addresses how this bebop pioneer interacted with the cultural and spiritual questions of his time. Jones will be joined by Ali, the turntablist Wendel Patrick, the pianist Zaccai Curtis, the bassist Boris Kozlov and the drummer Obed Calvaire.
212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys
ANAÏS MAVIEL at Roulette (June 28, 8 p.m.). A rising vocalist, movement artist and multi-instrumentalist, Maviel is one of two 2019 Van Lier fellows at Roulette. In that capacity she is preparing and performing new works throughout the year, and on Friday she will present "Time Is Due," which she calls an "operatic installation" for an electroacoustic ensemble. It interrogates the concepts of coexistence and interdependence, using music as both an embodied concern and a metaphor. Maviel will take the stage with five other vocalists, all of whom will also be playing keyboards and percussion instruments, some of them custom-made by Jonatan Malm.
917-267-0368, roulette.org
WILLIAM PARKER'S IN ORDER TO SURVIVE at ShapeShifter Lab (July 1, 7:15 p.m.). The banner-carrying bass elder of New York's free-jazz community, Parker has been performing and recording prolifically since the 1970s, when he began working with the eminent pianist Cecil Taylor and established himself on the bustling loft-jazz scene. For over 25 years, Parker has led In Order to Survive, a quartet of all-stars from his avant-garde generation currently featuring the alto saxophonist Rob Brown, the pianist Cooper-Moore and the drummer Hamid Drake.

WADADA LEO SMITH at the Stone (through June 29, 8:30 p.m.). This inimitable trumpeter is in the midst of an extended late-career boom, putting out mind-altering material at a rapid clip, in a range of formats. In all his work, what stays constant is the heavy, sighing power of Smith's expression -- a physical and calming force, speaking of poise and forbearance -- as well as restless vision. His residency at the Stone this week presents a chance to hear a number of his projects over the span of a few days. On Thursday he performs a tribute to the drummer Ed Blackwell, in duet with Pheeroan akLaff, on Friday he presents his composition "Red Autumn Gold/Silence," joined by two cellists and two pianists, and on Saturday he appears with an eight-piece electroacoustic ensemble, playing a piece titled "Ritual Light, a Cosmic Luminous Wave-Field."

Meharry Medical College Accepts Juul's Sponsorship

Texto completo: Meharry Medical College, a 143-year-old historically Black institution in Tennessee, announced that it received its second-largest grant ever from e-cigarette company Juul Labs.
The $7.5 million grant received much backlash from African American health experts and activists due to Black people in the United States having a higher death rate from tobacco-related illnesses like cancer or stroke, than any other ethnic and racial groups.
The money will be used to start a center to study public health issues that affect African Americans. Research into the health effects of tobacco products was the first order of study for the new center, including studies about newer nicotine delivery systems such as vaping devices.
The announcement caused concern among Black public health leaders, who remember tobacco industries targeting Black communities with menthol cigarettes, a process that seems to be mimicked now through the amount of support Juul has provided the community.
Juul, which is now partially owned by tobacco industry giants Altria, hired numerous leaders with close ties to the Black community as consultants and lobbyists over the past year, including Benjamin Jealous, former head of the NAACP.
Juul contributed to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and to the National Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA), a trade group for African-American community newspapers. In an interview with the New York Times, LaTroya Hester, spokeswoman for the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network (NAAT-PN), said, "Juul doesn't have African Americans' best interest in mind. The truth is that Juul is a tobacco product, not much unlike its demon predecessors."
However, Meharry officials have stressed that they were the ones to approach Juul and the college's president, James E.K. Hildreth Sr., has stated to the Times that he was confident that the new center's work would be free of Juul's influence. The college has not received any explicit instructions or conditions for the grant, or any research conducted with the money from Juul.
"We have historically found ourselves occupying the last seat at the table when research is conducted on emerging public health issues that profoundly affect minority communities," Hildreth wrote in a letter to the Meharry community. "We have paid a price for being shut out."

NRA splits with PR firm amid infighting

Texto completo: Infighting at the National Rifle Association exploded Wednesday, when the powerful association severed ties with its longtime public relations firm, suspended operations of its fiery online TV station and lost its top lobbyist.
The latest turmoil emerged just a year before the critical 2020 presidential elections when the NRA's ability to influence the outcome could decide the fate of gun rights.
Lobbyist Chris Cox, long viewed as the likely successor to longtime CEO Wayne LaPierre, was placed on administrative leave about a week ago by the NRA, which claimed he was part of a failed attempt to extort LaPierre and push him out.
It also came within hours of the association officially severing ties with Ackerman McQueen, the Oklahoma-based public relations firm that has shaped some of the NRA's most memorable messages in the past decades.
Cox had been the executive director of the NRA's lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, since 2002. He was credited with leading efforts to allow a decadelong ban on "assault weapons to expire in 2004, an achievement that allowed the gun industry to resume selling what the industry calls "modern sporting rifles and critics claim are used too often to exact mass carnage.
His resignation was confirmed by NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. No other comment was immediately made about his departure.
Cox did not immediately return a message seeking comment. However, when he was suspended, Cox said in a statement obtained by The New York Times that allegations he had been part of a group seeking LaPierre's ouster were "offensive and patently false.
"For 24 years I have been a loyal and effective leader in this organization, he said.
Cox played his usual prominent role at the NRA's annual meeting in Indianapolis in April, and there was little public evidence that he and LaPierre or the NRA's board of directors were at odds. Infighting spilled out during what is normally a pep rally of sorts among gun-rights enthusiasts when Oliver North, then the NRA president, threatened to expose questionable personal and travel expenses unless LaPierre stepped down. Instead, LaPierre turned the tables on North and accused him of trying to extort him into submission.
Joel Friedman, a longtime NRA board member, told The Associated Press his first reaction when he heard that Cox was stepping down was surprise. He said he saw no indications during the annual meeting that Cox was in a dispute with LaPierre.
LaPierre announced Cox's resignation in an email sent Wednesday to staff and NRA board members that was obtained by the AP. The letter also said an investigation will continue into allegations that North sought to extort LaPierre and that the storied Marine veteran was aided by Cox, a claim first laid out in a lawsuit filed June 19.
In the past few months, the NRA has filed several lawsuits against Ackerman McQueen, accusing it of refusing to document its billings and of seeking to undermine the association. Ackerman McQueen has countersued, claiming the NRA is trying to renege on its financial obligations and smear the public relations firm.
Last year, NRA began asking all of its vendors for detailed documentation about its billings after New York authorities began threatening to investigate the NRA's nonprofit status. The NRA was founded shortly after the Civil War and is chartered in New York, giving that state broad authority to investigate its operations.
During its two decades by the NRA's side, Ackerman McQueen was responsible for crafting the association's aggressive messaging, including the now-famous "From my cold dead hands line uttered by actor Charlton Heston in 2000 as he vowed to resist any effort to take away his guns. The line became a rallying cry for gun owners around the country.
Ackerman McQueen also created and operated NRATV. In a statement posted Wednesday on the NRA website, LaPierre said it would no longer be airing live programming and would be evaluating the station's future. It wasn't clear what would happen to its prominent hosts but there appeared to be no signs those on-air personalities, who are employees of Ackerman McQueen, would find spots at the NRA.
In a lawsuit, the NRA said some of its members had questioned NRATV's weighing in on "topics far afield of the Second Amendment.
In a statement Wednesday, Ackerman McQueen accused the NRA of trying to avoid its financial obligations by shuttering NRATV and implied its financial woes are partly the result of now paying for high-priced lawyers.
"When given the opportunity to do the right thing, the NRA once again has taken action that we believe is intended to harm our company even at the expense of the NRA itself, the company said.
"For Ackerman McQueen, it is time to move on to a new chapter without the chaos that has enveloped the NRA, the statement continued. "Ackerman McQueen will continue to fight against the NRA's repeated violations of its agreement with our company with every legal remedy available to us, but we will always be proud of the work that we completed during our 38-year relationship on behalf of the individual citizens that are the NRA.

Film festival lineup includes music panel

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — The lineup of offerings for the inaugural Four Corners Film Festival in September continues to grow.
The festival, which will take place Sept. 10-15 at the Totah Theater and the Farmington Civic Center, will feature film screenings, panel discussions, workshops, an awards ceremony, a fashion show and parties. It is being organized by local independent filmmaker Brent Garcia.
Garcia said last week that nearly 270 films had been submitted for inclusion in the festival.
"So we're going to have a really good offering of films this year," he said.
A recent addition to the festival's offerings is a music production panel that will include some industry heavyweights discussing the licensing of music for films. Garcia said the panel will feature TJ Chapman, industry executive, artist manager and tastemaker; Issy Sanchez, a 40-year music industry veteran and president of Music IS Entertainment; Soren Baker, a journalist who writes about hip hop and sports, and whose work has been featured in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune; and Steve Migliore, a.k.a, Mr. Mig, a producer, composer and DJ who has worked with artists ranging from Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Britney Spears to Adele, LeAnn Rimes and Usher.
"That panel's going to be exceptional," Garcia said.
Also taking part in the festival will be Farmington native John Austin, a.k.a. Poppin John, an internationally known dancer who recently advanced to the division finals on the NBC-TV series "World of Dance" before being eliminated. Austin will perform during a fashion show that Garcia promises will be a full theatrical production.
The reception to the festival has been very encouraging, he said, explaining he is very pleased with the quality of industry professionals who have agreed to take part and the sponsorship it has drawn from local businesses.
"For our first year, it's massive," he said. "We have an overwhelming amount of support from the businesses in the community to the city and the county."
Garcia acknowledged that the recent media attention and social media buzz that developed when two large film productions — a sequel to "Jumanji" starring Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart, and "Bios," a sci-fi drama starring Tom Hanks — shot footage in the Shiprock area may have helped his cause considerably.
"Certainly, the bigger productions coming in helped validate (the idea that the film industry can have a significant impact on San Juan County)," he said, adding that his film production company has been in communication with producers of a handful of smaller-budget projects — somewhere in the low seven figures — who are interested in shooting in San Juan County next spring.
A committee of nearly three dozen people has been planning the festival, Garcia said, and several subcommittees are focusing on specific areas. Garcia said that has allowed his full-time team from the Film Four Corners organization to avoid becoming overwhelmed as the festival approaches.
"A lot of businesses are throwing people at us," he said, describing offers of free manpower. "There's been a ton of support, so it's made it much more manageable for me and my team."
Garcia said he has been pleasantly surprised at how local businesses and residents have responded to the festival, given the fact that many of them have no familiarity with such events.
"It's more than I expected for our first year," he said of the financial and volunteer support. "It really took us four and a half or five months just to properly present it to people."
The preparations for the festival have gone so smoothly that Garcia said it has led to plans for another major event in Farmington early in 2020. When Civic Center supervisor Randy West approached Garcia with the idea of holding a comic convention at the facility, Garcia jumped on the idea. Plans for the event are being formalized, with an eye toward staging it in early January.
"We're anticipating 1,000 or more people for the film festival," Garcia said. "And we'll probably have more for the comic con. Between those, we'll have a couple of good events that will drive business to downtown."
Garcia said he has spoken to filmmakers from as far away as Boston and Atlanta who already are making plans to attend the film festival. He believes the event will be an even easier sell next year when organizers have the inaugural event under their belt.
"I think next year we'll have people calling us and asking how to get involved," he said.

Texto completo: Valerie Kosson doesn't have a memory of her birth, but she knows the story well:
"It was a life-threatening situation."
"I was holding onto life by a thread."
"I was truly considered a miracle baby."
Her story was chronicled by the New York Times and Huffpost. Her own mother, Robin Spielberg, gave a talk about it to a TEDx audience 10 years ago.
This time, Kosson will take the stage in Lancaster to tell her own story - the tale of a little baby born too early and so tiny that her mother's wedding ring fit around her hand. It's what happens after the miracle, when that micro-preemie grows up to navigate a world of people who don't know about her fragile start and don't understand that the challenges didn't end when she survived.
"They said she wouldn't walk or talk," Spielberg said. She could get cerebral palsy and would never be able to attend a public school, her parents were told.
She shattered all those theories. She learned to walk and talk and thrive so well that she eventually graduated magna cum laude from Susquehannock High School two years ago and played in the York Junior Symphony. At 20, she's going into her junior year as a music performance major at Lebanon Valley College, where she plays the marimba in and sings in the chorus.
But that's what can be seen and measured. She also carries lifelong challenges that aren't apparent to her classmates, teachers, casual friends or complete strangers. They're called invisible disabilities.
Her fragile beginning Spielberg and her husband, Larry Kosson, hadn't even considered names for the twin girls they were expecting in 1998. Spielberg wasn't even six months pregnant when she went into labor, she said.
One of their daughters, Clara Kosson, didn't survive, but Valerie did. To ensure that, a nurse put her finger on the scale to make Val 17 ounces, rather than 12. Babies at that time weren't given life-saving measures when they weighed less than 1 pound, Spielberg said.
Their newborn lived in an intensive care unit with beeping monitors and bright lights. Spielberg, an author, composer and pianist, asked if she could play recorded music to her baby. When the music played, they watched her vital signs improve along with the babies in earshot of the sound, said Spielberg, who is now a spokesperson for the American Music Therapy Association.
Kosson's premature birth caused a number of issues to be revealed: epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, ADHD, problems with short-term memory, an inability to understand the passage of time, and no nerve endings in her stomach, which has meant no hunger signals, Spielberg said.
She has now grown out of the epilepsy, but her brain remains challenged. She sometimes doesn't understand a statement or a question, almost like a foreign language is being spoken. It doesn't make sense to her on first pass, which has been a handicap, on occasion, in school.
"You think I'm fine, but I'm not," Kosson said.
Invisible disabilities Kosson held in her tears recently as she and her mom visited the newborn intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins Children's Hospital.
She looked at the tiny babies and knew that life beyond the hospital has great shining moments when gracious, kind, compassionate people lift you up, but she also knows what might await those fragile lives: There are dark moments, when the world occasionally feels like it's pushing you down instead.
In high school, Kosson went dark on social media for two years because she often felt left out, she said.
"My classmates laughed at me, dismissed me. They didn't care," she said. "They didn't include me in their groups."
For any teenager, those feelings of exclusion are hurtful. For a young girl with disabilities, they are just one more burden.
To enter Lebanon Valley College, Kosson had to take the SATs, where strangely worded questions didn't compute in her head. She wrote a letter to the College Boards about the poorly phrased questions that left her with a low SAT score; she didn't receive a response, but she got into college anyway.
"Fortunately, the admissions staff at LVC could see past my test scores," Kosson said.
'Have compassion' It was sophomore year at LVC when Kosson felt the sting of a classmate's laughter. She had raised her hand to answer a question, eager to join the banter with her professor.
The answer was incorrect. No big deal for Kosson, but a classmate beside her laughed.
"I was dazed for the rest of the class," she said. Then, there were tears, a call to Mom, a talk with the professor; then, too defeated by the unkindness, she didn't want to participate in class.
So, when she was asked to participate in TEDxYouth in Lancaster June 30, she knew what she wanted to say.
"Give more of yourself than you're used to," she will tell her audience. "How do you know if someone you know has invisible disabilities? You don't. ... That's why it's important we have compassion."
Compassion. Like her music teacher from Southern York County Schools, James McGarvey. He built a platform for Kosson as a young girl, so she could play the marimba with ease. He is patient and kind to her, so she has invited him to hear her speech.
And there's her best friend and college roommate, Chloe Kline, who lifts her spirit in the toughest moments. "She takes the time to hear me and understand me," Kosson said.
Kosson notices each kindness.
She doesn't wish to tell every person she meets that she carries disabilities. She just wants to be heard and seen for the person she is: Valerie, the miracle baby whose name came from the word valor: courage.
Valerie Kosson with her cat. Tilly would watch her sleep as a child and wake her when a seizure was sensed. When Tilly stopped waking up Kosson, her parents asked her doctor to check it out. A sleep study showed that she had stopped having seizures. She had grown out of her epilepsy, said Robin Spielberg, her mother.

Texto completo: Apple hopes to lure political junkies to its Apple News service with new at-a-glance candidate profiles of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls.
These curated candidate guides will appear ahead of the first two Democratic debates, taking place Wednesday and Thursday in Miami and broadcast on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.
Guides will include content from several of Apple's news partners, including USA TODAY, ABC, Axios, CNN, Fox, NBC, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, TIME and Vox.
Profiles are being set up for the same 20 candidates who will take the Democratic debate stage, 10 on each night. Candidates left out of these first debates won't have an Apple News profile either, at least for now.
As contenders along the way drop out of the race, the guides will be whittled down, in order to give more bandwidth to the candidate pages of those who remain.
The guides can be found in the Top Stories section within the Apple News app on iPhones, iPads and Macs.
They'll include an illustration of the candidates, plus bios, quotes and their key positions on select issues chosen on the basis of their specific platforms.
Apple News itself is free, though the premium Apple News+ service costs about $10 monthly, giving access to some 300 magazines, plus The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and Toronto Star.
Any paywalled articles related to a Democratic candidate will be made available only to those who subscribe or are trying out Apple News+.
Apple hopes voters will not only skim profiles before and during the debates but continue to follow favored candidates throughout the election cycle; stories about them will appear within Apple News feeds.
Apple also is working with NBC to get real-time fact-checking and video clips of key moments during the debates.
Each candidate guide will more or less get the same amount of space.
Apple plans something similar for any Republican candidates who might challenge President Donald Trump during the primary season.

With Target's Help, Contentious Bikini Gets Even More Exposure

Texto completo: Would you pay $ 285 for a skimpy blue bikini with multicolored elastic threaded through multicolored crochet trim?
How about $ 176?
Or better yet, $ 38?
These are the options available to crochet-bikini lovers now that Target has jumped into one of the messiest swimsuit tales ever to unravel.
The big-box retailer this spring began to offer its Xhilaration-brand version of a bathing suit first sold on a beach in 1998 by a Brazilian crochet artist. That bikini was later remade and marketed to great success by a New York entrepreneur as the perfect suit for high-end luxury buyers with tiny bodies and huge Instagram followings.
By making the swimsuit available to the mass market -- or a look-alike of a copy of the original -- Target has reinvigorated one of the bikini industry's wildest intellectual property disputes in memory; one that involves lawsuits and federal court, and evokes questions about art, commerce, the trickling down of trends and the internet's role in it all.
In an industry built on creative inspiration, can any one person own a design? Is infringement litigation a waste of time and money that would be better spent on new products and ideas? If one internet-savvy person manages to create a market for a product that would have otherwise existed mostly in obscurity, does the marketer deserve any creative credit?
And that's before addressing any issues of cultural appropriation.
Accusations of creative theft by big brands against small, unresourced designers have involved all sorts of luxury names, including Chanel, Versace and Michael Kors. (All deny wrongdoing.)
This is the sort of fray in which Target is now ensnarled. But while most such cases tend to be tried solely in the court of public opinion, the crocheted bikini is different.
The lawsuit involves a bikini sold by Kiini, a brand that was brought to market in June 2013 by Ipek Irgit. Her initial $ 285 bikini is nearly identical to a bikini created and first sold in 1998 by Maria Solange Ferrarini, a beach vendor and artist in Trancoso, in the Brazilian state of Bahia.
Ms. Ferrarini first sold the swimsuit more than 20 years ago for about $ 2.50. She now charges beach buyers about $ 75 for a handmade original. (A licensed version made by a San Diego swimwear company sells for $ 176 in the United States.)
Last year, Ms. Ferrarini, 62, filed suit against Ms. Irgit, who started her own company after visiting Trancoso in 2012, using one of Ms. Ferrarini's bikinis as a model for a prototype. The lawsuit says Ms. Irgit, 41, has passed off Ms. Ferrarini's design as her own, even submitting to the United States Copyright Office a photo of the Kiini bathing suit and receiving a copyright.
In an interview with The New York Times last summer, Ms. Irgit denied copying the swimsuit. Her lawyer, Mark A. Berman, did not respond to more recent requests seeking comment.
The case has pulled into its vortex companies including Victoria's Secret and Neiman Marcus, amid complex issues of intellectual property rights. It got more complicated in January when, in the wake of publicity surrounding the situation, the copyright office also granted Ms. Ferrarini a copyright.
Now, a federal court in the Southern District of New York is digging through those implications.
And the bikinis -- all the versions -- continue to sell.
Some fans of the Kiini bikini were surprised to learn of the details of its origin, and the controversy it has engendered.
The model Reka Ebergenyi wore a Kiini bikini in a 2014 photo shoot for Condé Nast Traveller. Ms. Ebergenyi knew Ms. Irgit through a mutual friend who was helping with Kiini's production, and had asked the editor on the shoot if she could wear the bikini.
The resulting photo -- Ms. Ebergenyi wearing a Kiini while standing by a pool -- appeared on the December cover of the magazine and was a big moment for the swimwear brand.
"I didn't know I was a part of a fraud," Ms. Ebergenyi said in an interview this spring.
Some people took to Instagram to register criticism of Kiini after the lawsuit drew attention. Both Ms. Irgit's personal Instagram account and the Kiini brand account now have restrictions on commenting.
As for the Target version of the bikini, a company spokeswoman declined to make an executive available for an interview on how the bathing suit design was created.
In an emailed statement, the spokeswoman said, "Target offers a wide range of swimwear styles and designs that feature the current trends of the season. This year, one of the trends we saw across the marketplace is crochet trim, which we incorporated into swimwear and other products."
Ms. Ferrarini's lawyer, Jack M. Rutherford, shared with The Times a letter he sent to Target on June 25 asking it to "cease and desist" from selling the bikini. "Continuing violation of Ms. Ferrarini's intellectual property rights, or any known past violation of those rights," Mr. Rutherford wrote, may subject Target "to heightened liability for willful copyright infringement."
(The lawyer was part of The Times's earlier article as well. "While I filed this case under my previous legal name," he said now, referring to his previous given name, Michelle, "I am a transgender man, and I now go by Jack M. Rutherford and am in the process of a legal name and gender transition.")
The Target spokeswoman said that "neither Target nor the vendor who designed this swimsuit have received a claim, so we're unable to comment on it at this time."
Last summer, Ms. Irgit said she felt compelled to sue companies that she believes have been benefiting from Kiini's success. "If your rights are being taken, and everything you've worked so hard for is, like, being wiped away, wouldn't you do something about it? Are we all supposed to be afraid and run away?"
Her lawyer didn't comment on whether Ms. Irgit plans to sue Target.

Texto completo: For the last six years, Kate Fowle has divided her time between Moscow, where she was until recently the chief curator at the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, and New York City, where she has been director-at-large at Independent Curators International (ICI).
Now Ms. Fowle will be planted here full-time as the new director of MoMA PS1, the museum in Long Island City, Queens, known for its inventive contemporary arts programming. The British-born Ms. Fowle will be only the third leader in the institution's 43-year history. The museum announced her appointment on Wednesday.
"It's an institution that I've known for years and years and years," said Ms. Fowle in a telephone interview. The curator, who was born in Kent, England, added that she first visited the museum's former studio program when she was living in London in the '90s.
"I love the second skin," she added, saying that she was referring to the museum's lingering aura of past exhibitions, "the legacy artists that have left."
Ms. Fowle, who starts Sept. 3, succeeds Klaus Biesenbach, who departed in October to lead the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. Mr. Biesenbach in 2010 took over from Alanna Heiss, who in 1976 founded the P. S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, which in 2000 merged with the Museum of Modern Art.
Glenn D. Lowry, MoMA's director, said Ms. Fowle was a natural choice. "She's an accomplished scholar, a deft curator and an outstanding leader," he said, noting that she will be arriving from outside the organization, where Mr. Biesenbach had been nurtured by Ms. Heiss.
"She is the first director that comes at it with fresh eyes," he said.
As to Ms. Fowle's mandate at the museum, Mr. Lowry said it would be "to build on the substantial platform we have created together over the last 20 years, but to stay very much true to PS1's artist-centric roots."
For her part, Ms. Fowle said she had "lots of ideas" but that she would first aim to get to know the staff and the neighborhood. "I don't want to rush into it," she said. "What's most important and the way that I've always worked is through collaboration."
"It's an institution that isn't broken, it doesn't need fixing," she continued, adding that given the museum's experimental environment there is "so much that can be pushed and developed."
The museum, housed in a 100-year-old Romanesque Revival school building, has over the years established an international reputation for mounting adventuresome exhibitions and championing local artists through its every-five-years roundup, "Greater New York."
PS1 has also been acclaimed for shows like its landmark 2013 survey of Mike Kelley -- at the time the largest exhibition of the artist's work -- and the recent Bruce Nauman retrospective, which Holland Cotter, The New York Times's co-chief critic, called "a transfixing trip."
The museum has also had its bumps along the way. Last year, Nikki Columbus, a curator, accused MoMA PS 1 of gender, pregnancy and caregiver discrimination, a claim she brought against the museum saying it had rescinded a job offer upon learning she had recently given birth. The lawsuit was settled in March.
Asked whether that case had given her pause, Ms. Fowle said, "I think it was important to listen to what was being said and try to understand things, but it has been settled now."
"It's really important to nurture women and especially young women in the workplace and to encourage them to believe they can have it all," she added. "I'm somebody who really stands up for that."
Ms. Fowle said she also believes strongly in the current trend among museums to make room on their walls -- and on their staffs and boards of trustees -- for people of color.
"Understanding the world from that perspective is long overdue," she said. "It's not the West and the rest. Those days are over."
Although her responsibilities will mainly be administrative, Ms. Fowle said she is glad they also include curatorial possibilities. "In the job description, it still says that you can curate," she said. "It's something I've done from the very beginning."
"I love working directly with artists," she continued.
In an interview with ARTnews in 2015, Rashid Johnson, who was commissioned by Ms. Fowle to create a living, green sculpture for the Garage Museum, said she was "an artist's curator. She's open to dialogue and really wants to participate in the vision, rather than try to mold that vision."
Ms. Fowle said she initially wanted to be an artist, but quickly realized she was better at organizing exhibitions, which led to a traineeship in curating and exhibitions through the Arts Council of England. "I decided the world was not going to be that sad if I stopped being an artist," she said.
Ms. Fowle went on to serve as the inaugural international curator at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing from 2007 to 2008 and as chairwoman of the Master's Program in Curatorial Practice at California College of the Arts in San Francisco, which she co-founded in 2002.
As the executive director of ICI from 2009 to 2013, Ms. Fowle transformed the organization from a deficit-ridden operation into a global network for curators with a professional training program.
Having joined the Garage in 2013 as its first chief curator, Ms. Fowle played a key role in the institution's transformation from art center to internationally-recognized museum. She worked closely with Rem Koolhaas and OMA to oversee its first building in 2015, the same year she became an American citizen. In 2017, Ms. Fowle established the Garage Triennial of Russian Contemporary Art.
She has written three books -- "Proof: Francisco Goya, Sergei Eisenstein, Robert Longo" (2016); "Exhibit Russia: The New International Decade 1986--1996" (2016); and "Rashid Johnson: Within Our Gates" (2016), which she co-authored.
On Wednesday, when Ms. Fowle's appointment is announced, she will also turn 48. "It's going," she said, "to be quite a birthday."

Texto completo: Ken Weiner slid the box of cookies across the table like a man passing over a tray of jewels. The cookies inside looked like specimens of fine artistry. But Weiner shook his head at the notion.
"I'm not an artist," he said. "We sell cookies that people like to eat."
Even if Weiner denies it, he's a craftsman who's passionate about his material — which, in this case, happens to be cookies.
Weiner launched Chloe's Cookies with his wife, Sheryl, last summer, and since then his small-batch chocolate chip cookies have been earning a lot of praise.
"We think it's a great product," Weiner said.
His company has developed 21 types of chocolate chip cookies (yes, they're all chocolate chip) though on any given week it offers seven types for purchase. Five are its regular standbys: original chocolate chip, double chocolate chip sea salt, oatmeal caramel sea salt, peanut butter chocolate chip and walnut ganache. And two are seasonal specials.
In the summer months, Weiner features berry-infused chocolate chip cookies such as raspberry and blueberry, and he's working on a cherry. This month he's also highlighting a banana cookie. Chloe's does pumpkin flavors in the fall, and at Christmastime it'll feature a peppermint cookie.
The company also offers vegan and gluten-free varieties.
The inspiration behind Chloe's came during a trip to New York City in 2018. Weiner and his wife and daughter were walking down the street, eating cookies, when Weiner looked at the cookie in his hand and said, "I think I can make a better cookie."
He came home and began experimenting with recipes until he hit on one that felt right. He had friends taste-test his cookies over and over again until they were perfect, and then he started getting the same response: His cookies were good enough to sell. (This kind of intense focus on a project is very much Weiner's M.O. Just ask him about his corned beef.)
Weiner called up his friend Harold Balink, chef-owner of Harold's in south Fort Myers, and asked him: "Will you sit down with me? I'm making these cookies, and I'm no expert in this field, but you are."
The two met and talked, and Balink tasted the cookies.
His response? "I think you can sell these cookies all day long."
Balink offered to feature Weiner's cookies in his restaurant over the summer, and each week he gave Weiner feedback on what customers thought. Weiner took that feedback, returned to his kitchen and refined his recipes. By the fall, he was ready to begin testing his cookies at farmers markets around Southwest Florida. Word quickly spread about Chloe's artisan chocolate chip cookies. Then, just before Valentine's Day, the cookies were named Best Chocolate Chip Cookies by a local magazine.
"We were just plugging along," Weiner said, "and then the phone started ringing."
His little cottage industry had suddenly become a big deal.
Weiner calls himself the company's CBO — that's chief baking officer — while his wife is CEE (chief everything else). Chloe's doesn't have a storefront operation, so Weiner ships or delivers his cookies. The delivery fee is $5 for Lee and Collier Counties, and Marco Island is $20. He's currently working on plans for future projects, including a beer and cookie pairing with Millennial Brewing Co. in downtown Fort Myers.
And that sweet-faced Dalmatian who appears on the promotional materials for Chloe's Cookies? She's inspired by the Weiner family dog, Chloe, a rescue Dalmatian who does pet therapy at Golisano Children's Hospital and through the Children's Advocacy Center.
"She's a very sweet girl," Weiner said.
As sweet as his cookies?
"Definitely."

The abortion lobby is going for the kill

Texto completo: John Irving is a fiction writer, and it shows.
Pretending he was writing a history in the pages of the New York Times, Irving wrote a fable. It’s the fable told by the abortion lobby, promulgated by the Democratic Party, and believed by most journalists.
“Abortion opponents don’t care what happens to an unwanted child,” wrote Irving, “and they’ve never cared about the mother.”
In a work of purported history, Irving bragged of his winning Planned Parenthood’s vaunted “Maggie Award,” named after Margaret Sanger. Sanger founded Planned Parenthood, of course, with eugenic purposes in mind. Maggie’s life work was “the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extinction of defective stocks — those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.”
Almost no defenders of legal abortion today share Sanger's vile views. The abortion lobby today, as wrong as it is on the issue of human life, is not a eugenics lobby. But given its history, you would think Sanger’s side, the folks cheerleading today for the industry spending millions a year to lobby against even the slightest health and safety regulations on the abortion of unborn babies, would have some humility before denigrating the other side as evil.
But they don’t. It's quite the opposite.
Defenders of legal abortion are in the early public stages of a concerted effort to brand the pro-life position as equivalent to Jim Crow. They are making the arguments and the policies that place opposition to abortion on the same level as virulent racism. Those who would protect the lives of the unborn are not merely wrong, according to this campaign, but ought to be unwelcome in polite society.
It starts with the fact-free slander by commentators and scribes like John Irving, who invent a caricature of pro-lifers. “[T]hey don’t care what happens to an unwanted child,” Irving wrote in the New York Times, in a line tweeted out by Planned Parenthood chief Leana Wen, “not after the child is born — and they’ve never cared about the mother.”
There is zero evidence that Irving or Wen has ever met a pro-life person. They should give it a try. They should talk to the people who pray the rosary outside of Wen’s abortion clinics. They should visit the crisis pregnancy centers Wen lobbies to shut down — those institutions that provide free healthcare and child care and other necessities both before and "after the child is born," and for "the mother." They will find people who dedicate their lives to helping mothers and children, including children in need of adoption. They should learn that pro-lifers are people too, motivated by love, but who arrive at a different conclusion on this sensitive question.
The fact-free, nasty stereotype of pro-lifers, that all of them are woman haters who don’t love children, is a necessary dehumanizing step to justify a nascent crusade to drive the pro-life position out of the public square.
Kamala Harris uses this line all the time, asserting that pro-lifers, all of us, don’t care about babies. Then Harris, who is running on the promise of turning her prosecutorial skills against her political enemies, pledges to sic the federal government on them.
“On this issue,” she says on the campaign trail when talking about how she’ll handle pro-lifers, “I’m a former prosecutor.” She sure is. As California’s lead prosecutor, she sicced the cops on a pro-life filmmaker who exposed Planned Parenthood’s very real sale of aborted baby body parts to the biotech industry.
Harris has repeatedly promised to take back America from extremists. Then she goes ahead and calls the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic service organization present at nearly every parish in America, “extremist” because the group is pro-life. And now Harris says that she wants the Justice Department impose federal sanctions on states that pass pro-life laws, just as there are special federal rules for states with a history of enforcing segregation.
It's a pattern, and it indicates a concerted campaign to weaponize government against political opponents. And much of the Democratic Party’s leadership is on board with it. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo famously stated that people who are “right-to-life ... have no place in the state of New York.”
Major corporations are staking out the same position. The parent companies of NBC and ABC have both declared that they won’t make movies in Georgia because the state passed a bill restricting abortion to very early in pregnancy.
These corporate executives are buying what Planned Parenthood and Kamala Harris are selling: The idea that extending legal protections to the unborn is crossing a line of decency. We don’t and ought not have polite policy debates on segregation, and the Left is increasingly trying to place pro-life views in that same basket of deplorable opinions.
Step one is casting all pro-lifers as demons, essentially denying the humanity of millions of people.

Hearing Hints of Rebellion Inside the U.S. Federation

Texto completo: PARIS -- The reviews read like pleas for help from inside a failing corporation. "A terrible and toxic place to work." "A culture of fear and intimidation." "Morale is at an all time low."
But this is not an ordinary company. The scathing critiques were posted, anonymously but publicly, by more than a dozen current and former employees of U.S. Soccer, the governing body for the sport in the United States, on a networking website. More than a dozen have been created over the past two months, as U.S. Soccer has moved into the final stages of its search for a new chief executive. Seven have appeared since the start of the Women's World Cup on June 7.
In telephone interviews with The New York Times, several current employees at various levels of seniority confirmed that the feelings expressed on the site, Glassdoor, accurately reflected concerns inside the federation's Chicago headquarters.
What the reviews suggest, as the United States women's national team chases another world championship in France and the men's side pursues a regional one, is a behind-the-scenes revolt against the federation's most powerful executives, notably its longtime chief executive, Dan Flynn, who plans to retire this summer, and his top deputy and potential successor, Jay Berhalter.
The reviews began appearing in May, suggesting a concerted effort to use the site's company review option -- which is public -- to alert top federation officials, and the organization's board, to concerns before they vote on a new chief executive.
In the reviews, and in interviews with The Times, past and present U.S. Soccer staff members described grievances common to almost any company: too much work, too little pay, bosses who don't listen. But in their open disdain for Flynn and Berhalter, the employees also paint the portrait of an organization -- one still emerging from a broad restructuring sparked by the humiliation of missing the 2018 World Cup -- that is dominated by a small group of long-serving executives, and infected by dissatisfaction and mistrust.
"Dream job, nightmare organization," read one post added a week ago. "Intervention needed" was the title of another. "Terrible leadership," said a third.
One current employee called the postings, which are an open secret inside the federation's headquarters, "cathartic."
"It's like a desperate cry for help," the employee said in a telephone interview. The employees contacted by The Times agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity, out of fear of retribution from the federation's leadership team.
Several employees said the reviews were motivated by the looming change in leadership. Flynn's desire to retire from the chief executive post he has held since 2000 has been public knowledge for months, and recent news media reports suggest the search for his successor is nearing an end. Berhalter, the federation's chief operating officer and the brother of the men's national team coach Gregg Berhalter, has emerged as a leading candidate to replace Flynn, perhaps as soon as next month.
U.S. Soccer's president, Carlos Cordeiro, said he and other senior officials, as well as federation board members, were aware of the online postings, but he declined to comment publicly on anonymous complaints.
He noted the federation was undergoing some of the biggest changes in its recent history, adding staff members and increasing the diversity and responsibilities of the organization's leadership. And a U.S. Soccer spokesman, in a statement, acknowledged that "at the moment we are at an inflection point where we are rapidly growing as an organization, which is both rewarding and challenging."
"As we grow," the statement continued, "listening to our employees and taking action where and when needed will be more important than ever."
At U.S. Soccer's Chicago headquarters, where most of the federation's nearly 200 full-time staff members are shoehorned into a 150-year-old stone mansion, employees said they or colleagues had left recently -- or were actively searching for new jobs -- for a variety of reasons: better opportunities, better hours, better pay. But several cited the workplace culture as part of their decision-making.
"You are losing a lot of great people," reads one review. "How can you not see that?"
"Prepare yourselves for a mass exodus after the Women's World Cup," reads another.
Several of the reviews directly blame Flynn, U.S. Soccer's chief executive since 2000, and Berhalter, the federation's top commercial officer, for a workplace climate in which employees' arrivals and departures are monitored, 50- to 70-hour work weeks are expected and those with dissenting or unpopular opinions are reprimanded or marginalized.
Others lamented that advancement inside the federation is limited by a core group of top executives who have controlled the most senior positions for a decade or more.
But it is the public -- and personal -- rebukes that paint the most troubling picture of a troubled workplace:
■ "We are okay with nepotism here," one review said, mentioning both Berhalters by name.
■ "Executives are more interested in what benefits them rather than 'making soccer the preeminent sport in America."'
■ "Morale is at an all time low in all the years that I have worked here. Have you noticed? Do you care? Will you continue to do nothing?"
The search for Flynn's successor has been conducted largely out of public view, by a committee of board members led by Cordeiro. More than a dozen internal and external candidates have been considered, but with little information leaking to the public, the perception has grown that the process is being managed to arrive at an arranged result that puts Jay Berhalter in charge.
That is precisely why some inside U.S. Soccer say they have tried to raise an alarm.
"We all know that if the next CEO comes from within," one wrote, "the toxic culture will never change."

Fed Chief Stays Focused on Risks

Texto completo: Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Tuesday that the central bank is weighing whether an interest-rate cut will be needed as trade risks stir economic uncertainty and inflation lags. But he made clear that the institution considers itself independent from the White House and President Trump, who continues to push publicly for a rate cut.
Mr. Powell said the case for a rate cut has strengthened somewhat given that economic "crosscurrents have re-emerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy."
But he stopped short of saying a cut was guaranteed, noting that the Fed would continue to watch economic events unfold and would avoid reacting to short-term issues.
"The question my colleagues and I are grappling with is whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional policy accommodation," Mr. Powell said at a Council on Foreign Relations event in New York.
The Fed is watching warily as global trade flows slow, manufacturing indexes sag and confidence gauges wobble against continuing uncertainty about Mr. Trump's trade war. Because interest rates are already historically low, the Fed wants to take a risk-management approach to setting policy, fending off any softening in growth before it becomes serious.
That inflation has never sustainably hit the Fed's 2 percent target, formally in place since 2012, heightens the case for moving pre-emptively -- rather than waiting and risking making a move too late. Inflation came in at just 1.5 percent in the year through April.
"That undershoot looks like it might be more persistent than we had hoped, and that is not a good thing," Mr. Powell said in a question-and-answer session with Neil Irwin, a senior economic correspondent with The New York Times. "It's another argument, frankly, for providing more policy accommodation."
The Fed's policy conversation is happening against a contentious political backdrop. Mr. Trump has been loudly criticizing the central bank for keeping rates too high, saying that it is weakening growth and putting the United States on an uneven playing field with trading partners with lower interest rates. Mr. Powell emphasized the central bank's independence on Tuesday.
"We are a strictly nonpolitical agency," he said in response to a question about Mr. Trump's continuing attacks. "We're human, we'll make mistakes," he added, but "we won't make mistakes of integrity or character."
Mr. Trump on Monday tweeted that the Fed "blew it" by increasing rates last year, and he has even toyed with the idea of demoting Mr. Powell to the role of governor. Mr. Trump has alternately implied that such a move would depend on Mr. Powell's actions and denied suggesting a demotion. He said he thought he had the legal authority to do so if he chose, though his authority is unclear.
[Mr. Trump's feud with the Fed is rooted in history.]
Politics aside, economic developments have prompted a growing number of Fed officials to expect rate cuts before the end of the year, according to economic projections released after their June 19-20 meeting. Investors in fed funds futures had fully priced in a rate cut next month after that meeting. Stocks indexes fell after Mr. Powell's speech was released Tuesday, suggesting that his characterization of rate cuts as a "whether" rather than a definite plan disappointed some traders.
But Mr. Powell's Fed colleagues are with him as he watches incoming data warily.
"The economy had solid momentum, but now it's pedaling against some pretty significant headwinds," Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in an interview with The New York Times on Tuesday. "Let's watch the next six weeks and see if the data reverse," and "see how the uncertainty resolves itself as we get more information about trade negotiations, and finally, let's see what other countries are doing to offset potential weaknesses."
Ms. Daly, who is not currently a voting member but participates in discussions about rate policy, would not say whether she has projected rate cuts this year. But she said she's concerned that, with more muted growth, it might take longer to push inflation back toward the Fed's 2 percent goal.
"The bottom line for me is that I want to sustain the expansion so that we can also push inflation back up to our target," Ms. Daly said.
Wage growth is showing signs of slowing, and several measures of inflation expectations are softening. That increases the risk that price growth will remain permanently below the central bank's goal, which is meant to provide a buffer to ward off economy-harming deflation.

Growth abroad has also shown signs of stalling. That pullback owes partly to the continuing tariff war between the United States and China, which could arrive at a turning point this week, when Mr. Trump is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 nations summit in Japan.
The United States has slapped tariffs on $ 250 billion worth of goods already, and Mr. Trump has threatened to extend them to another $ 300 billion of goods -- practically all remaining imports from China -- if the two nations can't reach an agreement. This would be the first meeting between the two leaders since talks broke off in May.
"The amount of tariffs that are in place right now are not large enough to represent, itself, a major threat to the economy," Mr. Powell said Tuesday. "The concern is more around a loss of confidence or financial market reaction."
Mr. Powell also delivered a warning to Facebook, which is developing a new cryptocurrency called Libra, saying the financial product would require rigorous scrutiny. "We're looking at it very carefully," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: John Sanders, the country’s top border security official, will resign from his job as acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection next month, according to Department of Homeland Security officials and a message sent to CBP staff Tuesday.
His resignation continues a dizzying pattern of personnel changes at DHS that have come in the middle of a border crisis triggered by the biggest migration surge in more than a decade.
Sanders has served in his job as acting CBP commissioner for barely two months. He was named to the role after President Donald Trump removed then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen from the department and replaced her with then-CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan.
CBP officials have not publicly announced Sanders’ departure. One DHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the move said the resignation was not related to recent controversies over the treatment of underage migrants in U.S. custody along the border.
Sanders had been pushing in recent weeks for an expansion of temporary holding facilities that could accommodate the growing number of underage mothers with infants who are being held in U.S. Border Patrol facilities because there is no room for them in shelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services.
“As some of you are aware, yesterday I offered my resignation to Secretary McAleenan, effective Friday, July 5,” Sanders wrote in a message to staff. “Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful, I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of CBP has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.”
Sanders’ resignation plans were first reported by The New York Times.
A former technology executive, Sanders had a reputation as a low-key and nonpartisan figure at CBP. He served under McAleenan as CBP chief operating officer and before that worked at the Transportation Security Administration.

Texto completo: MIAMI — In a windowless conference room in downtown Miami, Julian Castro practiced answering mock debate questions while an aide kept an eye on the clock, raising two hands in the air whenever Castro spoke longer than one minute.
Elsewhere in the city this week, another Democratic presidential contender, California Senator Kamala Harris, huddled with her advisers over Caribbean food. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren squeezed in one last rally with her final debate preparations. And New Jersey Senator Cory Booker's aides passed around a memo laying out his goals for the mere 7 to 11 minutes he will likely speak onstage.
Most of the Democrats seeking their party's nomination are preparing to meet in Miami on their biggest stage yet beginning Wednesday, for a two-night, 20-candidate extravaganza that marks a new phase in the sprawling campaign to take on President Trump. The events will put household names like former vice president Joe Biden on the same stage as little-known Democrats like Andrew Yang, offering leading contenders a chance to prove their polling leads are about more than name recognition while giving upstart candidates an opening to grab the nation's attention.
But instead of wrestling with substantial questions about the future of the nation, the event will probably feel like speed-dating, with 10 candidates standing elbow-to-elbow each night, all trying to pack soaring rhetoric or clever policy prescriptions into the 60 seconds they have each been allotted to answer questions by the organizers of the debate.
“It's going to be such a short time to get to know them," sighed Donna West, the chair of Nevada's Clark County Democrats. “I imagine most of the candidates are feeling enormous pressure."
The candidates will have no opening statements, according to NBC News, which is hosting the first debates along with MSNBC and Telemundo, and they will get 30 seconds for follow-ups in addition to the minute they get to answer questions from the event's five moderators.
“It's not a debate, it's a joint press conference," said Jeffrey Berry, a political science professor at Tufts University, who said the forums could nevertheless play a crucial role in shaping the unwieldy 2020 field, particularly as little-known candidates like Representatives Eric Swalwell or Tim Ryan seek a breakout moment.
“This could be really a do-or-die moment for some of these less-visible candidates," Berry said.
It all kicks off Wednesday night, when Warren will take the stage alongside Castro, Booker, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Texas representative Beto O'Rourke, and five other candidates. Warren has been climbing in the polls, but all of the other contenders have been mostly mired in the single digits.
Thursday night's debate is widely seen as the major clash for top-tier contenders. That night, Biden, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Harris, and the insurgent South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg face off with six more candidates.
It will give most Democratic voters their first chance to compare candidates side by side as they consider which one seems best-positioned to take on the president.
“Who looks like they are strong enough, tough enough, serious enough to both be president and defeat President Trump?" said Neera Tanden, the president of the liberal Center For American Progress, who is not aligned with a candidate, describing the central question for many voters.
But as candidates from different wings of the party come together onstage for the first time, the debate could open the door to spats and attacks that some Democrats worry will bruise the eventual nominee. “Democrats are very anxious about not having a candidate, the nominee, bloodied," Tanden said. “Any candidate that's attacking has a risk."
Indeed, the debate is coming as some of the early divisions in the crowded primary field are beginning to reveal themselves. Sanders, the Vermont progressive, last week sent a tweet that appeared to knock the populist Warren for drawing support from some centrist Democrats, and the two may seek to curry favor with each other's supporters, even though they are set to appear on different nights.
Also last week, Biden, who has been leading national and early state polls since he entered the race in April, drew disapproval and condemnation from some of his opponents, particularly Booker, for waxing nostalgic about his working relationships with segregationist senators. That could make Biden an inviting target for criticism or veiled attacks.
In 2016, it was Republicans who had droves of candidates running for president, and the crowded debates shaped the race. Trump benefited from his ability to dominate the stage, and candidates perceived as front-runners, like former governors Scott Walker and Jeb Bush, seemed to pale in comparison. Florida Senator Marco Rubio was memorably eviscerated on a crowded stage in New Hampshire by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.
“If you lose an exchange on that stage, your campaign may be over," said Alex Conant, who was Rubio's communications director that year. On a crowded stage, candidates need to flout the ground rules when necessary, he said.
“It's easy to be forgotten on the stage, so you need to be aggressive about interjecting, and being part of the discussion," Conant said.
This time, candidates will face different tests onstage depending on how widely they are known. Those who are polling in the low single digits, like the former Housing and Urban Development secretary Castro, will need to make a good first impression on voters who barely know who they are.
“For a candidate like Julian where his name ID might not be as high as others, this is an audience of potentially 25 million people who are watching him for the first time," said Sawyer Hackett, an aide to Castro. “It's a matter of whether you can condense your biography, your experience and your plans."
Warren, who is by far the most prominent candidate in Wednesday night's matchup, is likely to attract the most scrutiny and attention, and she may use the occasion to try to salve lingering reservations from some in the party about her ability to take on Trump.
“What she needs to communicate is that she's presidential, that she can translate her ideas into action," Berry said. “Elizabeth Warren needs to be the most dynamic person in the room."
Warren's supporters hope her rhetorical skills — honed over years of teaching and debate as a teenager — will help cement her status in the race's top tier, especially because she won't have to fight off jabs from Sanders or Biden.
“She'll get all the spotlight of a presidential debate stage and the ability to get her big-picture thinking across without the tensions of squabbling with other front-runners," said Adam Green, the cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which supports Warren.

Experts explain why the 'too ugly to rape' argument doesn't hold up

Texto completo: Days after writer E. Jean Carroll accused President Donald Trump of raping her in a Bergdof Goodman dressing room in the 1990s, the president said she was "totally lying" and "not my type. "
It's not the first time Trump has used the tactic of criticizing a woman's appearance to discredit her.
After Jessica Leeds accused Trump of sticking his hand up her skirt while on a flight in the 1980s, he said “Believe me, she would not be my first choice. "
He suggested Natasha Stoynoff, a writer for People who claims Trump forced "his tongue down my throat," was not attractive enough to assault. "Look at her," he told a cheering crowd at an October 2016 rally. "You tell me what you think. I don't think so. I don't think so. "
Trump adamantly denies all 20 accusations of sexual misconduct.
ANALYSIS: Writer E. Jean Carroll accuses Trump of rape. Why are we so reluctant to talk about it?
The "too ugly to rape" defense is one many perpetrators use to undermine victims, and sexual assault experts say it feeds into the public's misunderstanding of how sexual violence works.
"We see that babies to women in their 90s are raped," said Sarah Cook, associate dean at Georgia State University Honors College, a nationally recognized expert on violence against women and a survivor of sexual assault. "Rape isn't about sexual attraction. Rape is about the expression of power through sexual behavior. "
In March, Italy’s Justice Ministry ordered an inquiry into a court ruling that overturned a rape verdict in part because of an assertion the woman was too ugly to be a rape victim.
Last year, a North Carolina Republican official shared on Facebook a fake photo mocking the appearance of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Cabarrus County Republican Chair Lanny Lancaster wrote: "This is the alleged sexual assault victim. Wow," the (Raleigh) News & Observer reported.
When Dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid in 2011, online commenters questioned whether he would have raped her because of her "ugliness. "
Linking the likelihood of sexual violence to a woman's appearance is dangerous because it implies that if a woman was somehow less sexually attractive — for example, more covered up — then maybe she could have prevented her own rape. And it's not only men who make the case.
In a 2017 interview with Radio Times Magazine, actress Angela Lansbury said ”we must sometimes take blame, women. I really do think that. Although it’s awful to say we can’t make ourselves look as attractive as possible without being knocked down and raped. ”
In a 2017 op-ed in the New York Times, actress Mayim Bialik suggested conventionally beautiful women are more likely to be targets for sexual predators.
For victims who are not conventionally attractive by society's standards, the argument is literally adding insult to injury, attacking someone's self-worth that has already been damaged by the assault.
The pervasity of the "too ugly" argument can also have a chilling effect on reporting, making victims who lack confidence in their appearance further doubt whether they will be believed.
"Most rape victims are already hesitant to disclose — whether due to fear of retaliation, shame, self-blame or doubting that others will believe their allegations," said Karen Weiss, a sociology professor at West Virginia University and an expert on sexual victimization. "Insulting their self-esteem is just another account that revictimizes women and keeps victims silent. "
Sexual assault is never about a woman's beauty, experts say, but is a unique form of control used to shame, demean and defile victims. And it can happen to anyone, regardless of their appearance, age or what they're wearing.
"There are so many different portrayals of rape in our society, and many of them feed our stereotypes that rape is about sexual attraction, that you have to be absolutely beautiful, stunning, to be raped. But the reality is all of us are vulnerable. "
If you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800. 656. HOPE (4673) or visit hotline. rainn. org/online and receive confidential support.

No, they're not concentration camps

Texto completo: Six months in Congress has not dimmed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's talent for flippant demagoguery. After helping to scuttle Amazon's move to New York City - at a cost of about 25,000 jobs - and confusing a tax abatement with an outright subsidy, she recently called immigrant detention centers at the southern border "concentration camps." When some people complained, she tweeted, "If that makes you uncomfortable, fight the camps - not the nomenclature." How about both?
The internment centers at the border are not spas - granted. People have died in them, some of them children. Sleeping conditions can be harsh and it was White House policy to separate children from their parents - an unconscionable cruelty so patent that even Donald Trump backed down. The president himself agreed Sunday that conditions at some centers are "terrible."
Still, no one is being held for political, ideological or religious reasons. No one is being whipped and made to work until dead from exhaustion. There is no crematorium, and no one is being crucified upside down as they were at Buchenwald, where a nearby area was called the "singing forest," so named for the screams of the dying.
Naturally, some academics jumped to the defense of AOC, as Ocasio-Cortez is often called. They pointed out that long before the Nazis used the term, it had been applied to the camps the British established in South Africa during the Boer War. So true. It was also pointed out that the term has sometimes been applied to the internment camps in which Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II. So true again. Still, no random executions, no torture and no electrified fencing. Atrocious, but not a concentration camp.
Ever since the end of World War II, the term has come to mean unimaginable bestiality where untold numbers of people died - so many that no one knows the true number. The camps that the United States military forced German civilians to see for their own eyes were not even the worst. They had originally been established to incarcerate and punish political dissidents, communists, homosexuals, priests and others - and then, increasingly, Jews. The worst camps were located not in Germany, but in German-occupied Poland - the extermination camps of Auschwitz, Belzec, Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka. They were used mainly to kill Jews.
It's never clear to me if AOC knows what she's talking about - or even cares. She's a wonderful packager, reducing complicated issues to slogans, and, like Trump, she never backs down. But nomenclature, as she put it, is not a trivial matter. In my Army days, it was lesson one in basic training, because if you don't know the name of things, you can't identify them. "Get that thing" simply will not do in combat.
It is the same with life itself. Calling American internment facilities concentration camps so distorts the issue of what to do with the border that discussion, never mind solutions, is not possible. The debate becomes about what to call the thing, not the thing itself. More significantly, it compresses the issue so that it becomes ridiculously simplified: Are you for concentration camps or are you opposed? Will you tolerate them or will you not? In the parlance of the picket line, "Which side are you on?"
Many years ago, I wrote about Calvin Trillin, the New Yorker writer about food and lots more, who had denounced the trivialization of the Holocaust. He directed his ire at people who used "Nazis" to describe traffic cops or who referred to the deaths of more than three people as "genocide." As I noted in a column, Menachem Begin, the Israeli prime minister, had ridiculously referred to the Palestine Liberation Organization as the "Arab SS." Trump does that sort of thing all the time - the Mexican people, after all, are not "rapists," and The New York Times is not guilty of "treason."
Such language does not clarify, it inflames and, in the case of the Holocaust, it is dismissive. But there are no concentration camps on the border - only loose and provocative language.

Texto completo: Allentown State Hospital could be used for homeless vets
There are potentially positive uses for the "grand old lady," the Allentown State Hospital. When I worked there as a licensed psychologist manager and the quality assurance risk manager, the buildings were Medicare and Medicaid certified.
Couldn't any of these buildings be utilized as a home for our homeless veterans or restorative centers for people in need of psychiatric or addiction intervention? This was done at Hollidaysburg State Hospital several years ago when the state transferred ownership of the hospital to the federal government for our veterans in need.
I wonder why there seems to be such a rush to demolish resources when they might be used to help our citizens.

Democrats must realize: Nothing in this world is free
It is refreshing to read that a politician is annoyed when he sees that a public charter school promotes itself with the term "free tuition." Unfortunately, Rep. Schlossberg, who recognizes a good fib when he sees it, is not running with the herd for U.S. president.
But in that ever-expanding group of governors, senators, socialists, mayors and self-help gurus who yearn to be leader of the free world, there are numerous calls for free college tuition. Not to be outdone, some members of the stampede want to pay compensation to 21st century victims of 19th century crimes against humanity. Still others demand free health care for all, or universal basic income.
If the pandering candidates have their way, the Washington money tree would be picked clean in short order. Even in the current era of entitlement for all, the reality is still: Nothing in this world is free.
Hopefully, enough voters will realize this before making their decision, so that the election results benefit the country.

Trump's use of tariffs is
not wise economic policy
President Trump's thinking on tariffs is bad for the U.S. economy; it's outdated. For example, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 is considered a disastrous policy that caused other nations to erect tit-for-tat trade barriers that made the Great Depression worse.
The president has also claimed that China would pay for his tariffs, while, in reality, American businesses and ultimately the American consumer will pay the import tax.
So how will these tariffs and trade wars with China, Mexico, etc. play out? Looking at Trump's past behavior, it is likely he will create a crisis and threaten severe consequences. When the deadline approaches, said Peter Baker in the New York Times, the president will announce "a deal - real or imagined" and declare a big "win."
It's great political theater.
But Trump's poor judgment, antiquated thinking and the fact that our trading partners don't trust this president does not bode well for the future of our economy.

Ignoring Judeo-Christian morality imperils our future
We Americans have been blessed with innumerable blessings and a freedom that's unsurpassed anywhere in God's world. We are now, through a lack of concern and understanding, causing these blessings to be withheld.
The founders of our nation had the wisdom and understanding necessary to realize that only through the recognition of God as the author and sustainer of our freedom could its blessing be enjoyed. An almost complete rejection of God's influence at the government level and a total rejection at the educational level is helping to render our society unprincipled.
The critical difference between America and every other nation in the world was our adherence to Judeo-Christian beliefs.

Senate should approve background checks bill
Death by guns has been steadily increasing, from 28,874 in 1999 (79 per day) to 38,658 in 2016 (106 per day) according to ProCon.org. Only in 2004 did the rate dip slightly, from 83 deaths per day to 81. This 18-year period represents 572,537 total gun deaths, an average of 31,808 per year (87 per day).
ProCon did not list data for 2017, but Statista.com listed 39,773 deaths for 2017 (109 per day), so the trend is still upwards. I have not seen any data for 2018.
Suicides represent about 60% of gun deaths while homicides represent about 35%; the remaining 5% are all other causes. On Feb. 27, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill, called the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. That was 113 days ago (as of June 19). The U.S. Senate has not voted on this bill.
U.S. Sen. Bob Casey (D) supports this bill, and I have also read that Pat Toomey (R) supports this bill. About 97% of all Americans support universal background checks.
Let us pray that the Senate can get 51% in favor.

Trump is working from
Bush's playbook for war
The drums of war began to beat when Trump exited the nuclear agreement with Iran. This despite protests by our allies stating they were in full compliance. Sound familiar?
This brings to mind the false claims that President Bush used to justify the invasion of Iraq. Trump is working from the same playbook.
The attack on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman reminds me of the Gulf of Tonkin, which started our involvement in Vietnam. Later, proven to be total fabrication. The grainy photos of solders retrieving an undetonated bomb from one oil tanker was not clear enough to be certain it was Iran's doing.
The first statements from our government claimed only suspicion. Then the rhetoric changed to claiming it was factual. Clear photos appeared days later. How do we know they weren't Photoshopped?
It's another false flag attack to gain the support of the American people.
The Monroe Doctrine began U.S. domination of the Western Hemisphere. It expanded to the entire world after the end of the Cold War.
Not only men, but women and children were killed in Iraq for the sake of profit. Don't let this happen again in Iran.

Billionaires want wealth tax

Texto completo: Some of the richest people in the U.S. are calling for a federal wealth tax.
Financier George Soros, heiresses Regan Pritzker and Abigail Disney and Facebook Inc. co-founder Chris Hughes are among those calling for the levy to help address income inequality and provide funding to address climate change and public health issues.
“We are writing to call on all candidates for President, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, to support a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest one-tenth of the richest 1% of Americans — on us,” according to a letter signed by 19 individuals — one anonymously — and posted online Monday. “The next dollar of new tax revenue should come from the most financially fortunate, not from middle-income and lower-income Americans.”
Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke support the idea, according to the letter. Warren has proposed a 2% tax on assets of $50 million or more, and a further 1% on assets over $1 billion. It is estimated to generate nearly $3 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years.
The wealth tax isn’t embraced by all Democrats because many believe it would be difficult to assess objectively the value of wealth like artwork and jewels. There are also concerns that such a tax is unconstitutional because the federal government is prohibited from taxing property, only income.
The New York Times reported on the letter earlier Monday.
Some of those signing have already expressed concerns about America’s rising inequality. Hughes has evangelized for higher taxes on the rich in his book “Fair Shot.” Disney, whose grandfather and great-uncle founded Walt Disney Co., recently called Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger’s $65.6 million compensation package “insane.”
Another signatory, entrepreneur Nick Hanauer, first warned his “fellow zillionaires” about the country’s growing wealth divide in 2014, writing that “there is no example in human history where wealth accumulated like this and the pitchforks didn’t eventually come out.”
Such inequality has only deepened. Last week, Bernard Arnault joined Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates as the third person with a fortune of at least $100 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, whose 500 members have a total net worth of $5.5 trillion, up from $4.9 trillion two years ago.

Democrats strike deal with an obstruction witness, but a court fight looms

Texto completo: The House Judiciary Committee reached a deal with a key source of information for Robert Mueller's obstruction of justice investigation that will allow her to delay public testimony that had been scheduled for Monday but require her to answer written questions as the committee waits.
Democrats who control the committee said they were willing to take those steps because the witness, Annie Donaldson, is in her third trimester of pregnancy and lives in Alabama. They said she would still be required to testify in person in the coming months before the committee, which is investigating whether President Trump obstructed justice when he tried to thwart the special counsel's examination of his campaign's ties to Russia.
The White House is expected to intervene to try to block Donaldson, a former White House lawyer, from answering any questions about her government service. The White House will most likely cite a Justice Department opinion that close aides to the president have “absolute immunity" from congressional subpoenas.
The House, in turn, is preparing to file a lawsuit as early as next week to try to get the federal courts to strike down the administration's immunity theory, which has been advanced by presidents of both parties but has never been fully tested in court.
Even though the suit will probably take aim at Donaldson's former boss, onetime White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II, a ruling in the Democrats' favor could effectively force Donaldson and other witnesses who have defied the Judiciary Committee to take the witness stand.
Donaldson, as chief of staff to McGahn, witnessed or was privy to some of the most explosive moments detailed by Mueller's investigators, including the firing of James Comey as FBI director and attempts by Trump to gain control of the investigation. Donaldson kept detailed notes of those episodes and others, which are referenced frequently in Mueller's 448-page report.
A lawyer for Donaldson, Sandra Moser, said she was pleased with the accommodation.
New York Times
Accuser voices frustration about lack of consequences
Donald F. McGahn II, a New York-based writer who has accused President Trump of sexually assaulting her more than two decades ago, voiced frustration Monday that Trump has not faced consequences from a string of previous allegations of misconduct.
"With all the women it's the same: He denies it, he turns it around, he attacks and he threatens — and then everybody forgets it until the next woman comes along," Carroll said during an interview on CNN. "I am sick of it. I am sick of it."
Carroll, a longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, is among 16 women who have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct over the past several decades. Most spoke out just weeks before the 2016 election, after The Washington Post published a recording of Trump bragging during a 2005 "Access Hollywood" interview that his celebrity gave him permission to grab women by their genitals.
Trump has denied the allegations of misconduct and called the women "liars."
In a statement released Friday night, Trump said the encounter described by Carroll never happened and that he did not know her. In his statement, Trump asked that anyone who has information that Carroll or the magazine were working with the Democratic Party to come forward.
Carroll denied politics played any role in her decision to come forward.
"I'm barely political. I can't name you the candidates who are running right now," she told CNN. "I'm not organized . . . . I'm just fed up."
Carroll, a registered Democrat, told The Post in an interview Friday that she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She donated $1,000 this cycle to Emily's List, which supports female candidates who back abortion rights, and $500 to President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012, according to campaign finance records. On Twitter, she has posted several sharp remarks about Trump and retweets of satirical and critical articles about him.
Washington Post
Pelosi: Trump's threatened deportations not 'civilized'
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said President Donald Trump's threat to begin deporting migrants if Congress doesn't quickly pass immigration legislation is "outside the circle of civilized human behavior."
Trump gave lawmakers two weeks to act in a weekend tweet. He had earlier said there would be a nationwide immigration sweep beginning this past weekend aimed at removing people in the United States illegally, including families.
Pelosi made her remark Monday at an immigration event in Queens, N.Y.
The California Democrat also said when she called Trump Friday and asked him to call off the raids, she told him, "You are scaring the children of America."
Trump tweeted that he wants Congress to resolve "Asylum and Loophole problems" along the border with Mexico.
It is not clear what he means.
Associated Press
Knitters' network bans Trump support on website
A free, 8-million strong social network for knitters, crocheters, and others in the fiber arts has banned any mention of support for President Trump and his administration.
The new policy on Ravelry.com was posted Sunday. The post says the site took the action because it can't provide a space "inclusive of all and also allow support for open white supremacy." The post went on to say that support of the Trump administration is "undeniably support for white supremacy."
The site, founded in 2017, said the idea was not to ban Republicans or conservative politics but to distinguish them from "hate groups and intolerance." The policy makes no mention of similar treatment for registered users who criticize Trump or the administration.
One of Ravelry's cofounders, Jessica Forbes, did not immediately return a message for comment Monday. The White House declined comment Monday.

Texto completo: I did not vote for Donald Trump, as he was not my choice. But he is our duly elected president ("Condemned to repeat history?" Letters to the Editor, June 13). If one listens only to certain cable news networks and KTRC talk radio in Santa Fe, one would believe that President Donald Trump is Hitler-Stalin-Pol Pot or some other dictator who will not leave office at the end his term(s). That person would also believe that Trump is colluding with the Russians, is a Russian agent and is guilty of treason. When the same lie is told over and over, it turns into the "truth." I hope that citizens will not keep silent but will reject this type of alternate news.

Some play dirty
Remember Sen. Joseph McCarthy? Championed by conservatives, despised by liberals. The senator exhorted us to be alarmed that the Russian government, then under the guise of communism, was infiltrating our State Department. Looks like his instincts were right, but his timing was off and his sights were a bit too low.
Ronald Reagan said, "There is a bear in the woods. For some people, the bear is easy to see. Others don't see it at all. Some say the bear is ... vicious and dangerous." Reagan urged us to "beware the temptation to ignore ... the aggressive impulses of an evil empire." Those words were prophetic.
I find it supremely ironic that Fox News' Sean Hannity, the rest of the right-wing media and the Republican Party, have now become shills for the current infiltration of our government by the oligarchs of that same evil empire through our collaborator president. Call Congressman Ben Ray Luján -- impeach now!
Leslie Lakind
Santa Fe
No happy ending
Headlines in the Santa Fe New Mexican that ran inches apart -- ("State could see $1.3B oil windfall," June 15) and ("Arctic sees record ice loss," June 15). Someone should connect the dots. The Arctic and Greenland thaw and create weather havoc and sea level rise because we burn fossil fuels. Yet we give thanks for more gas and oil royalties.
Has nothing changed in 63 years? A 1956 New York Times Science in Review article said that accumulating carbon dioxide would likely lead to long-lasting environmental change; then it went on to say that industry was unlikely to respond so long as oil and coal remain cheap. Yet something has changed. We now know what we are doing and that accelerated climate change likely dooms our children.
We do not accept what we know. Thus, these headlines run on parallel tracks without anyone unearthing the underlying question: What kind of people do we want to be and what sacrifice is required of us? That is not a science question, nor one for the magic of the market. It's a moral and cultural, even religious, one. Is anyone stepping up?

Sounding explosive
When did Casa Solana become an active war zone? Several times since early May, I have been startled awake and kept awake until midnight or
1 a.m. by artillery-type explosions in the neighborhood. My dogs spend those hours in a state of panic, as do I. This is possibly illegal activity and certainly aggressive. These explosions are not a reasonable part of any Fourth of July celebration. Are the police following up on what must be repeated complaints?

Hard Rock Hotel in Dominican Republic to remove liquor dispensers after tourist deaths

Texto completo: The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is removing liquor dispensers from its Dominican Republic guest rooms as travelers question tourist deaths in the country, and specifically at the Punta Cana report, according to Penelope Polanco, a customer care assistance manager at Hard Rock Punta Cana.
"In the next day, we will proceed with taking the liquor dispensers away from the rooms, because of a final decision from our main offices," Polanco told USA TODAY. She says that the move is being made "for the tranquility of our guests" in the Punta Cana hotel and in three additional Hard Rock hotels in Mexico.
The change in hotel service comes after at least eight Americans have died in the Dominican Republic this year, though officials of the Caribbean vacation destination say that number is not abnormal.
"The Dominican Republic is a safe country," Francisco Javier Garcia, the minister of tourism in the Dominican Republic, told reporters Friday.
The deaths have happened at various locations, and in most of the cases, full toxicology reports are pending.
“There is no such thing as mysterious deaths in the Dominican Republic," Garcia said. "There is not an avalanche of deaths. ”
Last July, David Harrison of Maryland died at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Punta Cana, according to The New York Times and CNN. In April, Robert Wallace, 67, of California, died at the same resort, where he reportedly drank from the room’s minibar.
Polanco insists that the Hard Rock's "quality department investigated and didn't find anything out of our standards" in the liquor dispensers, which will still be made available to guests who order room service. The mini bar, which contains soft drinks and beer, will stay in the Hard Rock rooms.
The FBI is assisting local investigators with toxicological tests in some of the cases, according to the outlets.
A group of 40 graduating seniors and their parents from Deer Creek High School in Edmond, Oklahoma, were staying at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino when at least five members became ill, according to local TV stations KOTV and KOCO.
One of the parents, Liz McLaughlin, told KOTV that her daughter was one of the students to get sick on June 11 after eating at a Japanese restaurant at the hotel.
"We just don’t know what is happening," she said. "Is it the water? Is it the ice? Is it the food? Is it the food handling? Is it the pesticides? We have no idea what’s going on. "
Garcia said the confirmed deaths this year are not out of the ordinary and that the number is lower than in some previous years. Garcia said in both 2011 and 2015 through June, 15 tourists died in the Dominican Republic.
Latest death: Another American has died in the Dominican Republic
The deaths and violence in question
Three Americans have died in the Dominican Republic in June.
Vittorio Caruso, 56, of Long Island died June 17. His sister-in-law, Lisa Maria Caruso, told News 12 Long Island that his family got a phone call telling them he was sick, only to find out minutes later that he died.
Two other people were found dead in their hotel rooms in the Caribbean vacation destination: Joseph Allen, 55, of Woodbridge, New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of Staten Island, New York.
Cox died on June 10, the State Department confirmed to USA TODAY.
Allen's sister, Jamie Reed, told WABC-TV that his body was discovered the morning of June 13 in his hotel room at Terra Linda Resort in Sosua, located on the country's northern coast. The previous night, he had complained to friends that he felt feverish and went to bed early.
That same week, Dominican native David Ortiz, one of the most popular players in Boston Red Sox history, was shot in his homeland. The country's chief prosecutor said Ortiz was not the intended target of the June 9 shooting that put his life in peril, but was merely the victim of a hit gone wrong.
In May, Maryland couple Edward Nathaniel Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Ann Day, 49, were found dead in their room at Bahía Príncipe hotel at the resort Playa Nueva Romana. Within a week, a woman from Pennsylvania, Miranda Schaup-Werner, 41, died at the same hotel chain.
The Maryland couple who died each had internal bleeding, preliminary autopsy results showed, according to CNN. Holmes was found to have an enlarged heart and cirrhosis of the liver, while Day had fluid in her brain.
Schaup-Werner reportedly died after drinking from her hotel's minibar.
One hotel is disputing the timeline of an alleged attack of a Delaware woman that also made news the week of June 6.
And in April, the brother of "Shark Tank" star Barbara Corcoran, New Jersey-native John Corcoran, also died in the Dominican Republic. But Corcoran said her brother's death was of natural causes related to an existing heart condition.
A man who the State Department has not identified by name also became ill and later died on April 14.
Illness also called into question
Similar to the high-schoolers who fell ill at the Hard Rock Hotel in Punta Cana, a group of Jimmy Buffett fans, members of the Central Oklahoma Parrothead Association, told Oklahoma TV station KFOR and NBC News that they became seriously ill while staying at the Hotel Riu Palace Macao in Punta Cana in April.
More than 40 travelers in the group of 114 experienced similar symptoms, including fever, dizziness and diarrhea.

Texto completo: That the Democrats' two evenings of dueling oratory snippets this week are called "debates" validates Finley Peter Dunne's prediction that "when we Americans are through with the English language, it will look as if it had been run over by a musical comedy."
Already a linguistic casualty of the campaign is the noun "socialism." So, quickly, before Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign sinks, like darling Clementine, beneath the foaming brine, consider his struggle to convince Americans that socialism deserves to be the wave of their future.
One European explanation of America's puzzling (to many European intellectuals) resistance to socialism was given in 1906 by the German economist Werner Sombart: "All the socialist utopias came to nothing on roast beef and apple pie." Recently, however, Sanders delivered a Washington speech explaining, in effect, that socialism is as American as a piece of frozen apple pie with a slice of processed cheese. Doing so, however, he demonstrated that socialism is a classification that no longer classifies.
Sanders' socialism turns out to be a tweaked New Deal. He began, of course, by saying that the nation is in "a defining and pivotal moment." Speechwriters actually get paid for such bromides; capitalist America remains a land of opportunity even for the untalented. What Sanders then offered as forward-looking socialism was a warmed-over version of what President Franklin Roosevelt advocated 75 years ago.
In his 1944 State of the Union address, FDR called for "rights" to "useful" jobs, "good" education, "adequate" food and clothing and recreation, a "decent" living for farmers, a "decent" home, "adequate" medical care, "adequate" protection in old age. Details, such as how to define the adjectives and how to pay for what the nouns denote, were for another day. Sanders' agenda for "completion" of FDR's New Deal is a right to a "decent" job, "quality" health care, "complete" education, "affordable" housing, a "clean" environment, a "secure" retirement. Details later.
Sanders says "what I mean by democratic socialism" is "economic rights are human rights." Really. That's it. FDR said "necessitous men are not free men," implying that government can and should remove necessity from the human story. Sanders, FDR's unimaginative echo, presumably agrees.
Sanders loathes billionaires and loves Sweden, which has more billionaires per capita than America has. Economist Deirdre McCloskey, writing in National Review, notes that "none of Sweden's manufacturing or extractive industries has even been socialized." And "when Saab Autos began its descent into bankruptcy," the government let it go, unlike the U.S government bailing out GM and Chrysler (for a second time) after 2008. McCloskey quotes a Swedish diplomat: "In many fields, we have more private ownership compared to other European countries, and to America. About 80 percent of all new schools are privately run, as are the railroads and the subway system."
The morning after Sanders' speech, The New York Times reported something momentous: "Democratic socialism has become a major force in American political life." This is amazing, considering that it was never more than a negligible force when capitalism seemed to be in a perhaps terminal crisis: In 1932, three years into the Depression, with the unemployment rate at 23.6 percent and the GDP 25.7 percent smaller than in 1929, as this column previously noted, the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Norman Thomas, received fewer votes (884,885) than its 1920 candidate Eugene Debs received (913,693) while he was imprisoned by President Woodrow Wilson's administration.
A young adult - a member of the demographic supposedly most sympathetic to socialism - who attended Sanders' exegesis of socialism told the Times: "In America we embrace a lot of socialist policies already, like public education and parks." This understanding of socialism as any government provision of public goods puts Horace Mann (1796-1859), an advocate of public education, and Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), designer of New York City's Central Park, in the socialist pantheon with their contemporaries Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Many young people who supposedly are making socialism a "major force" think it is sociability: everyone being nice to everyone.
Sen. Elizabeth ("I have a plan for that") Warren, D-Mass., who describes herself as a "capitalist to my bones," is a more authentic socialist than Sanders because she has more granular plans for government power (aka politics) to supplant market forces in the allocation of wealth and opportunity. So she, even more than the other participants in this week's Democrats' presidential scrums, would as president give the nation a helpful, if inadvertent, tutorial about this axiom: If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

Don't let women's equality take 208 years

Texto completo: If you want to keep a secret from the general public, a blog post about accelerating gender parity in globalization is probably a good place to hide it. Even a nerd like me recognizes that it can be hard to turn a new analysis of gender data into clickbait.
I'm going to try anyway, though, because in a blog post this week, the World Economic Forum released a new projection that demands our attention.
Based on data from its widely-respected Global Gender Gap Index, WEF estimates that it will take the United States another 208 years to reach gender equality. At the current pace of change, gender equality won't arrive in the U.S. until the year 2227.
Underneath triumphant headlines about women running for office in record numbers, changing the face of Congress and breaking glass ceilings are trend lines that tell a much more somber story about the pace of progress for women in our country.
Although women now earn college and graduate degrees at higher rates than men, they remain concentrated in certain majors and, early in their careers, they are often channeled into less lucrative jobs. Men are 70% more likely to be executives than women their same age. In 2018, there were more Fortune 500 CEOs named James than there were women.
On the political front, women are 51% of the U.S. population, but hold only 24% of seats in Congress. And unlike 59 other countries — including India, Israel, Liberia, Slovakia, Mali, and Malawi — the U.S. has yet to have a female head of state.
WEF's projection also reflects the grim reality that the U.S. is the only industrialized nation where maternal mortality rates are actually getting worse. The risks are especially high for African American women, who are three to four times more likely to die during or after delivery than white women.
While 208 is a damning, daunting number, it is not destiny. The projection is based on the assumption that the rate of change will remain constant. If we can accelerate the pace of progress, that number will start to go down. And therein lies our call to action.
I know from experience that a startling statistic can be an animating force. About 25 years ago, Bill and I learned from a New York Times article that in developing countries, hundreds of thousands of children were dying of diarrhea each year. Bill and I had already decided that we wanted to give the majority of the wealth from Microsoft away, but until that article, we weren't sure how. That data point gave us direction and ultimately led us to start our foundation.
As it turned out, we were far from alone in wanting to do something about the unconscionable number of children dying preventable deaths. Our foundation was quickly connected to a wide range of partners eager to play a role in driving progress. Together, we created a new organization — Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance — which has spurred a 40% decrease in the number of children in low-and-middle-income nations who die before their fifth birthday.
Once again, we find ourselves facing an urgent challenge that calls for new investment and collaboration. Shrinking the number 208 is going to require many people across many sectors. But I believe progress is possible, and as a philanthropist, I'm particularly interested in the role that philanthropy can play in accelerating it.
While comprehensive data on U.S. philanthropy is hard to find, there's evidence that gender equality in the U.S. has been chronically underfunded. Preliminary, unpublished research based on foundation data from Candid suggests that for every $1 spent on gender equality by private donors, there is $9.27 spent on higher education, and $4.85 spent on the arts. What's more, 90% of the money that is going toward women's issues is going toward women's reproductive health specifically. If we want to make gender equality a priority, we need to be spending more — and spreading those resources more broadly.
In addition to writing checks, philanthropists can play a critical role in driving progress by creating new platforms to bring people together. As we saw with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, it's essential to have a mechanism for getting a diverse range of stakeholders around the same table.
When it comes to the fight for gender equality, one of the most important assets we have is the huge array of people who are already activated — from the thousands of organizations that have been working on these issues for years to the more than 4 million women who joined women's marches across 600 cities. That's why I think there's a lot of potential in new efforts to channel existing energies and expertise more effectively into one broad-based assault on systemic inequality. My company, Pivotal Ventures, recently invested in two of these efforts — Time's Up and The Collaborative Fund for Women's Safety and Dignity. Both are creating new partnerships to tackle harassment, discrimination and inequality at scale.
The gender gaps in our country are real, and they aren't going away on their own — at least, not any time in the next 200 years. If we want to see them close in our lifetimes, we will need to come together to insist in one voice that equality can't wait. Over two decades ago, a statistic in a newspaper called me to action. I hope the statistic WEF published this week does the same for others. If we commit to being part of the solution, the number 208 is ours to reject.

The 10% bonus that Trump needs

Texto completo: True, polls have very limited value at this stage of a presidential campaign. Yes, Democrats are far from choosing their nominee to oppose President Donald Trump. Of course, a great deal can change between now and Election Day.
Or maybe not.
Since Trump’s victory, the political balance has remained remarkably stable, and that’s both good and bad news for a president who formally launched his re-election campaign this week with a raucous rally in Florida.
On the plus side for Trump, his base shows no signs of cracking. When the president mused on Twitter recently that his supporters "would demand" he stay in office after eight years — a totally unconstitutional idea — he was accurately reflecting their unswerving devotion. "To too many people, he’s not a human being. He’s a demigod," said conservative radio host Michael Savage to The New York Times.
But the downside of this frozen landscape is equally obvious. Trump’s core base of support hovers between 35% and 37% of the electorate, and despite their fervid loyalty, that base is simply not large enough to guarantee him a second term. Trump won 46.4% of the vote in 2016, and he needs at least a 10% margin above and beyond his base — call it the 10% bonus — to have a realistic chance at a second term.
Recent polls clearly reveal the president’s peril. Two surveys in Michigan, one of three states that gave Trump his margin of victory in 2016, show Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by double digits. In Pennsylvania, a Quinnipiac poll had Biden beating Trump by 11 points. A national survey conducted by Fox News put Biden ahead by a similar margin.
An average of all national polls puts Trump’s favorable rating at 43.3%. As Peter Baker points out in The Times, "He is the only president in the history of polling who has never once, not for a single day, earned the support of a majority of Americans surveyed by Gallup."
Trump’s real base is actually even smaller. In 2016, only 38% of voters told exit polls he was qualified to be president, 35% said he had the proper temperament, and 33% described him as honest and trustworthy.
The president enters the race with many strengths. The unemployment rate of 3.6% in May was the lowest in 50 years, and in the latest CNN poll, 56% approved of his economic policies, a new high. Trump, who never really stopped campaigning, enjoys a huge lead over the Democrats in building a national organization and raising money. Above all, the Democrats are far from producing a candidate who can generate the sort of energy and excitement that powered the campaigns of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the only successful Democrats in more than 40 years.
For all the turmoil generated by the Trump presidency, not much has changed politically since his election. His base remains just about the same. He won in 2016 because about 1 in 10 voters who were not part of that base, and who had serious doubts about his character and qualifications, disliked Hillary Clinton enough to vote for him anyway. Can Trump win over that 10% again? The election could well hinge on the answer.

Texto completo: ALBANY — Eliot Spitzer remembers driving back from the Catskills in September 2007 and receiving a phone call from a former college roommate who was perplexed about how anchor Lou Dobbs was railing on TV about the governor's plan to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.
Just a few days earlier, Spitzer, still in his first year as governor, announced he would direct the state Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver's licenses to any New Yorker regardless of status so immigrants in the country illegally could come "out of the shadows."
The proposal didn't draw initial strong reaction, but days later, Dobbs and others picked up on the issue, and it was panned by Republicans, creating a national fervor.
The biggest attention came when Hillary Clinton, then the New York senator running for president, stumbled over her stance on the issue, leading to criticism from her Democratic primary rivals, including Barack Obama.
The backlash, Spitzer recalled this week, was too strong, was hurting his broader agenda, and Clinton's team asked him to pull the proposal. So he did.
Now, 12 years later, Spitzer's fight proved prescient.
The state Legislature passed a law Monday to let undocumented immigrants, perhaps 250,000 of them, apply for driver's licenses — ending a debate that started with Spitzer's failed attempt to mandate it.
Just six months after introducing the plan, he resigned when he admitted to soliciting a prostitute.
The law is "good for the state," Spitzer told the USA TODAY Network's Albany Bureau on Tuesday. "The credit goes to the advocates who stuck with this for years pushing the issue."
A fight that spans a decade and more Spitzer was trying to reverse a policy put in place in 2003 following the 9/11 attacks that banned immigrants in the country illegally from obtained licenses n New York.
But the Democratic governor said he didn't anticipate the type of reaction he received.
"I will confess," he said, "I didn't predict way back when I first proposed it that it would be such a third rail in terms of the emotions that it evoked, and the way, when I look back at it, the leading edge of the whole immigration debate."
But it certainly was.
Spitzer, who was elected by a record margin in 2006, saw his poll numbers fall over the plan, and the issue was overwhelmingly opposed by a majority of New Yorkers.
Even now, a Siena College poll this month showed a majority of voters did not support the measure.
It narrowly passed the state Senate with 33 out of 63 votes after more easily passing the Assembly, and it was signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo hours later.
Spitzer said he thought it was an important issue to tackle.
"There are many members of the community who are here, who are working and who need a means of transportation to work and support themselves and their families," Spitzer recalled.
The battle nationally For Spitzer, the issue took an unexpected turn when it became a hot-button issue in the Democratic presidential primary.
Clinton initially said on the campaign trail that Spitzer's plan "makes a lot of sense."
But as criticism built, Clinton stumbled on the issue during a debate that October, leaving an opening for her opponents to say she was flip-flopping.
Obama, then the Illinois senator, pounced.
"When it takes two weeks and six different positions to answer one question on immigration, it's easier to understand why the Clinton campaign would rather plant their questions than answer them," his campaign said, according to Reuters.
With little support in New York and questions about whether the measure would be upheld under legal challenges, Spitzer traveled to Washington to meet with federal officials on the issue and ultimately announced in November 2007 that he would drop it.
"I am not willing to fight to the bitter end on something that will not ultimately be implemented," Spitzer told the New York Times of the decision.
Spitzer recalled Tuesday the Clinton campaign had urged him to pull the plan, which was something he didn't reveal at the time but years later revealed. At the time, Clinton applauded Spitzer for dropping the effort.
"The Hillary campaign was very steadfast in calling and asking that we pull the proposal," Spitzer said Tuesday. "It reached a point where it was overwhelming all other substantive issues, and I said we have an agenda, and let's see if we can push this down the road."
Through the years The bill to allow driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants had lingered at the state Capitol since, and with Republicans in control of the state Senate for most of that time, it was gridlocked in the legislature.
But this year, with Democrats in control of state government, lawmakers were able to narrowly win enough support for its passage.
Republicans remained opposed, saying licenses should be reserved only for citizens.
"By passing this needed legislation, we are growing our economy while at the same time making our roads safer," Senate Democratic Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, said Monday.
Even Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has had a frosty relationship with Spitzer, has noted he backed the measure since Spitzer had introduced it. Cuomo was attorney general at the time.
"I support driver licenses; I did from the time Eliot Spitzer was governor," Cuomo said May 10 on WXXI, a public-radio station in Rochester. "It now gets wrapped into the immigration discussion, especially back then when Spitzer first did it."
So 12 years later, Spitzer, now a major New York City real-estate developer, sounded pleased he was on the right side of New York history on the issue.
Does he feel vindicated on the matter?
"I'm glad it passed, because it's good for the state. It's good for the immigrant community. It speaks to who we are in an affirmative way," he answered. "And like with all other issues, I suppose, it's better to be on the winning side than the losing side. More importantly, it's better to feel that we were taking a position that was the proper one for the state."
Gov. Eliot Spitzer first proposed allowing undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses in 2007, but faced remarkable backlash.

Bernie Sanders is FDR's unimaginative echo

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- That the Democrats' two evenings of dueling oratory snippets this week are called "debates" validates Finley Peter Dunne's prediction that "when we Americans are through with the English language, it will look as if it had been run over by a musical comedy." Already a linguistic casualty of the campaign is the noun "socialism." So, quickly, before Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign sinks, like darling Clementine, beneath the foaming brine, consider his struggle to convince Americans that socialism deserves to be the wave of their future.
One European explanation of America's puzzling (to many European intellectuals) resistance to socialism was given in 1906 by the German economist Werner Sombart: "All the socialist utopias came to nothing on roast beef and apple pie." Recently, however, Sanders delivered a Washington speech explaining, in effect, that socialism is as American as a piece of frozen apple pie with a slice of processed cheese. Doing so, however, he demonstrated that socialism is a classification that no longer classifies.
Sanders' socialism turns out to be a tweaked New Deal. He began, of course, by saying that the nation is in "a defining and pivotal moment." Speechwriters actually get paid for such bromides; capitalist America remains a land of opportunity even for the untalented. What Sanders then offered as forward-looking socialism was a warmed-over version of what President Franklin Roosevelt advocated 75 years ago.
In his 1944 State of the Union address, FDR called for "rights" to "useful" jobs, "good" education, "adequate" food and clothing and recreation, a "decent" living for farmers, a "decent" home, "adequate" medical care, "adequate" protection in old age. Details, such as how to define the adjectives and how to pay for what the nouns denote, were for another day. Sanders' agenda for "completion" of FDR's New Deal is a right to a "decent" job, "quality" health care, "complete" education, "affordable" housing, a "clean" environment, a "secure" retirement. Details later.
Sanders says "what I mean by democratic socialism" is "economic rights are human rights." Really. That's it. FDR said "necessitous men are not free men," implying that government can and should remove necessity from the human story. Sanders, FDR's unimaginative echo, presumably agrees.
Sanders loathes billionaires and loves Sweden, which has more billionaires per capita than America has. Economist Deirdre McCloskey, writing in National Review, notes that "none of Sweden's manufacturing or extractive industries has even been socialized." And "when Saab Autos began its descent into bankruptcy," the government let it go, unlike the U.S government bailing out GM and Chrysler (for a second time) after 2008. McCloskey quotes a Swedish diplomat: "In many fields, we have more private ownership compared to other European countries, and to America. About 80% of all new schools are privately run, as are the railroads and the subway system."
The morning after Sanders' speech, The New York Times reported something momentous: "Democratic socialism has become a major force in American political life." This is amazing, considering that it was never more than a negligible force when capitalism seemed to be in a perhaps terminal crisis: In 1932, three years into the Depression, with the unemployment rate at 23.6% and the GDP 25.7% smaller than in 1929, as this column previously noted, the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Norman Thomas, received fewer votes (884,885) than its 1920 candidate Eugene Debs received (913,693) while he was imprisoned by President Woodrow Wilson's administration.
A young adult -- a member of the demographic supposedly most sympathetic to socialism -- who attended Sanders' exegesis of socialism told the Times: "In America we embrace a lot of socialist policies already, like public education and parks." This understanding of socialism as any government provision of public goods puts Horace Mann (1796-1859), an advocate of public education, and Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), designer of New York City's Central Park, in the socialist pantheon with their contemporaries Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Many young people who supposedly are making socialism a "major force" think it is sociability: everyone being nice to everyone.
Sen. Elizabeth ("I have a plan for that") Warren, D-Mass., who describes herself as a "capitalist to my bones," is a more authentic socialist than Sanders because she has more granular plans for government power (aka politics) to supplant market forces in the allocation of wealth and opportunity. So she, even more than the other participants in this week's Democrats' presidential scrums, would as president give the nation a helpful, if inadvertent, tutorial about this axiom: If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

Is this the end of comedy?

Texto completo: These are the worst of times for comedy, especially in Hollywood.
Riffing on the weak box-office performance of the movie "Late Night," Stephen Galloway argued in the Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday that comedy is facing an existential crisis, with comedies now invariably disappointing the studios that produce them. The all-important franchises that once dominated the genre ("Airplane," "The Naked Gun," "The Hangover" and so on) have been bizarrely moribund for more than a decade.
His explanations: the preponderance of retro comedy available on Netflix; the high failure rate of new comedies; the persistent dependency of the genre on a shared, often parochial language when Hollywood would rather make money from films with global appeal. His conclusion: Comedy is now a "blip on the radar" of your typical major studio.
There is a lot to unpack here. Comedy is always hard, but it's especially difficult to write as a one-off project like a film or a play, especially if the writer is alone. Building funny characters from scratch is near impossible, since audiences now need more and more time, and a more intimate relationship, to know if it's OK to laugh with a protagonist.
It's easier to write for a multi-episode TV series, especially if there is a team of writers in the room, bouncing gags off each other and reinforcing the insecure scribe with an insistence that, yes, what you are writing is actually funny. Comedy in its purest form is the dramatic genre with the most finite aim: laughter. Tears can be brushed back, but laughter invariably builds on itself, gaining kinetic energy as one zinger leads into another. And if the jokes are not landing -- and jokes are hard to land -- the experience is excruciating.
And what's the motivation to take that risk? Even when it works, comedy has played second fiddle to tragedy since the golden age of ancient Greece.
And, of course, it is far easier to offend when attempting comedy. One person's joke is offensive to another. These days, gags are often told in semi-private settings, the teller making sure that the audience is friendly in advance.
Jokes have to make fun of something and humorists constantly worry about coming off as elitist, disloyal, out of bounds, privileged, tone-deaf or otherwise disqualified from the telling of the joke. Jokes have become a risk few want to take.
It's always useful in these discussions to ponder the difference between comedy, farce and satire.
Comedy is fundamentally mainstream and conservative. It tends to mock people who stand in the way of the natural order of things and is mostly seen these days as a so-called "rom-com," an entertainment where the end of the night brings a kiss, a consummation, a marriage. Those lampooned usually have stood in the way of true love. And since without procreation the human race would come to an end, we easily intuit that they deserve their fate.
But think of all the factors now that stand in the way of any shared notion of natural order: political differences, resistance to historical sexism, even the end of humanity or its dissolving into some version of non-carbon artificial intelligence. A lot of deep and wise thinkers these days are noodling over the question as to whether computers soon will be able to tell jokes, which is not the same thing as your Siri parroting a Monty Python-style gag previously programmed by a human.
Will artificial intelligence rise to the point where our digital cousins will be able to come up with a joke all on their own? That's a fascinating question. And the answer depends on whether you think machines will develop some amount of empathy, given that comedy requires that quality.
On the other hand, farceurs and satirists have always focused on power, so these genres have always functioned as safety valves and indicators of a free society. In a healthy democracy, a leader has to tolerate merciless lampooning, signaling a limit on power. In a dictatorship, the satirist is quickly shut down.
Of late, there have been some troubling signs of sickness: the decision by the New York Times, for example, to no longer run cartoons in its international edition, no doubt due to the propensity of the cartoonist to cause offense. Further evidence was on view at the White House Correspondents Dinner, which, running scared, replaced the usual satirist with a genial historian.
In a fascinating article in Politico the other day, Joanna Weiss argued (under the click-bait headline "How Trump Turned Liberal Comedians Conservative") that liberal comedians' hatred of Trump is so intense that it has killed the irony and the distance in their routines, and thus smothered the comedy. Weiss homes in on when Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a common profanity based on the female anatomy.
"The line drew a laugh," Weiss wrote, "but there was nothing to puzzle out. No irony, no distance. She just meant it."
Weiss expands that argument to the recent material on the Stephen Colbert show, comparing to the older stuff dispensed by Jon Stewart -- just as liberal in his world view as Colbert, but more ironic, arch, removed. And therefore funnier?
Hmm. Arguable, and also applicable to Second City and elsewhere. There isn't much irony or distance in Heidi Shreck's Broadway show, "What the Constitution Means to Me," a piece of political evangelizing that aims at a liberal audience. So much so that Supreme Court associate justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was treated as a rock star when she showed up to watch the show among the friendliest of crowds the other night in New York.
But there are some laughs in the piece: The laughs are laughs laughed by those relieved to be among kindred spirits, the jokes dispense the kind of comfort and confirmation we find in our personally curated feeds.
It's still comedy, I think. Just comedy for this moment. And not shared enough to be as profitable for a Hollywood studio.
I think the pendulum will swing back. I hope so.
We need to laugh together still.

The 'partisan' players transforming the Supreme Court

Texto completo: Federal judges are supposed to be neutral decision-makers. But any pretense of neutrality has slipped away as the appointment process for Supreme Court justices and prominent lower-court judges has become mired in political partisanship.
President Trump seems to expect his appointees to automatically side with him, just as he expects judges selected by President Barack Obama to be against him. His administration has allowed conservative advocates to play an outsize role in picking nominees. And the Senate, with its power to confirm or reject those choices, has sunk deeper into partisan score-settling. Hearings are now staged, circuslike spectacles, rather than a forum for truthful exchange.
Republicans and Democrats alike have contributed to today's hyper-politicized process. But nothing approaches the muscle that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell exerts. McConnell thwarted Obama's opportunity to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia in 2016 and, once Trump took office in 2017, began directing the swift approval of a record number of appeals court judges, as well as two Supreme Court justices.
In his new book, "Confirmation Bias," journalist Carl Hulse delves deeply into recent confirmation battles, describing the Senate's advice-and-consent power as "corrupted to what appears to be the point of no return."
The book is an absorbing, if dispiriting, look at the maneuverings of inside players like McConnell and Donald McGahn, Trump's first White House counsel, and outside advocates like Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, who appears to have steered judicial selection as much as anyone at the White House.
Hulse, a New York Times correspondent, probes moments of escalation over the years and the backroom machinations of the Trump strategy now transforming the courts and the law. Inevitably, he covers previously reported ground, but "Confirmation Bias" is an important guide at this crucial time for the stature of America's judiciary.
Chief Justice John Roberts, himself a Republican appointee (of George W. Bush), has lamented the current state of affairs. In public speeches, he has expressed concern that anyone witnessing the intensely partisan atmosphere of confirmation hearings would presume that the appointee who emerges is equally partisan. In November, Roberts pushed back on Trump when the president dismissively referred to a judge who had ruled against his administration as an "Obama judge." Roberts issued a statement saying: "We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."
Yet individual judges have sometimes reinforced the notion that they are bent on favoring the president who appointed them. Of equal concern, the current selection process appears patently designed to produce men and women who will do just that.
Tracing the origins of the Trump plan for the federal bench, Hulse recounts McGahn's early interaction with the candidate. They were introduced by David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United. Trump inscribed a copy of "The Art of the Deal" to McGahn's young son, Don III, writing, "You've got a great dad." McGahn then helped draw up Trump's spring 2016 list of possible Supreme Court nominees, at a time when conservatives wanted a sign that the erratic candidate would take judicial appointments seriously.
Once Trump became president, McConnell and McGahn - allies who abhor campaign finance limits and have sought to dismantle Washington's regulatory framework - formed an early partnership to place ideological soul mates on the bench. McGahn engineered the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. In 2018 he managed the resignation of Justice Anthony Kennedy and his replacement by Brett Kavanaugh.
Back in 2008, Kavanaugh, then an appeals court judge, swore in McGahn after his confirmation to the Federal Election Commission. "That guy's going to be on the Supreme Court someday," McGahn said privately. Nearly a decade later, in 2017, Hulse writes, McGahn confided to Trump strategist Steve Bannon his continued interest in Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court choice.
During the televised Kavanaugh confirmation hearings last year, McGahn coached the nominee on his response to Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegation. As Ford testified before senators, Hulse reveals, McGahn received "worried texts from his circle" and then urged Kavanaugh to respond aggressively: "He wanted to see the nominee push back, cut off his interrogators, and turn their questions back on them." Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegations dating back to their teen years in suburban Maryland, chalked them up to his partisan critics and challenged senators about their drinking habits after they suggested that he drank to excess as a young man.
For decades, Republicans in Washington, dismayed at the judicial liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s, have made judicial appointments a higher priority than Democrats have. They have taken a focused, unyielding approach to overhauling the bench. There have been exceptions, of course, when Democrats went on the offensive. In 1987 the Democratically controlled Senate rejected Robert Bork, and in 2013 Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid instigated a change in filibuster rules to win confirmation of stalled Obama nominations. A decade earlier, Reid helped block several nominees of President George W. Bush, including Washington lawyer Miguel Estrada to the prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Yet Republicans such as McConnell have more recently been in control and ready to play hardball, partly as retribution for Bork and Estrada. On Feb. 13, 2016, when Scalia died, McConnell received early word from the Federalist Society's Leo, a Scalia family friend. When the death became public, McConnell was ready with his statement that an appointment to the seat should be saved for the next president, to be elected in November. On that same Feb. 13, which happened to be the night of a GOP presidential debate in South Carolina, McGahn called Trump to advise him on addressing the vacancy and offering names of possible successors.
Hulse writes of the ensuing angst among some on Obama's team that the president moved too slowly on a successor. Ron Klain, then chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and a veteran of many court fights, wanted the president to quickly name Merrick Garland, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit. The well-regarded moderate's name had been kept in reserve during Obama's 2009 and 2010 appointments for just such a moment - in an election year with a Republican Senate.
Within a few days of Scalia's death, Hulse reports, Klain told White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough: "The president ought to go to the Rose Garden tomorrow and name Merrick Garland. Tomorrow. Not a month from now. Tomorrow. Every day that ticks by is a day that you are letting McConnell consolidate his position."
Obama announced the Garland choice a month later, on March 16. Senators never held a hearing.
Money also has become increasingly important in confirmation battles. Conservative advocates have raised millions for their efforts, buying ads to promote candidates and to pressure senators. While Hulse does not explore this development in depth, he does observe that liberals working with the White House were unable to generate the expected financing for a Garland campaign.
Timing and an inside track are crucial for a nominee. Hulse reveals that in June 2018, after Kennedy delivered his retirement letter to Trump, McGahn called Kavanaugh to give him the news and tell him to prepare.
Hulse admires Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate who was decisive in Kavanaugh's confirmation, calling her "meticulous" and "not one to be intimidated." His observations regarding whether the Maine Republican's vote was ever in doubt and her interactions with the Trump team are minimal. McConnell, for his part, promised to make Collins's reelection a Republican priority.
McConnell has recently said that if a Supreme Court vacancy occurred in 2020, the Senate would confirm a Trump nominee. That would reverse his 2016 election-year stand against Obama. But it would be no surprise.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- That the Democrats' two evenings of dueling oratory snippets this week are called "debates" validates Finley Peter Dunne's prediction that "when we Americans are through with the English language, it will look as if it had been run over by a musical comedy." Already a linguistic casualty of the campaign is the noun "socialism." So, quickly, before Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign sinks, like darling Clementine, beneath the foaming brine, consider his struggle to convince Americans that socialism deserves to be the wave of their future.
One European explanation of America's puzzling (to many European intellectuals) resistance to socialism was given in 1906 by the German economist Werner Sombart: "All the socialist utopias came to nothing on roast beef and apple pie." Recently, however, Sanders delivered a Washington speech explaining, in effect, that socialism is as American as a piece of frozen apple pie with a slice of processed cheese. Doing so, however, he demonstrated that socialism is a classification that no longer classifies.
Sanders' socialism turns out to be a tweaked New Deal. He began, of course, by saying that the nation is in "a defining and pivotal moment." Speechwriters actually get paid for such bromides; capitalist America remains a land of opportunity even for the untalented. What Sanders then offered as forward-looking socialism was a warmed-over version of what President Franklin Roosevelt advocated 75 years ago.
In his 1944 State of the Union address, FDR called for "rights" to "useful" jobs, "good" education, "adequate" food and clothing and recreation, a "decent" living for farmers, a "decent" home, "adequate" medical care, "adequate" protection in old age. Details, such as how to define the adjectives and how to pay for what the nouns denote, were for another day. Sanders' agenda for "completion" of FDR's New Deal is a right to a "decent" job, "quality" health care, "complete" education, "affordable" housing, a "clean" environment, a "secure" retirement. Details later.
Sanders says "what I mean by democratic socialism" is "economic rights are human rights." Really. That's it. FDR said "necessitous men are not free men," implying that government can and should remove necessity from the human story. Sanders, FDR's unimaginative echo, presumably agrees.
Sanders loathes billionaires and loves Sweden, which has more billionaires per capita than America has. Economist Deirdre McCloskey, writing in National Review, notes that "none of Sweden's manufacturing or extractive industries has even been socialized." And "when Saab Autos began its descent into bankruptcy," the government let it go, unlike the U.S government bailing out GM and Chrysler (for a second time) after 2008. McCloskey quotes a Swedish diplomat: "In many fields, we have more private ownership compared to other European countries, and to America. About 80% of all new schools are privately run, as are the railroads and the subway system."
The morning after Sanders' speech, The New York Times reported something momentous: "Democratic socialism has become a major force in American political life." This is amazing, considering that it was never more than a negligible force when capitalism seemed to be in a perhaps terminal crisis: In 1932, three years into the Depression, with the unemployment rate at 23.6% and the GDP 25.7% smaller than in 1929, as this column previously noted, the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Norman Thomas, received fewer votes (884,885) than its 1920 candidate Eugene Debs received (913,693) while he was imprisoned by President Woodrow Wilson's administration.
A young adult -- a member of the demographic supposedly most sympathetic to socialism -- who attended Sanders' exegesis of socialism told the Times: "In America we embrace a lot of socialist policies already, like public education and parks." This understanding of socialism as any government provision of public goods puts Horace Mann (1796-1859), an advocate of public education, and Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), designer of New York City's Central Park, in the socialist pantheon with their contemporaries Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Many young people who supposedly are making socialism a "major force" think it is sociability: everyone being nice to everyone.
Sen. Elizabeth ("I have a plan for that") Warren, D-Mass., who describes herself as a "capitalist to my bones," is a more authentic socialist than Sanders because she has more granular plans for government power (aka politics) to supplant market forces in the allocation of wealth and opportunity. So she, even more than the other participants in this week's Democrats' presidential scrums, would as president give the nation a helpful, if inadvertent, tutorial about this axiom: If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

Family secrets: Which to keep and others to share

Texto completo: Family secrets, every family has them. But should your estate plan be one of those secrets?
In my law practice, I am often asked by parents if they should provide a copy of their estate planning documents to their adult child(ren), or at least discuss the plan with them. And the typical lawyer answer I give is “it depends.” And it does.
It depends on the ages of those folks; whether you’re likely to make significant changes in the future; if there is anything unusual in your plan; whether anyone is being disinherited or inheriting less than what they might expect; and your relationship with the heirs and beneficiaries in general.
There are, however, some general rules.
What not to keep secret
Someone besides you (and your spouse, if applicable) should know where your documents are stored.
By the time your will, trust, health care directive, or power of attorney is needed, you are either deceased or incapacitated, so you won’t be available to hand over keys or combinations or directions to your secret storage spot.
Generally, it’s not a good idea to keep your documents in a bank safe deposit box either — access to these is notoriously difficult and they can’t be reached as quickly as may be needed in an emergency.
Your heirs and beneficiaries should know which attorney drafted your documents and how to reach them.
It’s a good idea to inform your heirs who you’ve put in charge when you’re gone. The trustee of your trust will have immediate duties and responsibilities. It’s good for them to be aware of their role ahead of time so they are prepared and willing to act.
The job of trustee is a big one — it’s not necessarily an “honor.” Thus, let them all know whom you’ve selected and why. You might find out the person you chose doesn’t want to serve, or the others object to that choice for very valid reasons.
I once had a client choose one child as trustee because the other four children “liked” that child. But during the family meeting to review the plan with all the children, it became clear that while they may have liked that child, they did not respect him. We could all see he wasn’t likely to act fairly either. Luckily, it was also apparent there was one child they all did respect. We made the change immediately.
If you are disinheriting a child or leaving one child less than the others, it’s generally a good idea to make that known ahead of time as well as your reasons for doing so. If you aren’t comfortable telling that child directly, let your attorney and your other children, and perhaps a trusted friend or adviser, know your reasons for the disinheritance. You may be able to avoid a costly fight later.
Secrets you might keep
You may want to keep the dispositive provisions of your estate plan (i.e. who gets what and when) confidential. Your children don’t need to know if you’ve left a charitable gift in addition to what you’ve left them, or how much you have, or that you’ve left the grandchildren something as well. Those things often change over time.
If you’re concerned about the spending habits of the spouse of one of your children, or the possibility of a child divorcing, you can arrange for that child’s share to be held in trust to maintain its separate property status (in California). That might be awkward to bring up at a family dinner, so you don’t have to go into details. You can simply let your child know you’ve provided for them in a trust that will give them creditor protection. (“Creditor” includes future ex-spouses, but doesn’t “creditor protection” sound so much nicer?).
Your list of assets and liabilities isn’t something anyone needs to know currently. But there should be a list (often it’s attached to your trust) and contact information readily available so that the trustee or agent acting under a power of attorney can spring into action when needed.
Many times I’ve seen family members struggle to find out where the bank accounts are, whether there was a mortgage on the house, and if there was any insurance, for weeks and months, which causes a delay in the entire administration process and unnecessary stress during an already stressful time.
Don’t take it to the grave
Finally, you’d be doing your family members a great favor if you talked about your wishes for end-of-life care and memorial services. It’s a difficult topic, but an important one. Talk about whether you want to be an organ donor, your desires for pain medication, life support and CPR.
If you prefer cremation or burial, let your loved ones know. The more plans you make on your own, including pre-paid burial arrangements, and share with your loved ones, the less their burden will be when they are grieving your loss. They’ll be able to focus on celebrating you and your life, your final gift to them.

BUSINESS BEAT; Walmart to pay $282 million to end bribery case

Texto completo: Walmart Inc. ended a seven-year investigation by the U.S. government over payments made to fast-track store openings in several countries by agreeing to pay more than $282 million in penalties. Its Brazilian unit admitted to violating a federal anti-bribery law.
In parallel announcements Thursday, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission faulted the country's largest retailer for not having controls in place to vet third-party companies it worked with to open stores in Mexico, China, Brazil and India. Walmart will pay about $138 million in criminal penalties and $144 million in disgorgement to resolve the SEC's allegations.
WMT Brasilia pleaded guilty Thursday to failing to keep accurate records, while the U.S. parent reached a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. The company will have a compliance monitor for two years as part of that accord.

"Walmart is committed to doing business the right way, and that means acting ethically everywhere we operate," Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in a statement. "We've enhanced our policies, procedures and systems and invested tremendous resources globally into ethics and compliance, and now have a strong Global Anti-Corruption Compliance Program."
The resolution, disclosed in court filings in Virginia and news releases, was a muted end to what was once seen as one of the largest foreign bribery cases launched by the U.S. Although the penalty is about one-sixth of the $1.78 billion levied against Petroleo Brasileiro in one of South America's biggest corruption scandals, Walmart wound up spending about $1 billion in legal fees and other costs related to the investigation.
Justice Department and SEC officials said Walmart didn't take necessary steps to avoid corruption.
"Walmart valued international growth and cost-cutting over compliance," said Charles Cain, chief of the SEC unit that enforces the FCPA. "The company could have avoided many of these problems, but instead Walmart repeatedly failed to take red flags seriously and delayed the implementation of appropriate internal accounting controls."
Walmart disclosed possible violations in Mexico to the Justice Department and SEC in November 2011. In 2012, the New York Times outlined details of allegations that Walmart paid some $24 million to Mexican officials to win quick zoning changes, sidestep licenses and environmental permits and deflect opposition to stores, turning Walmart into Mexico's largest private-sector employer.
The Times article set off a resurgence of foreign bribery investigations, which had begun to accumulate court losses and gain corporate enemies who were pushing Congress to rein in prosecutors.
But the Walmart case posed challenges for investigators. Much of the conduct uncovered in Mexico, for example, couldn't be used as evidence because it was too old, according to people familiar with the matter. So the government sought to build stronger cases in other countries. In Brazil and India, investigators found more recent examples of what they believed were improper payments, yet struggled to find examples of rampant misconduct in China, the people said.
In the closing days of the Obama administration, Walmart balked at demands to pay more than $600 million in penalties, leading prosecutors to go back to gather more evidence from witnesses, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg at the time.
In 2017, the company set aside almost $300 million for a possible settlement, after which the sides deadlocked over what misconduct the retail giant would admit to, a person familiar with the matter previously said.
On Thursday, Walmart's Brazilian unit admitted that $527,000 in improper payments to an intermediary were inaccurately recorded on financial records. Walmart Brazil employees logged those payments as going to construction companies when they knew the money was going to a former Brazilian government official, according to the plea agreement filed in Virginia.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — U. S. forces were prepared for a retaliatory strike on Iran on Thursday, but later withdrew those plans with just hours to go, according to officials and news reports.
A U. S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that the military had prepared for limited strikes on Iran after the nation shot down a U. S. drone over international waters, but that approval was abruptly withdrawn.
The New York Times, citing several unnamed senior administration officials, reported that President Donald Trump approved the strikes and then stopped them. The U. S. officials had expected a strike as late as 7 p. m. , the Times reported.
The decision followed a day of tensions with Iran after the country's military shot down the drone, which Iran said violated its airspace – claims the U. S. said are false. The Pentagon called the action a "dangerous and escalatory attack," and Trump labeled it a "very big mistake," suggesting a retaliatory U. S. strike was imminent.
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan huddled Thursday with national security officials at the White House to discuss military options, including an attack on the site that launched the missile that destroyed the unmanned surveillance aircraft, according to a Defense official familiar with the discussions but not authorized to speak about them publicly.
Iran shoots down U. S. drone: Donald Trump plays down Iran attack on US drone as a 'big mistake' by someone 'stupid'
The White House on Thursday night declined the AP's requests for information about whether Trump changed his mind.
Earlier Thursday, the White House summoned leaders in Congress for a late-afternoon briefing on Iran.
"I sense that a limited, targeted reprisal strike is likely – but with the emphasis on 'limited,'" said Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst at the Brookings Institution. "Then Iran will decide what it wants to do next. Not a huge risk of escalation. But still a non-zero risk. "
In the last two years, U. S. and allied forces have mounted limited airstrikes in Syria that could offer a guide to an attack on Iran. In April 2018, American, British and French forces fired 105 missiles on three Syrian chemical weapons facilities a week after the regime of Bashar al Assad had launched a brutal attack that killed 40 civilians. A year earlier, Tomahawk cruise missiles struck an airfield in Syria where Pentagon officials said a chemical attack had originated.
Trump responds: 'You'll soon find out' if US retaliates after Iran shoots down drone, Trump warns
In recent weeks, the Pentagon has shifted an aircraft carrier strike group, B-52 bombers and thousands of troops to the region to confront Iran and protect American forces in the region. The bombers offer the option of launching long-range cruise missiles far from Iran's air defenses.
The Navy RQ-4 was flying in international airspace over waters where two tankers were attacked in recent weeks when it was blasted by a surface-to-air missile fired from a battery near Goruk, Iran, according to Air Force Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, commander of Air Force assets in the Middle East. Iran has denied attacking the tankers, and said Thursday that the drone had violated its airspace.
"This dangerous and escalatory attack was irresponsible and occurred in the vicinity of established air corridors between Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Muscat Oman, possibly endangering innocent civilians," Guastella said.
Experts had predicted Iran would continue acting out before the drone strike and that the crisis could spiral. Earlier this week, Philip Gordon, a negotiator on the deal to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapons, said there were “not a lot of good options and a significant risk of escalation. ”
Gordon, who was White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf Region under President Obama from 2013 to 2015, pointed to the Trump administration declaring Iran’s Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization in April, and then imposing sanctions on other countries buying Iranian oil, which “severely punished the Iranian economy. ”
Iran v. U. S. : What Iran and the United States are saying about the shooting down of the U. S. drone
The tensions: Escalating Iran crisis looks a lot like the path US took to Iraq war
“I think that’s what brought us to the crisis that we’re in now,” Gordon, now senior fellow in U. S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he believes Iran is responsible for the recent sabotaging of ships and explosions in the Gulf, and he noted the regime “ominously” has vowed to restart its nuclear program. He said he didn’t see many off-ramps from imminent military conflict.
“There was… the notion that by squeezing the Iranians so hard the people would rise up and push the regime aside,” Gordon said. “That doesn’t seem to be happening anytime soon. ”
Gil Barndollar, a former Marine and senior fellow at non-interventionist-leaning think tank Defense Priorities, said Thursday that “it would be hard to bet against” United States taking military action, even in a limited way, in response to the drone strike. But he hopes the Trump administration uses the incident as “an opportunity” to restart diplomatic efforts.
“I would hope we use this opportunity to steer back toward negotiations and look at re-orienting things with Iran on a live-and-let-live basis,” said Barndollar, who is also the director of Mideast studies at the Center for the National Interest.

Texto completo: Group accuses Chris Cox of aiding a 'conspiracy' to oust chief executive
The National Rifle Association has sidelined its top lobbyist, Chris Cox, after accusing him in court documents of participating in what it called a failed extortion scheme to rid the organization of its top executive.
Cox, the NRA's second-in-command and leader of its powerful political arm, was placed on administrative leave after the organization filed a lawsuit Wednesday in New York against former NRA president Oliver North, who resigned in April after accusing the NRA of exorbitant spending.
Chief executive Wayne LaPierre has accused North of attempting to extort the group. In its new suit, the NRA accused Cox of participating in a "conspiracy" with North.
NRA officials on Thursday confirmed Cox has been suspended, declining to comment further.
Cox could not be reached for comment. In a statement to the New York Times, which first reported his suspension, Cox called the allegations "offensive and patently false. For 24 years I have been a loyal and effective leader in this organization."
The abrupt ouster of Cox, a prominent figure in Washington, is the latest sign of disarray and turmoil at the organization, which has been roiled by accusations of misspending. The bitter infighting also comes as President Trump - who was the beneficiary of a record-setting $30 million boost from the NRA in 2016 - launches his reelection campaign.
Cox is one of the organization's highest-profile leaders, featured on enormous banners at the group's annual convention and in videos put out by the NRA, where he controlled a $33 million budget of the group's political arm.
Cox, who has led the political and lobbying arm of the NRA since 2002, received about $1.1 million in compensation in 2017, according to the NRA's most recent tax filing.
The internal power struggle that has riven the NRA burst into public view in April, when LaPierre told the board of directors that North was threatening the release of "a devastating account of our financial status" if the NRA chief did not step down. LaPierre accused North of working in concert with the group's estranged public relations firm, Ackerman McQueen.
An attorney for North has declined to comment. But in a letter as he left his post as president, North warned that the organization's finances were in "clear crisis."
In its lawsuit against North, the NRA claims that North said he could work with Ackerman's co-founder to negotiate an "excellent retirement" for LaPierre if he cooperated. It also implicated another board member, former Oklahoma congressman Dan Boren (D), in the alleged scheme. Boren did not return a request for comment.
The lawsuit claims that emails and text messages "demonstrate that another errant NRA fiduciary, Chris Cox - once thought by some to be a likely successor for Mr. LaPierre - participated in the Ackerman/North/Boren conspiracy."
The lawsuit seeks to block North from having the NRA pay his legal fees associated with numerous suits involving the NRA and Ackerman, as well as for a Senate inquiry.

Texto completo: The verdict followed a wild six-week trial where jurors heard explicit testimony about Raniere's graphic sexual exploits and how he manipulated the many followers of NXIVM, a purported self-help group based in the Albany area.
ALBANY — NXIVM leader Keith Raniere, who surreptitiously led a secret master-slave group whose members were sexually exploited and branded with his initials on their pubic area, was convicted Wednesday of seven felonies in Brooklyn federal court.
A federal jury returned its verdict around 2 p.m. after less than five hours of deliberation.
The verdict followed a wild six-week trial where jurors heard explicit testimony about Raniere's graphic sexual exploits and how he manipulated the many followers of NXIVM, a purported self-help group based in the Albany area.
For more than two decades, Raniere, who grew up in Suffern, Rockland County, portrayed himself as an all-knowing guru who was once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as one of the smartest men in the world.
But prosecutors said Raniere, 58, was a fraud. They painted him as a conniving, jealous con man who methodically groomed his followers for sex and was nearly kicked out of college after struggling to keep up his grades.
The U.S. Attorney's Office for New York's Eastern District said Raniere was convicted of all charges, including forced labor conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, sex trafficking and racketeering charges, which included underlying acts of child pornography possession, identity theft and child sexual exploitation, among others.
"His crimes, and the crimes of his co-conspirators, ruined marriages, careers, fortunes and lives," U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said in a statement. "The evidence proved that Raniere was truly a modern day Svengali."
There was no immediate comment from Raniere's attorneys.
Critics long called NXIVM a cult Raniere founded NXIVM in the late 1990s after shutting down his previous business, Consumers Buyline Inc., which had been investigated by several state attorneys general as a pyramid scheme.
NXIVM, which was based in Colonie, Albany County, was billed as a self-help organization. People paid thousands of dollars to take classes based on Raniere's curriculum, but the group quickly and repeatedly faced accusations that it was a cult whose members were manipulated into lionizing Raniere.
The organization built up a series of influential followers, including Clare Bronfman, a wealthy heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune who bankrolled many of Raniere's efforts and lawsuits against detractors.
More recently, Raniere secretly founded DOS, a women's group whose members were known as "slaves" who had to follow orders from their "masters." Most members didn't know Raniere was the top "master."
"Slaves" had to give up damaging collateral — naked photographs, false confessions — in order to join the group, which was billed by leaders, including actress Allison Mack, as an empowerment organization but was used by Raniere to further his sexual interests.
Mack, 36, who was best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan on the CW's "Smallville," pleaded guilty in April to two racketeering felonies. She is due for sentencing in September.
Also pleading guilty for their roles in the criminal enterprise were Bronfman, NXIVM co-founder Nancy Salzman and her daughter, Lauren Salzman, who was a high-ranking NXIVM official.
Jurors heard explicit testimony Throughout the lengthy trial, prosecutors detailed how Raniere possessed sexually explicit photographs of one his followers who was 15 years old at the time and how he kept a woman imprisoned in her own home for nearly two years for showing interest in another man.
Jurors heard from a one-time "slave" who was forced to strip naked and wear a blindfold while another woman was told to perform a sex act on her as Raniere watched. The sex act was videotaped.
"Slaves" were told their collateral could be released if they didn't perform the acts ordered by their "master."
Some of the "slaves" were also told to strip naked for an initiation ceremony, where they were branded on their pelvis with a hot cauterizing iron. The brand was a logo that contained the initials of Raniere and Allison Mack, who was a top-level "master."
Victims speak out After the verdict was announced, women who had been victimized by Raniere spoke to the media outside the courthouse, thanking the jury for its decision.
Among them were Catherine Oxenberg, the former "Dynasty" star whose daughter, India, was a member of DOS, and Toni Natalie, a Rochester-area woman whom Raniere harassed with lengthy, expensive lawsuits and legal threats after their eight-year relationship ended in 1999.
Oxenberg and Natalie called themselves "bookends."
Natalie was one of the first people to speak out publicly against Raniere and accuse NXIVM of being a cult, while Oxenberg's decision to speak out in The New York Times in 2017 helped spur the federal investigation that ultimately brought him down.
"She started this, and I finished it," Oxenberg said.
Natalie, who was painted as NXIVM's foremost enemy by Raniere and his inner circle, said that after she and Raniere broke up, he told her she would be "dead or in jail" the next time he saw her.
"Well, I'm alive and he's in jail and it looks like for the rest of his life," Natalie told reporters. "The good guys won today."
Natalie, who attended the entire trial, spent years locked in litigation with Raniere and his followers, who challenged her bankruptcy, fought for years-old patents from an old business and forced her to spend thousands and thousands of dollars in legal fees. On Wednesday, Natalie wore a black-and-white striped shirt to wait for the jury's verdict. She called it her "jail shirt."
"I wore this so he knew what he would be looking at for the rest of his life," Natalie said.
The verdict followed a wild six-week trial where jurors heard explicit testimony about Raniere's graphic sexual exploits and how he manipulated the many followers of NXIVM, a purported self-help group based in the Albany area.

Texto completo: UNITED NATIONS - Relatives of a Bethpage man who is on a hunger strike in the same Egyptian prison where the former President Mohammed Morsi was held before his death Monday are renewing their call for their family member's release - fearing he may suffer the same fate.
"We have constant nightmares about him dying in prison," said Mustafa Ahmed, who is Moustafa Kassem's brother-in-law. "He cannot survive there much longer. We pray that he is released and brought home so that he can receive the medical care he needs to save his life."
Ahmed has lobbied federal lawmakers, including Reps. Peter King (R-Seaford) and Thomas Suozzi (D-Glen Cove), written an opinion piece in The New York Times and reached out to the administration of President Donald Trump in an attempt to get Kassem back home to Bethpage, where the two men live. They co-own an auto parts shop in Bay Shore.
Kassem's  attorney, Washington-based Praveen Madhiraju, said the family is concerned since Kassem is already medically compromised because he has been on a hunger strike since September. That's when he was sentenced by an Egyptian court to 15 years in prison for his alleged role in support of Morsi and his political party, the Muslim Brotherhood.
The family denies that Kassem supported the now-outlawed political party, saying he was arrested during a sweeping crackdown on dissent in Cairo while he and Ahmed were visiting family in June 2013. Kassem has been imprisoned ever since his arrest that August.
"Moustafa has been enduring similarly neglectful medical care, in the same prison complex, and is also very much at risk of dying," Madhiraju said. "He needs to be released and given proper medical attention immediately."
Morsi rose to the top of Egyptian politics in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, the wave of anti-authoritarian protests across the Middle East that toppled several longtime leaders, including Hosni Mubarak, who was president of Egypt for three decades until he stepped down in February 2011 in response to popular demand.
But Morsi, who was elected in 2012, himself was overthrown a year later, in July 2013, by military commanders - including then-Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who is now the president - and jailed until his death Monday. Morsi collapsed under suspicious circumstances during his trial in Cairo.
Kassem became embroiled in a wave of rough-and-tumble Egyptian politics when military forces cracked down on thousands of people assembled at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square on Aug. 14, 2013, breaking up a protest camp because they were supporting Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood.
Kassem's family said he was in Egypt at the time of his arrest to visit his wife and children and played no role in the protests. They said Kassem, who was due to fly back to the United States 12 days later, had gone to a shopping mall to change currency but was captured when the crackdown spread far beyond the square.
Ahmed said Kassem showed his U.S. passport to the authorities and they proceeded to beat him before detaining him. He has been in custody ever since and he was sentenced in September after a trial that prosecuted over 700 defendants - giving some the death penalty - and which has been criticized by human rights groups and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.
"The conduct of the trial in the Cairo Criminal Court has been widely criticized," Bachelet said at the time. "And rightly so. The 739 people were tried en masse, and were not permitted individual legal representation before the court. In addition, the accused were not given the right to present evidence in their defense, and the prosecution did not provide sufficient evidence to prove individual guilt. The evident disregard of basic rights of the accused places the guilt of all those convicted in serious doubt. In particular, the 75 death sentences affirmed yesterday, if implemented, would represent a gross and irreversible miscarriage of justice."
On Tuesday, Bachelet called for an independent investigation into Morsi's death.
"As former President Mohammed Morsi was in the custody of the Egyptian authorities at the time of his death, the State is responsible for ensuring he was treated humanely and that his right to life and health were respected," she said in a statement. "Any sudden death in custody must be followed by a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation carried out by an independent body to clarify the cause of death."
Madhiraju said he welcomed U.S. intervention on Kassem's behalf - or for Egyptian authorities to have a change of heart.
"We hope that President Sisi grants Moustafa a release -- on humanitarian or other grounds," he said. "We and the United States government would very much value such merciful ac

TRUMP IS HIS OWN WORST ENEMY THE PRESIDENT DOES WELL ON THE ISSUES, BUT HIS PERSONALITY IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF HIS RE-ELECTION

Texto completo: "What's your pitch to the swing voter on the fence?" ABC's George Stephano br data-css-regions-fragment-of="3345">poulos asked President Donald Trump in an interview that aired Sunday.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="3347">
Questions of this sort are gifts to politicians, but interviewers ask them for a couple of reasons. One, they're civic-minded. Politicians deserve the opportunity to make their cases straightforwardly - and voters deserve to hear them. Second, they save time. If you give your subject a free shot to get the talking points out of the way, you can move on to the more interesting stuff.
Mr. Trump's initial answer started off following the standard script. He got four words off that must have had his political advisers cheering, "Safety, security, great economy."
Ideally, this is where Mr. Trump would have stopped talking.
But the president kept going, boasting that he won 52% of the women's vote in 2016. He didn't; that was the white women's vote; he got 41% of women overall, according to exit polls. Then, Mr. Trump talked about how the economy would help him with minorities.
"So," Mr. Stephanopoulos asked, "that's the pitch?"
Mr.Trump briefly got back on message. "No, I have no pitch," he said. "You know what I have? The economy is phenomenal. We've rebuilt our military. We're taking care of our vets. We're doing the best job that anybody's done probably as a first-term president. ..."
This was another good place to stop. But he was only getting warmed up: "I have a phony witch hunt, which is just a phony pile of stuff. Mueller comes out. There's no collusion. And essentially a ruling that no obstruction. ..."
And then Mr. Trump was off to the races, fighting with Mr. Stephanopoulos about what the Mueller report did or didn't say. The facts weren't on Mr. Trump's side, as virtually every news outlet was eager to trumpet.
But politically, that's not the important part. Impeachment is catnip to the mainstream media and Democrats. Whether Mr. Trump was "set up" by the deep state and their "dirty" dossier is catnip to Republicans and right-wing media. But it seems a fair bet that the swing voters Mr. Stephanopoulos asked about aren't intoxicated by either topic.
And that's the problem for Mr. Trump. When you talk to people who think he will be re-elected, they point to conventional rules about how a good economy makes voters want to stay the course. That's superficially plausible, but it leaves out the single most important fact of the political landscape: Mr. Trump's personality.
A good economy doesn't necessarily speak for itself. Normal presidents stay on message to deny the press the ability to talk about more interesting stuff. The only talking point Mr. Trump can be counted on to stick to is himself. Hence, his claim to Mr. Stephanopoulos that no one has been treated worse than him.
Mr. Trump doesn't want the election to be about the economy, he wants it - and everything else - to be about him. His exchange with Mr. Stephanopoulos was an analogue of every Trump rally. He runs through the talking points about the economy or conservative judges as quickly as possible so he can get to the really important topic: Donald Trump.
The problem for Mr. Trump is that if the central question of the election is him, he will lose because he is not popular.
The Trump campaign's internal polling, which was leaked last week, showed him trailing Joe Biden in several must-win states by wide margins. Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, said the polls were irrelevant because it was "ancient" data from last March, taken before he was "exonerated" by the Mueller report. But Mr. Trump's post-Mueller-report approval ratings haven't improved. His sub-50 percent approval rating has had the least variation of any president since World War II. Most people have made up their minds about him, and most of them don't like him.
The campaign responded by saying it had fresh data showing solid support from "informed voters." Mr. Parscale told ABC News that since March, "we have seen huge swings in the president's favor across the 17 states we have polled, based on the policies now espoused by the Democrats."
The key words there are "informed voters." According to The New York Times, the polls Mr. Parscale described were "informed ballot" polls that described Democrats in negative ways before asking about support for Mr. Trump.
The common wisdom among pollsters is that if you're citing informed-ballot polls, you're losing. But even taken at face value, the meaning of these polls is that some voters could be persuaded to vote for Mr. Trump if they could be convinced they were voting on issues rather than him. For that to work, Donald Trump would have to stop acting like Donald Trump and make the message about something other than him. That's a tall order.

Theater at Monmouth to feature ‘Murder for Two’ musical mystery show

Texto completo: MONMOUTH — Theater at Monmouth opens its “What Dreams May Come” Golden Anniversary Season with a killer case just begging to be solved. “Murder for Two,” with book and music by Joe Kinosian and book and lyrics by Kellen Blair, begins with a bang.
One actor investigates the crime. The other plays all of the suspects. And they both play the piano. A zany blend of musical comedy and madcap mystery, this fast and funny whodunit is a highly theatrical duet loaded with killer laughs. Help catch the killer at 7:30 p.m. Saturday June 22, through Friday, Aug. 16, including matinee and evening performances on both weekdays and weekends.
On the eve of his surprise birthday party, legendary American novelist and guest of honor Arthur Whitney is shot dead by an unknown killer. Small town policeman Marcus Moscowicz’s only orders are to keep the scene secure and the party-goers turned suspects from leaving; but this could be the break he needs to prove to the chief he’s ready to make detective. If he can stick to protocol, he might be able to solve this crime. Unless the suspects and his painful memories get the best of him first.
Director Adam P. Blais feels “the strength of ‘Murder for Two’ is the way Kinosian and Blair lovingly spoof, celebrate and reimagine both the murder mystery and musical theatre genres.”
First produced by Chicago Shakespeare Theatre in 2011, Blair and Kinosian have concocted a theatrical and literary love letter that honors the work of Agatha Christie, the Marx Brothers, Alfred Hitchcock, Frank Loesser and Charles Ludlam.
Blais continues, “’Murder for Two’ encompasses everything that I love about the theatre. The story is smart yet funny, the characters complicated yet endearing, and the score is intricate yet hummable.” The New York Times called it an “ingenious miniature musical in the form of a snazzy vaudevillian double-act.”

“Murder for Two” features TAM new comers Robbie Harrison as the suspects and Quinn Corcoran as Detective Marcus. Directed by Adam P. Blais, set design by Daniel Bilodeau, costume design by Jonna Klaiber, lighting design by Jim Alexander and sound design by Rew Tippin.

Texto completo: Dance has been a part of Derek Hough's life since he was a child, but he is also an accomplished musician, actor and singer. In his new stage show, "Derek Hough Live! The Tour," he showcases his many talents and opens up with audiences on a more personal level.
Hough is best known as a cast member on "Dancing With the Stars," a TV competition he has won six times. He won two Emmy Awards for his choreography on the show. He recently served as a judge alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo on the TV show "World of Dance."
He has played Corny Collins in "Hairspray Live!," been the male lead in a London production of "Footloose" and had a recurring role on the TV show "Nashville." His book "Taking the Lead: Lessons from a Life in Motion" was a New York Times bestseller.
This tour is a different experience for Hough, who is used to working with his sister. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he toured with Julianne Hough, also an accomplished dancer, actress and singer.
His new show isn't just him on stage alone, though. He has dancers and a band. The show crosses genres, presenting Motown, Latin, rock-and-roll, big band, hip hop and other styles of music and dance. Hough plays the guitar and drums, along with singing and dancing.
He talked about his solo tour during a recent telephone interview.
Question: How have audiences been responding to your tour?
Answer: The audiences' response, the reactions, the reviews have been overwhelming. I've worked so hard on this show, putting together something that appeals to such a wide demographic, everybody from kids to 90-year-olds and everybody in between.
I really get personal, and I get quite vulnerable in the show towards the end, having a chat. The response so far from everybody has been just beautiful. I'll sign autographs and sign posters after the show, and I ask a lot of people what's their favorite part.
What's so wonderful to hear is everybody has a different favorite part that they love the most. Some will be in tears from the emotional parts of the show, and some are having a blast, having fun, standing up and dancing. It captures all of the different emotions.
Q: Do you feel it's changed how people look at you?
A: There's a lot of singing in the show. I do "Singin' in the Rain," Michael Buble songs and some Top 40 stuff. It's wonderful to share that aspect of what I do as well.
For me to have done so many different tours and for people to come up to me and say that they really, really loved this one, it just makes me so happy. I'm always trying to get better and better, elevate and make the best show possible for these audiences.
Q: What went into choosing the dancers for your show?
A: I picked dancers that can do things that I can't. There's certain things that I'm an expert at, and there are certain areas that aren't necessarily my strongest areas. Every night, I'm blown away by what they are producing on that stage, just their technique, their grace and their athleticism.
Q: When you were getting ready for the show, did it feel different working with them compared to your sister?
A: The biggest difference was trying to figure out how I was going to be onstage for the entire time, or where I was going to not be onstage. It was very important for me to have dancers who were so good that it didn't matter if I was onstage or not.
Also, the one big change for this show is I have a live band. That was a big part of the process. It took a lot more thought, a lot more time. I did all the arrangements and was in the recording studio, putting together music. The band was rehearsing, and we were dancing in the room. What it has done is it has made the show feel more like a concert.
Q: How long did it take to put together the show?
A: It took a long time. The thing that took the longest was the music, getting the music and the set list together. I wanted such a big variety of music that covers the whole spectrum of genres and music that inspires us to move and dance. Also, I wanted to pick music that was meant to be played live. I wanted this music to really pop and really feel exciting when you hear it.
Q: How did you decide what music to use?
A: I picked music that I get excited about but also music that I know that my audience will love as well, infusing them, combining them, updating some of them, changing some of these songs and making them feel more contemporary. For me, what's awesome is after the show having a 6-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music and, in the same moment, having a 70-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music.
Q: Did you have to brush up on any dance styles for the show?
A: I tap a lot in the show. For me, I love tap dancing so much. I had to definitely work hard on brushing up on my tap. I do a really challenging routine in the show. It's very demanding, very physical. Fortunately, I keep sharp in my styles and what I do, and I work hard, train and practice a lot. When it came to rehearsal, I was ready to go.
Q: It sounds like you've really challenged and pushed yourself with this show.
A: This definitely is a challenging show for everybody, including our dancers. The dancers are working extremely hard. It's a full-out show. When people come and see the show, I think they're surprised by the amount of energy that is exerted on that stage.
Q: What do you hear consistently that audiences always love and get excited about?
A: There's a moment where I get really personal. I really open up about struggles that I've gone through and how we all share this vulnerability. We all share these thoughts, these doubts in our mind. I've really heard from a lot of people that it touched them. It really moved them tremendously. That's my goal. I really just want to inspire, motivate or connect with the audience.
Q: Have your dancers and band helped to shape the show?
A: A lot of the big moments, it could only happen because of the talent of the musicians or the dancers. Being a choreographer isn't just about creating moves that you want to see. It's about bringing the best out in who you have. A lot of times, I will say, "Do something amazing here," and they will do something that is in their wheelhouse and only they can bring that to the table. There are so many of those moments that each dancer brings that couldn't have happened without them.

Trump’s troubling trade tirades

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has declared victory in his confrontation with Mexico. After he threatened to impose crippling tariffs on $350 billion worth of goods Mexico exports annually to the U.S., that country’s leaders agreed to measures aimed at impeding asylum-seekers from Central America that flow through Mexico headed for the American border.
The short-term headlines were certainly favorable to the president. But the long-term cost to Trump could be very damaging. The president’s strongest argument for a second term is a vibrant economy, and his actions are jeopardizing fiscal stability and his own re-election chances.
The clash with Mexico is part of a much larger pattern in which the president blusters and bullies his way around the world, threatening trading partners from China and Japan to France and Canada if they don’t knuckle under to his demands. And the backlash is already blossoming. The U.S. economy added only 75,000 new jobs last month, one of the lowest monthly totals since the last recession ended 10 years ago, and those results reflect a global economic slowdown that many economists blame at least in part on Trump’s trade tirades.
The World Bank cited "rising trade protectionism" as a prime cause of weakening economic growth in 2018.
Republican senators were so alarmed at Trump’s bellicose threats toward Mexico that they were preparing to block new tariffs before the president canceled them.
"We are going to have a lot of our members who are very concerned about where this is headed," said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican, to The New York Times.
Since a healthy economy remains a prime GOP campaign issue, he added, "I don’t know why we would want to step on that." The Wall Street Journal warned in an editorial that "the effects of trade uncertainty are rippling out," and that the May jobs report was "a flashing yellow light that Mr. Trump needs to settle his trade wars and get back to promoting growth."
The economic slowdown is not the only thing signaling danger for the president. The brightest warning light, however, foreshadows the impact of Trump’s policies on the economy. Businesses detest chaos and confusion, but the president firmly believes that he thrives in precisely those conditions. And after his encounter with Mexico, he seems more emboldened than ever to raise tensions with trading partners by threatening new penalties.
"Protectionism shows no signs of abating; rather, it is intensifying," Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., told the Times. Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, added on CNBC: "The weaponization of tariffs — the increase of threats on our economy, and on our farmers, our manufacturers, our consumers — is going to hurt our country."
Those farmers, manufacturers and consumers also vote. And Trump’s tariff tirades risk undermining economic growth, and alienating those voters, just as his re-election campaign is accelerating.

Texto completo: MOSCOW -- The Kremlin warned on Monday that reported American hacking into Russia's electric power grid could escalate into a cyberwar with the United States, but insisted that it was confident in the system's ability to repel electronic attacks.
Dmitri S. Peskov, President Vladimir V. Putin's spokesman, also raised concerns that President Trump was reportedly not informed about the effort, which was the subject of a New York Times report on Saturday that detailed an elaborate system of cybertools deployed by the United States inside Russia's energy system and other targets.
The program, as described by current and former unidentified American officials, would enable an attack on the Russian power grid in the event of a major conflict between Moscow and Washington.
It was deployed, the Times reported, after years of public warnings from American security agencies about similar aggressive actions conducted by Russia. "This information means that there is a hypothetical possibility" of cyberwarfare against Russia, Mr. Peskov said.
It is unclear how deeply the so-called software implants have penetrated into the Russian power grid. Russia's Energy Ministry said in a statement that it had received no information about attacks against its system, which is defended separately by various companies that manage it.
"The Russian energy power grid has a high level of security," the ministry said in a statement, noting that most of the critically important facilities are connected to the state defense system. "Systemic and successful work is being carried out to use Russian technology and equipment to eliminate such risks."
Mr. Peskov echoed that statement, but also said that "vitally important spheres of our economy have been targeted with cyberattacks from abroad."
"We have said it many times that our relevant agencies are constantly fighting against them in order to make sure these attacks inflict no damage on our economy and sensitive spheres," he said.
Mr. Putin has tried repeatedly "to initiate international cooperation in order to jointly counter all forms of cybercrime," Mr. Peskov added, but the United States has not responded.
American intelligence agencies say that in fact, Russia is a major source of cybercrime and state-directed intrusion into American systems. Investigators have reported that Russian intelligence tried to gain access to American voting systems before the 2016 election, and in some cases succeeded.
Energy power grids have recently turned into an international battlefield. Mr. Trump and Congress gave new authority last year to the American military's Cyber Command, but two administration officials told The Times that they did not think the president had been told in detail about efforts to penetrate Russia's energy systems.
Russian foreign policy commentators said that the report about American efforts to insert software code into Russia's energy system might jeopardize a potential Putin-Trump meeting at the G20 Summit in Japan at the end of June.
"This is a direct challenge that Moscow cannot leave unanswered," Ruslan Pukhov, an arms expert and head of the Center for Strategies and Technologies, told Kommersant, a Russian business daily.
The two leaders might meet briefly on the sidelines of the summit, Mr. Peskov said, adding that Washington has not reached out to Moscow to organize a full-scale meeting.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump respondió a sus bajos números en las encuestas despidiendo a tres de los cinco esncuestadores de su campaña luego que se filtaron a la prensa las preocupantes cifras del apoyo electoral del magante en estados claves para su reelección en 2020.
La medida se produce después de que la semana pasada, varios medios de comunicación informaran sobre la existencia de una encuesta de 17 estados, que supuso muy malas noticias para la reelección de Trump.
El sondeo, realizado por Tony Fabrizio, encuestador líder de la campaña de Trump, entre el 13 de marzo y el 28 de marzo, encontró a Trump detrás del ex vicepresidente Joe Biden con dos dígitos en todos los estados que se consideran cruciales para su victoria en 2020.
Esa misma encuesta que se filtró a la prensa también mostró a Trump con un desempeño inferior en los estados republicanos confiables que no han sido competitivos durante décadas en las elecciones presidenciales.
La decisión de la campaña de despiddir a sus propios encuestadores , Michael Baselice, Adam Geller y Brett Lloyd, tiene el propósito de evitar nuevas fugas de datos de encuestas internas, informó el New York Times el domingo.
Trump ha negado airadamente la cobertura de los números en los últimos días, y dijo a ABC News en una entrevista transmitida el jueves: “Esas encuestas no existen. Acabo de reunirme con alguien que es un encuestador y estoy ganando en todas partes, así que simplemente No sé de qué estás hablando “.
Trump también tuiteó que sus números son “los mejores números que hemos tenido”, y afirmó que los números informados eran de “Encuestas falsas”.

America squandering its power through foreign policy abuses

Texto completo: Last week we watched an unusual spectacle. The foreign minister of Germany, one of the United States’ closest allies, went to Tehran and announced that a European payment system, designed as an alternative to the dollar-based one, would soon be ready. This visit was made in coordination with Britain and France, both of which helped create the new payment mechanism, called INSTEX.
INSTEX will probably fail or prove to be wholly inadequate in the short term. The dollar’s dominance in global transactions — which has been a huge benefit for America — will be hard to displace, but INSTEX is a warning sign, the canary in the coal mine. America’s closest allies are working hard to chip away at a crucial underpinning of U.S. global power.
Why? It’s simple: the Trump administration’s abuse of this power. The United States sits atop the world for now, but there are forces eroding that lofty status. Some of these are deep structural shifts, like the rise of China. But as The Economist points out, others are reactions to a pattern of hegemonic abuse.
Consider the trigger for this search for an alternative to the dollar. Britain, France and Germany are all signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. When the Trump administration unilaterally reneged on the pact last year — even though Iran had abided by it — the U.S. reimposed sanctions, using its dollar power to prevent other countries from doing business with Iran (since most international transactions use the dollar for convenience). Furious at this misuse of authority, the Europeans have set about trying to create a new payment system.
They are not the only ones. The Chinese, Russian and Indians have also been trying to create mechanisms that would allow them to escape the hegemony of the dollar. So far, these efforts have been largely ineffective. But if so many major trading nations, including key European ones, set out to subvert the dollar, they will eventually have some impact. Once upon a time, the British pound was the dominant international currency, but it was supplanted by the dollar. There is no iron law that says the dollar will be king forever.
Or look at the way the Trump administration has been wielding the threat of tariffs. In many cases, the administration has invoked a "national security" concerns. The law that allows the president to levy such tariffs was passed during the Cold War to enable the country to preserve critical industries that might be needed to sustain the geopolitical contest with the Soviet Union. Canadian aluminum and Japanese-made SUVs don’t fit the bill, even if Trump thinks otherwise. As Jennifer Hillman, the former general counsel to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, wrote recently in The New York Times: "If the United States can justify tariffs on cars as a threat to national security, then every country in the world can most likely justify restrictions on almost any product under a similar claim."
The United States has legitimate complaints about China’s trade practices. Beijing will often follow the letter of the law but find clever ways to undermine its spirit through loopholes and exceptions. But that is precisely what the Trump administration is itself doing. By misusing the national security exemption, it is weakening the very trade rules and international laws that it is asking China to follow. If I were a Chinese negotiator, I would simply explain that I would follow trade rules just as much as Donald Trump does.
Or consider Trump’s efforts to crush Chinese tech behemoth Huawei. So far, very few countries have followed America’s ban, but almost all are surely noting that if they remain reliant on crucial American technologies, Washington could suddenly cripple them on a whim. The result will be a greater desire for technological self-reliance and a shift away from American companies.
America still occupies a unique position in the world. But it is clear that we are moving into an era in which more players will have more power. Twenty years ago, China accounted for 3% of global GDP; today its share is 15% and rising. In such a period, it is all the more important that Washington act with restraint, use international institutions and try to establish consensus.
The administration is acting to achieve some short-term gains in limited transactions with other countries. But by abusing its power to do so, it is putting at risk the structure of the international system in which American power is so deeply embedded. It is a bad trade and one for which all Americans will pay the price in decades to come.

Texto completo: They are all fathers now. Once they were boys born three years apart. From 1990 to 1999 we watched them play sports from football, basketball, wrestling, baseball to track and field.
Their competitive spirit started young. One day I caught the two older ones with a "snake-bite" grip on the youngest one's arms. This was their attempt to "keep him in place." What was his response? He laughed. The tighter they squeezed, the more he laughed. I broke it up.
A few days later I called them together. Look, I told them "I want each of you to reach adulthood. By the time number three reaches 21, if you all survive, I will give you each $500. January 23, 2002 cost me $1,500, but they were alive.
What does a father teach his children? Love, kindness, respect, and patience are taught day-by-day. I was not good at that last one. Today, as fathers they are much better than I was there.
What does a father teach his sons? Most importantly, is to love their wives. Nobody is perfect at doing so. There are ups and downs from day to day, but if this world is to continue it is important for parental love to see it through.
Well, this column is dedicated to the bundle of love the three have put us through. From "go-for-broke" go-cart rides, to the disappointment of "White City" (too many 'Burma Shave' signs leading to – well, not much at all), to their marvelous weddings, to the birth of their children we are thankful for the love they have provided to us. Each has a spouse who completes the "circle of love" necessary for life to continue.
The backstory of Father's Day had its start with Sonora Dodd in Spokane, Washington in 1910. After her mother died in childbirth, her father raised six children on his own. She thought he deserved a day also. The day is also related to the 1907 Monograph, West Virginia mine disaster where over 500 fathers were killed in a mine blast.
In recent times however, it is getting more difficult to become a father. In a May 17th edition of the New York Times, writer Liam Stack stated, "The United States' birthrate fell for a fourth consecutive year in 2018, bringing the number of people born in the country to its lowest level in 32 years, according to provisional figures published on Wednesday by the federal government." There is less chance to become a father.
Much attention has been addressed in the press about negative aspects of life today. This includes fatherhood. Remember however, it is the uniqueness of events in life that makes them newsworthy. Fathers I have known have done a great job being a dad for their kids.
Life however, is not all ways a "bed of roses." Time is spent dealing with the mistakes we make in our actions as fathers. Despite wanting our best, errors on the field of life are plentiful. At the worst these errors cause pain, suffering and can lead to more of the same in the next generation. Where does love with its sacrifice and forgiveness fit in?
As to those last two, this Father's Day remember the clear message of sacrifice and forgiveness was set by One who so loved the world that through grace we are set free from the errors we make daily in the game of life. Now there is a Dad to set us free from every worry we have.

Medinah Temple to get another redevelopment

Texto completo: Sixteen years after completing a redevelopment of the historic Medinah Temple, Al Friedman is ready to do it again.
The Chicago developer confirmed he has bought the landmark at 600 N. Wabash Ave. from retail chain Macy's, which plans to move its Bloomingdale's home goods store out of the building next year.
The deal was completed Thursday, Friedman and Macy's confirmed. They did not disclose a price, which was believed to be about $25 million, according to sources.
The Moorish Revival structure, known for its distinctive onion domes, attracted interest from a range of retailers and real estate investors.
But the building wound up in the hands of the firm that knows it best: Friedman Properties, which already owns the land beneath the approximately 140,000-square-foot structure after helping save it from the wrecking ball in 2001.
"It's personal to me," Friedman said. "This is my life's work."
Friedman has yet to decide what will go in the space once Bloomingdale's moves out next year. But he said it's important that the new use, or uses, be complementary to the mix of shops, galleries, artist spaces, restaurants, bars and other retail that his firm has spent almost two decades curating on an entire block that includes the Medinah Temple.
Friedman Properties will begin marketing the space to potential tenants in the next month or so, he said.
"It will be whatever is best for the rest of the block," Friedman said. "There is nothing else like this in the city. It's so unique that I think it will sell itself."
Macy's was represented in the sale by broker Luke Molloy of CBRE.
Friedman's deal comes more than eight months after the Tribune reported that Cincinnati-based Macy's was putting the building on the market. At the time, Macy's confirmed plans to move its Bloomingdale's home furnishings store out of the flagship space.
Those Bloomingdale's products will move to the nearby 900 North Michigan Shops, where Bloomingdale's already has a department store and will expand.
The home furnishings store will remain in the Medinah Temple space until the Michigan Avenue expansion is completed in mid-2020, Macy's spokeswoman Andrea Schwartz said.
Friedman is often referred to as the "mayor of River North," because he's spent decades amassing a huge portfolio of properties north of the Chicago River. During that time, the once-seedy area has emerged as a top destination for restaurants, bars, shops and residential, hotel and office towers.
The firm's original restoration of the Medinah Temple was part of a city-backed plan to preserve the entire block bounded by Wabash and Ohio, Ontario and State streets. The block also includes the landmark Tree Studios property, a longtime enclave for artists.
The Medinah Temple, designed by architecture firm Huehl and Schmid, was completed in 1912. A 30,000-pound pipe organ was installed in 1915.
Built by the Shriners, the structure was designated a Chicago landmark in 2001. By that time, it was vacant and dilapidated.
Friedman Properties received more than $12 million in tax increment financing from the city to support a more than $60 million redevelopment of the entire block.
As part of the 2001 redevelopment agreement with the city, Bloomingdale's signed a 25-year ground lease with Friedman, which includes six 10-year options, according a city document. The agreement created a TIF district that expires in June 2023.
Now that Friedman controls the land and the building, the ground lease will be nullified.
Bloomingdale's four-level space was created within a soaring former 4,200-seat auditorium that once held events such as the Shrine Circus. Before Bloomingdale's opened its store, Friedman made extensive renovations to stained glass windows and constructed a pair of five-ton, copper onion domes to replace the damaged originals. The domes were constructed in the adjacent Tree Studios courtyard.
When the sprawling store opened 16 years ago on Wabash, it was Bloomingdale's first standalone home furnishing store. Previously, the concept had only been tried in malls.
"It's a risky venture, yes, very risky," Bloomingdale's then-CEO Michael Gould told The New York Times ahead of the store's 2003 opening.
The deal also was significant for Chicago preservationists, as Bloomingdale's lease helped spare the unique structure from demolition.
Macy's officials in March filed paperwork with the city seeking a zoning amendment to expand allowable uses in the space, such as a fitness center. In April, the Chicago Plan Commission voted in favor of allowing uses including sports and recreation, food and beverages sales and offices.
The full City Council has yet to put its final stamp of approval on the zoning revision, which does not allow for substantial changes to the structure or any new construction.
Friedman said he does not have specific plans in mind yet, and wants to hear from a range of potential tenants. The space could be leased to one tenant or a few.
"I'm going to be completely open-minded," Friedman said. "We're going to listen to ideas."
Before the the Medinah Temple sale, Macy's has been cashing in on its real estate portfolio in Chicago and other cities.
Last year, Macy's sold the top half of its State Street flagship building for $30 million. The buyer, Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management, is converting floors 8 through 14 into office space and creating a large rooftop deck.

Texto completo: Pope Francis issued a decree this week "declaring the heroic virtues" of Augustine Tolton, an African American priest who was born in 1854. As a child, Tolton escaped slavery in Missouri with his family, fleeing to Illinois. Tolton became the first publicly known, black, Roman Catholic priest in the United States. Should he be found deserving of the designation, he would be the church's first African American saint.
Because the Catholic Church would not train a black man to be a priest at the time, Tolton was ordained in Rome and gave his first public Mass at age 31 at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Returning to the United States shortly thereafter, he served in the Chicago area until his death in 1897 at age 43.
Of Pope Francis' decree, the Diocese of Springfield in Illinois issued a statement this week that stated, in part, "Today’s news is not only exciting for Catholics across the Diocese of Springfield in Illinois, but also for the entire Christian world. Father Tolton’s story, from slave to priest, is an incredible journey that shows how God has a plan for all of us. Father Tolton overcame the odds of slavery, prejudice, and racism, to become a humble priest and someone we should model our lives after. He carried his crosses in life quietly and heroically."20191206_Augustus_Tolton.jpgOf Tolton's work as a priest, Bishop Joseph Perry of the Archdiocese of Chicago said, "Father Tolton leaves us a shining example of what Christian action is all about, what patient suffering is all about in face of life’s incongruities. He was a bright light in a difficult period of this nation’s history. His life and ministry still speak to the problems of our day where communities, neighborhoods, and churches continue to evidence separations among race and class and the disturbances that erupt periodically from these social contradictions."
While Tolton has met most of the criteria to be considered for sainthood, in order to be canonized as such in the Catholic Church, it is required that two miracles be attributed to the candidate. Miracles must be verified by the church. Officials of the church are investigating "at least one potential miracle" that could be attributed to Tolton, according to the New York Times.

Pope Francis has positioned for sainthood a former slave and the first known black priest in America. The pontiff on Wednesday, June 12, 2019, declared the Rev. Augustine Tolton of Quincy "venerable." The Diocese of Springfield announced that the designation means that Tolton lived a life of "heroic virtue." Church officials are investigating possible miracles attributed to Tolton which could lead to his canonization.

Finding Trump scandals is easy if you imagine them all

Texto completo: There haven’t been any major scandals so far during Donald Trump’s presidency, so his political opponents, including most of the national press, are pointing to things that didn’t happen as reasons for the electorate to rise up in revolt.
It was all the outrage this week that Trump said in an interview on ABC that he would be willing to take “information on an opponent” if it came from a foreign agent. He allowed that if he thought the “information” (we don’t know what kind because this is all a stupid hypothetical) merited a referral to the FBI, he would do so.
But you’re supposed to be upset merely at the possibility that Trump would consider evaluating “information” that could potentially make a difference in the 2020 campaign because this is precisely what didn’t happen in 2016.
Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., and his son in law, Jared Kushner, in 2016 agreed to meet with a Russian who purported to have “documents” that would “incriminate” Hillary Clinton. Maybe those incriminating documents were transcripts of TV interviews or speeches. We have no idea what it could have been or if it ever existed because by all accounts, no material was ever exchanged and the meeting was a bust.
Democrats and the media are very clever in conflating this meeting, that turned up nothing, with the U.S. intelligence conclusion that Russia attempted to interfere in the election by allegedly stealing and publishing emails from the DNC and Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. But it needs to be repeated over and over again that no one, not Trump, Donald Jr., or Kushner, knew what they might be getting by taking the meeting. It’s also worth repeating over and over again that what they got at the meeting was nothing.
It would be questionable if Trump during the 2020 campaign did receive and use some valuable information that was obtained illegally. Say, for example, if Trump published the private tax information of the Democratic nominee.
Wait a minute, that’s precisely what the New York Times did just one month ago!
The paper on May 8 said that it had received “information” (there’s that word again!) on several years’ worth of Trump’s tax history “from someone who had legal access to it.” (I love that the Times was sure to note that its source “had legal access” to the information while neglecting to disclose that, unless the source was Trump himself, it was nonetheless illegal to hand it to a newspaper reporter for print.)
How rich, then, that the media would claim moral authority on something that Trump didn’t do. It’s like every other supposedly major controversy. Liberal New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg on Thursday microwaved one of the #Resistance's favorite frozen meals: Trump’s joke in summer 2016 about Russia obtaining Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails (which the public, under freedom of information regulations, would have been entitled to see, had Clinton not deleted them).
This is, again, something that never happened. Those emails have never been seen. But where there is no scandal, you simply have to believe there could have been one.
Now-former Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no conspiracy between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia, and the Justice Department determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge Trump on obstructing justice. Yet New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait on Monday referred to special counsel’s “devastating findings of the Trump campaign efforts to collude with Russia, and Trump’s obstruction of justice thereof.”
These are, again, things that didn’t happen. But that they could have happened (even if they weren't a crime) is supposed to be enough.
House Democrats right now are largely hanging their impeachment hopes on Trump’s half-hearted actions to have Mueller fired, which he had the executive authority to do and which he could have done himself if he were truly committed. Yet it's one more thing that never happened. Mueller remained in his role for two years and completed his investigation.
It’s all like that scene in Steven Spielberg’s “Hook” (1991) where Robin Williams as Peter Pan sits down for dinner, exhausted and famished, only to find that the pots and pans contain nothing but steam. “I want some real food,” he says. Tinkerbell tells him to use his imagination because it was once his "favorite game."
True, if we all use our imaginations, we can envision a world in which Mueller was fired, that Russia found Clinton’s deleted emails and that Trump obtained election-altering information from a foreign agent, even if none of it happened in the real one. Are you ready to revolt now?

Visual shortcuts, the ‘angry mob’ and editorial cartoons

Texto completo: A picture, we all know, is worth a thousand words. But which thousand is often up to the individual viewer.
This can be especially true when it comes to editorial cartoons. As a form of expression, a single cartoon panel can have a unique power to make a viewer laugh in agreement or growl with displeasure. Interestingly, the reaction is immediate — a chuckle, a guffaw, a pounding of the fist on the table — but the effect, at least in the best of cases, is long-lasting, as the viewer naturally is induced to reflect on the meaning and intent of a particular issue’s visual portrayal.
Unfortunately, though, nuance is not usually the editorial cartoonist’s stock in trade, so in many, if not most, cases, an individual cartoon must be examined very narrowly, and in some cases, a lack of depth can leave a cartoon open to vastly different interpretations.
All this makes selecting editorial cartoons for publication an imprecise art, no pun intended, for newspapers like the Daily Herald that value presentation of diverse points of view on their Opinion pages. And it can lead to considerable controversy when readers are stung by an artist’s portrayal that they find offensive, wildly exaggerated or simply wrong.
We at the Daily Herald address this challenge by striving to present a wide range of points of view in the editorial cartoons we publish from day to day. The New York Times has decided to deal with it by ending publication of editorial cartoons altogether in its international editions.
The Times’ decision followed an outcry over an April cartoon that lampooned President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Many critics found the image overtly anti-Semitic. The Times later agreed and apologized.
The artist, it’s worth noting, insisted that he did not mean to promote anti-Semitism but just wanted to make a statement about what he saw as President Trump’s blind loyalty to the Israeli leader. He is finding — as legions of Twitter and social media commentators also learn from time to time — that the inherent power of an arresting image or clever phrase can be abused by clumsy presentation.
The Times has never been particularly fond of editorial cartoons and had already ceased publication of them in its domestic editions. In a blog reacting to his newspaper’s decision to cease publishing traditional editorial cartoons in all its editions, Times cartoonist Patrick Chappatte, who did not draw the offending panel, described cartoons as "visual shortcut(s) with an unmatched capacity to touch the mind" and said that quality is both "their strength, and their vulnerability." He lamented that we live in an age when "moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm" to intimidate publishers and commentators.
In short, combine a moralistic mob and a visual shortcut and you have a formula for trouble. Chappatte thinks the solution is "to stop being afraid of the angry mob," and I’m willing to side with him to a point. But I’ve also found that the degree of people’s objection to the "angry mob" often depends on which angry mob they’re a part of. So, I place my hope and faith in the willingness — even as grudging as it sometimes is — for citizens of a country that values free speech and a free press to, within certain broad boundaries, tolerate views and images they abhor as long as their own views can get a fair hearing.
Or, in the case of editorial cartoons, a fair viewing.
For our part at the Daily Herald, we’re constantly evaluating how we use editorial cartoons and how we select the ones we publish. Like Chappatte, we still think they have a unique capacity to compact a complex idea into an instantaneous picture, as long as we respect the sentiments and diversity of the readers transforming each image into those thousand words.

How did Bennett College Keep its accreditation despite financial and legal woes?

Texto completo: (TriceEdneyWire.com) - The music director at the Alfred Street Baptist Church was a good person to be in a good place at a very important time. And she did something especially beneficial for her alma mater, Bennett College.
When Joyce Garrett heard that Bennett could lose its accreditation if it didn't quickly raise $5 million, she turned to her pastor. Alfred Street Baptist, a two-centuries-old institution in Alexandria, Va., has a host of HBCU alumni in its congregation, and a soft spot for those schools in its heart - and in its budget, too.
The church gave $50,000 to the tiny, all-women's college in Greensboro. N.C. - one of the largest community contributions to a two-month fund drive that brought in nearly twice the amount targeted.
Bennett's vice president for institutional advancement offered a hearty amen to the church's generosity, and particularly some of those behind it. "Our alums weren't deep in pockets, but were strong in influence," Danny Gatling said on a recent visit to the nation's capital.
In a matter of just two months, Bennett raised nearly $10 million to prove its financial stability and save its accreditation, only to lose it anyway for reasons it is disputing in federal court in Atlanta. The court has temporarily reinstated the accreditation pending the outcome of the lawsuit.
Half the money that the "Stand with Bennett" campaign took in came through efforts like those at Alfred Street Baptist - individual donations from alumnae like Garrett, their families, and friends. The average gift from thousands of donors was $50-$75, Gatling said.
But there were big givers, too.
The Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority gave $100,000; the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, $31,000; and the brothers of Omega Psi Phi, $20,000. Singer Kwanza Jones, whose mother and an aunt are Bennett graduates, donated $1 million. So did High Point University, which like Bennett has historical ties to the United Methodist Church.
Papa John's Pizza contributed $500,000, as did a North Carolina foundation linked to the R.J. Reynolds tobacco family.
Jones, a Princeton University alumna, explained her family-affair contribution this way:
"I am a very proud African American woman who wears my crown. I am a queen that was raised by queens. I am a queen who knows other queens lift other queens. They raise kings. They raise the world. They elevate everything," she said as she announced the gift from her and her husband. "So that is the foundation of why my mother said, You know, you all should give to Bennett'."
Bennett's success in what school officials characterized as a do-or-die effort drew attention to a dilemma it shares with many other HBCUs - especially private ones - as well as with other small, private liberal arts schools around the nation, Brian K. Bridges, vice president of research and member engagement for UNCF, said in an interview.
Gatling agreed. "Bennett's issue is not unique, it's [just] getting so much attention compared to other schools," he said. "I think [in] this, day when we're focused so much on the #metoo movement, women's rights, and women's color, losing one of the only two institutions that were created for women of color raised this visibility..."
The core of a recurrent financial problem for Bennett is that the college is more dependent than most on tuition, fees and even personal gifts from families on shaky financial ground, who struggle to pay even relatively modest money to send their children to a better school, which itself lacks the endowment dollars to more easily make its own ends meet.
Gladys A. Robinson, the chair of the board of trustees of her alma mater and a North Carolina state senator, said the Great Recession seriously diminished the fragile wealth of Bennett families and their communities.
"We are disappointed that [the accrediting panel] does not seem to understand the issue of HBCUs," Robinson said in the midst of the campaign, "and especially an African American woman's HBCU that continues to survive and strive and improve, regardless of economic situations."
More than half of Bennett's annual operating revenues of about $15 million come from tuition and fees, and gifts and grants.
Yet, the school needs to keep its costs affordably low. For instance, Bridges of UNCF said, Bennett cannot charge more than Harvard for tuition.
Tuition and fees at Bennett are about $18,000 a year, while the cost is $50,000 at Harvard, which 20 years ago effectively merged with Radcliffe College, its former women-only counterpart.
Radcliffe was one of the elite Seven Sisters women's colleges. So, too, were Smith College and Bryn Mawr, which remain all female. Smith charges $52,000 a year, and Bryn Mawr, $44,000.
Bridges said a school like Bennett also must compete for students with other HBCUs that receive public funds, and with predominantly white schools offering more educational opportunities to black students than were possible years ago.
North Carolina A&T State University, an HBCU a stone's throw from the Bennett campus in Greensboro, is $20,000 for non-state residents, and less than $7,000 for North Carolinians; down the road from Greensboro at Winston Salem State University, another HBCU the costs are about the same as at A&T.
At the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG), a predominantly White school near Bennett, tuition, and fees are $22,000 for out-of-state students and $7,000 for Carolinians. UNCG has more than five times as many black students as Bennett has students overall.
UNCF's Bridges said Bennett has one of the smallest endowments of any HBCU, and many of its alumnae are more likely to live in the South, where earnings are lower. The small endowment is what limits the college's ability to provide financial assistance, he said and makes its students and their families - as well as Bennett's ongoing operations - more vulnerable to ups and downs in the national economy.
Some 97 percent of the college's students need financial help, according to Bennett's Gatling. What they cannot get from the school, they mostly must borrow.
Ninety percent of Black college students nationwide take out loans to pay for college, compared to 70 percent of their White counterparts, the National Center for Educational Statistics reported.
The bad years for the nation's economy were especially bad for Bennett. Its enrollment was 780 in 2010. In 2017, it was 493, a drop of 37 percent.
There were six years of annual losses in its operating budget, including in 2014, when Bennett came up $2 million short on a budget of about $19 million. Some employees were laid off, and some academic programs were cut.
In December of 2016, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges placed Bennett on probation. Two years later - last December - it revoked the school's accreditation.
Things may be looking up for Bennett on at least two fronts.
The Women's College Coalition said that first-year enrollment among its 38 members rose from 9,000 in 2014 to 13,000 in 2017, The New York Times reported earlier this year.
There also may be a new interest in both HBCUs and women's colleges as 'safe space' oases in hostile climates, the newspaper said, and some see women's schools as better environments in which women can develop their potential.
Bennett says it has received twice as many applicants for the upcoming school year as normal. It had projected a $700,000 budget surplus for the current year, on top of a $461,038 surplus the year before.
Despite the success and spotlight of the "Stand with Bennett" campaign, the college does not consider itself out of the financial woods. "To transform the institution, we probably need about $50- to $60 million," Gatling said.
"While we don't like how we got the visibility, it has really caused people to start to look at the small schools and their existence," he said. "We want to take the lessons we learned and help other HBCUs. We're wanting to work with other institutions big or small, to approach some different ways of fundraising."

Texto completo: Chicagoans like their hot dogs and beef sandwiches. Even when they've relocated to the Sunshine State.
Often they'll cast about, driving past local seafood restaurants and crab shacks until they find the foods of their homeland. That's what happened to husband and wife team Andrew and Jennifer Goode, who took over Chicago Beef and Dogs in Cape Coral in September 2018.
"We had a family vacation home here in Cape Coral since 2014," Jennifer said.
"We used to come here to vacation, and then we ended up purchasing our own vacation home. Andrew was doing some renovations on the house and walked into this restaurant one day and the guy said it was for sale. So we bought it, and our vacation home became our permanent residence."
The pair were no strangers to the food business.
Jennifer's parents owned a deli when she was younger, and Andrew grew up in the Chicago area working in places much like the one they now own.
"My husband always wanted to have a hot dog and beef sandwich type place," Jennifer said.
Andrew began his career in law enforcement, working with a canine unit in Chicago in the 1980s. After a while he took a job in the private sector managing convenience stores, and the couple left Chicago for Arizona. But they never forgot their love of a good Chicago dog.
According to Jennifer, the Goodes' time in Arizona helped prepare them for having their own place.
"What Andrew was doing in the corporate world, he had a strip mall in Arizona that he built from the ground up," she explained. "There were different restaurants — a Mexican restaurant, a Subway, a coffee shop."
So, when Andrew walked into Chicago Beef and Dogs last fall and heard the spot was for sale, the couple was primed to take over.
And now they're having a great time.
"It's fun," Jennifer said. "We got into this to have fun with it. We have four children, and a couple of them are employees here. We bought this restaurant with the idea of teaching our kids how to run a business and giving back to the community. We do a lot of sponsoring the youth sports teams here in Cape Coral and of course getting jobs out there for people."
Though the restaurant has stayed true to its Chicago-style origins, the couple have made a few updates.
"We've definitely improved on the food, prices and quality," Jennifer said.
"What we serve is Chicago-style food — Chicago dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, Chicago-style pizza and other things Chicago is known for, like pizza puffs."
They even offer Green River soda, a specialty soda that originated in Chicago and is known for its sweet-tangy lime flavor and bright green color.
"There are a lot of Chicagoans who seek out food like this when they're away from their hometown," Jennifer said.
"There's also people that don't know what it is and discover that they like it."

2008 Universal Studios fire destroyed up to 500,000 original master recordings, according to magazine report

Texto completo: SANTA MONICA — The Universal Music Group is pushing back on a New York Times Magazine report that, contrary to official statements made more than a decade ago, a 2008 fire at Universal Studios Hollywood destroyed a staggering number of original master recordings stored there.
The devastation, which company executives downplayed or dismissed outright after the fire was extinguished 11 years ago this month, is breathtaking in scope, amounting to what the new report describes as “the biggest disaster in the history of the music industry.”
“This is a tragedy,” Elliot Roberts, longtime manager to Neil Young, told the Los Angeles Times. Young did not lose any master recordings in the fire. “You can yell, you can jump up and down, you can look to insurance, you can sue,” said Roberts, “but if you lose a master, you’re [sunk].”
UMG disputed the New York Times report, citing “numerous inaccuracies, misleading statements, contradictions and fundamental misunderstandings of the scope of the incident and affected assets.”
“Music preservation is of the highest priority for us and we are proud of our track record,” said the statement issued Tuesday. “While there are constraints preventing us from publicly addressing some of the details of the fire that occurred at NBCUniversal Studios facility more than a decade ago, the incident, while deeply unfortunate, never affected the availability of the commercially released music nor impacted artists’ compensation.”
“In a sense, nothing was lost,” a UMG spokesman told the Los Angeles Times shortly after the June 1, 2008, blaze had been extinguished by fire crews. Most reports centered on contents of the facility’s movie and video archive.
The loss to the audio contents, in fact, was incalculable, “yet the news has never reached the broader public,” reporter Jody Rosen writes in The New York Times Magazine. “In part, this represents a triumph of crisis management.”
Rosen cites internal emails in which a UMG spokesman informed his superiors, “We stuck to the script about physical backups and digital copies.”

Trump tariff threat remains in place

Texto completo: President Donald Trump and his acting Homeland Security secretary on Sunday defended their new agreement with the Mexican government to curb migration at the southern border, striking back at Democratic critics -- including accusations that at least some parts of the deal predated Trump's recent tariff threats.
In a series of tweets, Trump said Mexico "was not being cooperative on the Border" before the deal reached Friday. Now, he said, "I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done."
He also said he could move to reimpose tariffs if Mexico doesn't follow through on its promises. Some aspects of the deal, he added, remain to be announced -- "one in particular," he said, "will be announced at the appropriate time."
Meanwhile, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan credited Trump's tariff threats -- which would have placed a 5% levy on Mexican goods starting Monday, ratcheting up over several months to as much as 25% -- with producing a breakthrough.
"The president put a charge in this whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threat, brought them to the table," McAleenan said in a "Fox News Sunday" interview, noting that Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard "arrived within hours" to begin talks.
Mexico announced it would implement "strong measures" to slow the flow of migrants across its territory toward the southern U.S. border, including the deployment of thousands of Mexican national guard troops. It also agreed to expand a program allowing Central American migrants to wait in Mexico while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims.
On Sunday, two Democratic presidential candidates said Trump had exaggerated what his tariff threats against Mexico had accomplished. They echoed a New York Times report alleging that the Mexican government had already agreed to several terms of the deal before Trump publicly floated the prospect of tariffs.
"These are agreements that Mexico had already made, in some cases months ago," former congressman Beto O'Rourke said in an interview on ABC's "This Week." "They might have accelerated the timetable, but by and large the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has."
During an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also said Trump had repackaged earlier agreements with Mexico to declare success in the trade standoff.
"I think what the world is tired of, and what I am tired of, is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war, with our allies," Sanders said, adding that Trump should focus on achieving comprehensive immigration reform.
Trump, in his tweets, lashed out at The New York Times for suggesting the deal was not entirely new and also pointed out that tariffs could be back on the table if the Mexican government does not honor its end of the deal.
"There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn't exist for decades," he said. "However, if for some unknown reason ... there is not, we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs."
McAleenan echoed that sentiment, saying the dangling threat of tariffs amounted to "a mechanism to make sure that they do what they promise to do, that there's an actual result that we see a vast reduction in those (migrant) numbers."
Republican lawmakers appeared relieved in talk-show appearances Sunday.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, had voiced anxiety about the tariffs before the deal was reached. On Sunday, he had nothing but praise for Trump.
"Republicans understand that tariffs are attacks on American consumers, and we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does, either," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations, and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly."
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., speaking on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," defended Trump.
"Republicans need to provide the president with a lot of leeway," Tillis said, adding that if lawmakers give Trump some "unorthodox" options for negotiating trade agreements, "then America wins."
Top congressional Democrats on Saturday delivered dual attacks on the deal, saying that the agreement amounted to less than meets the eye while also arguing that the tariff threat that prompted it was reckless.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the deal was "likely to be one of the president's typical, bogus solutions" to justify retreat from the tariffs, which had prompted a fierce backlash from business interests and many Republicans.

Five ways to save money while traveling

Texto completo: I love to travel. I love trying out a new hotel, sleeping in a California king-sized bed and not having to worry about making my bed in the mornings.
The one thing that's always true about traveling is that it costs money. And I'm all about saving money. So, here are my best travel tips to help you keep more of your hard-earned dollars in your pocket:
• If you're flying, travel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.
These are cheapest days to be in the air. If you can arrange your trip and vacation days to accommodate, you'll save money!
• Avoid baggage fees.
Don't forget that many airlines will charge you to check a bag, which could cost an extra $50 to $100 round-trip per person. So, factor this in when you're shopping for low fares, or just pack more efficiently into a carry-on.
• Don't open a credit card just for the travel points.
Even if you think you're "working the system" and you'll pay if off before it's due, the facts say there's a real chance you won't. One in three Americans are behind on bills. Payments have a tendency to pile up, and they steal more than your paycheck. They steal your joy, too.
• Look into Airbnb.
With Airbnb, you can rent someone's whole house, or even just one room in their house, and many times it's a lot cheaper than staying in a hotel. If you're a real go-getter, try reaching out to the owner directly and make them an offer. The worst they can do is say no!
• Don't take a vacation if you have debt.
I know there's always one reason or another to spend money going somewhere. But if you're in debt, now isn't the time to take elaborate vacations. All your extra money should be going toward building up a starter emergency fund or paying off debt. Trust me, you'll enjoy that beach trip so much more when you have money in the bank, and you paid for it with cash.
For more tips on how to save money traveling, I've got two episodes of The Rachel Cruze Show that will help you: Travel Tips That Will Save You Money and How to Go to Disney World Without Debt.
As a #1 New York Times best-selling author, host of The Rachel Cruze Show and The Rachel Cruze Show Podcast, Rachel helps people learn the proper ways to handle money and stay out of debt. She's authored three best-selling books, including Love Your Life, Not Theirs and Smart Money Smart Kids, which she co-wrote with her father, Dave Ramsey.

Texto completo: Considering the political energy that has flowed through the party since the elections in November of progressive Democrats to Congress, most of them women, one would expect the Democratic Party to embrace the trend.
Apparently not so.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which takes responsibility for recruiting and supporting Democrats for Congress, has issued a sharp and, supposedly unyielding, edict: It will not do business with political consultants who work for candidates who run against Democratic incumbents.
This is the true face of politics, usually concealed behind a gauzy lens, exposed.
Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., both defeated entrenched incumbents, Joseph Crowley and Michael Capuano, respectively. The defeated incumbents were white men. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is Puerto Rican while Ms. Pressley is African American.
The DCCC is ostensibly out to protect sitting Democrats from having to worry about primaries so they can instead focus their energy and money on fighting off Republicans, The New York Times reported on the new DCCC policy.
Some feel it will block an important avenue for female candidates and other newcomers.
The House Democrats, in particular, owe the energy of the current Democratic Party in large part to the new and mostly younger women who have brought fresh ideas and frank - if sometimes raw and misinformed - viewpoints to the fore.
The DCCC is one of the big organizations that make up the campaign machinery of the Democratic Party. Ambitious political consultants will think twice before getting themselves on a blacklist.
This is how politics is really run, away from the staged protests and TV talking heads.
However, in a twist that shows the party's sharp leftward turn, conservative Democratic incumbents may not enjoy the DCCC's full protection. Groups that support abortion, such as NARAL and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, are supporting Marie Newman against Chicago-area U.S. Rep. Daniel Lipinski, a Democrat who opposes abortion rights. Pro-gressive organizations will ignore the DCCC's attempts to restrict upward political mobility.
The DCCC's policy is a bridge too far. It can be expected that it will support incumbents beause the incumbents literally are the DCCC. However, those incumbents should have more respect for the right of the citizens to choose their representatives.
The DCCC's policy is at odds with populist movements within its own party. The DCCC should not attempt to control the entire congressional political waterfront.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and his acting Homeland Security secretary on Sunday defended their new agreement with the Mexican government to curb migration at the southern border, striking back at Democratic critics - including accusations that at least some parts of the deal predated Trump's recent tariff threats.
In a series of tweets, Trump said Mexico "was not being cooperative on the Border" before the deal reached Friday. Now, he said, "I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done."
He also said he could move to reimpose tariffs if Mexico doesn't follow through on its promises. Some aspects of the deal, he added, remain to be announced - "one in particular," he said, "will be announced at the appropriate time."
Meanwhile, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan credited Trump's tariff threats - which would have placed a 5% levy on Mexican goods starting Monday, ratcheting up over several months to as much as 25% - with producing a breakthrough.
"The president put a charge in this whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threat, brought them to the table," McAleenan said in a "Fox News Sunday" interview, noting that Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard "arrived within hours" to begin talks.
Mexico announced it would implement "strong measures" to slow the flow of migrants across its territory toward the southern U.S. border, including the deployment of thousands of Mexican national guard troops. It also agreed to expand a program allowing Central American migrants to wait in Mexico while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims.
On Sunday, two Democratic presidential candidates said Trump had exaggerated what his tariff threats against Mexico had accomplished. They echoed a New York Times report alleging that the Mexican government had already agreed to several terms of the deal before Trump publicly floated the prospect of tariffs.
"These are agreements that Mexico had already made, in some cases months ago," former congressman Beto O'Rourke said in an interview on ABC's "This Week." "They might have accelerated the timetable, but by and large the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has."
During an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also said Trump had repackaged earlier agreements with Mexico to declare success in the trade standoff.
"I think what the world is tired of, and what I am tired of, is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war, with our allies," Sanders said, adding that Trump should focus on achieving comprehensive immigration reform.
Trump, in his tweets, lashed out at The New York Times for suggesting the deal was not entirely new and also pointed out that tariffs could be back on the table if the Mexican government does not honor its end of the deal.
"There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn't exist for decades," he said. "However, if for some unknown reason ... there is not, we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs."
McAleenan echoed that sentiment, saying the dangling threat of tariffs amounted to "a mechanism to make sure that they do what they promise to do, that there's an actual result that we see a vast reduction in those (migrant) numbers."
Republican lawmakers appeared relieved in talk-show appearances Sunday.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, had voiced anxiety about the tariffs before the deal was reached. On Sunday, he had nothing but praise for Trump.
"Republicans understand that tariffs are attacks on American consumers, and we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does, either," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations, and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly."
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., speaking on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," defended Trump.
"Republicans need to provide the president with a lot of leeway," Tillis said, adding that if lawmakers give Trump some "unorthodox" options for negotiating trade agreements, "then America wins."
Top congressional Democrats on Saturday delivered dual attacks on the deal, saying that the agreement amounted to less than meets the eye while also arguing that the tariff threat that prompted it was reckless.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the deal was "likely to be one of the president's typical, bogus solutions" to justify retreat from the tariffs, which had prompted a fierce backlash from business interests and many Republicans.

Russian, U.S. warships narrowly avoid collision

Texto completo: MOSCOW - After years of increasing assertiveness by Russia's military in waters and airspace around its borders, a Russian destroyer nearly collided Friday with a U.S. warship in the Philippine Sea.
Each side blamed the other for the episode, which took place in Asian waters that have previously been the site of an intense naval rivalry between the United States and China, but from which Russia, though a Pacific power, had been largely absent.
NATO has repeatedly accused Russia's warplanes and warships of staging dangerous, threatening maneuvers in the Baltic and Black seas, but the episode Friday was the first potentially catastrophic near miss involving Russian and U.S. naval vessels so far from Russian shores since the end of the Cold War.
The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet, which patrols the Pacific, said the Russian destroyer's crew had navigated unsafely and forced the U.S. warship into an avoidance maneuver. The Americans released video clips to corroborate their version of events.
Russian state-controlled media suggested that the near collision, the second close encounter involving U.S. and Russia forces in a week, had been staged by the Pentagon to coincide with a visit to Russia by President Xi Jinping of China, who has overseen a steady increase in economic and military ties between Beijing and Moscow.
China and Russia are not officially military allies, but they have staged joint military exercises and increasingly look to each other for leverage against Washington, with which both have severely strained relations.
Maj. Gen. Vladimir Bogatyrev, chairman of the National Association of Reserve Officers, told Russian state media that "it is not by chance that these actions happened during the visit to Russia by the head of the People's Republic of China."
The United States, he added, had deliberately provoked the incident in the Philippine Sea in an effort to "demonstrate to us the supposed strength of the American fleet and lawless behavior in the wide expanse of global seas."
But he also hinted that Russia was not merely an innocent bystander.
"The protest of our sailors was completely justified," he said, without specifying what "protest" he was referring to.
The U.S. Navy said the near collision took place around 11:45 a.m. local time as a result of an "unsafe and unprofessional" move by a Russian destroyer, the Admiral Vinogradov, which came within 50 to 100 feet of the USS Chancellorsville, according to a statement. The cruiser had to quickly maneuver to avoid a collision, the Navy said.
Cmdr. Clayton Doss, a spokesman for the 7th Fleet, said in the statement that the Russian destroyer had made an "unsafe maneuver" against the USS Chancellorsville, a guided missile cruiser, "putting the safety of her crew and ship at risk."
Russia gave an entirely different version of events, with the Pacific Fleet press service telling the state-run news agency Tass that the U.S. vessel had hindered the passage of the Admiral Vinogradov, forcing it to perform a dangerous maneuver to avoid a collision.
"The U.S. cruiser Chancellorsville suddenly changed its course and crossed the Admiral Vinogradov destroyer's course some 50 meters away from the ship," the press service said, according to Tass. "In order to prevent a collision, the Admiral Vinogradov's crew was forced to conduct an emergency maneuver."

Texto completo: I had a debate today with a Trumpist who had down the tricky knack of retreat -- into conspiracy, innuendo and the nonfactual, that itself is the "political" meaning of their program.
Historian Barbara Tuchman had pointed out that political decisions leading to World War I were made by men who were not soldiers, merely self-believers -- the war would end in months -- whose prophesy was shared by and mutually benefited "bankers and industrialists" sustaining a European economy. I mentioned another analysis that Trump is offensively or unknowingly disrupting "Western" political economics, at least.
He said, "Well, you know, a lot of news is made up," so I had to debate that point instead of the more socially important question of international economics.
I cited the New York Times and the Washington Post as ethical. He said, "They're controlled by the CIA."
I was hereupon reminded of Tuchman's noting the historical oddity of Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany being on opposite sides. Strongmen Wilhelm and Nicholas had a royal connection, but could not unite. Recently, Donald Trump made an instant ally of strongman-by-military coup of Egypt, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, by embracing him in the White House.
To this he responded, "I'm a nationalist."
I rather shot back, "Nationalist is a code word for racist!"
"Look it up! Look all around you!"
I was dazed but pointed to the debacle on the border with Mexico, now more and more like a war, probably too to be hung around the neck of a U.S. president. I accused Trump of being inhumanly anti-Hispanic and a strangely tacit ally of white nationalists, who consider immigrants literally to be invaders.
He dodged and eternally backpedaled into an area where the only rule of argument is to avoid the issue. I determined unilaterally that dialog had become impossible and the conversation was over.

Texto completo: El acuerdo para evitar los aranceles que el presidente Donald Trump anunció consiste, principalmente, en acciones que el Gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador ya había prometido tomar en conversaciones anteriores con los Estados Unidos durante los últimos meses.
Así lo afirmaron funcionarios de ambos países familiarizados con el negociaciones, reveló The New York Times.
La declaración conjunta del acuerdo del viernes dice que México aceptó el “despliegue de su Guardia Nacional en todo México, dando prioridad a su frontera sur”.
Sin embargo, el Gobierno mexicano ya se había comprometido a hacerlo en marzo durante conversaciones secretas en Miami entre la entonces secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen , y la secretaria de Gobernación, Olga Sánchez .
El Times afirma que la expansión del programa para que solicitantes de asilo permanezcan en México mientras continúan sus casos en Estados Unido era un acuerdo desde diciembre.
El análisis y reporte con fuentes anónimas del diario neoyorquino no deja claro si los acuerdos suponen una ampliación de aquellas negociaciones, pero el presidente Trump calificó las afirmaciones de “falsas”.
La Administración mexicana defendió como un éxito el acuerdo entre ambas naciones para evitar los aranceles a México hasta del 25 por ciento.
Organizaciones en defensa de los inmigrantes critican el acuerdo, acusando que es en detrimento de quienes buscan una vida mejor en los Estados Unidos.
Hay una parte de las negociaciones que el mandatario republicano afirma que no se ha revelado y se dará a conocer en “su debido momento” .

Texto completo: Trump pulls back Mexico tariff threat made over migrants
President Donald Trump on Friday night yanked back his threat to slap escalating tariffs on all Mexican imports if the country didn't address migrants at the southern border. The move seemed to avert a new trade war while ensuring "strong measures" by Mexico to curb the flow of Central American migrants, though critics said Trump avoided a political crisis of his own making. The New York Times reported Saturday that the deal's steps were ones Mexico had already agreed to in previous rounds of negotiations. In a tweet Sunday, Trump claimed Mexico said it would take further steps to curb migration that would "be announced at the appropriate time. " Mexico's Ambassador to the United States, Martha Bárcena, admitted there were "details" not in the deal's official declaration.
Hundreds of thousands protest bill in Hong Kong
Hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday to demonstrate against proposed amendments to an extradition bill, which would allow the transfer of criminals to mainland China. Police estimated the crowd at 240,000; organizers said it was closer to 1 million. After around 10 hours of peaceful protest, tensions rose when demonstrators stormed the government headquarters. The group briefly made it to the lobby, but police responded with batons and pepper spray. The massive demonstration took place three days before Hong Kong's full legislature considers the bill, which critics fear would let China target political opponents in the former British colony and could undermine its judicial independence.
Nadal makes history with 12th French Open title
In a rematch of the 2018 French Open final, Rafael Nadal downed Dominic Thiem to claim his 18th Grand Slam and become the only man or woman to win the same major tournament 12 times. Nadal has won the past three French Opens and has never lost a French Open final. Nadal took the first set 6-3, but Thiem held serve in the second to go up 7-5 and break the 10-set winning streak the Spaniard held over him in Paris. But Nadal reasserted himself by grabbing 16 of the next 17 points and 12 of the remaining 14 games. "I gave everything I had," Thiem said. "It's amazing: 12 times here. It's unreal. " Nadal beat Thiem in straight sets in 2018.
A month's worth of rain in a day: The Southeast faces flooding
Roads became rivers, high-water rescues were underway, and states of emergency were being declared in parts of the Southeast on Sunday after more than a month of rain fell in a day with more on the way. "The same storm system that linked up with tropical moisture and dumped more than a foot of rain in portions of the south-central United States is crawling eastward," AccuWeather meteorologist Renee Duff said. Flooding that brought havoc to Oklahoma, Arkansas and other states over the past two weeks was sweeping east, threatening metro areas such as Atlanta and Nashville, Tennessee, AccuWeather said. The rains that rolled into the region will linger at least until Monday.

Laura Yeager will assume command of the California National Guard’s 40th Infantry Division in ceremonies later this month at the Joint Forces Training Base, Los Alamitos. Yeager, taking the reins from retiring Maj. Gen. Mark Malanka, will take charge of a force of more than 10,000 soldiers. She began active-duty service in 1986 after receiving her commission as a second lieutenant from the Reserve Officer Training Corps at California State University Long Beach.
'NCIS' actress won't return: She's 'terrified' of co-star
Pauley Perrette says she will never return to "NCIS" – and she says that's because of her former co-star Mark Harmon. The actress, 50, took to Twitter Friday to say she is "terrified" of Harmon, 67, who has a leading role in the criminal investigation series. "I am terrified of Harmon and him attacking me. I have nightmares about it," she said. Perrette, who played forensic specialist Abby Sciuto, departed the series in 2018 after 15 seasons on the show. In May 2018, she said her departure was due to "multiple physical assaults. "
Body of police chief who fell from boat found in Texas
Searchers on Sunday found the body of a Texas police chief who toppled from a fishing boat into Galveston Bay, setting off a frantic-two day search, the U. S. Coast Guard said. The body of Kemah Police Chief Chris Reed, who had been missing since Friday afternoon, was found Sunday morning north of the Texas City Dike, according to the Coast Guard. Reed, who was not wearing a life jacket, fell overboard when his boat was hit by a large wake from a passing vessel, officials said Friday. After his wife, who was also aboard and was not injured, called 911, the Coast Guard and dozens of local, state and federal agencies launched a search involving helicopters, rescue ships and drones.
When Supreme Court justices get snippy
In written opinions and dissents, things have gotten a bit snippy at the Supreme Court. The court's four liberals have displayed irritation at its new, more conservative majority – including once in the middle of the night. And some of the five conservatives are showing impatience with the incremental pace of change. Ill tempers are colliding with Chief Justice John Roberts's effort to lower the temperature following the contentious confirmation of Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. "We are seeing more expression of frustration and anger from the justices this term," said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley School of Law.

Kittery's Festina Lente a splendid restaurant hiding in plain sight Chef and owner Sam Ostrow cooks Italian, mostly, with intention and care.

Texto completo: Pure, unadulterated confidence is a rare commodity in the restaurant world.
More frequently, you'll encounter it in its alloyed form - underconfidence - which you can spot through bland, stale dÃ©cor and unambitious dishes that never seem to change from season to season or year to year.
Worse (and sadly, even more common) is its opposite: overconfidence, a glittery amalgam that ought to be called Fool's Confidence. You'll find it wherever you see gimmicky cocktails, sprawling, schizophrenic menus, and ludicrous dishes that feature a bedlam of unnecessary ingredients.
Simple confidence is scarce because, to create it, you need experience, clarity of vision and a genuine understanding of the boundaries and amplitudes of your abilities.
Just ask Sam Ostrow, chef and owner of Festina Lente, a tiny-yet-stylish 26-seat restaurant that opened in Kittery almost a year ago. Motivated by the poise and self-possession of restaurants he visited when he traveled to Italy in his 20s, he has assembled a terse menu of about a dozen appetizers and soups, alongside just eight pastas and mains. Maybe more to the point, while his modern, rustic Italian restaurant has a full liquor license, you won't find a Negroni or Old Fashioned at the chic dark-walnut-topped bar. Wine, beer, digestifs and aperitifs are what's on offer at Festina Lente.
"One big reason is that, with such a small space, staffing a bartender to make cocktails just wouldn't be financially viable," he said. "We also have one coffee maker. It makes coffee: no espressos, cappuccinos, no decaf. We have a big 'Don't do it if it's going to stretch you too far' mentality. I always try to think what a tiny place would do in Italy, where they cordially say, 'This is what we have to serve you. No more than that. Please enjoy it with us.' It keeps things simple."
Ostrow, who previously cooked at The Black Birch and Portsmouth's Black Trumpet and Block Six at 3S Artspace, conspired with Kittery design firm Winter Holben to extend his clear-eyed vision to everything from the business's line-art anchor-and-fish logo to the high-gloss concrete floors.
The menu, on the other hand, is all his own.
Nearly everything that comes out of the miniature kitchen is house-made, from a gorgeously balanced scoop of chocolate chunk ice cream churned from dairy infused with fresh spearmint leaves ($3), to skinny shoelaces of chitarra-cut pasta that Ostrow rolls out from a rugged dough of fine semolina and Maine Grains flour. Dangled into a pan of butter, grated pecorino Romano cheese and cracked black pepper, then tong-twirled onto one of the kitchen's charmingly mismatched vintage plates, this version of cacio e pepe ($15) might be the best I have eaten in Maine.
While Festina Lente's fresh, 100 percent semolina rigatoni are just as good, the red-chile-fueled amatriciana ladled over them is undersalted, with barely enough guanciale - used here in place of more traditional pancetta - to provide the tongue-coating fattiness the sauce requires. As mistakes go, it's a small one (and easy to remedy). It's also the only one I encountered during a recent visit.
Most of Ostrow's other dishes are inventive and seem to spring naturally from ideas germinated by local flavors. Take his panna cotta ($7), a classic Italian dessert that gets a tweak from the spicy funk of overwintered parsnips and sweet crunch of pistachio brittle.
Or either of his springtime asparagus dishes: The first, a hearty farro salad ($10) into which roasted asparagus spears and curlicues of raw, shaved asparagus are stirred. Mounded atop torn heads of just-picked baby lettuces and garnished with thin slices of savory, unsmoked scamorza (hard, aged mozzarella), this is what you might get if you asked a village nonna to make you a grain bowl.
Then there's a deceptively named veggie terrine ($10), built upon a cushiony foundation of firmly set polenta from Tuckaway Farm in Lee, New Hampshire. Sure, the umami from the shallot-and-mushroom duxelle is lovely. So is the tart sorrel pesto and the papery layer of prosciutto around the exterior of each slice, but the real star is the tender asparagus spears shot through the center of the terrine like arrows into St. Sebastian.
If I lived a little closer, I'd spend the next month of lunchtimes ordering a slice of terrine and a glass of either the near-savory, petillant Feudo di Santa Tresa Frappato ($10) or the Chiarli Vecchia Modena Lambrusco ($13), a sparkling red stunner with tangy fruit that slaps you in the mouth the way a raspberry lambic might.
As long as they're on the menu, I would also go out of my way for a plate of Festina Lente's radishes ($6). Taking a page from the ages-old French tradition of serving newly dug radishes simply, with unsalted butter and a sprinkle of salt, Ostrow builds a wholly new ode to spring. He starts with a miniature salad of radish sprouts and thin coins of radish flesh. Then things move where you'd never predict:
"I was inspired by white-chocolate-dipped strawberries," he said. "So I get butter to just the right temperature, halve or quarter the radishes, and dip them. As the butter cools, I sprinkle them with sea salt." Instead of a candy-coated confection, a savory treat that sparkles with peppery crunch.
If you're questioning why he would choose to make a feature of a French-inspired appetizer in an Italian restaurant, Ostrow offers neither justification nor apology: "Why not? Radishes are the first things that come up in the garden," he says. "It's a playful way of expanding on that." Well aware that he is serving a remarkable dish, he feels no need to explain. That, right there, is confidence.

Hoop Dreams Flourish in the Philippines

Texto completo: Go to any street corner in the Philippines. Any village. Any beach. Even a church. You're likely to see a basketball jersey.
"It's often described as a religion," Carlo Roy Singson, the managing director of N.B.A. Philippines, said in an interview.
Indeed, basketball is ingrained in Filipino culture and has been for more than a century.
The sport's permeation of a country of about 105 million began in the late 1800s, when Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. A large facet of the introduction of the fledgling game was Christian missionaries, who were part of the Y.M.C.A. The game's inventor, James Naismith, conceived of the sport at what was then known as the International Y.M.C.A. Training School in Springfield, Mass. To take a round object and throw it into a peach hoop, as Naismith pictured it, could build morale and character. Soon after he invented the game, missionaries began spreading it around the world, particularly in the Far East and the Philippines, in United States-controlled areas -- a kind of sports imperialism.
The N.B.A. and its players, recognizing the sport's popularity in the Philippines, have invested time there in recent years. In 2013, the Houston Rockets and the Indiana Pacers played a preseason game there. According to a spokesman for the league, the N.B.A.'s Facebook page has 7.3 million followers from the Philippines, the largest of any country outside the United States. Stephen Curry has visited the country multiple times. His teammate Klay Thompson taped a video message in 2015 for his Filipino fans. Multiple networks, including Fox Sports and Solar, broadcast 30 live games per week during the regular season. Two of the most notable figures of Filipino descent in the N.B.A. are Jordan Clarkson, the Cleveland Cavaliers guard, and Erik Spoelstra, the coach of the Miami Heat.
This all began in the early 1900s, when basketball was introduced into schools in the Philippines. In 1913, the first Far Eastern Championship Games -- an early version of what is now known as the Asian Games -- took place in Manila, featuring several East Asian countries taking part in Olympics-style competitions, including basketball. It was the first of 10 biennial events, before disagreements between the countries disbanded the games. The Philippines won gold in nine of them.
The country's population took to basketball en masse. In 1936, its national team made the Olympics and placed fifth, finishing 4-1 in the tournament. At the 1954 FIBA world championship, the Philippines won a bronze medal, the best finish for an Asian country. Two decades later, in 1975, the Philippine Basketball Association, Asia's first basketball league, was created. These games kept the sport at the forefront of Filipino culture and helped grow interest throughout the 20th century.
Chang W. Lee, a New York Times photographer, traveled to the Philippines in April to document how far the sport has come there.
"This is my life! This is my life!" proclaimed a basketball fan, Teddy Garces, after his team, Rain or Shine Elasto Painters, won Game 6 to tie the 2019 Philippine Basketball Association Cup semifinal series with the Magnolia Hotshots Pambansang Manok on a Friday night in April. Garces, a fan of the game for 30 years, spent most of the evening in motion, sitting in his courtside seat one minute, then hopping up on the advertising panels every time a Rain or Shine player scored.
Across the court, Ehla DeJesus, 17, and her sister Rochellyn, 9, moved as if to counterbalance Garces. The sisters jumped up dancing each time the Magnolia Hotshots got a basket. The energy of Garces, the DeJesus sisters and others rocked the Ynares Center in Antipolo City until the last play of the game.
Earlier in the day, basketball devotees in the country had been transfixed by another Game 6, more than 8,000 miles away, when the Nuggets played the Spurs in the first round of the N.B.A. playoffs. In Tondo, a Manila slum, a fisherman, Joel Galigar, desperately tried to connect his TV antenna so he and his family could watch the game. Early-morning N.B.A. game watching is his nearly daily ritual. But after trying and failing to get the antenna adjusted, and finally relying on a neighbor who came to the rescue with a borrowed cable box, Galigar and his family of six watched the game in their barely standing tiny hut. Soon after the game began, neighbors started to crowd around the hut, leaning in to catch a glimpse of the game.
All week, similar scenes played out in Quezon City and Manila. On the mornings when N.B.A. games were being played, nearly every home visited by Lee was watching the game.
Corporations have seen the opportunity. In 2013, Nike took LeBron James to the country for a short visit.
Curry visited in September on the first stop of his Under Armour Asian tour. It was his second visit.
Under heavy clotheslines in a narrow alley on a recent Saturday morning, Randy Fausto wore Curry's jersey while playing the Filipino version of pool and watching a Warriors game through a window. Fausto claimed the jersey was his lucky charm. After the Warriors game ended, men migrated to nearby Asamba Covered Court, where Romeo Naguiat was playing. Naguiat is unemployed and plays daily, including in a local league.
Back in the center of Manila, Gil Tandoc, his 7-year-old son, Michael, and 9-year-old daughter, Elgene, worked at the family's convenience store adjacent to the Manila City Jail Complex. The store sells basketballs.
While Michael and Elgene tirelessly bounced the basketball off the fence surrounding the jail's entrance, inmates and guards inside the jail were busy getting ready for their own basketball tournament.
Up the coast from the jail in Navotas, other games happen in the unlikeliest of places. As the sun began to go down and the heat lost its intensity, the players -- both adults and children -- came out to play at Navotas City Cemetery among the "apartment tombs," stacks of concrete boxes containing the dead. It was there that 21-year-old Renalto AbAdies, who lives in a slum adjacent to the cemetery, played on a recent evening. "I don't fear the dead," said AbAdies, who said he has spent his life playing there.
In the Philippines, the game is everywhere.

Texto completo: PARIS -- As world soccer opens its most important championship for women this week, it is confronting a range of accusations that men with influence over women in the sport repeatedly have used their positions to harass or abuse them.
Since the start of this year, coaches and administrators in at least five countries on four continents have been accused by players and colleagues of sexual misconduct, inappropriate behavior and even rape.
Now, an internal investigation has begun into a vice president of FIFA, world soccer's governing body, after he was accused, among other transgressions, of dismissing an employee in 2017 after she rejected his romantic advances. The official, Ahmad Ahmad, the president of Africa's soccer confederation and a close ally of the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, has denied the accusation and separate claims that he sexually harassed several other women.
The harassment allegations against Ahmad are the first to be made against the leader of one of soccer's six regional governing bodies. Ahmad also has been accused of misusing confederation funds and entering into questionable contracts, potential offenses that led to his being detained by the French authorities in Paris on Thursday. He was later released without being charged.
Accusations of financial misdeeds have long dogged FIFA, which continues to struggle to repair its reputation after a wide-ranging corruption scandal in 2015 led to the ouster or arrests of much of its senior leadership.
Direct accusations of misbehavior involving women, though, generally have remained out of public view; in a rare exception, the former goalkeeper Hope Solo once accused the former FIFA president Sepp Blatter of groping her at an awards ceremony. But the #MeToo movement has inspired women to come forward even in soccer's clubby atmosphere, which remains dominated by powerful men unaccustomed to scrutiny.
Just last month, officials in Gabon announced a judicial investigation into claims that members of the country's under-20 women's team were raped and mistreated by federation staff members during a recent tournament in France. Earlier cases came to light this year involving stories of rapes in Afghanistan, tales of a pattern of inappropriate behavior by an elite youth coach in Canada, and reports of sexual assault and harassment in Colombia and Ecuador.
"I think there's a lot to be done to ensure proper safeguarding" of women's players, said Moya Dodd, an Australian soccer official who once served on FIFA's governing council. "We simply don't know how big the problem is unless we have proper policies and safe-reporting mechanisms to test that question."
In some of the cases, the abuse of women's players was known to more senior soccer officials, who did not act to stop it.
This was the case, too, with the accusations of inappropriate behavior by Ahmad. In the most detailed accusation against him, a public relations consultant from Mali, Mariam Diakite, said she was fired by Ahmad for rejecting his advances. Although she was later reinstated after soccer officials intervened, she learned, after her incident was included in an ethics complaint filed with FIFA this year, that at least four other women had made similar claims.
Diakite, 34, said she had a confrontation with Ahmad in a hotel suite during a conference she was hired to organize in Rabat, Morocco, in 2017. He informed her he was terminating her because he had intimated to officials that the pair were in a romantic relationship, and that it would be a conflict of interest if she carried on working.
But Diakite said that while he sought one, there was no romantic relationship.
"He was refusing to let me work because I refused to marry him," Diakite said. "When you are a president and you've got people whose dream is to work in football and you say, 'Come to my room and I give you a job,' is that not abuse of power?"
Ahmad, in response to questions from The New York Times about the incident with Diakite, called her accusations "smears on my character" and part of a personal vendetta against him that he said was being orchestrated by a former senior employee of the African soccer federation.
"They are lies," he said.
Diakite said that as a woman with Muslim heritage, it was not easy to come forward, for cultural reasons but also because of pressure from some soccer insiders to remain quiet. Even now, she is reluctant to use the term "sexual harassment" to describe what she said happened to her, preferring to label it an abuse of his power.
The details of Ahmad's conduct in Rabat are part of a dossier filed with FIFA's ethics committee by Amr Fahmy, who had been the No. 2 official under Ahmad at the Confederation of African Football, which oversees the game on the continent, until he was ousted this year. Separately, two current federation staff members sent emails to FIFA's secretary general, Fatma Samoura, a friend of Ahmad's from her time as a United Nations official, outlining sexual harassment allegations. Those complaints have been forwarded to the ethics body, too.
FIFA said it would not comment on any continuing ethics inquiry.
But a British woman, whose identity is known to The Times but spoke only on the condition of anonymity, was said to have been cornered by Ahmad at the same event in Rabat, and said that he had insisted she, too, accompany him to his room. The woman, hired to do translation work at the conference, said she quit immediately after the encounter and returned to Britain, where she filed a complaint with the police in London.
Senior officials of the African federation and FIFA sought to resolve the conflict between Diakite and Ahmad -- she had angrily tossed an ashtray at him during the meeting in his suite -- after his assistant told them what had happened.
Diakite met with Isha Johansen, one of only two female African soccer leaders. Samoura, who was in Rabat for the event, spoke privately with Ahmad in his suite. The dispute was eventually settled after Ahmad, according to several witnesses present, apologized and agreed to allow Diakite to continue with her work, which she did.
Ahmad declined to comment on the resolution of the dispute, reiterating his view that he was the subject of a smear campaign.
Johansen confirmed that she was present but declined to comment on the specifics of the meeting. She said, however, that she was prepared to speak with FIFA ethics officials to discuss the matter further if they asked.
For soccer's governing body, the conflict risks turning into yet another crisis, just as Infantino -- elected to the top post in 2016, a year after a corruption crisis brought down FIFA's leadership -- begins a new four-year mandate.
The case also highlights how vulnerable women can be in some parts of the soccer world. One female member of the African confederation's staff, among those to have filed a complaint to FIFA, said she did not raise her concerns earlier because she did not think anyone would listen.
Directly addressing the harassment of women in a speech to a FIFA-organized women's soccer conference in Paris on Thursday, Samoura said she hoped the #MeToo movement would lead to change in soccer.
"As the momentum of the social media phenomenon grew, finally, finally, the struggles, the problems and the battles that women face day in and day out begun to be understood," she said.
"I want the Women's World Cup to be a safe space for girls and women," she added, "where your voice can be heard, and where you can feel empowered."
Dodd, the Australian official, went further, urging FIFA to strengthen and enforce reporting policies, and to set up systems where women can report harassment and abuse.
"We know that harassment and abuse is a serious issue in sport, because we saw in gymnastics 150 women file into a courtroom and give evidence of it," Dodd said. "And these were women who had been educated, who were medalists, who you might have thought had a voice in things.
"So we know that so often in these matters the voices of the victims are suppressed, and not able to be heard. And football needs to ensure that we have an adequate safeguarding system in place."

Two-thirds of Texas Democrats want Beto O'Rourke to quit 2020 race

Texto completo: A majority of Democrats in Texas believe it would be best if Beto O'Rourke stepped down from the 2020 presidential race to run for Senate, with many claiming they are skeptical that the former Texas congressman could beat President Trump.
By a margin of 60% to 27%, those polled expressed a desire that "O'Rourke should challenge Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in the 2020 U.S. Senate race, rather than continue his campaign for president," according to a Quinnipiac University poll published Wednesday.
The Quinnipiac poll is further confirmation that support for O'Rourke continues to slip, which a Reuters poll also indicated Thursday. Among Democratic and independent voters polled nationally, O'Rourke's support slid 3 percentage points since May to a mere 3%.
Ranking sixth in a field of 24 candidates, O'Rourke remains far from the bottom of the list, despite his declining popularity.
"Why do Texas Democrats want to see a second O’Rourke Senate campaign?" wrote David Leonhardt in the New York Times. "I can’t get inside their heads, but I think their view is rational. The Democrats have enough presidential candidates, and O’Rourke doesn’t currently look like the strongest one."
Former Vice President Joe Biden remains the front-runner in the large field, with many claiming that he has the best chance of defeating Trump. "I think things are really messed up right now in America, and I trust Biden more," a Democratic voter told Reuters.

EPA chief rips media: ‘Reporters are lazy’

Texto completo: President Trump’s EPA chief is stepping up his campaign against what he sees as media bias skewed to disparage him and his agency, ripping online media as unreliable and reporters as “lazy.”
The last straw for Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler was a quote attributed to him this week by a Yahoo News reporter and retweeted by the New York Times that he felt far out of context.
“I mean, is Yahoo even a real news service?” he said in an interview with Secrets.
Tweet
“Anybody online thinks that they’re a reporter these days,” he added.
After he spoke to the National Press Club this week, Yahoo News tweeted out, “‘The media does a disservice to the American public’ by reporting on global warming, says EPA head Andrew Wheeler. Wants more positive coverage.”
Tweet
Wheeler said that he did not like how the quote was framed in the tweet. He said that his comment was aimed at non-stop negative coverage that doesn’t tell the story of years of improvement, a point made in the Yahoo News story.
Yahoo News is a popular news service. The president of the White House Correspondents’ Association is the former Yahoo News White House reporter.
Wheeler said it was one of a long string of media efforts meant to mock Trump’s environmental record. He added that there is a pack mentality with anti-Trump media and he cited the retweeting of the Yahoo report by other media.

“It tells me that most reporters are lazy these days,” he said. “What does it say about the state of journalism today? It’s atrocious,” he said.
“I get stuff out of context all the time. All the time, every single day, almost every single article written about me by the mainstream media takes something out of context,” he added.
Wheeler also charged that the media would not have retweeted anything disparaging a Democrat without checking first.
“If somebody had put out a fake quote about somebody else that made them look bad, a Democrat or one of the Democratic presidential candidates, they would have verified and double verified and called to make sure it was accurate. They probably wouldn’t have even tweeted it if it was negative against somebody that they liked. They would either ignore it of just double check and triple check it,” he told Secrets in his office.
Despite his wariness with the press, Wheeler continues to grant interviews and give speeches and even said, “I probably need to do more but I don’t have enough hours in the day.”
And while media coverage frustrates him, Wheeler pledged, “I’m trying to make sure that it does not slow down our agenda.”

Texto completo: Eighth-seeded Australian player Ashleigh Barty has reached her first Grand Slam final at the French Open, and she got there by ending the run of 17-year-old American Amanda Anisimova 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-3.
Barty will face another teenager, Marketa Vondrousova, in the final. Vondrousova beat Johanna Konta 7-5, 7-6 (2).
Anisimova, who was born in Freehold Township, pulled off a shocker at Roland Garros on Thursday.
She stunned third-ranked Simona Halep in the quarterfinals, cruising in straight sets to a 6-2, 6-4 victory. The win was Anisimova's first against a top-five player, and it secures her first trip to the semifinals at a major championship.
"I can't believe it. I mean, I've been working so hard, but I didn't think it would pay off like this," Anisimova said after Thursday's win. "This is honestly more than I could ask for. "

More: Is Freehold-born Amanda Anisimova, 17, the next Maria Sharapova of tennis?

More on Amanda:
New Jersey born, Florida raised
Anisimova is the daughter of Russian immigrants Konstanin and Olga, who moved to the United States in 1998 in order to provide more tennis-related opportunities for the oldest daughter, Maria, according to The New York Times.
Maria went on to play tennis collegiately at the University of Pennsylvania — but Amanda quickly grew into a star.
Born in Freehold Township, New Jersey, in 2001, Amanda later moved to Florida, where many professional tennis players live and train. She now lives in Aventura, Florida.
Why tennis?
Anisimova told WTA's website that she was inspired to pick up the sport by her aforementioned older sister. But she also loves the individual nature of the sport.
"In tennis, you don’t have to depend on anyone," she told WTA's website. "I did gymnastics as a kid, and I liked that too, because I only had to depend on myself.
"It’s not like it’s all about me, but at the end of the day, if I won or lost, I knew what I had to improve, and couldn’t rely on a team. "
A rapid ascent
Anisimova actually made her French Open debut two years ago, earning a wild-card spot when she was just 15. She also won one title that year on the ITF Women's Circuit, which is a developmental level below the WTA.
Last year, in her first professional season, she climbed to No. 95 in the world with a handful of solid performances, including a runner-up finish at the Hana-Cupid Japan Women's Open in Hiroshima and a run to the fourth round at Indian Wells.
Anisimova then reached the Round of 16 at the Australian Open in January, where she lost to Petra Kvitova. She was ranked No. 51 in the world entering play at Roland Garros.
Russian roots
Anisimova speaks Russian with her parents, including her father, Konstanin, who served as her coach earlier in her career. But she told The New York Times in 2017 that she has never visited Russia and never considered representing her parents' home country on the court.
"I do plan on going, though," she told the newspaper in 2017. "I really want to visit and see what it’s like and see the culture more. "
Anisimova is one of two Russian-American players who have made waves at Roland Garros this week. Another young American of Russian descent, Sofia Kenin, upset Serena Williams on Saturday.
Backup plan?
Anisimova said in the 2017 article that she would like to become a surgeon if the whole tennis thing doesn't work out.
"Actually what I want to do is go to online college while I’m in my pro career and then go to med school after I finish," she told The New York Times in 2017.
In a similar vein, WTA's website reported two years ago that Anisimova "spends her free time reading books and watching Youtube videos about science and chemistry. "
"I’ve always been curious about it, and I think it’s pretty cool," she said at the time.

Thomas Edison's great-grandson: Stop using incandescent lightbulbs

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Thomas Edison’s great-grandson wants you to stop using the incandescent lightbulb.
On Thursday afternoon, Barry Edison Sloane, one of Thomas Edison’s great-grandchildren, took part in a press conference with Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N. J. , to call on the Trump administration to stop a rollback of lightbulb efficiency standards that would have all but phased out the lightbulb Edison played a role in inventing. Pallone chairs the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Department of Energy.
Sloane slammed the rollback, saying, “It’s unacceptable that the Department of Energy now intends to disregard commonsense innovations that have already been embraced in 80 countries and the U. S. for over a decade. Edison would have agreed that, given the urgency climate change presents, this kind of action is like throwing gasoline on our burning house. "
More: On World Environment Day, everything you know about energy in the US might be wrong
Edison is generally credited as one of the inventors who helped make incandescent lightbulbs commercially viable in the United States. He patented his designs for lightbulbs in 1879 and 1880, and went on to create the first modern electric utility when he opened the Pearl Street Station in New York City in 1882.
“This reckless rollback will lead to years of unnecessary electricity generation and carbon emissions – just to power inefficient and outdated lightbulbs,” said Pallone. “Trashing this important standard will also increase consumers’ electricity bills by allowing inefficient products to remain on the market, something that is absolutely unnecessary,”
Pallone told USA TODAY that he and Sloane were holding the press conference to “call out” the Trump administration for its regulatory rollback, though no legislation or lawsuits were planned at the time to stop the Department of Energy’s actions. According to Pallone's office, this regulatory rollback would "increase consumers’ electricity bills by $12 billion a year by the year 2025. "
In March 2019, the Department of Energy announced that it planned to withdraw an Obama-era rule that would have effectively ended the sale of all incandescent bulbs — including “decorative” bulbs that had previously been exempt. Advocates of the policy rollback had argued the Obama rule was necessary for energy conservation.

Lightbulb industry groups had opposed the Obama-era rules.
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association, which represents companies like Siemens, General Electric, and Signify, formerly Philips Lighting, wrote in a release when the Department of Energy issued its proposed rollback that “consumers, retailers, and manufacturers have, without government regulation, already driven energy savings in the general service lamp category far faster than anyone could have imagined just a few years ago. ”
Edison’s descendants have been vocal, though, in their desire for technological change.
In an April 2019 New York Times op-ed, Barry Edison Sloane and J. Heywood Edison Sloane wrote that “Our great-grandfather’s lightbulb helped change the world. But it’s almost 140 years old and it’s time to modernize. Thomas Edison would have been the first to say so. ”

Texto completo: WikiLeaks founder Julian
Assange's indictment under the Espionage Act is so controversial that at least two of his prosecutors argued against the decision to indict. We know this because it was leaked to news media.
Leaks to the media are as much of a Washington routine as the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival. So are internal debates between members of the same prosecution team.
But the Assange dispute is a higher stakes argument than most. He is the first publisher in any medium to face criminal prosecution under the 1917 Espionage Act for publishing classified information, even though newspapers have routinely published government secrets that have been leaked to them, including some by WikiLeaks.
In this case, an enormous trove of classified documents was provided to WikiLeaks in 2010 by Chelsea Manning, a U.S. Army intelligence analyst who later went to prison for the leaks.
The Espionage Act has been used to prosecute spies and employees with classified clearances who leaked to the press. But federal prosecutors have avoided using it to prosecute journalists for receiving or publishing those leaks.
Contrary to popular belief, they were not doing this simply to be nice to the media. Although judges have sent to jail for contempt some reporters who refused to reveal their sources, prosecution under the Espionage Act raises the ante by treating journalists the same as spies. Prosecutors could be stepping over the line into the criminalization of journalism, a direct violation of a First Amendment right.
But this argument has never been fully tested in the courts. As one legal scholar, Steve Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor and specialist in national security law, said in a 2017 interview with Just Security, "the statute is old and ambiguous," produced in the political heat of World War I Washington "and not drafted with the kind of specificity that usually characterizes speech-restricting statutes that survive constitutional challenge."
In his 2010 testimony about WikiLeaks before the House Judiciary Committee, Vladeck suggested that the law should be fine-tuned to limit prosecutions to those who specifically intend their disclosure to harm national security or benefit a foreign power.
But under existing law, President Donald Trump's Justice Department has gone where President Barack Obama and Eric Holder, his attorney general, decided after long consideration and internal debate to avoid.
And Obama and Holder, let us not forget, were no softies in pursuing leaks. Obama's Justice Department subpoenaed the phone records of AP journalists. They went after Fox News reporter James Rosen, naming him as a "co-conspirator" in a leak about North Korea's nuclear program. They picked up where the George W. Bush administration left off in pursuing The New York Times' James Risen's source in the espionage case of former CIA employee Jeffrey Sterling.
But the Obama administration pulled back in his second term after Holder held meetings with press freedom organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, of which I'm a board member.
Holder assured us at the time that he had no intention to lock up journalists. But the Trump administration appears to be leaning in the other direction in the Assange case.
"The department takes seriously the role of journalists in our democracy," John Demers, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, told reporters when he announced the indictment May 23. "But Julian Assange is no journalist."
But who is to decide these days who's a journalist and who isn't? Assange may fall far short of being a model journalist, but pursuing him as a spy only makes bad matters worse.

Texto completo: The Indianapolis Colts drafted former Stanford football captain Bobby Okereke in April despite knowing that he had been accused of sexual assault while he was at the university, and that three members of a campus disciplinary panel had concluded he was responsible for the alleged rape, according to the Associated Press.
The Colts discussed the allegation with Okereke before they drafted the inside linebacker in the third round of April's NFL draft, general manager Chris Ballard told reporters on a conference call Wednesday, the AP reported.
Ballard stressed that Okereke was never criminally charged or convicted in the 2015 case, and was not disciplined by the university because two members of the Stanford hearing panel found he was not responsible for the alleged assault.
"From everything we gathered, we felt it was appropriate to take him," the Associated Press reported Ballard said. "He was very honest about his side of the story and what occurred and how he had to move forward."
Ballard's comments came hours after The Fountain Hopper, an independent Stanford student publication, for the first time identified Okereke as the accused football player who was written about, but not named, in a 2016 New York Times story scrutinizing how Stanford handled sexual assault allegations.
Brad Hayward, a Stanford spokesman, said Wednesday the university could not confirm the identity of anyone involved in a Title IX investigation, or say whether Okereke was ever disciplined while at the university.
The Times reported that the woman met the unnamed player at a fraternity party and went back with him to her room, where she said he sexually assaulted her. He said that the two had consensual sex, according to documents cited by the Times in the report.
Neither the woman nor Okereke could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
Three of five members of a Stanford disciplinary panel that handled Title IX allegations found the player had committed sexual assault, according to the Times. But Stanford's policies for adjudicating sexual assault allegations at the time required that at least four of the five panelists reach that conclusion in order to impose discipline.
The woman who accused the player appealed the panel's decision and was granted a second hearing, where the panel again split 3-2 in favor of finding the player responsible, the Times reported.
As a result, the university found the football player was not responsible for the assault, and he was never disciplined. The woman also sought a restraining order against Okereke in 2015, but a judge reportedly turned down the request.
Okereke started every game of the 2018 season and led the Cardinal with 96 tackles.
A spokesman for the Colts did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon.
In the conference call reported by the Associated Press, Ballard said no one from the Colts had spoken with the woman who accused Okereke of sexual assault before he was drafted.
"It happened four years ago, and because there were no charges and no disciplinary action taken by the university, and because of his track record since, we felt comfortable drafting him," Ballard said.
The woman never reported the alleged assault to law enforcement, according to the Times, preferring to handle the accusation through Stanford's internal disciplinary process.
Stanford and other universities handle sexual assault allegations under the federal gender equality law Title IX. But the processes for investigating and disciplining students have faced criticism, both from victims rights advocates who say they don't do enough to protect survivors and from those who argue they violate the due process rights of accused students.
Stanford changed its standard for finding students responsible the equivalent of a guilty verdict in university discipline hearings in 2016. Cases are now heard by a three-person panel, which must unanimously find the student committed sexual assault for the student to be disciplined. Critics have said that the process favors the accuser.
Hayward, the university spokesman, said, "Stanford responds to all reports of Title IX violations that are brought to the university's attention, and we encourage anyone with information or concern about a Title IX matter to report it to our Title IX Office."

Congress expects foreign interference again in the 2020 election. It still isn’t likely to take any action.

Texto completo: Even as she campaigns for the Democratic nomination for president, it’s become apparent that if anyone can get bipartisan legislation passed in the Senate, it’s Amy Klobuchar. In the 2017-18 session, 22 of her bills and resolutions made it passed the Senate, the most of any Democrat. At the same time, Klobuchar introduced 65 bills with a Republican and Democratic co-sponsor, also making her the Democratic Senator to introduce the most bills with bipartisan support.
After all the reports of foreign interference in the 2016 election, presumably no issue would be easier to legislate around than ensuring that election vulnerabilities are secured before the next election. The Mueller report indicated that Minnesota was one of the 21 states probed for elections interference in 2017.
The Secure Elections Act, first introduced by Klobuchar and Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma in 2017, was one such bipartisan bill aiming to protect U.S. elections. It would have, in part, provided additional resources shore up election infrastructure, as well as encourage the use of paper ballots and election audits. It had broad support from Democrats and Republicans alike, from California Democrat Senator Kamala Harris to Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
But last year, the Republican-led Senate Rules and Administration Committee abruptly blocked the bill from moving forward.
“The current FBI Director and the current Director of Intelligence have told us that Russia is getting bolder; that what we’ve just seen was a dress rehearsal,” said Klobuchar, the ranking Democrat on the Rules and Administration Committee .
“And yet, any attempt that I’ve made to pass the Secure Elections Act — a bill that I have with Sen. Lankford — the White House has stopped in its tracks. They made calls to stop that bill despite strong Republican support.”
In April, The New York Times reported that acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney believes any discussion of Russian election activity is seen by the President as a problem of legitimacy for his election.
In addition to the Secure Elections Act, Klobuchar has been instrumental in pushing a number of bills that each fulfill a different election-reform related purpose: The Election Security Act, which which would require backup paper ballots and provide additional election security grants; The Honest Ads Act, which would create stricter laws for online political advertisements; and the Global Electoral Exchange Act, which would establish a information sharing program on election security with U.S. allies.
“Hardening our electoral infrastructure will require a comprehensive approach and it can’t be done with a single piece of legislation,” Graham said in a press release, advocating for The Honest Ads Act.
So far, none of the bills have seen any movement.
Ahead of the curve
Minnesota is one of the few states ahead of the curve on some election security. The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank based in D.C., places Minnesota as one of 11 states with a B rating on election security. The rest of the states received C, D, or F ratings, evaluated on criteria like post-election audits, paper absentee ballots, and cybersecurity for voter registration systems.
Additionally, the state is ahead of the curve in that it uses paper ballots, avoiding the potential security problems with electronic voting.
Nonetheless, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon believes that further spending and analysis of potential security issues is critical to being prepared for future elections. He said he believes that Federal legislation that sets basic standards for election security for states is key to doing this.
“I’m partial of course to Senator Klobuchar and Senator Lankford’s Secure Elections Act,” said Simon. “To set floors, not ceilings, to work with states, and to come up with some common sense consensus about elections administration.”
The Federal government, through the Help America Vote Act, already allocated $6.6 million to modernize election security for the state. There was some initial dissent to allocating the entire amount, but in the end, after finalizing a brokered bipartisan session in the State Legislature, Gov. Tim Walz was able to sign the entire $6.6 million allocation.
“We’ve had multiple people from Homeland Security in our office for days at a time and when they find vulnerabilities, they write up a report and give us recommendations,” said Simon. “And those recommendations cost money.”
But Simon still remains concerned for the long term.
“That $6.6 million is a tremendous boost once we get our hands on it, but it is one time money,” he said. “The fixes that are necessary, the modernation, will require ongoing funding.”
Running out of time
The Senate this month did pass legislation on election security: the Defending Elections against Trolls from Enemy Regimes Act (DETER Act), which would prevent someone from entering the U.S. if they tried to, or had, interfered in U.S. elections. But beyond punitive security measures, the Senate has done nothing in recent months to shore up election security.
Election security policy experts, like at Verified Voting, an organization that advocates for accurate and transparent elections, believe that interference with our elections is “a risk, not a certainty,” but also that “the federal government can take to get that risk close to zero.”
Verified Voting President Marian K. Schneider Schneider said that congress needs to provide support to replace all remaining paperless ballot systems, as well technical and material support for post-election audits. “Most of all,” she said, “we need to invest in our election infrastructure in order to mitigate any risk of error or attack.”
Beyond the money that was allocated under the Help America Vote Act, it is unclear what a Republican Senate led by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky will be willing to pass. Earlier last month, when asked if there would be any more election security legislation passed, Roy Blunt, Chair of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, told reporters: “At this point I don’t see any likelihood that those bills would get to the floor.”
Lankford does plan on releasing a new version of the Secure Elections Act as soon as this week, working with the White House to restructure the language. Although he said the bill would not include election security funding for states, he told The Hill it would still require post-election audits.
Despite this, as the 2020 election approaches and the presidential field (that includes her) narrows, Klobuchar seems intent on pushing bi-partisan election security and reform. And while Republican Senators have offered support for the legislation, the decision ultimately remains with those at the top: namely McConnell and the White House.
“Congress should pass my bipartisan election security legislation now. There are some smaller measures that could be passed by the Senate—but we know Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and we know they’re trying to do it again in 2020,” Klobuchar said.
“The time has come — in fact, we are running out of time — to put the rules in place on issue ads and candidate ads. We need to make sure our next election is protected from foreign interference. Protecting our democracy shouldn’t be a partisan issue.”

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom based in New York. Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published.
On Thursday, we launched a new feature for our Nonprofit Explorer database: The ability to search the full text of nearly 3 million electronically filed nonprofit tax filings sent to the IRS since 2011.
Nonprofit Explorer already lets researchers, reporters and the general public search for tax information from more than 1.8 million nonprofit organizations in the United States, as well as allowing users to search for the names of key employees and directors of organizations.
Now, users of our free database can dig deep and search for text that appears anywhere in a nonprofit’s tax records, as long as those records were filed digitally — which according to the IRS covers about two-thirds of nonprofit tax filings in recent years.
How can this be useful to you? For one, this feature lets you find organizations that gave grants to other nonprofits. Any nonprofit that gives grants to another must list those grants on its tax forms — meaning that you can research a nonprofit’s funding by using our search. A search for “ProPublica,” for example, will bring up dozens of foundations that have given us grants to fund our reporting (as well as a few filings that reference Nonprofit Explorer itself).
See the Database
Nonprofit Explorer: Research Tax-Exempt Organizations
Search the full text of over 9.6 million tax filing documents going back as far as 2001.
Just another example: When private foundations have investments or ownership interest in for-profit companies, they have to list those on their tax filings as well. If you want to research which foundations have investments in a company like ExxonMobil, for example, you can simply search for the company name and check which organizations list it as an investment.
The possibilities are nearly limitless. You can search for the names or addresses of independent contractors that made more than $100,000 from a nonprofit, you can search for addresses, keywords in mission statements or descriptions of accomplishments. You can even use advanced search operators, so for instance you can find any filing that mentions either “The New York Times,” “nytimes” or “nytimes.com” in one search.
The new feature contains every electronically filed Form 990, 990-PF and 990-EZ released by the IRS from 2011 to date. That’s nearly 3 million filings. The search does not include forms filed on paper.
So please, give this search a spin. If you write a story using information from this search, or you come across bugs or problems, drop us a line! We’re excited to see what you all do with this new superpower.

No más prima donnas de la contaminación

Texto completo: La industria de combustibles fósiles se comporta como la prima donna de la economía nacional. Sin importar las consecuencias catastróficas de sus actuaciones, la administración Trump sigue premiándola con ramos de rosas.
Las comunidades hispanas que sufren las consecuencias de estos desastres, en cambio, solo reciben las espinas.
Un claro ejemplo son los barrios hispanos de Houston —Pasadena, Deer Park y Manchester— que recientemente han sufrido de primera mano varios desastres petroquímicos. El más grave fue el incendio en una instalación de almacenaje de ITC que emitió enormes cantidades de sustancias tóxicas al aire y las vías acuáticas colindantes. Decenas de familias, en su mayoría hispanas, sufrieron los efectos tóxicos de venenos como xileno y benceno.
Este abuso ocurre por todo el país. En los dos últimos años se han dado decenas de desastres petroquímicos similares, al mismo tiempo que la administración Trump ha debilitado las protecciones que ayudan a prevenir estas tragedias.
Un estudio del New York Times reveló que desde su llegada al poder, la administración ha debilitado o eliminado 84 protecciones, favoreciendo abrumadoramente los deseos de los contaminadores fósiles.
Esta insidiosa narrativa —sucio, bueno; limpio, malo— es un desesperado intento de ocultar los verdaderos costes de los combustible fósiles. Según un reporte del Fondo Monetario Internacional, Estados Unidos gasta más en subsidiar los combustibles fósiles que en sus fuerzas armadas. En 2015, los subsidios directos e indirectos al petróleo, carbón y gas alcanzaron los $649 mil millones, mientras que el Pentágono recibió unos $600 mil millones.
El cálculo de estos subsidios incluye las llamadas externalidades de esta industria, incluyendo los descomunales costos de su contaminación a la salud nacional. El estudio también reveló que los subsidios mundiales a esta industria se elevaron a $4,7 billones (trillions en inglés). El FMI llegó a la pasmosa conclusión de que si se hubiera puesto un precio justo a estos combustibles, se hubieran reducido las emisiones climáticas en un 28%, y se disminuirían las muertes prematuras en el mundo en un 50%.
Mientras tanto, el avance de la economía de energía limpia continúa imparable. Cinco estados más Puerto Rico y el Distrito de Columbia, y más de 120 ciudades se han comprometido a generar un 100% de energía limpia, y varios proyectos de construcción de gasoductos han sido derrotados o intensamente confrontados en Carolina del Norte , Maryland , Nueva York , Virginia y Virginia Occidental .
En una economía en la que la energía limpia rápidamente se convierte en su prima ballarina, no hay espacio para prima donnas.

Texto completo: General Motors CEO Mary Barra said Wednesday that the company does not plan to add a new vehicle to its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant.
Barra said GM still hopes to sell the plant to an electric-vehicle start-up company based in Loveland, Ohio, although questions have been raised about that company's financial wherewithal.
Barra made the comments during a brief interview Wednesday with Reuters in Washington, D.C., where she said that GM's plan to sell Lordstown Assembly to Workhorse Group Inc. and an affiliated, newly formed entity was well considered and had a chance of success.
Asked if the deal was a "PR stunt" Barra said no, adding, "We vetted many opportunities."
"General Motors did a lot of vetting," Barra said. "We're trying to find solutions."
Reuters reported that Barra rebuffed criticism of the planned deal, saying GM continues to believe selling the plant to Workhorse is "a strong possibility and (I) think people should focus on opportunity, and maybe every now and then a little optimism wouldn't hurt anyone."
No new car Barra said GM did not plan to add a new vehicle at Lordstown, which had built the Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan until March, because the automaker has unused capacity at other U.S. plants.
Her comments echo remarks she made in January to the Free Press when asked if Detroit-Hamtramck or Lordstown could get one of the 20 new electric vehicles GM plans to bring to market in the next decade. Barra said at that time, "We have more products coming that we will build in the United States and we'll provide opportunities."
But she added, "We need to make sure the capacity is up at other plants that we're still working to improve."
Lordstown and Detroit-Hamtramck, which had built the pioneering Chevrolet Volt, an electric car with a gas backup, were among five North American factories targeted in November for idling, affecting 6,200 jobs. Oshawa Assembly near Toronto and transmission plants in Warren and near Baltimore are the other plants. Detroit-Hamtramck is to operate until January.
Lordstown UAW Local 1112 President David Green declined to comment on Barra's comments to Reuters, noting that the UAW has sued GM over the plant closure, contending it violates terms of the 2015 contract.
GM has endured harsh criticism from the UAW and politicians, including President Donald Trump. But GM said it's trying to soften the blow for affected workers. As of May 30, GM said it has placed about 1,450 of the 2,800 hourly employees at the affected U.S. plants in new jobs.
No money, no optimism Workhorse designs and builds electric vehicles including trucks, aircraft and drones, along with monitoring systems to help fleet operators.
It is a finalist in bidding for a $5 billion U.S. Postal Service contract to replace its fleet.
But the day before Trump last month tweeted news of the Lordstown talks, it cast doubt on its own viability, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.
"Our existing capital resources will be insufficient to fund our operations through the first half of 2019," Workhorse stated as it reported more red ink. "If we are not able to obtain additional financing and/or substantially increase revenue from sales, we will be unable to continue as a going concern (stay in business)."
Workhorse had $763,000 in revenue in 2018, down from $10million in 2017.
But the company's need for cash is hardly "man bites dog" news, GM's global communication's boss, Tony Cervone, wrote in an opinion piece to the New York Times on June 3.
"With the end of Cruze production, a sale of the plant to a new company affiliated with Workhorse Group is the best opportunity we have found to keep vehicle production at the site — a conclusion we reached after reviewing proposals from multiple interested parties," Cervone's essay said. "Why Workhorse? Because it is better positioned than most electric vehicle start-ups, with hundreds of battery electric trucks on the road, satisfied customers and a substantial order backlog."
Cervone said if talks this summer are successful, "it will put Workhorse at the center of a new and potentially lucrative growth market — commercial electric trucks."
Cervone also said that 850 people, a little more than half of Lordstown workers, have been placed in jobs at other GM plants at pay that can be more than $100,000 a year, including profit-sharing. He said the company continues working to find placements for the remaining workers and complete a sale. Yet, there is "significant opportunity" for the local community, which, he argued, "should drive a sense of optimism, not despair."
Uncertainty in trade On the topic of Trump's threatened tariffs on imports from Mexico, Barra told Reuters it was unclear what the precise impact would be on GM if the tariffs take effect on June 10, but according to congressional aides, she told lawmakers the impact would be significant.
Barra said the difficulty in gauging the impact was due to a lack of knowing "what the rules are going to be and the exclusions around it."
Earlier this week, the Trump administration denied GM's year-old request for an exemption to a 25% U.S. tariff on its Chinese-made Buick Envision midsize SUV. GM had argued that if it did not get an exemption the vehicle might have to be dropped from the Buick lineup.
The denial came in a May 29 letter from the U.S. trade representative's office saying the request concerns "a product strategically important or related to 'Made in China 2025' or other Chinese industrial programs," Reuters said.
The 2020 Envision starts at $31,995. GM sold 30,152 Envisions in the United States last year, down 26.5 percent from 2017. The Envision made up 14.6% of Buick sales in the U.S.
"We have been notified that our exclusion reuse was denied," Stuart Fowle, a Buick spokesman, said in a statement. "At this time we do not have any plans to adjust the volume or price of the Envision in the United States and will comply with all trade rules."

This is Indy's best new barbecue restaurant

Texto completo: First Friday. 11:30 p.m. Most people are tumbling in and out of Fountain Square bars after a long night of artistic stimulation. Alex George is alone, wrapping briskets in brown paper under the dim light of a few bulbs. They hang above his smoker at the Old Gold Barbecue food truck behind Metazoa Brewing in Fletcher Place. "You've caught me at a busy time," he says, barely looking up from his swaddled lovelies. Brisket is fussy. The tough cut requires low, slow cooking. Blanketing the beef part-way through the smoking process ensures juicy tenderness hours later. Timing is critical. "I have to stay focused on this," George says.
His day began eight hours earlier, and George, who came to Indy from Austin, Texas, where barbecue is pretty much a way of life, will remain by the smoker until well past 11 a.m. the following day. Old Gold serves barbecue fresh off the cooker Wednesday-Sunday until the meat's all gone. By the time someone tucks into the first brisket sandwich out the order-up window, George is prepping for his next night of cooking.
When he's not tending the fire or smoking meats, George splits and stacks the cherry, Indiana white oak and Texas post oak logs he uses to achieve a masterful smoke balance on brisket, ribs, pulled pork and turkey breast.
George is the kind of obsessive, out-of-state cook you hope Indianapolis attracts as the metro area expands beyond the handful of chefs who have dominated the city's top restaurants for the past decade.
He's part of Austin-based Keller Restaurant Group, fronted by Lafayette native and former N.Y. Jets tight end Dustin Keller. The company plans three to five distinctive, one-off Indy restaurant concepts different from anything else here.
"Wait 'til they have one of my half-pound burgers stuffed with brisket, Monterey Jack and serrano," George says of specials he plans as Old Gold moves closer to occupying brick-and-mortar digs this year.
From there, the group intends a casual French-Vietnamese restaurant, possibly in Fountain Square, that might incorporate George's smoked brisket into pho or feature his green curry sausage among spring rolls and banh mí sandwiches.
"We decided on Indy because this feels very much like the beginning of a cool food scene. I thought, why not add something else to it," Keller partner Will Hong says.
Hong is a Southern Californian who grew up in his parents' diner business and ran Wolfgang Puck restaurants in Vegas. He was managing Austin restaurant Elizabeth Street Café by the city's top-notch McGuire Moorman Hospitality when he met Keller.
Keller, an Austin resident and Elizabeth Street regular, is a food enthusiast who has written restaurant reviews for the New York Times NFL blog Fifth Down. He also owns stake in McAlister's Deli and Dunkin' Donuts franchises. Ready to do something more creative back home in Indy's blossoming food scene, Keller found the right cohort in Hong.
"Every single time I would come into Elizabeth Street Café, he just made me feel, like, so at home," Keller says. "It just gave me that feel-good for the whole rest of the day. Whatever I had ahead of me, I got my moment of peace, my moment away, my perfect sanctuary, and that all started with Will."
Not just Hong but also his Elizabeth Street co-worker, Brittany Kobayashi, genuinely cared about customers, taking interest in their families, even photos of their kids, Keller recalls.
"And they didn't have truly a vested interest in that restaurant. That's just who they were," Keller says. "My wife and I knew at some point, if we had the opportunity to create something with these guys, we would love to do that."
Keller pitched Indianapolis to Hong, who was ready to move on from what he and Kobayashi say has become the expensive and restaurant-saturated Austin area. Hong suggested they start with an authentic, Texas-style barbecue restaurant in Indianapolis.
"It's kind of a meat-and-potatoes town, and barbecue is the best meat and potatoes," Hong says.
Hong and Kobayashi, originally from Las Vegas, had become friends, and Kobayashi's boyfriend, George, originally from Savannah, Ga., just happened to be a seasoned barbecue guy who worked under respected pitmasters Braun Hughes of Austin's famous Franklin Barbecue and Bill Dumas of the city's highly rated Stiles Switch BBQ & Brew.
George proved himself to a doubtful Keller by smoking meats for the ex-football-player and a bunch of his Texas-barbecue-aficionado friends. "He (George) was up for 15, 16 hours straight by himself cooking all this, and the next day...everybody was just blown away," Keller says.
Keller invited Kobayashi and George into Keller Restaurant Group, and the couple along with Hong set off to Indiana. "We went for it," Keller says.
As of late May, Hong, Kobayashi and George had a promising lead on a permanent Old Gold location. The business is named after Keller's Purdue alma mater colors. The restaurant will be casual, counter service, with smoked meats cut to order and served on brown-paper-lined sheet pans.
Expect signature Old Gold sides like smoked street corn, housemade smoked pickles and green chile macaroni and cheese that the business partners serve themselves from the food truck. They share shifts between other duties.
Kobayashi, who holds a degree in fine art photography, handles marketing. Hong is the numbers and inventory guy. George is all culinary, pushing out specials to keep setting Old Gold apart. Lately it's been cherry-smoked beef jerky and nachos smothered in chopped brisket and spicy queso.
"It's not about being a master," George says. "It's the struggle of trying to get there."

Crisp Creperie brings Seattle-born, French-inspired menu to Cape

Texto completo: Cape Coral just got an import from Seattle.
Crisp Creperie opened last month in Coralwood Shopping Center. That's about 3,200 miles southwest of where it started.
Classically trained in French cooking with a degree from Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts, Crisp's owner Debi Hernandez has a solid foundation in the kitchen. She's worked at Seattle's RN74, a hip modern French restaurant owned by celebrity chef Michael Mina, as well as Ray's Boathouse, a fine dining restaurant focused on Northwestern seafood. She's been running her own food truck in Seattle since 2012, parking at corporate headquarters of companies such as Amazon and Starbucks.
"We'd go there on a regular rotation," Hernandez said. "We've done many festivals at wineries like Chateau Ste. Michelle, plus Boeing, Microsoft and Google. We'd also cater corporate events."
The food truck scene in Seattle was "crazy busy," Hernandez said, with between 800 and 1,000 trucks offering their popular style of food to hungry grab-and-go diners.
"It was good for us. We loved it there," she said.
But the appeal of warmer weather and waterfront property called.
When Hernandez and her husband decided they'd had enough of Seattle rain, they set out to find a place with waterfront property under $1 million. A quick Google search turned up Cape Coral, and soon they were buying a house site-unseen and moving their life to Southwest Florida.
Once she got here, Hernandez set out to fulfill a long-held dream: owning her own brick-and-mortar restaurant. Crisp Creperie launched in late May, and between her Gulf-access home and the new eatery, Hernandez is living her best life.
With Crisp, she decided to stay with the theme that had made her food truck so unique in Seattle — crepes. Even with nearly 1,000 food trucks operating in the city, crepe trucks were a rare breed.
"There were hundreds of hotdogs sellers, Mexican trucks, falafel stands," Hernandez said, "but only two crepe trucks. So many people were doing things that were so common, I just thought that crepes were uncommon. They can be savory or sweet, they're extremely versatile, and they're just darn delicious."
Plus, there's something appealing about the way the classic French street food gets made.
"There's a certain charm to people watching you spin the crepes," Hernandez said, "and it was a good fit for a food truck because you're standing right in front of people."
Customer favorites include the classic French crepe made with black forest ham, a fried egg, mozzarella and bourbon maple syrup; the gourmet crepe with prosciutto, brie, sliced applies, apple butter and arugula; and the crepes Versailles with roasted chicken, Swiss cheese, mushrooms and asparagus.
The restaurant also does sweet crepes, and the most popular, the Blondie, features bananas, Bavarian cream, vanilla wafers, salted caramel and whipped cream. The restaurant sells beer and Chateau Ste. Michelle wine in a nod to its Seattle origins.
Now that she has her own restaurant, Hernandez sees the benefits of a brick-and-mortar place.
"People are loving the decor," she said, " and I love talking to people. On the food truck, people take their food and walk away. Here I can sit down with them."
The food truck hasn't retired, though. It's still around and will be available starting next month for weddings and corporate events.
And that waterfront home? It's working out great, Hernandez said, even if the couple hasn't had time to enjoy it yet.
"We figure once we're going we'll have time to go fishing," she said.

EPA chief accuses New York Times reporters of colluding with Sierra Club

Texto completo: Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler escalated a dust-up with the media Monday by accusing New York Times reporters of colluding with a major environmental group by retweeting a "made-up" quote of his.
“Makes me wonder if the two reporters for the New York Times were colluding with the Sierra Club," Wheeler said Wednesday, addressing the agency's Scientific Advisory Board.
He told the board's members to use "caution" and "to be careful what you read in the media" after the incident.
The controversy started when EPA slammed a reporter from Yahoo News on Tuesday, saying he made up a quote from a National Press Club address he gave on Monday. The story reported that Wheeler said the news media does a disservice by reporting on global warming.
EPA clarified that what Wheeler said Monday was: "The media does a disservice to the American public and sound policy-making by not informing the public of the progress this nation has made."
Wheeler called the Yahoo News story, which he said was then retweeted by two New York Times reporters, "made up." The EPA did not identify the specific reporters, but the climate reporters Kendra Pierre-Louis and Lisa Friedman retweeted the tweet in question.
Later, the Sierra Club used the story in a tweet of its own.
Wheeler told the science advisers to come to him directly if they have any questions about what they read in the media.

Texto completo: Yes or no: Do you favor impeaching President Donald Trump? That’s the question Democratic politicians around the country are being battered with – at town halls, in fundraisers, during TV interviews. Support for impeachment has been slowly rising among Democrats in Congress, within the large Democratic presidential field, and among the American people.
Now that retired special counsel Robert Mueller has spoken publicly about his Trump-Russia investigation, effectively leaving next steps to Congress, the question has gained fresh urgency.
But “impeachment, up or down” may not be the right question. Indeed, in responding to a president who defies subpoenas and whom a significant portion of Americans view as unfit for office, Congress is not facing a binary choice. The options are many, including another form of sanction for perceived wrongdoing: censure, a formal reprimand in the form of a majority resolution by one or both houses of Congress.
“It’s a symbolic gesture that would please no one, but it might be the best alternative,” says a Democratic strategist, speaking on background.
Unlike impeachment, which is the constitutional procedure for expelling a president before the end of his term, censure is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. But it’s an option – rarely used – that would at least convey moral outrage over certain presidential actions, for those who feel it. The Mueller report found no provable conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia in the 2016 election, but it detailed 10 examples of potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Democratic pollster Mark Penn, a critic of the Mueller investigation, agrees that “censure makes sense” – in part because holding such a vote against the president in the Democratic-controlled House would put “a lot of Republicans in a bind.” Mr. Trump enjoys 90 percent support among Republican voters, which makes it politically dangerous for GOP members to vote against him. So far, the only Republican in either chamber to come out in favor of impeachment is the libertarian-leaning Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan.
A House censure vote against Mr. Trump could hold some political peril for Democrats. As with impeachment, Mr. Trump could wear a censure resolution as a badge of honor. And the party’s liberal base would likely perceive it as a mere slap on the wrist in the face of what many Democrats see as egregious or even illegal presidential behavior. But would it lead them to stay home in the 2020 election? Mr. Penn is doubtful.
“It’s pretty unlikely activists will pass on an opportunity to vote against Trump,” the pollster says.
For now, though, debate among Democrats centers squarely on impeachment – or more precisely, whether to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The hope is that such an inquiry would unearth further evidence of presidential wrongdoing, either in matters related to the Mueller investigation or elsewhere, including Mr. Trump’s financial dealings.
In effect, a preliminary impeachment inquiry is already starting, though not in name. The warm-up act comes Monday, when former Nixon White House counsel John Dean testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on obstruction of justice, along with former U.S. attorneys and other legal experts. Mr. Dean was the star witness against President Richard Nixon in the 1973 Watergate hearings that eventually led to the 37th president’s resignation.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler has announced additional hearings in coming weeks that will focus on “other important aspects of the Mueller report.”
On another track, the full House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr and former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt for failing to deliver subpoenaed documents and, in Mr. McGahn’s case, for defying a subpoena to testify. The contempt resolution is expected to contain language that boosts Democrats’ efforts to obtain Trump tax returns.
So far, no key witnesses in the Trump-Russia inquiry, including Mr. Mueller himself, have agreed to testify in Congress. In a rare public statement last week, Mr. Mueller said “the report is my testimony.” But Democrats still want him to appear before Congress, if only to give voice to key points from his report, based on the assumption that few Americans will read the 448-page tome. Democrats have yet to subpoena Mr. Mueller.
Meanwhile, the list of House Democrats supporting an impeachment inquiry is growing – now at 59 (out of 235), according to a New York Times count. Among the two dozen Democrats running for president, 11 now support an inquiry. Overall public support for impeachment is also growing, though still not a majority. Mr. Penn’s latest Harvard-Harris poll shows support for impeachment and removal from office at 37 percent, up from 28 percent in April; support for “no action” is at 42 percent, and 20 percent favor censure. Among polled Democrats, 60 percent favor impeachment; among independents, it’s 36 percent.
Time is not on the pro-impeachment side, barring an explosive revelation. With each passing day, the November 2020 election takes up more oxygen and boosts the argument that the voters should decide Mr. Trump’s fate. Democrats are keenly aware that, based on what’s known, the Republican-controlled Senate would not come close to convicting and removing the president even if he were impeached by the House.
So the calendar, in effect, is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s friend, as she tries to fend off pro-impeachment forces within her caucus. Speaker Pelosi maintains impeachment is still on the table, but only in the event of a major new revelation.
Here the argument becomes circular: The likeliest path to explosive new information, if it exists, would come via a formal impeachment inquiry, congressional Democrats say. They believe it would boost their case in court as they seek access to grand jury testimony and documents underlying the Mueller report. But most House Democrats fear a formal House move toward impeachment could boost Mr. Trump politically, as it did President Bill Clinton in 1998.
“Right now, if the House impeached Trump, the Senate wouldn’t convict. That inoculates him,” says Rick Tyler, an anti-Trump Republican commentator. “He’ll say he was exonerated. He’ll say it was all a witch hunt.”
Centrist House Democrats are also advising caution.
“I think people now are just all about the contempt vote next week,” a leading House moderate told reporters on background Tuesday. “Hopefully that will let off enough steam to avoid the impeachment vote. I think people still think – like me – oversight, oversight, oversight, you know? And use the courts.”
Whether there’s potential for a modern-day John Dean to step forward is another question. Historian Ken Hughes has his doubts.
Mr. Dean had agreed to become a key witness in exchange for a lighter sentence, stemming from his involvement in the Watergate scandal. But “it’s not clear now that the Democrats in the House have that kind of leverage over any current members of the Trump administration,” says Mr. Hughes, a research specialist and expert on Watergate at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.
With former administration officials, there are major disincentives to cooperating with Congress. Some may be motivated by continuing loyalty to the president. There are also professional reasons to avoid testifying, Mr. Hughes says.
“Former Trump administration officials can fear being ostracized and fear losing job opportunities,” he says. “They can fear losing access to their former colleagues in the administration, which makes them less useful as lobbyists.”

Texto completo: The internet giveth, and the internet taketh away.
What it gives can, at times, be an instant sense of justice.
A few days ago, the world was shown a smartphone video of a manager at a Salt Lake fast food restaurant angrily telling a worker she had been fired. The son of the worker, an Hispanic woman with limited English skills, said he was trying to help his mother ask for a promised raise — one she was too shy to ask for herself.
In the video, the manager, a white woman barely able to control her rage, says, “You just got your mom fired.” Later she yells at the woman and her children to get out of the restaurant. “Your niño and niña no bueno,” she says in broken Spanish.
Soon after, CoreLife restaurant officials held a press conference to say the manager had been fired. This came after talking with witnesses about the incident, they said.
Instant justice can be satisfying. Managers should not treat employees that way. Still, we can’t escape the reality that we don’t know what happened right before the smartphone camera was turned on.
What the internet takes, on the other hand, is a sense of shared human imperfection, replacing it with instant judgment and a desire to lecture rather than lift. People are quickly rendered bad or good.
Take the case of Craig Brooks, a Holiday Inn Express worker in Austin, Texas. He turned on his phone to record himself calmly telling a customer he couldn’t give her a room because he, an African American, overheard her describing him using a racial slur. According to Buzzfeed, the woman reportedly used the slur while on the phone with him trying to make a reservation, after he told her to call the hotel’s automated reservation service.
He spoke with upper management after the phone call and was told to deny the woman service.
At first, the internet applauded the calm and dignified way he handled the situation after the woman entered the hotel to confront him. But then, someone dug into his Twitter account and found he had tweeted offensive, stereotypical comments about transgender people.
The tide turned quickly. Eventually, he issued an apology, promising to change his behavior. But did he really experience a change of heart or just do what he felt the internet expected him to do?
David Brooks of the New York Times wrote recently that “the nation’s culture is now enmeshed in a new technology that we don’t yet know how to control.” In this culture, he said, “stereotype is more salient than persons,” and “a single moment is more important than a life story.”
Sometimes, that single moment really is worthy of public condemnation and severe consequences. Without the internet, social media and ubiquitous video cameras, abusive and demeaning restaurant managers wouldn’t be called to account. Without the internet, the officer who arrested University of Utah nurse Alex Wubbels two years ago probably would have gone unpunished, lost in a "he said, she said" stalemate judged by people who didn’t actually see what happened.
But without the internet and all those cameras, American culture also wouldn’t be littered with the fractured lives of people who were dragged into the spotlight and battered against their will — people like “Alex from Target,” a young man who became a national sensation five years ago when a girl secretly snapped a picture of him working at the store and made it go viral.
Without the internet, a young student at Woods Cross High School wouldn’t have found herself in an abusive nationwide Twitter storm last year because she wore a Chinese dress to her prom.
People may walk more gingerly when they are aware that some camera, somewhere, is most likely recording their every move, and yet a culture loses something precious when the single moments lead to final judgments.
In the end, it isn’t the internet that gives and takes away; it’s us. The internet just makes our propensity for snap judgments louder and more powerful.
When it strikes at legitimate injustices, it is marvelously efficient and satisfying. But its aim is unsteady, its mechanism often is half cocked and everyone, it seems, is loaded and ready.

On YouTube, an open gate for pedophiles

Texto completo: Christiane C. didn't think anything of it when her 10-year-old daughter and a friend uploaded a video of themselves playing in a backyard pool.
"The video is innocent, it's not a big deal," said Christiane, who lives in a Rio de Janeiro suburb.
A few days later, her daughter shared exciting news: The video had thousands of views. Before long, it had ticked up to 400,000 - a staggering number for a video of a child in a two-piece bathing suit with her friend.
"I saw the video again and I got scared by the number of views," Christiane said.
She had reason to be.
YouTube's automated recommendation system - which drives most of the platform's billions of views by suggesting what users should watch next - had begun showing the video to users who watched other videos of prepubescent, partially clothed children, a team of researchers has found.
YouTube had curated the videos from across its archives, at times plucking out the otherwise innocuous home movies of unwitting families, the researchers say. In many cases, its algorithm referred users to the videos after they watched sexually themed content.
The result was a catalog of videos that experts say sexualizes children.
"It's YouTube's algorithm that connects these channels," said Jonas Kaiser, one of three researchers at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society who stumbled onto the videos while looking into YouTube's impact in Brazil. "That's the scary thing."
The video of Christiane's daughter was promoted by YouTube's systems months after the company was alerted that it had a pedophile problem. In February, Wired and other news outlets reported that predators were using the comment section of YouTube videos with children to guide other pedophiles.
That month, calling the problem "deeply concerning," YouTube disabled comments on many videos with children in them.
But the recommendation system, which remains in place, has gathered dozens of such videos into a new and easily viewable repository, and pushed them out to a vast audience.
YouTube never set out to serve users with sexual interests in children - but in the end, Kaiser said, its automated system managed to keep them watching with recommendations that he called "disturbingly on point."
Users do not need to look for videos of children to end up watching them. The platform can lead them there through a progression of recommendations.
So a user who watches erotic videos might be recommended videos of women who become conspicuously younger, and then women who pose provocatively in children's clothes. Eventually, some users might be presented with videos of girls as young as 5 or 6 wearing bathing suits, or getting dressed or doing a split.
On its own, each video might be perfectly innocent, a home movie, say, made by a child. Any revealing frames are fleeting and appear accidental. But, grouped together, their shared features become unmistakable.
"I'm really scared of it," said Christiane. "Scared of the fact that a video like this fell into such a category." The New York Times is withholding the family's surname to protect its privacy.
When The Times alerted YouTube that its system was circulating family videos to people seemingly motivated by sexual interest in children, the company removed several but left up many others, including some apparently uploaded by fake accounts.
The recommendation system itself also immediately changed, no longer linking some of the revealing videos together. YouTube said this was probably a result of routine tweaks to its algorithms, rather than a deliberate policy change.
Jennifer O'Connor, YouTube's product director for trust and safety, said the company was committed to eradicating the exploitation of children on its platform and had worked nonstop since February on improving enforcement. "Protecting kids is at the top of our list," she said.
But YouTube has not put in place the one change that researchers say would prevent this from happening again: turning off its recommendation system on videos of children, though the platform can identify such videos automatically. The company said that because recommendations are the biggest traffic driver, removing them would hurt "creators" who rely on those clicks. It did say it would limit recommendations on videos that it deems as putting children at risk.

Texto completo: And that's a wrap.
"Jeopardy!" contestant James Holzhauer lost on Monday, ending his 33-day run on the game show, during which he took home a total of $2,464,216, including $2,000 for his second-place finish to new champ Emma Boettcher. He came up just $56,484 shy of besting the all-time record set by Ken Jennings for nontournament play.
"Nobody likes to lose," Holzhauer said in an interview with the New York Times published Monday. "But I'm very proud of how I did, and I really exceeded my own expectations for the show. So I don't feel bad about it."
"Jeopardy!" airs mostly in evening timeslots, but ran in a few cities earlier Monday, including Little Rock, Arkansas; Meridian, Mississippi; and Jackson, Tennessee.
Holzhauer, 34, made a splash during his winning streak on the show by taking the board by storm, going for the highest-dollar questions first and hunting for Daily Doubles. Then, he bet big. The professional sports gambler from Las Vegas explained to the Times that his huge advantage on the trivia show was that he wasn't afraid to risk his winnings.
"The fact that I win and lose money all the time helps desensitize me, so I can write down $60,000 as the Final Jeopardy wager and not be trembling at the thought of losing that money," he said.
Except on Monday, when he didn't. Holzhauer, along with his two rivals, gave the correct response ("Who is Marlowe"?) to the clue: The line "A great reckoning in a little room" in "As You Like It" is usually taken to refer to this author's premature death. But with $23,400 going into the round, he wagered only $1,399, an unusually "modest" bet, as host Alex Trebek termed it.
Boettcher, who led going into the round, bet big and finished the victor.
During his nearly seven-week run on the show, Holzhauer crossed the $1million mark on Day 15 and the $2million mark on Day 27, becoming only the second person in the game show's 35-year history (excluding an earlier NBC version) to reach the feat in regular-season play. He first appeared on April4, and was absent only for a two-week Teachers Tournament that aired in mid-May. But his final episodes were taped in early April.
He also playfully teased early word of his exit on Twitter, with a reference to the "Drake Curse," a reference to the singer as bad-luck omen: "Knew I shouldn't have invited @Drake to the @Jeopardy taping."
Computer programmer-turned-author Jennings made off with $2,520,700 over 74 games in 2004, one year after the show stopped limiting champions to five-day reigns and allowed them to compete until they lost.
Holzhauer's financial haul is even more impressive given the pace of his winnings. He holds the top 15 daily money totals, including the one-day record of $131,127 set April 17. Jennings averaged $34,064 during his 74-game run.

Texto completo: The New Jersey house in which fictional Mafia boss Tony Soprano and his family lived during the hit show that began 20 years ago is up for sale - with a hefty surcharge based on its television history.
Comparable homes in the North Caldwell neighborhood typically go for between $1.5 million and $2 million. But for the chance to use the same driveway that Tony Soprano, clad in his dressing gown, walked down to pick up his newspaper under the watchful eye of the FBI will cost $3.4 million.
Victor and Patti Recchia, owners of the house, which they built in 1987 and have lived in since, have set the ambitious starting price and asked for those interested to email them via sopranoshouseforsale@gmail.com by June 21.
The 5,600-square-foot home includes 1.5-acres, four bedrooms, four full bathrooms, a powder room, two two-car garages and a detached one-bedroom guesthouse. Although there have been updates, the house retains the ostentatious Italianate character depicted in the show. Property taxes are $34,005 a year.
"Those things can be quantified," Victor Recchia, 65, a property developer, told the New York Times, “but I don’t think you can quantify the intrinsic value of this home."

The couple's property was used between 30 and 50 times during the show's six-season run, which ended in 2007 with an 86th-episode cliffhanger that is still hotly debated by aficionados.
While the home was the set for the show's pilot episode, filming was then moved to a set in Manhattan, though the exterior was used for the duration. While there were numerous marital and family arguments in the house, Tony's murders and serial unfaithfulness took place in other locations.
Fans of "The Sopranos" often turn to take pictures. “We’ve met a lot of great people," Victor said. When actor James Gandolfini, who played Tony, died suddenly in Rome in 2013 at the age of 51, fans left flowers, candles and dried ziti by the curb.

Texto completo: The media’s recent coverage of abortion legislation is pretty one-sided.
Bills dramatically restricting abortion get breathless, nonstop coverage, while radical pro-choice bills quietly slip under the radar. A search of three major outlets, using the Nexis service, puts this distinction in clear relief.
For example, the New York Times ran three times more articles focusing on the Georgia heartbeat bill than on New York’s own Reproductive Health Act, which decriminalized third-trimester abortions. If we look at all articles that even mentioned the laws, the supposedly New York publication covered the Georgia bill about twice as much as the New York bill.
Yes, outlawing nearly all abortions puts Georgia at the far end of the spectrum in this country. But in the same way, legalizing abortion until the moment before delivery puts New York at the far end of abortion law in the world.
Other mainstream media outlets show similar trends. The Associated Press ran four times more articles focusing on the Georgia bill and three times more articles mentioning it. The Washington Post ran twice as many articles focusing on the Georgia bill and nearly three times more articles mentioning it.
Chart
On a smaller scale, the same thing happened with two other states last week.
On Thursday, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed a pro-life heartbeat bill into law, and both houses of the Illinois legislature passed a radical pro-choice bill last week. But if you follow mainstream media outlets, you were far more likely to hear about the Louisiana bill.
In covering these two bills, the AP published five times more articles mentioning the Louisiana bill, and The New York Times published nine times more articles covering the Louisiana bill.
When covering pro-life legislation, these outlets have clearly spelled out the legislated abortion restrictions in an effort to paint pro-life policy as radical. However, in the sparse coverage they’ve given to the pro-choice bills, these outlets have provided very few details, if any. For example, in its only article to even mention the Illinois abortion bill, The New York Times simply said the bill “would protect abortion rights” and provided no further details.
Similarly, the Associated Press said the bill would “bolster the right to abortion.”
Both outlets failed to specify that the bill would allow third trimester abortions, including partial-birth abortions, and repeal conscience protections for doctors, nurses, and Catholic hospitals who do not want to perform these inhumane procedures.
Maybe the editors at these outlets know these liberal policies are wildly unpopular. A 2019 Marist poll found that 3 in 4 Americans want “substantial abortion restrictions,” and in a 2019 Harvard poll, only 8% of respondents supported allowing third-trimester abortions nationwide.

Everest has long been a deadly place

Texto completo: "The plain truth," the author Jon Krakauer wrote, "is that I knew better, but went to Everest anyway."
It was 1996. Krakauer, a correspondent for Outside magazine, was to hike to Mount Everest's base camp and write a story for the publication. Instead, he met the guides who helped pioneer the commercial climbing business on the world's highest peak, and convinced the magazine to let him climb to the top. His editors obliged.
By the end of his trip, eight climbers had died during a storm. At the time, it was the deadliest attempted ascent on the mountain. Eleven people have died on Everest this year, due in large part to the vast contingent of unqualified and unguided alpinists who now flock to the mountain during climbing season, the very phenomenon Krakauer went to document.
Three years before his trip, life on Everest changed, but to understand that, you have to understand the mountain's history.
British climbers made early attempts to reach the peak on the northern side of the summit in Tibet in the early 20th century. George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were spotted within hundreds of feet of the top in 1924, but the two never returned to camp to relay whether they'd made it. Mallory's body was found in 1999. Irvine's remains missing.
Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay made the first official ascent in 1953 on the mountain's southern side, in Nepal. The first Americans summited in 1963.
But amid the Cold War, access to the mountain was severely restricted. China closed the Tibetan portion of Everest from 1950 to 1980. Nepal for years did not allow foreigners into the country to climb Everest unless they were accompanied by scientists, and when it finally opened its border in 1985, it issued one Everest permit per season per route.
By the 1990s, international tensions had eased and more qualified alpinists began showing up at the mountain, hoping to gain access to climb.
"Everest, you could always get a permit, but you had to be sponsored by your country's climbing agency," said Todd Burleson, founder and president of guide service Alpine Ascents International. He's led two guided journeys to Everest's summit, and said aspiring climbers used to wait several years until their turn for a permit arrived.
"Up until about 1990, you'd take a group of the best climbers from your country to Everest and if one of those climbers got to the top, you were a national success," he said. "But during the '90s we learned a lot, and there were a lot of people who couldn't get on those groups who were very skilled. And then we started bringing them to the mountain."
Sensing opportunities for revenue and fresh off an economic modernization, China began granting more permits. Then Nepal liberalized the permitting process to keep up. Where fewer than 2,000 people attempted to climb the mountain in the 1980s, according to the Himalayan Database, nearly 4,000 have tried each of the past two decades.
"In 1993 the world changed completely," said Eric Simonson, director at International Mountain Guides and a multiple-time Everest summiteer.
Guiding agencies like Adventure Consultants and Mountain Madness, the subjects of Krakauer's 1997 book "Into Thin Air," began leading trips up Everest. Local Sherpas, who experienced mountaineers say are excellent climbers but sometimes unqualified guides, established companies that offered trips at less than half the cost, but not every agency did a thorough vetting of clients to see if they were physically capable of scaling Everest.
And so crowds arrived at the mountain as the services at base camp improved, aided by technology and more precise weather tracking that allowed climbers to reach the peak in more predictably safe conditions.
But the cluster of people on the mountain is dangerous, too, sometimes preventing swift evacuations and cramming climbers together on perilous slopes.
By 1996, one of the world's most remote locales was becoming a tourist attraction. Krakauer, an avid climber, arrived to tell that story.
He summited the mountain on May 10, then returned to a forward base camp. As he descended, the weather turned, and dozens of climbers from three groups were stuck in a traffic jam and exposed to a hurricane-strength storm. So many climbers assaulted the summit at once - even after delays in securing ropes along the treacherous "death zone" some 26,000 feet in the air - they couldn't turn around in a timely fashion and retreat for cover.
Eight climbers died, including three guides.
"The commercialized trips and the overcrowding were what caused the tragedy (in 1996)," Hillary, who died in 2008, told Time magazine in 2003. "It was inevitable. I've been forecasting a disaster of that nature for some time. And it will happen again."
Krakauer wrote a 17,000-word article about the tragedy for Outside, then turned it into a book that made The New York Times bestseller list and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Sony bought its film rights nearly immediately after publication, and it was adapted into a TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest") in 1997, and a feature film ("Everest") in 2015.
(Krakauer has criticized the 2015 movie for departing from actual events on the mountain. He told the Los Angeles Times it was "total bull." Director Baltasar Kormakur responded that his script was not based on the book.)
"I walked off of that mountain," said Burleson, who was awarded the American Alpine Club's most prestigious honor for his part in the 1996 rescue effort, "and I had phone calls from all over the world asking, 'Can I climb Everest? Can I climb Everest?' Before that, there were only a few of us and we knew what we were doing. But now everybody wanted to do it."
The new demand for Everest expeditions outpaced the supply, especially from the mostly Western guide agencies that had offered such services, said Alan Arnette, an Everest expert, summit coach and blogger.
Those firms typically took small groups, often no more than 10 clients, and brought along up to four guides with several more Sherpas, who help fasten ropes and haul gear. Since acclimatizing to Everest's elevation can take days, and the climbing is slow going, the average Everest quest takes close to two months and costs around $70,000.
Other guide agencies began leading larger trips at lower prices without requiring climbers to have certain requisite experience, experts say, and the mountain got even more crowded. And as more underqualified adventurers attempt to summit the peak, Everest was normalized as a tourist destination.
"If you have the money, you can go," Burleson said.

FLAWED PROCESS MUELLER'S PUBLIC REMARKS OFFERED NO CLARITY

Texto completo: Republicans insist that former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation cleared President Donald Trump of wrongdoing, while Democrats maintain the opposite.
If Americans are confused, little wonder. Mr. Mueller is a good public servant, but the process he followed was awful. His 10-minute news conference last week provided no clarity for the public but gave the party partisans more grist for their PR machines.
Should there be future need for a special counsel on any federal matter, the investigation must be conducted in a reasonable time frame that everyone knows in advance. Just as important, the American public must be told up front what the limitations and possible outcomes will be.
The public waited two years for the former FBI director to issue a report on his investigation into whether Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. That was too long a wait, especially when much of the government's energy and attention during this period were consumed by investigation-watching and the related parlor game of speculating on the outcome.
Mr. Mueller's report, issued in April, concluded that there was no collusion.
The report also addressed the question of whether Mr. Trump obstructed the investigation. For example, Mr. Trump suggested that FBI Director James Comey let National Security Adviser Michael Flynn off the hook after he had been caught lying about his Russian contacts. He ultimately fired Mr. Comey after saying he was displeased with how he handled questions about Russian interference in the election and urged subordinates to fire Mr. Mueller as well.
While Mr. Trump said and did things that looked bad - in some cases perhaps because he didn't understand the limits of his authority or how the Justice Department operated - the report noted that people inside the president's inner circle, such as former White House Counsel Don McGahn, failed to follow through on orders that would have derailed the investigation. In the end, Mr. Mueller's report neither accused the president of obstruction nor exonerated him.
That was enough for Trump partisans to spin the story one way and the president's haters to spin it another.
Only late in the process did much of the public come to understand that Mr. Mueller wouldn't have filed a charge even if the evidence warranted one. The reason: a Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president. That left many people - those without skin in the game -wondering about the point of the whole exercise.
The public expected a "yes, he did wrong," or "no, he didn't" and the lack of clarity was unsettling to all but the partisan spinmeisters. It's highly unusual for the federal government ever to comment on matters that don't result in charges. The reason is to spare the reputation of a person never formally accused.
Breaking two years of silence, Mr. Mueller decided to say a few words as he wrapped up his work. His lawyerly dissection of the report - "if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so" - provided no additional clarity, just more words for the partisan hacks to mine to their advantage.
Mr. Mueller was right when he said the report really should speak for itself. But the report would have meant more if the parameters and limits of the investigation were spelled out clearly in the beginning.

The media, including, I regret to say, The New York Times, have slipped into the habit of referring to people like Clarence Thomas, the justices who often vote with him, the Senate majority leader and those he leads, and journalists like Sean Hannity as "conservatives."
Of course they have nothing to do with conservatism as it has been known in the life of our country. True conservatives share the mind and temperament of Edmund Burke. They are men and women like Dwight D. Eisenhower, John Marshall Harlan, Sandra Day O'Connor, Bob Dole, Howard Baker and many more.
Those who today are called conservatives for ease of reference are nothing of the sort. The historical and correct term is reactionaries.

Texto completo: SEOUL, South Korea - Kim Yong Chol, a former North Korean spy master and vice chairman of its ruling Workers' Party, had been the country's most internationally visible diplomat in the past year.
He visited the White House twice and led negotiations for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's two summit meetings with President Donald Trump.
Now, he has suddenly become the latest example of how a senior North Korean official's political fortune is made or broken at the whims of Kim Jong Un.
Last week, leading South Korean newspapers reported Kim Yong Choi's fall from grace. One of them, the conservative daily Chosun Ilbo, went so far as to report that Kim had been banished to forced labor, with many of his negotiating team members either executed or sent to prison camps.
South Korean officials and analysts cautioned that it was too early to say with precision what was happening inside Kim Jong Un's opaque regime.
South Korean news media offered differing conjectures, including whether Kim Hyok Choi, the North's special nuclear envoy to the United States, had been executed by firing squad in March, as the Chosun Ilbo reported, or was still under interrogation.
But they all agree on one thing: Kim Yong Chol and his negotiating team, which had driven Kim Jong Un's diplomatic outreach toward Washington, have been sidelined, as the North Korean leader sought a scapegoat to blame for his disastrous second summit meeting with Trump, held in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February.
Kim Yong Chol, 73, and his senior team members - including the special envoy Kim Hyok Chol and Kim Song Hye, both of whom accompanied Kim Yong Chol when he visited Trump in the Oval Office in January - have largely disappeared from the North's state-run news media since the Hanoi summit ended abruptly without a deal.
Kim Yong Chol's negotiating counterpart on the U.S. side had been Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and their relationship had been frosty.
Pompeo, asked at a news conference in Berlin on Friday about the report that Kim Yong Chol had been purged, said U.S. officials were looking into it.
"We've seen the reporting to which you're referring," he said. "We're doing our best to check it out. I don't have anything else to add to that today."
Kim Yong Chol's political undoing came in the second Kim-Trump summit in Hanoi, from which Kim Jong Un returned home without badly needed relief from U.S. sanctions. The outcome was seen as a major humiliation for Kim Jong Un.
Analysts theorized that Kim Yong Chol and other North Korean negotiators mistakenly believed that Trump, eager for something he could tout as a diplomatic achievement, would settle for sanctions relief in return for a partial dismantlement of the North's nuclear weapons facilities. But Trump demanded a full rollback of the North's program, and the talks collapsed.
"Someone had to take the blame for the loss of face of the supreme leader, and an obvious scapegoat was Kim Yong Chol and his team," said Cheon Seong Whun of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.

Cal Thomas: Trump gets no credit where credit is due

Texto completo: The quote is attributed to President Harry Truman, and Ronald Reagan kept it on his desk: “It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.”
It is even more amazing what has been accomplished with the American economy, but Democratic presidential candidates, the media and economists such as Paul Krugman of The New York Times refuse to give President Trump any credit. Recall that it was Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner, who predicted that Trump’s election would trigger “a global recession.” One continues to wait in vain for an “I was wrong” statement from him.
The Economist, a center-left British magazine that includes coverage of events in the U.S. and is no fan of the Trump administration, recently published a remarkable editorial that contains gems Republicans should quote between now and the next election. They include a strong rebuke to the contention of many Democrats that “working people” are still struggling and that the improved economy continues to benefit only the wealthiest 1 percent.
The bleak picture painted by Democrats, the editorial says, “is at odds with reality.” The Economist refers to a worldwide “jobs boom” and (note to Bernie Sanders and others promoting socialism) asserts that, “Capitalism is improving workers’ lot faster than it has in years … the zeitgeist has lost touch with the data.”
Noting that U.S. unemployment at 3.6 percent is the lowest in 50 years, the magazine says, “Less appreciated is the abundance of jobs across most of the rich world.”
A more educated population, the matching by websites of jobs to qualified applicants, and, yes, economic stimulus efforts that helped fuel the emergence of economies from the last recession have all contributed to the American economy and many European economies.
Then there is this, which has been the gospel of conservatives for decades when it comes to welfare and its disincentive for many to find work: “… reforms to welfare programs, both to make them less generous and to toughen eligibility tests, seem to have encouraged people to seek work.”
This has forced liberal politicians to shift their focus from the unemployed to the “quality” of jobs. British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is quoted as saying, “Our jobs market is being turned into a sea of insecurity.”
“Reality begs to differ,” says The Economist. “Official projections” predict that by 2026, “America will have more at-home careers than secretaries.” Jobs and the skills necessary to fill them are changing, but not so rapidly that workers — and especially younger people — cannot adjust their education and training to match the new requirements.
Wages are rising almost everywhere, and, as the editorial says, tight labor markets “lead firms to fish for employees in neglected pools, including among ex-convicts. … American wonks fretted for years about how to shrink the disability-benefit rolls. Now the hot labor market is doing it for them.”
This is the argument that conservatives, many Republicans and the Trump administration have been making for some time. Economic growth, not government, raises most boats.
While acknowledging “The jobs boom will not last forever” and that a recession will eventually “kill it off,” the editorial concludes that the economic boom “deserves a little appreciation.”
It deserves more than that and would be more than appreciated if it all happened under a Democratic president. Republicans and the Trump administration should seize on this reality and promote it every day, asking voters if they want to continue with these successful policies or return to low economic growth and fewer jobs.
It is a question Democrats and their policies of higher taxes and reimposed regulations will find difficult, if not impossible, to answer.

Is your insurance policy good enough? Here's a checklist to review

Texto completo: Summer’s here! Barbecues. Burgers and beer. It's a good time to review your insurance coverage. If an out-of-control cookout cooks your castle, are you prepared?
Household losses
Folks commonly see insurance as a once-and-done purchase. Renters buy policies to meet landlord requirements, auto-renew and forget it. Income stretched homeowners often buy bare-bones policies to satisfy the bank while minimizing premiums. But “required” is often inadequate.
Old coverage may not suffice now. Have you updated your policy to cover the increased worth of your possessions?
Renters’ insurance covers either depreciated cash value or replacement cost, which is pricier coverage. Depreciated value means that if you bought your sofa 10 years ago, you would get reimbursed for its current value. Replacement cost means that you would get money for a new sofa.
State Farm says average renters have $35,000 worth of stuff that their policies won’t cover. Does that describe your policy? Bankrate, a financial website, helps estimate how much renters insurance you really need.
To document your stuff's value try Encircle, a free app. It works room-by-room storing photos and details like value, quantity, purchase date and relevant warranties.
Renters' policy costs vary significantly by state. ValuePenguin, a personal finance website, lists average monthly costs per state.

Natural disasters happen
If you’re outside California, don’t think you’re earthquake safe. Quakes span much of the west. Similarly, flood insurance is an obvious buy for folks along the Gulf Coast, eastern seaboard and major rivers. But according to FEMA, low-risk areas generate over 20% of National Flood Insurance Program claims – and about one-third of flood-related federal disaster assistance. In 2017, the average paid flood insurance claim was about $92,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute and FEMA. . Could you handle that? Flood risks can change, too, from changed community development. Go to FEMA’s website to find your flood map to see what coverage you need. In Washington state, where I live, landslides are astoundingly common. Disasters are everywhere.
Even in disaster-free areas, you may be unprepared for the worst. Most policies cover damage from hail, fire, wind and tornadoes. But basic policies exclude most mold. Some insurers offer extra mold riders. But it costs a bit more. So does extending coverage for sewer backups. Many skip these riders. If you're ankle-deep in sewage, the last thing you want to hear is it isn’t covered.
You're sued and . . .
Most critically, make sure you’re protected from personal liability. Homeowners insurance includes lawsuit coverage. But it’s usually bare-bones. If someone suffers a catastrophic injury on your property, you can be liable for their lost income, medical bills, personal damages and trumped up trauma. Costs can mushroom, exhausting your coverage – leaving you stuck for big bucks.
Umbrella policies can protect you, adding a million dollars, even more, in extra liability coverage – protecting you from having to sell your home or other assets.
Homeowners’ policies usually provide liability protection up to $100,000. If an injured guest sues you for $350,000 in medical bills, lost wages and more – you may be fried. The Insurance Information Institute has a great site to learn what policies cover and what they don’t.
A middle-class family’s umbrella policies should roughly equal their net worth. NerdWallet has a great net worth calculator to approximate that.
Ultimately how much insurance you buy comes down to how much risk you readily endure. I was always comfortable self-insuring many things. But I’m lucky. Are you feeling lucky?

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - More than a dozen Democratic presidential hopefuls flocked to California on Saturday for the chance to make their cases to thousands of activists in the nation's largest liberal stronghold during a three-day gathering of the state party.
California's own Sen. Kamala Harris looked to make a show of force in the prime first speaking slot to kick off the day's main event, and her campaign even emblazoned the official convention lanyards with her name. But it was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who electrified the crowd the most among the early morning speakers, bringing the Democratic Party's most faithful voters to their feet repeatedly.
"Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses," Warren said in a thinly veiled shot at former Vice President Joe Biden, who has expressed hope the GOP will have "an epiphany" after President Donald Trump is gone. "But our country is in a crisis. The time for small ideas is over."
Biden was the only major candidate not attending the weekend gathering, opting instead to campaign in Ohio.
Harris has a deep connection to California voters; she has won statewide office three times, once to the U.S. Senate and twice as the state's attorney general. Before that, she was elected as San Francisco's district attorney. In her remarks, she reminded the crowd of their long history together, then brought the crowd to its feet with her call for impeachment hearings for Trump.
"We need to begin impeachment proceedings and we need a new commander in chief!" she declared.
Acting Pentagon chief slams China's tech policy in speech
SINGAPORE - U.S. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Saturday denounced China's efforts to steal technology from other nations and militarize man-made outposts in the South China Sea as a "tool kit of coercion," saying activities by Beijing the U.S. perceives as hostile must end.
In his first major speech on the international stage, Shanahan mixed sharp criticism of China and warnings of North Korea's "extraordinary" threat with vows that the U.S. will remain strongly committed to the Indo-Pacific region and is ready to invest billions of dollars in securing its stability.
While he didn't specifically name China in early parts of his speech, he made clear who his target was, making pointed references to Beijing's campaign to put advanced weapons systems on disputed islands in the region.
Justice Department preparing to investigate Google practices
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports.
The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.
Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company's search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Officials: 79 people injured in blast at Russia explosives plant
MOSCOW - Russia's health ministry says 79 people have been injured in an explosion in a plant manufacturing TNT.
The blast took place Saturday in Dzerzhinsk, 250 miles east of Moscow. An investigation is underway but the cause of the blast has not been determined.
The ministry said 38 employees at the plant and 41 local residents sought treatment after the blast. It said 15 were hospitalized, one in serious condition.
The blast broke windows in about 180 residential buildings near the plant, the state news agency Tass reported.
Dmitry Krasnov, deputy governor of the region that includes Dzerzhinsk, said earlier on state TV that two people were missing in the blast, but later said that information had not been confirmed.
Judge orders captain arrested in Danube sinking
BUDAPEST, Hungary - A Hungarian judge on Saturday ordered the formal arrest of a captain whose Viking river cruise ship collided with a sightseeing boat on the Danube River, sinking the tourist boat and leaving seven South Koreans dead and 21 people missing.
Authorities said water levels in Budapest are expected to fall quickly in the coming days, helping efforts to salvage the wreckage that may still contain victims' bodies.
The judge ordered the 64-year-old Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn cruise ship formally arrested for 30 days. He said the captain could be released on bail - subject to him wearing a tracking device and remaining in Budapest - but prosecutors are appealing that decision.
Divers so far have been unable to even approach the wreckage.
In speech to leaders, Saudi king slams Iranian attacks
MECCA, Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia's King Salman slammed Iran over recent attacks targeting the kingdom, describing the incidents on Saturday in a speech before Muslim leaders gathered in Mecca as "terrorist acts" that threaten global energy supplies.
It was the monarch's strongest words yet since tensions spiked in recent weeks between the two regional heavyweights.
Iran had a representative present at the 57-nation summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, but its top leadership did not attend.
The Islamic summit drew political figures and heads of state from countries spanning Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
They come with widely varying policies and priorities, but share a common reverence for the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem.
Lunch with Buffett: An anonymous bidder has offered more than $4.5 million to have a private lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett, shattering the previous record of nearly $3.5 million. An online auction that raises money for the Glide Foundation's work to help the homeless in San Francisco ended Friday night with a winning bid of $4,567,888. It's the 20th year the Berkshire Hathaway CEO has participated in the pricey lunch auction, giving the winner the chance to talk with the renowned investor and philanthropist. Bidding starts at $25,000. Buffett has raised nearly $30 million for the charity over the years. The winning bidder and up to seven friends get to dine with Buffett.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - More than a dozen Democratic presidential hopefuls flocked to California on Saturday for the chance to make their cases to thousands of activists in the nation's largest liberal stronghold during a three-day gathering of the state party.
California's own Sen. Kamala Harris looked to make a show of force in the prime first speaking slot to kick off the day's main event, and her campaign even emblazoned the official convention lanyards with her name. But it was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who electrified the crowd the most among the early morning speakers, bringing the Democratic Party's most faithful voters to their feet repeatedly.
"Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses," Warren said in a thinly veiled shot at former Vice President Joe Biden, who has expressed hope the GOP will have "an epiphany" after President Donald Trump is gone. "But our country is in a crisis. The time for small ideas is over."
Biden was the only major candidate not attending the weekend gathering, opting instead to campaign in Ohio.
Harris has a deep connection to California voters; she has won statewide office three times, once to the U.S. Senate and twice as the state's attorney general. Before that, she was elected as San Francisco's district attorney. In her remarks, she reminded the crowd of their long history together, then brought the crowd to its feet with her call for impeachment hearings for Trump.
"We need to begin impeachment proceedings and we need a new commander in chief!" she declared.
Acting Pentagon chief slams China's tech policy in speech
SINGAPORE - U.S. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Saturday denounced China's efforts to steal technology from other nations and militarize man-made outposts in the South China Sea as a "tool kit of coercion," saying activities by Beijing the U.S. perceives as hostile must end.
In his first major speech on the international stage, Shanahan mixed sharp criticism of China and warnings of North Korea's "extraordinary" threat with vows that the U.S. will remain strongly committed to the Indo-Pacific region and is ready to invest billions of dollars in securing its stability.
While he didn't specifically name China in early parts of his speech, he made clear who his target was, making pointed references to Beijing's campaign to put advanced weapons systems on disputed islands in the region.
Justice Department preparing to investigate Google practices
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports.
The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.
Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company's search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Officials: 79 people injured in blast at Russia explosives plant
MOSCOW - Russia's health ministry says 79 people have been injured in an explosion in a plant manufacturing TNT.
The blast took place Saturday in Dzerzhinsk, 250 miles east of Moscow. An investigation is underway but the cause of the blast has not been determined.
The ministry said 38 employees at the plant and 41 local residents sought treatment after the blast. It said 15 were hospitalized, one in serious condition.
The blast broke windows in about 180 residential buildings near the plant, the state news agency Tass reported.
Dmitry Krasnov, deputy governor of the region that includes Dzerzhinsk, said earlier on state TV that two people were missing in the blast, but later said that information had not been confirmed.
Judge orders captain arrested in Danube sinking
BUDAPEST, Hungary - A Hungarian judge on Saturday ordered the formal arrest of a captain whose Viking river cruise ship collided with a sightseeing boat on the Danube River, sinking the tourist boat and leaving seven South Koreans dead and 21 people missing.
Authorities said water levels in Budapest are expected to fall quickly in the coming days, helping efforts to salvage the wreckage that may still contain victims' bodies.
The judge ordered the 64-year-old Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn cruise ship formally arrested for 30 days. He said the captain could be released on bail - subject to him wearing a tracking device and remaining in Budapest - but prosecutors are appealing that decision.
Divers so far have been unable to even approach the wreckage.
In speech to leaders, Saudi king slams Iranian attacks
MECCA, Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia's King Salman slammed Iran over recent attacks targeting the kingdom, describing the incidents on Saturday in a speech before Muslim leaders gathered in Mecca as "terrorist acts" that threaten global energy supplies.
It was the monarch's strongest words yet since tensions spiked in recent weeks between the two regional heavyweights.
Iran had a representative present at the 57-nation summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, but its top leadership did not attend.
The Islamic summit drew political figures and heads of state from countries spanning Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
They come with widely varying policies and priorities, but share a common reverence for the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem.
Lunch with Buffett: An anonymous bidder has offered more than $4.5 million to have a private lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett, shattering the previous record of nearly $3.5 million. An online auction that raises money for the Glide Foundation's work to help the homeless in San Francisco ended Friday night with a winning bid of $4,567,888. It's the 20th year the Berkshire Hathaway CEO has participated in the pricey lunch auction, giving the winner the chance to talk with the renowned investor and philanthropist. Bidding starts at $25,000. Buffett has raised nearly $30 million for the charity over the years. The winning bidder and up to seven friends get to dine with Buffett.

Texto completo: Por un precio inicial de $3.4 millones de dólares, los fanáticos de la exitosa serie de HBO “The Sopranos” (1999-2007) pueden soñar con comprar la casa del mafioso principal, Tony (James Gandolfini).
Según The New York Times, la propiedad de aproximadamente 5,600 pies cuadrados, ubicada en 14 Aspen Drive en North Caldwell (NJ), ha sido colocada en el mercado.
La casa aparecía en los créditos de apertura del programa, cuando Tony se detiene en el camino curvo. Otras partes, como la cocina y un patio al aire libre, también aparecieron en el programa piloto. Más tarde se reprodujo para filmar escenas de interiores en un estudio en Queens.
Durante las seis temporadas del programa, la casa original se usó entre 30 y 50 veces. Las diversas escenas están bien documentadas en una guía en línea de los lugares de rodaje de “Los Sopranos”.
Muchos fanáticos se acercan para hacer fotos. Los propietarios son Victor y Patti Recchia, quienes se negaron a comentar cuánto les pagó HBO por usar su casa.
Victor, quien dirige Fourth Generation Construction, construyó en 1987 la casa de cuatro habitaciones y 4 baños y medio (con más de 20 en las cercanías).
La pareja le dijo al Times que ya no necesitan tanto espacio desde que su hijo adulto se mudó. Piensan quedarse en Nueva Jersey después de la venta.
Debido a que no están utilizando un corredor inmobiliario, la pareja les pide a los compradores calificados que envíen ofertas y comprobantes de fondos antes del 21 de junio al correo electrónico sopranoshouseforsale@gmail.com
