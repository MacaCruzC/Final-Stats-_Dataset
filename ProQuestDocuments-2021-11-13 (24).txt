Bill Smedley
Bill and Colette Smedley boarded a Princess Cruises ship Jan. 5, just five days before the first death in Wuhan, China, was linked to a quickly spreading coronavirus.
The Dillsburg couple was headed into the heart of Asia's seaports in Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan on a 29-day cruise.
Before the cruise was over, the coronavirus had reached their ship and would ultimately infect hundreds of the passengers.
The trip to celebrate their 33 years of marriage lasted longer than they had expected, as the Medleys hunkered down under quarantine in a windowless cruise cabin for 10 more days and then spent another two weeks confined on a Texas military base.
The march of the virus The Smedleys planned the cruise on short notice.
Colette Smedley had already booked a cruise through the Panama Canal, a trip they've always wanted to do. They hoped to tie it into seeing their son, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida. But they realized, after she booked it, that it was scheduled for 2021.
So, they decided to see parts of Asia this year on the Diamond Princess.
"We like getting out of the cold, miserable Central Pennsylvania weather for the winter. Why not?" Bill Smedley said Friday, now safely home from their ordeal. He had always wanted to see Vietnam.
The ship's 3,600 passengers were primarily American and Australian residents, but eventually about half of them rotated out, and more Asian guests arrived.
One of those was a man from China, who eventually got off in Hong Kong and went straight to the hospital, even though he wasn't showing signs of the virus.
Throughout the trip, CNN and Fox News reports on the cruise ship's televisions showed the virus marching through China and other parts of Asia.
"It just kept escalating every day," he said.
The Smedleys' temperatures were checked when they got off in ports like Osaca and Okinawa, but the trip was nearly over by then.
The trip - for them - was supposed to end Feb. 3, so the night before leaving, protocol is to place luggage in the hallway outside of staterooms for the crew to take it off the ship. The Smedleys did that before going to dinner Feb. 2, but when they returned, their luggage had been returned to the room.
"We were like uh-oh," Smedley said.
Inside a cabin for 10 days It turned out that the man from China who left the boat had the coronavirus, even though he hadn't shown symptoms before leaving the ship. The entire ship was under quarantine for 10 days.
They were docked in Japan and became the focus of the world, for a time with the highest concentration of coronavirus cases outside of China.
Their cruise cabin had a bed and a desk chair with no window or balcony.
"We were laying in bed all day long," he said. Free internet and, eventually, more cable channels helped entertain the couple. They read, researched the virus, endured interviews with news media and checked Facebook. They had also made acquaintances on the ship, who they talked to on the ship's phones.
Eventually, because they didn't have a balcony, they were allowed to walk on the decks occasionally, in limited numbers. They kept their distance from others, Smedley said.
Food arrived at their door. The passengers were required to wear a medical mask, as was the crew member delivering the food.
U.S. Rep. Scott Perry and members of his office kept in close contact with the Smedleys while the numbers of those afflicted with the virus grew.
At one point, Colette had a fever and was tested for the virus three times. "Both of us were really worried," he said, but no word back from the ship meant no infection.
By Feb. 13, the number of people infected with the virus on that ship reached 218, according to the New York Times.
"We knew that quarantine wasn't working on the ship, because the number kept growing," Smedley said.
As of Tuesday, more than 700 confirmed cases of the coronavirus were tied to that cruise; six of them have died.
Americans taken off the ship Under the tight control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Americans were taken off the ship and sent to a Texas military base, Lackland Air Force Base.
"People in Texas weren't happy that we were there," Smedley said. Local leaders didn't want the cruise passengers in their community. "It's just total politics. ... The people we were with, we weren't sick. We were never sick."
At Lackland, the Smedleys had two rooms and the ability to walk outside. Smedley gives credit to the tremendous work of the CDC and HHS to get them home safely.
"They were more than professional. They looked out for our medical well-being and our emotional well-being," Smedley said.
The captain of the Diamond Princess had been filling in for another who was on vacation, Smedley said. "He was nothing but spectacular the whole time. He was the last man to get off the ship."
Home again The Smedleys arrived home earlier this week, returning to life as usual.
Well, sort of. Interview requests have continued. Smedley turned down a trip to New York City for an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN.
"Are you nuts? I've been traveling everywhere for two months," Smedley said.
They went to the American Legion Wednesday for bingo night and invited friends to the house.
"There are people out there who are afraid to be around us," Smedley said. "But I'm not going to curtail my behavior."
Two months of being attached to each other hasn't changed the Smedleys, but for now, they're spending a little time doing things apart from one another.
And they're still planning that cruise next year through the Panama Canal.

Texto completo: The night of the tornadoes, Darlene Williams locked herself in her bathroom with a flashlight and her Australian Shepherd mix, Bodhi, and hoped for the best.
The next morning, unscathed from the storm, she took her dog out in the yard to survey the damage. Yellow insulation covered everything like snow — the trees, the grass, the power lines, her car. Glass crunched beneath her feet.
And then, in the side yard of her Hermitage home, she noticed something different.
"I saw something glistening in the sun," she said.
When she picked it up, she realized that a priceless personal keepsake had been blown in by the storm.
It was the Medal of Honor recognition for James Howard II.
The copper plaque was attached to black cardboard base, the adhesive on the back suggesting it had been ripped from its home. Perhaps something far away.
Now, she wants to get it back to where it belongs.
"I have family members in the military," she said. "It's always great to see folks honored for their service and heroism."
In the aftermath of the Tennessee tornadoes, many are trying to reunite those impacted by the storms with what they have lost.
On a Tennessee Tornado Lost and Found Facebook page, hundreds are posting pictures of an heirloom quilt and a wedding announcement, wrinkled photographs and a sweet kitty cat, all which have shown up in their yards and in hopes of getting belongings back to owners.
In Lebanon, one woman posted a photo of a warped white paper — the exam results for a new certified clinical medical assistant. Within an hour the owner had been found.
"That is mine! Yes!," she responded after being tagged by a mutual friend in the post. "How amazing are you! I was waiting on it. I got the news I passed on the 27th and they were going to mail that to me for proof of records! And I never got it. We never thought about our mail! Oh my gosh!"
Another posted a letter from "Mom" dated 2004, which mentions Ella Jane sitting up on her own and someone passing out at a Christmas play. That, too, was returned.
Facebook is not the only place for reunions. An area at the Cookeville Community Center has also been set up for such a purpose — a place to recover personal items that had been blown away, some of them for multiple miles into areas far from those damaged by the tornado.
New items arrive each day.
"We were just putting tons and tons of stuff in backpacks," said Ashley Walkner, who dropped off items Thursday at the community center after volunteering in the impacted areas Wednesday. "We found like insurance cards and driver's licenses and just random things in piles. We were trying to collect all that we could. If it seemed personal, we just tried to keep it. ...
"This isn't like litter pickup. These are people's lives."
Flight combat against the Nazis earns highest military honor When Williams found the Medal of Honor plaque in her yard, she wanted to know more about the man being honored.
The story of Howard's life is incredible.
The only fighter pilot to win the Medal of Honor in aerial combat over Europe in World War II, Howard earned the nation's highest military honor in January 1944, after he single-handedly took on 30 Nazi aircraft that hampered a mission by Allied bombers over Germany, according to the Los Angeles Times.
He destroyed at least four enemy airplanes and damaged others before he was forced to return to England, the L.A. Times reported.
Howard was born in China. His parents were missionaries in Canton, and he spent his first 14 years in China, according to his obituary in the New York Times. After attending the U.S. Navy's flying school in Florida, he joined the American volunteer group, the Flying Tigers, and helped to defend China against the Japanese.
In 13 months of action over Burma and China, he flew 56 missions and was credited with shooting down six Japanese planes, according to the New York Times.
He died in 1995, at the age of 81.
Now, Williams hopes to find the person who owns the keepsake that honors Howard's service and his memory. A tribute that has endured.

Texto completo: I don't know Jill Biden. But I know Jill Biden.
All of us "Philly girls" know Jill Biden.
We are Jill Biden.
We female Fightin's take care of the job. Just as, on a Super Tuesday stage behind a speechifying former Vice President Joe Biden last week, his raised-right-down-Broad-Street-into-Willow-Grove wife did exactly that: She got into a Philadelphia Eagles lineman defensive crouch and laid her hands on a vegan-activist-protester storming a stage in Los Angeles behind the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
I watched this viral moment and had just one thought, one Philly girl to another:
Of COURSE you take care of business this way.
OF COURSE you then turn around in your skirt and jacket and take even more control by shouting: "We're OK!" And, OF COURSE you clap your hands as if nothing just happened, letting the crowd resume chanting for the guy who just scored huge primary nomination wins. No sweat.
No surprise in my zip code, at least, that Jill's body-block reverberated across social media. The former Jill Jacobs, Upper Moreland High School Class of 1969, had just done what a Philly Girl does. No matter that she has spent years as an English professor with a Ph.D. and other advanced degrees.
Jill. Is. No. Snowflake.
A few days earlier, she'd caught my attention by helping remove a pretty sizable male heckler from a New Hampshire rally. When asked about that one, her response to reporters was, with a laugh: "I'm a good Philly girl."
No kidding.
Joe surely knows where this grit comes from. He was once a young boy from Scranton, Pa. (Don't know Scranton? Look up Philadelphia, add coal mines and mountains.) At a California fund-raiser Wednesday night, he shot out this zinger about his wife's Tuesday tussle on stage in front of rolling cameras:
"I'm probably the only candidate running for president whose wife is my Secret Service," the former U.S. senator and No. 2 to President Barack Obama said, according to The Hill. "Whoa. You don't screw around with a Philly girl, I'll tell you what."
Willow Grove, on a map, is in a belt of Philly suburbs that share with one another a certain old-school, working-to-middle-class cultural DNA. To test this theory, I drove there to talk with a wise man of Jill's generation.
He's wiseacre Jerry DiMarzio, Upper Moreland Class of '70 - just a year behind Jill. His family has run the Willow Inn since after his mother had a priest come to the former brothel to bless and douse it with holy water so she could turn it into an Italian restaurant and pub.
He still talks about how Jill's dad gave him his first mortgage. How he was the kind of man who enjoyed a game of pool and darts.
"I'm gonna say most of the girls here were nice girls, but they weren't wearing silk and lace or that," said DiMarzio, who at 69 is quick with a one-liner.
Back then, the small single houses around here were full of former Philly folks like Jerry's mom, from Germantown, or blue-collar carpenters who became big-time builders with all the open land out there.
The girls around there, Jerry said, "they wouldn't take any crap. But they wouldn't give you any crap if it wasn't called for."
I knew it.
He and I talked in a vintage-red tavern booth in a building that's more than a century old.
"I'm here," I told Jerry, "because I have a theory." Told him how I grew up in Upper Darby. The Philly Girl reflex, I told him, seems baked in us.
"It's in the DNA," I said. "What do you think?"
DiMarzio, a 5-foot-4 sparkle of gab who's married to a 6-foot-tall brunette named Jan, leaned back and thought about it. Only after smiling did he offer his own theory: "Let's call it wooder."
This hunt-or-be-hunted stuff, though, isn't in everyone. It was forged in the non-silver-spoon zip codes in and around Philly, back when union folks lived out there. Places like Willow Grove and Horsham, Oxford Circle or Southwest Philly, Upper Darby (Go UDHS Class of '88!) or Aston.
These places branded you with unmistakable characteristics: 1) A no-nonsense Philly accent that sounds like a schoolyard challenge at all times. 2) An always-be-alert defensive reflex that, at least as it came out of the mouths of my own public school classmates, went like this: "I'll kick your a-."
In an email the New York Times obtained and published earlier this year while profiling Jill, she mentioned these ordinary-kid roots. She was writing to a colleague at Northern Virginia Community College, where she taught until a few months ago. The Times got the emails through a records request. Here's what the Times reported:
In January 2017, Dr. Biden wrote about the personal transition that came with her husband's departure from public office.
"I am currently living in 3 houses!" wrote Dr. Biden, whose emails show up as "Jill Tracy." "I can't find a thing!!! I have my DE home, our new rental, and the Vice President's Residence all this for a middle class girl. Amazing."
Jerry and I laughed when I pulled out my iPhone and zoomed in on the photo of Jill with her hand gripping the protester. He always remembered Jill as more refined. Then again, this was Upper Moreland.
"Would a woman raised in Rittenhouse Square," I asked, "have had the same moves as Jill on that stage?"
This time, no pause from Jerry.
"If you get her silver spoon out of her mouth on time," he said. Again, though, a smile. "That's a different kind of cloth."
Exactly my point. Bless the girls with the grit.

Texto completo: I DON'T know Jill Biden. But I know Jill Biden.
All of us "Philly girls" know Jill Biden.
We are Jill Biden.
We female Fightin's take care of the job. Just as, on a Super Tuesday stage behind a speechifying former Vice President Joe Biden this week, his raised-right-down-Broad-Street-into-Willow-Grove wife did exactly that: She got into a Philadelphia Eagles lineman defensive crouch and laid her hands on a vegan-activist-protester storming a stage in Los Angeles behind the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
I watched this viral moment and had just one thought, one Philly girl to another:
OF COURSE you take care of business this way.
OF COURSE you then turn around in your skirt and jacket and take even more control by shouting: "We're OK!" And, OF COURSE you clap your hands as if nothing just happened, letting the crowd resume chanting for the guy who just scored huge primary nomination wins. No sweat.
No surprise in my zip code, at least, that Jill's body-block reverberated across social media. The former Jill Jacobs, Upper Moreland High School Class of 1969, had just done what a Philly Girl does. No matter that she has spent years as an English professor with a Ph.D. and other advanced degrees.
Jill. Is. No. Snowflake.
A few days earlier, she'd caught my attention by helping remove a pretty sizable male heckler from a New Hampshire rally. When asked about that one, her response to reporters was, with a laugh: "I'm a good Philly girl."
No kidding.
Joe surely knows where this grit comes from. He was once a young boy from Scranton, Pa. (Don't know Scranton? Look up Philadelphia, add coal mines and mountains.) At a California fund-raiser Wednesday night, he shot out this zinger about his wife's Tuesday tussle on stage in front of rolling cameras:
"I'm probably the only candidate running for president whose wife is my Secret Service," the former U.S. senator and No. 2 to President Barack Obama said, according to The Hill. "Whoa. You don't screw around with a Philly girl, I'll tell you what."
Willow Grove, on a map, is in a belt of Philly suburbs that share with one another a certain old-school, working-to-middle-class cultural DNA. To test this theory, I drove there to talk with a wise man of Jill's generation.
He's wiseacre Jerry DiMarzio, Upper Moreland Class of '70 - just a year behind Jill. His family has run the Willow Inn since after his mother had a priest come to the former brothel to bless and douse it with holy water so she could turn it into an Italian restaurant and pub.
He still talks about how Jill's dad gave him his first mortgage. How he was the kind of man who enjoyed a game of pool and darts.
"I'm gonna say most of the girls here were nice girls, but they weren't wearing silk and lace or that," said DiMarzio, who at 69 is quick with a one-liner.
Back then, the small single houses around here were full of former Philly folks like Jerry's mom, from Germantown, or blue-collar carpenters who became big-time builders with all the open land out there.
The girls around there, Jerry said, "they wouldn't take any crap. But they wouldn't give you any crap if it wasn't called for."
I knew it.
He and I talked in a vintage-red tavern booth in a building that's more than a century old.
"I'm here," I told Jerry, "because I have a theory." Told him how I grew up in Upper Darby. The Philly Girl reflex, I told him, seems baked in us.
"It's in the DNA," I said. "What do you think?"
DiMarzio, a 5-foot-4 sparkle of gab who's married to a 6-foot-tall brunette named Jan, leaned back and thought about it. Only after smiling did he offer his own theory: "Let's call it wooder."
This hunt-or-be-hunted stuff, though, isn't in everyone. It was forged in the non-silver-spoon zip codes in and around Philly, back when union folks lived out there. Places like Willow Grove and Horsham, Oxford Circle or Southwest Philly, Upper Darby (Go UDHS Class of '88!) or Aston.
These places branded you with unmistakable characteristics: 1) A no-nonsense Philly accent that sounds like a schoolyard challenge at all times. 2) An always-be-alert defensive reflex that, at least as it came out of the mouths of my own public school classmates, went like this: "I'll kick your a-."
In an email the New York Times obtained and published earlier this year while profiling Jill, she mentioned these ordinary-kid roots. She was writing to a colleague at Northern Virginia Community College, where she taught until a few months ago. The Times got the emails through a records request. Here's what the Times reported:
In January 2017, Dr. Biden wrote about the personal transition that came with her husband's departure from public office.
"I am currently living in 3 houses!" wrote Dr. Biden, whose emails show up as "Jill Tracy." "I can't find a thing!!! I have my DE home, our new rental, and the Vice President's Residence all this for a middle class girl. Amazing."
Jerry and I laughed when I pulled out my iPhone and zoomed in on the photo of Jill with her hand gripping the protester. He always remembered Jill as more refined. Then again, this was Upper Moreland.
"Would a woman raised in Rittenhouse Square," I asked, "have had the same moves as Jill on that stage?"
This time, no pause from Jerry.
"If you get her silver spoon out of her mouth on time," he said. Again, though, a smile. "That's a different kind of cloth."
Exactly my point. Bless the girls with the grit.

Texto completo: Her husband's commute from his job in the Bronx to their house in Brooklyn was stressful, traffic-clogged and slow, and each night after he finally made it home it could be another 45 minutes before he found somewhere to park the car. But Dionne Searcey was still floored when, after 14 years of this, her husband, Todd, uttered the fateful words, "I want to move to the suburbs."
A newspaper reporter and a native of Nebraska, Searcey had worked her way into a job covering the economy for the New York Times. With three young children, their home life had become, she admits, "a huge, rat-raced rut." But still, the suburbs! She simply wasn't ready for such a drastic move.
So instead, she moved the family to Senegal, where she became the West Africa Bureau Chief for the Times. "An international move might remind us of why we liked each other enough to have a family in the first place," she figured.
"In Pursuit of Disobedient Women" is Searcey's captivating, straight-ahead memoir of their three years in Dakar, Senegal. There is plenty here about family: Todd's restlessness and job angst; their children's growing independence and occasional bouts of parasitic worms; a horrifying account of a good friend's medical emergency and all that it entailed. (Buying him sheets for his hospital bed, to start.)
But while her family life is part of the narrative, what Searcey really wants to talk about are the stories of the people who live there. And my gosh, they are fascinating.
Searcey's writing is plain and unvarnished; she pretties nothing up. A journalist's journalist, she lets the details and characters provide the drama and plays down her own role, giving enormous credit to the local journalists and translators who work with her.
The memoir is not just a rehashing of stories she wrote for the Times; many of the stories she tells here never saw print. At the time, the United States was consumed with the election of Donald Trump and for a story out of West Africa to crack the cover of the Times, well, it had to be something astounding.
Frankly, all of the stories she tells seem astounding to me. Searcey gravitates toward stories about women, and the women she interviewed have endured almost unfathomable trauma and yet tell their stories bravely.
"All you had to do was ask," she writes. "They wanted to share the terrible things they had witnessed. They wanted the world to know."
Many of the stories involve the violence of Boko Haram. She writes about a woman who watched as a man is cut down by their bullets as he runs toward her -- and then realizes he is her son.
She writes about two little boys, both forced to watch their parents slaughtered, both conscripted into the Boko Haram army. They ran away and found a girl hiding in the weeds, pregnant from rape by a Boko Haram fighter. "The threesome kept running until they were safe." They now live together with the baby, "the world's most amazing blended family."
She interviews some of the Chibok girls who were kidnapped from their school by Boko Haram. She writes about the medical complications that develop in child brides -- girls whose bodies are not yet developed enough for sex -- a problem so prevalent there is a clinic devoted to it. She spends time with a judge who hears divorce cases, and she writes about how more West African women are seeking jobs and independence.
And she interviews young girls who were being trained to become suicide bombers, who desperately did not want to do this. One group fashioned long ropes from their hijabs and carefully lowered the bombs deep into wells where they would do no harm. When word came out that a different market had been bombed than the one assigned, the fighters "called the new girl over and scolded her for bombing the wrong town. Then they shot her to death."
What is astounding is the poise and fortitude that these women exhibit in telling their stories to a Western journalist. Also astounding is how many of these tales Searcey was able to absorb over three years.
"My colleagues cautioned about 'self-care' while reporting grim stories," she writes. "But I didn't want Netflix and a facial; I wanted a story."
This book is full of them.

Urban living in Lakeville?

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
If prospective home buyers were blindfolded before they entered a new detached townhouse development featured on the current Parade of Homes, they might not be able to say for sure if they were in the city or in the suburbs.
That's by design.
"It's an overused tagline, but with this project, we like to say we're putting the urban in suburban," said Todd Stutz, president of Robert Thomas Homes.
A division of the company, RT Urban, built the townhouses, called the Revival Collection. Bounded by urban features like sidewalks and front porches or stoops in the front and attached rear garages and an alley in the back, the townhouses are located in … wait for it … Lakeville.
They're the newest housing addition to the Spirit of Brandtjen Farm development, a 600-acre master plan community built with walkable access to a grocery store, several coffee shops and miles of trails. Priced from $369,000 to $399,000, the four townhouse models are aimed at buyers who value many aspects of city living but can't afford it.
"To get a new home with this square footage for under $400,000 would be challenging in the urban market," Stutz said. "Millennial buyers we are trying to attract have been renting in the central cities. When they buy, they're looking for the style and amenities they're used to."
The New York Times coined the term "hipsturbia" to define communities that blend desirable features of urban and suburban life; the Urban Land Institute named hipsturbia as a top real estate trend of 2020.
"Surban" is another identifier, a mashup word trademarked by two real estate consultants who wrote the 2016 bestseller "Big Shifts Ahead."
The authors anticipate that surban developments will gain ground among home buyers who want the smaller yards and walkability they find in cities, along with the lower housing costs found beyond the inner core.
"This is a lifestyle we will definitely see
more of," predicted Katie Elfstrom, spokeswoman for Housing First, the organization that represents Twin Cities builders and remodelers and hosts the Parade of Homes.
"There's a big group of buyers looking for urban energy at a suburban price point, and builders are always looking for new ways to innovate and make housing available."
Sleek and compact
With 1,700 square feet of living space, the RT Urban detached townhouses are bigger than typical city apartments but smaller than most new single-family construction in the suburbs.
And while the development was designed with millennial buyers in mind, Stutz expects a wide variety of buyers to purchase the compact homes. Downsizers and empty-nesters have been showing up to tour the townhouses and are also interested in the smaller concept, he said.
The townhouse interiors don't look like typical suburban houses.
"Suburban houses are more traditional, they feel a little heavier, more ornate. These [townhouses] are not that at all; they're sleek with a minimalist look," said Emily Anderson, senior designer for Martha O'Hara Interiors, which fashioned four different design packages for buyers of the Lakeville dwellings.
The design team looked to downtown apartments or loft-style condominiums for inspiration, laying out interiors that will feel familiar to buyers transitioning out of urban rentals.
"They're used to brand-new finishes and fixtures. They've had high-end countertops, cabinets, flooring, lighting," Anderson added. "They're OK with compact space and less square footage; they think about their carbon footprint."
The suburbs have always held residential appeal. At the first Parade of Homes in 1949, prospective homeowners walked through a dozen houses in Edina.
Seven decades later, the suburbs have changed. They've become more racially and economically diverse, with more adventurous dining and entertainment options. Commuting patterns have shifted as well; more businesses have set up shop in the suburbs near where their workers live, and more people telecommuting or managing flexible schedules mean that fewer workers make the daily rush-hour round trip to the city.
"It used to be that the cheap houses were in the city -- the suburbs was where you went when you had money. Now that's flipped," said Tom Fisher, professor of architecture and director of the Minnesota Design Center at the University of Minnesota.
Fisher said that putting more housing on smaller lots will be critical to the survival of suburbs.
"A lot of the suburbs need the higher density to increase their tax base so they can continue to meet demands for public services without increasing taxes for residents," he said.
As suburbs reinvent themselves, Fisher suggests that adopting features that mimic city neighborhoods will prompt buyers to put down roots.
"Sidewalks and alleys are functional spaces but they also answer a desire for community. People talk over the back alley; there's a relationship between people who share an alley and a street," he said. "In the age of social media when we have friends who are virtual, we crave the face-to-face. With proper design, that kind of interaction can be met in the physical environment."
Millennial enthusiasm
According to the Census Bureau, twice as many Americans live in suburbs as in cities or rural areas combined.
A 2018 Gallup poll asked respondents where they would live if they could live anywhere they wished. The first choice was a rural area, but the suburbs of a big city ranked second, with younger respondents particularly enthusiastic about suburban life.
"Clearly, the word 'suburb' is not anathema to young people today," the Gallup report concluded. "Despite assumptions … that millennials love living in big cities, these data show that many of them, in an ideal world, would leave big and small cities and move to the suburbs of such cities."
Soon younger home buyers will have another iteration of an urban-in-the-suburb option. Next month, RT Urban will break ground on a Lakeville development that's more "surban" than the detached townhouses.
The new project, to be called the Revelation Collection, will be what people in the East know as row houses. In Lakeville, the single-family dwellings will be called "attached townhouses."
The initial phase of the development will include 43 of them; the 2000-square-foot, three-story units will have flat roofs for elevated decks, along with sidewalks in front and two-car attached garages and alleys in the rear. Prices will start at $379,900.
"They will have an attractive streetscape that will look more urban than what's usually built in the suburban market," said Stutz. "We anticipate this option will appeal to buyers who want spend their free time on experiences -- not yard work and snow-shoveling."

A real history lesson in a real estate boom crash

Texto completo: The value of Florida real estate soars to giddy heights, homes doubling and tripling in price, bare lots in planned developments selling out and flipping before the ink is dry on the closing papers. Homeowners and investors alike plunge into new financial products, caught up in the frenzy of speculation. Fortunes grow even faster than buildings rise.

And then it all crumbles like sandcastles in a hurricane.

Does that sound like the housing crash of 2008, in which Florida was one of the hardest-hit states after flying high?

Well, yes. But that was just one more repeat of an old story. Florida was the scene of an even more outlandish boom about a century ago, one that might have had even more dire consequences than the recession that followed the 2008 crisis. That era is the subject of Christopher Knowltons absorbing new book, Bubble in the Sun: The Florida Boom of the 1920s and How It Brought on the Great Depression.

Knowlton, who has written for Fortune, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and worked in the investment business, brings expertise, deep research and a brisk style to the book. Its a dauntingly complex slice of history, but he examines it with clarity and insight, not to mention lots of juicy dish about the personal lives of some of the high rollers.

In 1915, Miamis population was only about 10,000 people, and the Miami Herald had a staff of three reporters. Only a decade later, in 1925, the city was booming so enormously that the Heralds rival, the Miami Daily News, published a 504-page edition in twenty sections, loaded with real estate ads and weighing 7.5 pounds. One Miami real estate office, Knowlton writes, sold $34 million worth of real estate in a single morning  and thats in 1920s dollars.

The Florida land boom would prompt the countrys greatest migration of people, dwarfing every previous westward exodus. ... Six million people flowed into the state in three years. Floridas Legislature obligingly got rid of the state income tax and inheritance tax in 1924, making the state an alluring tax haven overnight.

Knowlton explains the complicated reasons for the boom, which include such factors as the then-new availability of automobiles, mortgages and consumer credit as well as a national trend toward suburbs and away from cities and rural areas. Railroad magnates like the two Henrys, Plant and Flagler, had made Florida accessible and built playgrounds for the rich, but the boom of the 1920s drew a much broader swath of Americans.

Much of the book centers on a handful of powerful and imaginative developers and the Florida communities they created: Carl Fisher and Miami Beach, George Merrick and Coral Gables, Addison Mizner and Palm Beach. Colorful characters all, they soared to fantastic heights of wealth and lost everything.

Also among them was Tampas own D.P. Davis, who looked at a couple of uninhabited mud-flat islands in Hillsborough Bay and saw a veritable Venice at ones home-door, as one brochure for Davis Islands put it.

Davis rambled around the country as a young man, working a variety of jobs. He made a little money on a development in Miami, where, Knowlton writes, he was particularly taken with (Carl) Fishers use of dredgers to haul sand from the seabed to convert sandbars into brand-new islands or new waterfront property that could be sold for a premium.

In 1924, he returned to Tampa, bought Big Grassy Key and Little Grassy Key, and hired a dredging firm to remove nine million cubic yards of sand from Hillsborough Bay and pile it up to make dry land. A month later, buyers stood in line for 40 hours waiting for him to open his office, and they bought all 300 lots available, at an average cost of $5,610, in three hours.

Later that year, Knowlton writes, Davis, feeling especially cocky, announced he would marry the next queen of Gasparilla, whoever she was  and he did. Neither the marriage nor Davis next grand development idea, in St. Augustine, worked out as well as Davis Islands had. In 1926, Davis set sail for Paris with his young mistress, intending to divorce his wife (who was already in Paris awaiting him). Somewhere in the mid-Atlantic, he went overboard  fell, jumped or pushed, no one knows. His body was never recovered.

Knowlton sketches many of the other players in the boom, such as Handsome Jack Taylor, who built the Roylat Hotel and Pasadena-on-the-Gulf (now Stetson University College of Law and Pasadena Estates), only to abandon them abruptly, leaving behind parrots and a small band of monkeys that lived on an island in a golf course lake.

He writes a mini-biography of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, beginning with her days as the society reporter for the Miami Herald and following her path to champion of the Everglades. The environmental damage to that unique place had its roots in the 1920s boom.

Some of the people who wanted in on the boom were ambitious or naive, or both, but others were outright crooks. You might not be surprised that the con artist for whom the Ponzi scheme was named practiced a version of his pyramid ploy in Florida.

Charles Ponzi arrived in 1925, having already served a five-year sentence for one of his infamous pyramid schemes. He went right back to fraud in Florida, selling tiny parcels of swampland outside Jacksonville and promising investors a 200 percent return in 60 days. Arrested and convicted again, he faked suicide, shaved his head, grew a mustache, and donned a sailors cap, sailing out of Tampa on a freighter. But he couldnt resist bragging about his scam to a shipmate and was arrested as soon as the ship reached New Orleans.

Whether they were development moguls, fraudsters or ordinary people looking for a place in the sun, almost no one came out of the crash whole. Knowlton details its causes, which included the devastating 1926 hurricane that nearly flattened Miami, and its repercussions. He argues that the booms collapse had as big a part in causing the Great Depression as the stock market crash of 1929, and in Bubble in the Sun he makes a fascinating case for that analysis.

Texto completo: The coronavirus has been dominating the news for the past several weeks. Many agencies and communities around the world are trying to decide how to combat the new pathogen. While we still have little information on the new disease (for example, how it spreads and how deadly it really is), various attempts at creating novel approaches to fighting the spread of it have been developed. China, the epicenter of the coronavirus, is in the process of deploying these technologies. Some are fairly interesting. Others are a bit more invasive ... as one Facebook commentator quipped, “This just shows you how little imagination Orwell had.” Let’s look at a few of these new technologies.
First, is a disinfection robot. Many modern hospitals have robots that will shine intense UV light to disinfect rooms. China is using these as well. However, how do you disinfect the streets of a major city? There have been several designs proposed and a few prototypes in operation, but they all have the same basic idea: Spray disinfectant everywhere. These robots vary in size depending on the model but are all about the size of a shopping cart. Tubes stick out that spray the disinfectant. One looks like a mini tank. It has two treads and a giant “cannon” on the front. These robots are designed to wander down sidewalks and spray everything they can find.
The next technology starts to fall down the Orwellian path of creepy big brother government. Several companies are deploying contactless temperature detection systems in many public areas. While this isn’t that uncommon for many border crossings around the world, what is different is what else these systems can do. Many are starting to use facial recognition software that detects whether the individual is wearing a face mask. In one case, this technology was put on a robot. The robot would wander around taking people’s temperature from a distance. If it detected a high fever or that someone was not wearing their mask, it would sound an alarm.
As if having a robot publicly yell at you for not being healthy wasn’t enough, China has released a new app to better control its population. Officially called “Alipay Health Code,” is a mobile app developed by Ant Financial (bank and sister firm to Alibaba). The publicly stated point of this app is to decide whether you pose a contagion risk and it tells you if you should be quarantined or allowed in public areas. It works through Ant Financial’s mobile wallet application, Alipay. The New York Times did a deep dive into the mobile application and what it found was, to say the least, a bit concerning. First of all, there is no clear or detailed information about how the application really determines your risk level. It does mention you can get flagged if you had contact with an infected person, visited a virus hot spot, or you reported symptoms. If you are flagged for quarantine, the application does not say why. Second, the Times found a program within the application that accesses personal data. This program is called “reportInfoAndLocationToPolice.” It appears the application is tracking individuals’ movements over time and the Chinese government is using that data along with many other records (such as trains, buses, etc). Do these facts scare off the Chinese from using the app? No, because the government requires it to travel … even locally. Checkpoints have been set up all over many cities requiring users to show their status in the application from train stations to subways.
A new disease can be scary and precautions should be put in place to stop its spread. However, we should be very wary of taking cues from China on how to stop the spread of the disease in the United States. It is an interesting use of technology, but it is also scary in its own right how China has reacted.

Texto completo: Donald Trump Jr. insisted he was using "hyperbole" when he claimed that Democrats want "millions" of U.S. citizens to die from the coronavirus so that President Trump's "streak of winning" can come to an end.
In a Sunday Axios HBO interview, the president's son was confronted with his February claim, which he made while speaking with Fox News. While on the network, he said, "For Democrats to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of winning is a new level of sickness."
He added, "I don't know if this is coronavirus or Trump Derangement Syndrome, but these people are infected badly."
The first son told Axios that he's "entitled to speak with hyperbole."
"I don't know that they want millions of people, but you could see them," he said. "There was nothing that Trump could do that could turn his response to coronavirus into, 'Hey, he did a good job.'"
Trump went on to explain that he was "quoting an article in the New York Times that said, 'We should call it the Trumpvirus.'"
"So I don't want to hear the sanctimony from these people on the left, you know, saying these sorts of things because it's nonsense," he said, adding that he used hyperbole to drive "home the point." "I don't actually think that."
President Trump was criticized for his initial response to the coronavirus outbreak, including from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who slammed his budget request as "too little, too late" and questioned if he fully understood the crisis at hand. The president also took flak for his choice to tap Vice President Mike Pence to lead the U.S. effort against the spreading illness. His son's comment came in response to some of the backlash.
Just under two dozen Americans have died from the coronavirus, with around 500 cases still in the country.

Florida woman charged with changing voters' registration information and party affiliations

Texto completo: A Florida woman might have filled out dozens of voter registration forms with false information, according to election officials.
Cheryl A. Hall, 63, was charged on Thursday with putting false information into 10 voter registration forms while working for Florida First, a voter registration group with ties to the pro-Trump PAC America First Policies, according to the New York Times. Election officials suspect that Hall falsified parts of 109 other forms, as well.
"It’s just really bizarre," Lake County, Florida, elections supervisor Alan Hays, said. "I don’t know what part of her imagination was convinced she could get away with this."
The 10 forms in question contained correct names, but other information — such as social security numbers, dates of birth, and party affiliation — was wrong. Hays tracked the forms back to Hall after receiving complaints from three voters that their party identification had been changed without their permission.
"We don’t know what she was hoping to accomplish," said Lt. John Herrell of the Lake County Sheriff’s Office. Herrell added that Hall appeared to have acted on her own and that Florida First was not suspected of wrongdoing.
"Florida First will continue to work tirelessly to serve communities that may be underrepresented, and provide them access to voter registration services," Florida First’s State Director Elicia Babac said in a statement.
Hall is due in court on March 30 and faces up to five years in prison or a $5,000 fine for each of the 10 counts of submitting false voter registration information she has been charged with.

Texto completo: If Joe Biden wins the Democratic nomination, I’ll worry that his candidacy might be doomed. Doomed by Sanders supporters who, out of pique, will sit out the election; doomed by a throwback messenger with no particularly stirring message; doomed by hints of infirmity that many voters find worrisome and that Donald Trump will exploit with crass efficiency.
If, despite this, Biden wins the presidency, I’ll worry that, as a potential one-termer, he’ll bend too far to appease his party’s progressive wing. That he’ll do so in order to cut a figure for history. That he’ll over-empower federal agencies, overregulate business and overtax individuals. That he’ll appoint judges with cramped views of religious liberty and free speech. That he’ll resume a policy of appeasement toward Iran.
Then again, if Biden wins, there will be other things that, for a change, I won’t have to worry about. And most of these will be the things that really matter.
If Biden wins only the nomination, I won’t have to worry that there’s a fair chance that, in Bernie Sanders, a man could be elected president who, without nuance or discrimination, demonizes entire sectors of American industry. I won’t have to worry about getting my health insurance taken from me or watch my savings shrink to nothing thanks to monetary policy on the Weimar Republic model. I won’t have to worry that the self-described “dirtbag left” will become to the Democratic Party what the Hannity-Carlson-Ingraham right is to the Republican Party.
I won’t have to worry that not one, but both, major U.S. parties have become unrecognizable from what they were just five years ago; that they’ve succumbed to their respective extremes; that nowhere in American politics do centrists have sway; and that on nothing is compromise possible.
And if Biden wins the White House?
In that case, I won’t have to worry about the president trying to criminalize his political opponent. Not with demagogic chants of “Lock her up,” nor with quiet attempts to strong-arm an ally for the sake of digging up dirt on an American citizen. I won’t have to worry about White House officials being forced to choose between their ethical obligations and their loyalty to the president. I won’t have to worry about an attorney general who chooses loyalty over obligation — and, a year later, is bluntly reprimanded by a Republican-appointed federal judge for doing so.
If Biden wins, I won’t have to fear that the president might order the abrogation of a free-trade agreement with a major trading partner — only for a watchful adviser to snatch the order from his desk before he can sign it. I won’t have to read about frantic aides wondering if the president is really serious about his threats to withdraw the U.S. from NATO. I won’t have to cross my fingers hoping that a clever general will convince the president that the reason we shouldn’t betray our desperate Kurdish allies in Syria is so we can keep the oil.
If Biden wins, I won’t have to watch another press conference like Trump’s in Helsinki. I won’t have to wonder why the president seized his own translator’s notes after a meeting with Vladimir Putin. I won’t have to hear paeans of praise sung for North Korea’s ogreish tyrant, or for Turkey’s pernicious strongman, or for China’s cult-of-personality despot.
If Biden wins, I won’t have to read that the president has told fellow American lawmakers to “go back” to their countries of birth or ancestry. I won’t have to watch the U.S. close its doors to desperate refugees on the view that they hail from “s---hole countries.” I won’t have to cringe in shame and disgust as the attorney general cites the Apostle Paul to defend a vile policy of separating children from parents as a useful deterrent against illegal immigration.
If Biden wins, I won’t have to listen to the president call members of my profession the “enemy of the American people.” Or people of my political viewpoint “human scum.” Or colleagues “stone cold losers.” I won’t have to spend time wondering whether being an unindicted co-conspirator in a hush-money scandal rises to the level of an impeachable offense. I won’t have to steer family conversations away from politics lest they veer into X-rated territory. If Biden wins, the word “Stormy” will refer only to weather, and “Daniels” only to whiskey.
If Biden wins, I will write column after column opposing him on policy grounds. But at least I’ll feel relief that the American people didn’t vindicate Trumpism and the nativism and meanness it represents.
If Biden wins, he will amuse, embarrass and probably alarm me with his gaffes, misstatements and memory lapses. But I’ll never feel ashamed to think of him as my president, much less to root for his success.
If Biden wins, it will not mean a great American presidency. It will mean a decent one. That will be more than enough for me.

Texto completo: My son and I had a very serious conversation recently. It was one of those tough, grownup-to-teenager talks, and like many of these, it all started with a question.
“Mom, how worried should I be about coronavirus?”
Me: “Call it COVID-19, dagnabbit!”
Kidding. I don’t know why the media (including The Trib) feels the need to specifically say COVID-19. I mean, can you imagine telling someone you have coronavirus, and they respond, “Which one? Crossin’ my fingers it’s COVID-5, my friend.”
I feel like saying, “Stop trying to make COVID-19 happen.”
“How does it spread?” my son asked.
Thankfully, I knew just how to talk to my kid about this. I’m currently working at the Utah Capitol during the legislative session, where politicians meet voters and lobbyists and elementary kids, and handshakes are part of the job. But as of last week, it became a handshake-free zone, like quarantine for your fingers. Guess we all know how it feels to be in quarantine now.
So, I sat my son down, and said in a serious voice, “You know, when two coworkers work with each other a lot, they develop a working relationship, that is no way like a personal relationship. The first time they meet, they do a very special thing with their hands. It’s like a hug. But with hands.”
“You mean a handshake,” he said.
“Precisely,” I said. Nothing gets by my 17-year-old. “But sometimes, as with any non-personal relationship, it can be met with resistance.”
“You mean like the resistant strain of coronavirus?”
“No, not always virus resistance, but in this case, yes. So, sometimes what you have to do is avoid large spaces with lots of people.”
“Like the Capitol during session,” he asked.
“Um… yes.”
“And my school assembly?”
“Um… yes. But when you have to go to these places, all you have to do is remember to wash your hands for 20 seconds, and forego handshakes.”
“What about hugs?”
“Oh, hugs are just fine. Plus, if things get bad, we can get those masks.”
“Do those things really work?” he asked.
“No, not really. But the pure expense of them makes me think they must.”
My son narrowed his eyes. “So, who is really the adult in this conversation we’re having?”
“Well, son, I’m glad you asked about my experience at the Capitol. When you see someone you know, each of you reach your hands out to shake. It’s automatic. But then it turns into this thing where your hands both do this slow dive, and then you pull them back awkwardly. Then one of you holds out a fist to bump, but of course if germs are on hands, they’re certainly on fingers, which do the actual bumping. So you don’t bump. Then one of you holds out an elbow as a greeting, and your face winces because you remembered that person coughing into their elbow.”
“Isn’t that just what doctors advocate?” he said.
“Yes, but I’m not sure they fully anticipated every scenario. What if a square dance breaks out?”
“Hmm,” he said thoughtfully.
“Anyway, then after you use the restroom, you wash your hands, and then you shove your shoulder against the door to open it, so you can avoid germs.”
“You do that with every door?”
“Oh no. That’s silly,” I said, rubbing Purell into my hands. “Just the bathroom doors.”
“What about handrails? Gavels? Computers? Elevator buttons?’
He had a good point.
He sighed. “Going back to my original question, Mom, how worried should I be?”
I thought about it. “I’d say mildly.”
“What’s mildly?” he asked.
“Well, you want to be somewhere in between a pure panic and licking the handrails.”
“So, wash my hands?”
I nodded. That’ll do, son. That’ll do.

Texto completo: On Jan. 31, over a month ago, the Trump administration made an excellent decision: In an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus, it forbade most foreign nationals from entering the United States if they had recently traveled to China.
This move was immediately attacked in the language of cosmopolitan sophistication, which assumes that because travel bans and quarantines are associated with things liberals consider bad — nationalism, hardened borders, migration restrictions — they necessarily must not work as well.
But this supposed sophistication is really just a superstition. It’s certainly true that the travel ban could not, and did not, prevent the coronavirus from reaching the United States. But as with local quarantines and closings — all of which emphatically do work, whether you’re looking at the history of the Spanish flu or Hong Kong’s success combating the coronavirus today — you don’t need 100% effectiveness for travel restrictions to be wise and helpful. What they buy you, above all, is a slower rate of spread, and with it precious time for preparation.
So Trump made the right call, and in so doing he briefly vindicated a case that his supporters have always made for him: He acted like the guy who would make common-sensical choices in the national interest, even when they went against the nostrums of globalization and the supposed wisdom of the do-gooders.
And then his administration took the month that his decision bought the country and completely wasted it.
Obviously the White House isn’t to blame for everything that’s gone wrong with the coronavirus response. Our inability to roll out testing rapidly, even when thousands of cases are probably in circulation, owes a lot to the inherent problems of medical bureaucracy and the regulatory state and to the decadence that afflicts U.S. institutions at almost every level.
But the president can still be reasonably held responsible for the urgency with which the bureaucracy attacks the problem, the speed at which rules get suspended and workarounds enacted, the pressure brought to bear on state and local authorities to take a possible pandemic seriously, and the use of presidential rhetoric to encourage private citizens to do the same.
And on all counts the White House has been failing. There should have been a public face of the anti-coronavirus effort long before Mike Pence was finally elevated with the power to respond quickly to bureaucratic bottlenecks. Weeks ago, private laboratories like Quest Diagnostics should have been encouraged to run their own tests for the virus. Weeks ago, the government should have promised to cover the cost of testing, instead of leaving it to the tangle of insurance. Weeks ago, the White House should have begun working with states and cities to devise a uniform response to outbreaks and with Congress to ready aid packages for regions that need to go into lockdown — and perhaps to prepare a general stimulus as well. Even a specific issue like the production of surgical masks, outsourced like so many things to China, could have been the focus of a Trump-directed mobilization.
Above all, the president’s rhetoric could have been deployed from early February onward to encourage people to take this disease seriously, to focus a political and social response, to prepare the country for the kind of steps that have contained the coronavirus elsewhere.
Instead, Trump fell into the same trap as the cosmopolitan sophisticates — acting as if the specter of panic is worse than the disease itself, focusing on the more reassuring estimates of the virus’s fatality rates instead of recognizing the wide spread of possible scenarios — while mixing in his own short-termist fixation on the stock market. And then when, at last, even the cosmopolitans became alarmed, he took their anxiety as a partisan insult and lapsed into “hoax” accusations, pulling a certain percentage of his co-partisans into irresponsibility along with him.
Now the time his travel ban bought us has expired, and the next few weeks will be decisive. There is still a chance that state and local efforts to contain the virus can succeed, and there are still ways in which the White House could exert strong leadership to help that happen. But right now we are headed for a scenario of rising death rates and overwhelmed hospitals, shuttered schools and empty stadiums and cancellations everywhere.
Combine this scenario’s inevitable economic consequences with the optics of the president’s blundering and solipsistic response, and the coronavirus seems very likely to doom Trump’s reelection effort, no matter where he casts the blame.
And how ironic that would be. In 2016 we elected a China hawk who promised a “complete shutdown” in response to foreign threats, a germaphobic critic of globalization who promised to privilege the national interest above all.
Now he is in danger of losing his presidency because when the great test came, in the form of a virus carried by global trade routes from communist China, he didn’t take the danger seriously enough.

Texto completo: Several dozen Latter-day Saints in New York City took to the streets of the Big Apple on Saturday to express their disappointment with Brigham Young University’s changing position on “romantic behavior” by same-sex couples.
“We want BYU students to know that they are loved and supported by people who are a country away,” said Sarah Morris, a BYU graduate who was among the 50-60 people who turned out for the demonstration. “We hear them. We feel their pain with them. And we will do everything we can to facilitate that change.”
[ READ MORE: LGBTQ students at BYU and allies rallied at LDS Church headquarters over school’s changing positions about same-sex couples]
Protesters started at the corner of Columbus Avenue and 65th Street, across the street from the Manhattan temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They chanted slogans including “BYU, there’s no excuse. This is human rights abuse,” and held up signs reading “Agency is God’s Plan” and “BYU, let the gays stay.” They also sang hymns and Primary songs.
“It was all about just being there for fellow members and friends who were suffering right now; who are in pain and having a hard time with this,” said Anne Lambert, a Utahn who attends the Fashion Institute in New York. “We were there to show them that we’re there for them. And we support them and we love them and accept them.”
The protesters were members of the LGBTQ community, friends and allies, and included a number of BYU alumni. They talked to passersby and handed out literature explaining their demonstration.
“A lot of people were like, ‘Oh, this is so great. I love what you’re doing,’” Lambert said. “I mean, some people were uninterested and kept on walking. But I would say that, overall, people were really positive and really happy about what we were doing.”
No church leaders appeared at the rally, but members of the media — including a reporter from NY1 (a local cable news operation) and a photographer from The New York Times were on hand.
It was the fourth such rally — the first outside of Utah — in response to the school’s reaffirmation Wednesday that same-sex relationships were still “not compatible” with the school’s Honor Code — despite removing the code’s ban on “homosexual behavior” last month.
“For it to be removed as a section of the Honor Code was massive progress. Frankly, the section on ‘homosexual behavior’ has been vague and abused for years,” said Morris, a Latter-day Saint who was active in BYU’s unofficial student group, Understanding Sexuality, Gender and Allyship, while she was a student there. “It was amazing to have that [section of the Honor Code] taken away and for students to feel that safety and freedom. And I know students who reached out to the Honor Code office and were told directly, ‘Yes, this means that queer students can date.’”
Until Wednesday, when the church announced that same-sex romantic behavior is still “not compatible” with the BYU Honor Code.
“To be at a university that has absolutely no support for LGBTQ students — they’re already in a vulnerable position,” Morris said. “And now BYU has put them in dangerous position. They offered them a place of safety, and people came out. There were all sorts of other people kissing on campus and people came out to their families for the first time. And now BYU has retracted that?”
There were two demonstrations on the Provo campus after the announcement, and the third, which attracted more than 500 participants, was held Friday outside the church’s downtown Salt Lake City headquarters.
As was the case in Utah, the New York protesters aimed their well-behaved ire at BYU and the Honor Code, not at the church’s policies toward gay people.
“I don’t think it was really geared toward changing church policy,” said Lambert, who was there with a number of other members of the young adults Latter-day Saint ward she attends. “It was more specifically just about BYU and how they handled the situation and the Honor Code.”
The Utah-based faith teaches that being homosexual is not a sin, while acting on those attractions is.
“The teachings of the church and the policies of our universities are consistent with eternal principles, and seek to encourage and strengthen relationships that lead to eternal covenants made with God,” church spokesman Doug Andersen said Friday. “The church and its leaders continue to teach that though there may be disagreement on an issue or policy, we should treat one other with love, respect and kindness.”

David Leonhardt: How working-class life is killing Americans

Texto completo: When economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton first published their research on “deaths of despair” five years ago, they focused on middle-aged whites. So many white working-class Americans in their 40s and 50s were dying of suicide, alcoholism and drug abuse that the overall mortality rate for the age group was no longer falling — a rare and shocking pattern in a modern society.
But as Case and Deaton continued digging into the data, it became clear that the grim trends didn’t apply only to middle-aged whites. Up and down the age spectrum, deaths of despair have been surging for people without a four-year college degree.
In the early 1990s, the number of white adults without a college education who died from drug overdoses, alcoholism or suicide was fairly low — and the death rates for younger adults were lower than for older adults.
But over the past three decades, deaths of despair among whites without a college degree — especially those under age 50 — have soared.
The death rate for whites with a college degree, by contrast, has risen only modestly across all age groups and remains lower for the young than the old.
Case and Deaton — a married couple who are both economists at Princeton — try to explain the causes in a new book, “Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism.” Their basic answer is that working-class life in the United States is more difficult than it is in any other high-income country. “European countries have faced the same kind of technological change we have, and they’re not seeing the people killing themselves with guns or drugs or alcohol,” Case said. “There is something unique about the way the U.S. is handling this.”
Inequality has risen more in the United States — and middle-class incomes have stagnated more severely — than in France, Germany, Japan or elsewhere. Large corporations have increased their market share, and labor unions have shriveled, leaving workers with little bargaining power. Outsourcing has become the norm, which means that executives often see low-wage workers not as colleagues but as expenses.
And the United States suffers from by far the world’s most expensive health care system. It acts as a tax on workers and drains resources that could otherwise be spent on schools, day care, roads, public transit and more. Despite the unparalleled spending, the U.S. medical system also fails to keep many people healthy.
Many of the problems afflicting the working class span racial groups, and Case and Deaton emphasize that these problems aren’t merely financial. Life for many middle- and low-income Americans can lack structure, status and meaning. People don’t always know what days or hours they will be working from week to week. They often don’t officially work for the company where they spend their days, which robs them of the pride that comes from being part of a shared enterprise.
“Many people used to associate the meaning of their life with what their corporation or institution was doing,” said Deaton, a Nobel laureate in economics. Miners and factory workers identified themselves as such. Warehouse workers, especially those whose paycheck is signed by a staffing company, rarely feel the same connection.
The result of these trends has been a “coming apart,” as Case and Deaton put it, of day-to-day life for whites without a college degree versus those with a college degree.
Marriage rates have diverged as well. People without college degrees are also less likely to attend church. Surveys show that a growing number of working-class Americans find it difficult to do basic things, like climb a flight of stairs or socialize, partly because of chronic problems with their mental or physical health. Many people are also drinking more. And they are unhappier.
Given all of these alarming social indicators, it’s not surprising that some other causes of death — in addition to suicide, alcoholism and drug overdoses — have also started rising for Americans without a college degree. Heart disease is the most significant, exacerbated by obesity, drinking and drug use.
The combined result is a divergence in the life expectancy of white college graduates and nongraduates. Overall mortality for whites between the ages of 45 and 54 has held roughly steady in the last 25 years. But that average hides a big increase in death rates for nongraduates and a big decline for graduates.
What can be done about all of this? Many of the solutions are obvious, if difficult to accomplish. The medical system should be overhauled to put a higher priority on health than on wealth for people who work in the industry, Case and Deaton argue. (And that doesn’t necessarily mean a mandatory version of Medicare, they add.)
The federal government should do a better job of keeping big business from maximizing profits at the expense of its workers, by enforcing antitrust laws and encouraging new kinds of labor unions. Governments at all levels should help more people earn college degrees, both four-year degrees (like BAs) and meaningful vocational degrees.
Other economic research has found that a college degree isn’t simply a marker. Students who attend and graduate from college do better in life than otherwise similar students who didn’t get the same opportunities. Graduates are more likely to be employed, earn more, marry and stay married, be satisfied with their lives, be healthy and live longer. These findings suggest that college itself — both the classroom learning and the experience of successfully navigating college — brings long-term benefits.
The focus of Case and Deaton’s book isn’t education, but it lingers as the backdrop to all of their findings. “This BA/non-BA divide,” Deaton said, “just comes up again and again and again.”

SAFETY FIRST, BUT WITHOUT FANS 'WE'RE NOTHING,' PIRATES SAY

Texto completo: BRADENTON, Fla. - COVID-19, the newly discovered coronavirus, continues to be a topic around the sports world.
On Friday, a Division III men's basketball game at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore was played in an empty gym. The game is the first known American sporting event played without fans because of COVID-19, of which more than 400 cases have been confirmed in the United States, according to The New York Times.
Later that day, news started to come out about the NBA telling teams to prepare for the possibility of playing without fans or media in attendance.
LeBron James spoke out and said he didn't want to play without the fans. Pirates pitcher Jameson Taillon understood the sentiment but also believes that caution is essential.
"It sounds cliché, but you have to follow whatever medical advice you get from the trainers and doctors," Taillon said before the Pirates' spring training game Saturday against the New York Yankees. "I agree with LeBron - as players we play for the fans. Without the fans, we're nothing. At the same time, if it's a couple of weeks playing without fans to make sure everyone stays safe, then I'm all about that."
Bryan Reynolds has a bit of experience playing in an empty big-league park going back to his days at Vanderbilt. Of course, those circumstances were different.
"We played at Dodger Stadium against TCU. It was quite weird. Eerie. Quiet," Reynolds said. "It was strange how you were able to hear all the sounds. It was so quiet. We were used to playing at these loud SEC ballparks. It was harder than usual to get up for the game with no fans there."
Baseball players probably have more experience than other athletes playing games in (nearly) empty ballparks. Before they become major leaguers, they often play before sparse crowds in the minor leagues.
"I enjoy the fans; they make the game fun. They bring a lot of the vibe and excitement," shortstop Kevin Newman said. "It'd be so strange to play a game without them there. I hope it doesn't come down to that."
MLB already has sent out protocols for players to follow amid COVID-19 concerns. The Pirates took the extra step of deep-cleaning their Bradenton facility after cases in Manatee County and nearby Hillsborough County. Part of the protocols includes limiting high-fives with patrons and not signing autographs with pens from fans.
"It's tough," Newman said. "I appreciate any fan that wants my autograph. But right now we can't risk it until we figure out what's going on. It's hard because I see the excitement from fans when their favorite player gives them a few moments of their time."
Newman also is taking another extra step in games.
"I don't lick my fingers anymore," Newman said. "I try to be highly aware of it while I'm playing because I used to do it all the time. I make sure not to touch my face and regularly am washing my hands."
Taillon knows it would be unconventional to play with a genuinely empty ballpark. And before you make your PNC Park attendance joke, even a crowd of 10,000 is a far cry from no fans.
"It would be interesting to hear every little thing that happens," Taillon said. "It'd be different, but once a big-time hitter like Anthony Rizzo or Mike Trout steps in the box, they're trying to beat me. The competitive juices take over from there."
Around the horn
Erik Gonzalez played in his second game at third base Saturday as he returns from a foot fracture. Colin Moran likely is going to be the starting third baseman when the season opens in less than three weeks in Tampa, Fla. But Moran played first base Friday against Toronto and hit a home run. Philip Evans played second and third base.
Pirates manager Derek Shelton expects Moran to play some first even though he's the starting third baseman. The goal is for Moran and other players to give the roster as much flexibility as possible.
"We are trying to get different views, different looks on the field. There will probably be a time where Colin starts at first and goes to third or starts at third then goes to first," Shelton said. "We are trying different ways to think about it to get guys different looks. The big thing, personally, is I don't want them to be surprised if they have to switch positions in a game.
"If that is the case, that's something that's on me, and I don't want someone to be unprepared."
Jose Osuna mostly plays the corner infield positions as a utilityman, but he played Friday in right field. Cole Tucker has spent time at second base, as well.
About that grievance ...
There has been a few questions on the topic of the players union and its grievance accusing the Pirates of not using revenue-sharing money to improve the on-field product as required under the collective bargaining agreement.
First, there isn't a second grievance against the Pirates as some outlets have reported. Union chief Tony Clark and the MLBPA filed an amended claim against the Pirates, along with Tampa Bay and Miami. The original complaint, which centered on the 2017-18 offseason and was filed in 2018, is still awaiting a hearing date.
There is no public record of how much money teams receive in revenue sharing, but according to Cots Contracts, the Pirates are going to have the lowest projected payroll in baseball at about $57 million when the season starts. The Pirates' argument is that payroll isn't the only way to make the team better. They'll point to their facility in the Dominican Republic, for instance. The team would argue money is being spent on technology, the draft and international signings.
Where will this go?
That's the hardest question to answer. At some point, there will have to be either a hearing or an agreement to drop the complaint. If that hearing happens, the Pirates will have to give an account of how they spent their revenue-sharing money as required. If they can, then this dies. If they cannot, things will get interesting, especially heading into negotiations for a new CBA in 2021.

Krugman: Bernie Sanders is going for broke

Texto completo: Few political movements have experienced as quick and dramatic a fall from grace as what happened to the Sanders campaign between the Nevada caucuses and Super Tuesday. Over the course of 10 days Bernie Sanders went from the presumptive Democratic nominee to a very long shot.
In fact, things have gotten so bad that Sanders is running an ad that attempts to portray him as best buddies with former President Barack Obama.
Fact checkers have pointed out that the ad is deeply misleading. It jumbles together things Obama said over the course of a decade and leaves out important context.
But a frame-by-frame analysis actually understates how disingenuous it is for Sanders to try to tie himself to Obama. For Sandersism, as a philosophy, is all about rejecting Obamaism. That is, it’s about refusing to accept incremental, half-a-loaf-is-better-than-none politics and demanding go-for-broke maximalism instead.
The thing is, there is a case for the Sanders critique of Obama. But Sanders should own that critique, not pretend that he never made it.
So what is this debate about? It’s not about values, although Sanders and those around him have a bad habit of suggesting that anyone who questions their political strategy is a corrupt tool of the oligarchy. Obama was, and Joe Biden is, clearly in favor of progressive goals such as universal health coverage and reduced income inequality.
But Obama pursued those goals via incremental changes. Obamacare was designed to expand health coverage while doing as little as possible to disrupt the lives of people who already had health insurance. Obama raised taxes on the wealthy more than most people realize — by 2016 the average federal tax rate on the 1% was almost as high as it was pre-Ronald Reagan — but he did so quietly, without much populist rhetoric.
In the Sanders view, this incremental, low-key approach reflected a failure of nerve (or perhaps corruption by the “establishment”). Obama should have gone the whole way and (somehow) enacted “Medicare for All.” He should have made a frontal assault on inequality, with much bigger tax hikes for “millionaires and billionaires.”
And to be fair, I actually agree that Obama was much too cautious on some fronts. Back in 2009 I was very publicly tearing my hair out over the obvious inadequacy of Obama’s economic stimulus, which I predicted (correctly) would be a political disaster, because the failure to achieve dramatic results would play into Republican hands. And I believe that Obama could have gotten much more if he had been willing to use reconciliation to bypass the filibuster, the way Republicans did in ramming through the 2017 tax cut.
I was also very unhappy, in real time, when Obama began echoing Republican arguments for fiscal austerity despite continuing high unemployment.
And I still believe that Obama could and should have taken a couple of big banks into temporary receivership as the price of being bailed out. Obama definitely showed too much respect for the bankers who got us into the financial crisis in the first place.
But Sanders isn’t making a selective case, arguing that Obama should have been more aggressive on some fronts. He’s arguing for a maximalist agenda on all fronts: complete elimination of private health insurance and a vast expansion of government programs that would require major tax increases on the middle class as well as the wealthy.
The political theory behind this maximalism is an assertion that a bold populist program would transform the electoral landscape, winning over white working-class voters and bringing a surge of new voters, all of this on a scale sufficient both to win a smashing victory in November and to intimidate centrist members of Congress into accepting radical proposals.
There is, unfortunately, no evidence to support this political theory; in particular, the promised surge in young voters failed to materialize on Super Tuesday. So Sandersism is looking more than a bit like Green Lanternism — a belief that political miracles can be achieved by sheer force of will.
Of course, many Sanders supporters will claim that I’m only saying this because I’m in the pay of billionaires, or something.
In any case, we need to be clear about the nature of the argument in what remains of the Democratic primary contest. Again, it’s not about values: Democrats as a group have become far more progressive than they were, and even a “centrist” like Biden is advocating policies, like a major expansion of Obamacare, that would have been considered pretty far left not long ago.
That said, I do worry that if Biden becomes president he will compromise too easily; progressives will have to hold his feet to the fire, and make sure that incrementalism doesn’t turn into preemptive surrender.
Sanders, however, despite his last-minute attempts to link himself to Obama, is committed to a strategy of maximalism, without compromise. I understand that strategy’s emotional appeal, especially to his young supporters. But everything we know suggests that a progressive who insists on going for broke will end up, well, broke.

Census prompts distrust in Fort Worth neighborhood

Texto completo: FORT WORTH — Cristina Otera, 59, has never filled out the U.S. census survey, even though she’s lived at the same yellow corner house where she raised her children and now grandchildren for more than two decades.
Otera lives in the United Riverside neighborhood two miles east of downtown Fort Worth, on the other side of the Trinity River and south of Airport Freeway. This area is one of the hardest to count in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
In 2010, less than 60% of the households in the area returned their census by mail, forcing enumerators to visit the neighborhood to fill out the questionnaire in person. United Riverside is also at a high risk for the undercount of young children for the 2020 census, according to the bureau and the Center for Urban Research at City University of New York.
Every year, $675 billion in federal funding for transportation, food stamps, school lunches and children’s health insurance is allocated nationwide using census data from local communities. So an undercount means those communities might not get as much as they need, and local taxpayers and nonprofits end up making up the difference.
In 2016 alone, Texas received more than $59 billion through 55 federal spending programs guided by data derived from the 2010 census, according to a 2019 George Washington University study.
To curb this risk, the bureau began sending postcards in February inviting people to respond online, by phone or by mail. The paper questionnaire will arrive at most households this month with instructions in English and 12 other languages.
The bureau also plans to begin a campaign dubbed Statistics in Schools to help teach children about the census in hopes they’ll influence their parents and take additional educational materials home.
Otera said she didn’t receive anything in the mail in 2010, and no one from the bureau came to her house. She said if she gets it this year, she probably would not fill it out.
“Because it doesn’t affect me,” Otero said in Spanish. “It’s all politics, and I don’t like to get involved in things like that.”
The census, which is mandated by the U.S. Constitution, does affect politics. Every 10 years it determines how the 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives are distributed among the 50 states. Texas stands to gain up to three seats in Congress. The 2020 census will also be used to redraw district maps and help shape the creation of two new City Council districts in Fort Worth.
But what Otero did not know was that the free school lunches her grandchildren receive at Versia L. Williams Elementary, directly across the street from her home, are also affected by the census.
“That’s why it’s so important to get the count right,” said Karen Molinar, the link between the Fort Worth school district and the bureau’s efforts to educate the public about the importance of filling out the census. “If we don’t, that money, it goes somewhere else, and we end up stretched thin and struggling to find other means to make it up.”
Nationwide, an estimated 1 million children under 5 were not counted in 2010, the most of any age group, according to the bureau.
Texas ranked No. 1, with 102,406 children under 5 who were not counted, followed by California with 101,854 and Florida with 71,307, according to a publication from the Count All Kids Committee, made up of national, state and local children’s organizations across the U.S.
Because of the undercount, Texas has lost almost $119 million a year since 2010 for federally funded health, safety and well-being support for children and families.
In Tarrant County, 6,800, or 4%, of children under 5 were missed, according to a census data analysis by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. In 2016, the National Association of Latino Elected Officials found that 4,000 of the county’s children who were missed were Latino.
Children in households like Otera’s, where a child is cared for during the day while parents work, are likely not to be counted. Children who live with a single parent or in a home with several generations or families are also at risk of being missed, according to the bureau.
Because of these challenges and the federal money tied to population, California state leaders set aside $187.2 million toward community outreach and media campaigns to reach hard-to-count areas, more than any other state. Texas lawmakers did not budget any money toward census efforts, leaving it up to the bureau and the cities to ensure an accurate count.
In January 2019, Arlington set aside $30,000 toward census outreach efforts and started a monthly complete count committee. In April, Fort Worth announced its own outreach committee targeting schools, government, churches, businesses, the media and community organizations.
Molinar heads the education subcommittee and is also the chief of staff for the Fort Worth school district’s Policy and Planning Department. Molinar started at the district as a first grade teacher more than 20 years ago and is confident that if parents hear from teachers about the importance of filling out the census, they will be more willing to participate.
“We’ve built a relationship with our families by meeting them where they are,” Molinar said. “It has taken years to build that trust.”
In March 2019, President Donald Trump’s administration decided to add a question on citizenship status to the 2020 census. More than two dozen states and cities sued the administration, arguing the change would violate the Constitution and cause fewer people to be counted.
The U.S. Supreme Court blocked the question in June, a month after evidence from a deceased GOP strategist emerged that the Trump administration wanted to add the question to help the Republican Party skew political boundaries to their advantage when redistricting begins in 2021, according to a report by The New York Times.
Mireya Flores, 45, whose 6-year-old daughter, Miriam, and 6-year-old niece, Anali Espinoza, also attend Williams Elementary, said she did not know the question had been thrown out.
“I have family members that don’t have any papers,” Flores said, referring to the immigration status of several relatives living in her household. “I don’t trust that they are not going to use it against us.”
Title 13 of the U.S. Code requires that responses to Census Bureau surveys be kept confidential and used for statistical purposes only. Unlawful disclosure is a federal crime punishable by a $250,000 fine or five years in prison, or both, according to the census website.
A colorful flyer children nationwide will receive from school states: “The Census Bureau will never share information with immigration enforcement agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), law enforcement agencies like the police or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or allow this information to be used to determine eligibility for government benefits.”
The Census Bureau is spending $50 million on ads targeting Latinos to help combat the scare over the citizenship question, Politico reported in February.
In 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation allocated some $3.3 billion to Texas through the Highway Planning and Construction program, the fifth-largest amount of federal assistance based on census data.
In 2016, 325 census-guided federal spending programs distributed more than $900 billion to state and local governments, nonprofits, businesses, and households across the U.S., according to a study by Andrew Reamer, a research professor at George Washington University.
Texas received more than $59 billion through these federal grants. Despite being the second-most populous state, it still ranked 43rd among states in federal grants received per resident in 2016, according to the state comptroller’s office.
Everyone living in the U.S. is required by law to be counted by the 2020 census. The official census day is April 1.

Texto completo: Sunday is International Women’s Day, and to celebrate we’re spotlighting 10 fantastic female talents who were scheduled to play South by Southwest.
Moonchild Sanelly
Hometown: Port Elizabeth, South Africa
On her excellent 2019 EP, “Nüdes,” the Afroclub chanter issues dancehall directives with sexy defiance and stylish flair over electropop grooves that smash together elements of hip-hop, house and Kwaito, a down-tempo club style that originated in Johannesburg. She’s been sweeping the European club scene, and with recent collabs with Beyoncé, Gorillaz and Major Lazer under her belt, she’s about to break Stateside.
Cifika
Hometown: Seoul, South Korea
At SXSW 2018, the singer said she was “trying to push the boundaries” of Korean music beyond K-pop. She described her sound as “kind
of future, psychedelic, electronic.” With bubbling melodic loops, moody vocals and haunting riffs, her dark electro-pop has been winning fans around the globe.
Céu
Hometown: Sao Paulo, Brazil
With plaintive vocals that betray just the hint of a rasp, the Brazilian standout unwinds a beguiling psych-pop tale of longing and loss on “Corpocontinente,” the lead single from her new album “Apká!” On the new release, the singer draws on her background in everything from samba to reggae to tropical club grooves to create new soundscapes.
Jehnny Beth
Hometown: Paris, France
The day after David Bowie died, the frontwoman of the critically acclaimed British post-punk outfit Savages listened to his swan song, “Blackstar.” Gripped by its power, she told The New York Times, she recognized the way an album can be “an imprint of your vision of the world” that “will last longer than you will.” It drove her to create her debut solo album “as if I was going to die,” she said. “To Love Is To Live” is due out in May, and the first tracks are “Flower,” a simmering tale of unrequited lust, and “I’m the Man,” an industrial beatdown with an incongruously sentimental interlude.
Otoboke Beaver
Hometown: Kyoto, Japan
Brutally aggressive but adorably dressed, the ladies of the all-female Japanese punk outfit don the image of airbrushed perfection that characterizes Asian pop groups, then subvert it the moment they begin to play. At last year’s SXSW opening party, vocalist Accorinrin sneered, snarled and screeched into the mic, while the band at her back unleashed a frenzy of furious noise. Guitarist Yoyoyoshie gleefully abused her six-string, pounding out maniacal licks with a trickster grin, tossed herself into the crowd multiple times and, at one point, screamed into her shoe.
Beabadoobee
Hometown: London, United Kingdom
The lo-fi ode to life’s simple pleasures “Coffee” made the 19-year-old Filipina Brit a SoundCloud sensation. With solid followups such as the buoyant love lament “She Plays Bass” and the lovely celebration of awkward high school shuffling “Dance With Me,” she claims her place in the new generation of singer-songwriters who are rewriting the definition of teen pop.
Sudan Archives
Hometown: Cincinnati, Ohio
“Athena,” the 2019 release from the vocalist and violinist who draws inspiration from Sudanese fiddlers, is a breathtaking work, rich with lush, layered compositions and expansive emotional scope. Weaving cinematic swells of strings with bold vocal loops and breathy poetry that slides into song, she creates second generation neo-soul with a luxurious new texture.
Arlo Parks
Hometown: London, United Kingdom
The 19-year-old singer-songwriter spent her high school years listening to emo music and studying poets such as Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath.

Texto completo: Remember your grandmother's avocado-green kitchen? It could soon be yours. Or maybe it'll be pink, mauve, emerald green or buttercup. Anything but white, because the revolt against the white kitchen has begun.
Last November, the cover of Elle Decor featured a Steven Gambrel-designed kitchen awash in a shiny turquoise - even the ceiling gleamed like an iridescent underwater wonderland. On Pinterest between November 2018 and November 2019, searches for dark green cabinets jumped 367%, plum kitchens went up 107% and pink kitchen walls spiked 121%.
For decades now, cabinets have been relegated to white, brown or maybe black, and it's been even longer since appliances were allowed to be anything but stainless steel. But the Instagram kitchen - invariably a clean backdrop of basic Shaker cabinets, simple subway backsplashes and marble countertops - finally has some competition.
Jenny Dina Kirschner, an interior designer in New York, recently painted the cabinets pink for a client in Long Island, giving the room a decidedly '80s vibe somewhere between mauve and millennial pink. The color picked up the pinkish tones in the Calacatta Vagli marble countertop.
"We're starting to see more daring use of color," Kirschner said. "It's a rebellion against the white kitchen."
Breaking the mold is risky when 43% of homeowners choose white cabinets and a third choose white countertops, according to a 2019 Houzz report. Try something bolder than wood cabinets or black soapstone countertops and you might fail. Unlike an unfortunate coat of paint on the living room walls, the wrong choice of cabinetry could cost a homeowner tens of thousands of dollars. And money aside, it's not easy to rip out that chartreuse backsplash if you later regret it.
Yet cracks in the color-free facade are emerging. Between 2018 and 2019, BHG.com consumer insights found a 115% spike in interest in cabinet paint trends and a 10% increase in interest in colorful kitchen cabinetry. And from March 2018 to March 2019, interest in blue and green for paint and home decor rose 50%. Navy cabinets have become increasingly popular along with two-toned ones, with choices like blue for the lower ones and blond wood for the uppers. Greens of all shades have been nudging their way onto the stage, too, appearing as emerald cabinetry, avocado backsplashes and sage pendants.
In a throwback to the 1970s, the age of wacky colored appliances is also back. Want a retro fridge? Big Chill carries them in colors like beach blue, cherry red and pink lemonade. The appliance company BlueStar offers hundreds of color options, as well as custom colors for its products, letting customers personalize down to the color of the doors, trim and dials. Have a specific shade of purple in mind for your oven? Dacor can match a swatch you provide to the color of its appliances.
"Anything goes these days," said Gideon Mendelson, an interior designer in Manhattan. He is currently designing a yellow kitchen for a couple on the North Fork of Long Island, which he described as "a sophisticated buttercup. It's not going to be sweet and cutesy. It's not quite mustard. It's happier than that."
Who doesn't want a happy kitchen? With the world so dreary, a little yellow can go a long way. In these uncertain times, we're drawn to colors that don't need to be impeccable, that can hide the messiness of life. "There's a sense of energy and nourishment in bright colors," said Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of "Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness."
Alessandra Wood, vice president of style for Modsy, an online interior-design service, said that homeowners are looking for comfort and coziness in design choices, so why not our kitchens, too?
"In this really unstable world, we are looking for anything that makes us feel comfortable, and we are definitely turning to our homes to do that," she said.
Just look at the color Pantone chose for its color of the year: classic blue, because it "highlights our desire for a dependable and stable foundation." Paint companies Sherwin-Williams and PPG also ushered in the new decade with blue as their picks of the year in a collective nod to what might soon be our new neutral - call it bluetral.
We're also living in our homes differently. After decades of relentless moving, Americans are moving at the lowest rates since the U.S. census began tracking our mobility, with fewer than 10% of Americans moving between 2018 and 2019. Baby boomers are aging in place and millennials, facing rising housing costs and stagnating wages, are less likely to house hop. With no plans to stake a "for sale" sign in the front yard, why commit to the safe and listless colors of a staged house?
Greige, that dreary hue that is neither gray nor beige, but took over our homes for over a decade, is decidedly out. The relentlessly white kitchen may be next. It made a lot of sense in the era of house flipping. White looks clean and is unlikely to offend a potential buyer. Who hates white? And if your home is perpetually one renovation away from its next open house, white is a natural go-to color. It's a kitchen designed for future buyers, not the specific tastes of the current inhabitants.
But let's face it: White looks clean only when it is clean. The rest of the time, it is not the most practical color for a room that regularly gets splashed with marinara sauce. There is something to be said for a little color to hide the imperfections.
"We're living in our spaces longer, so there's an extra level of consideration that people are giving to them," Wood said. "We're thinking, 'How do I make this space into a space that I really feel comfortable in?' "
So if there is no buyer on the horizon, if the kitchen remodel is just for you, the view widens. Why not wash the whole room in turquoise? It doesn't really matter what some fictional buyer might think. You can be you and paint the cabinets pink.
Caption: The days of the all-white kitchen and plain stainless-steel appliances may be numbered.

Texto completo: Since Ron Barrett illustrated the classic children's picture book "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs" in 1978, the forecast for our world has become considerably more dire.
Fast-forward 42 years to "The Top 10 as We Hit Bottom," a darkly satirical but real collection of top 10 lists that highlight the predicament global warming and other impending catastrophes have put us into. The book has been researched and written by Jim Parry and illustrated by Barrett.
Although some might call this book a collection of "fake news," the lists are compiled and culled from respected authorities like NASA, the United Nations and the Union of Concerned Scientists. The creators think the heartwarming illustrations, to temper the harsh messages of the text, will have readers laughing their way all the way down in the race to the bottom.
The book's cover, reminiscent of the box for Screaming Yellow Zonkers (are you with me?), says the lists have been compiled by The Center for Impending Doom, for which Parry, voted Class Cynic of his high school graduating class, claims to be the founder.
The Top 10 may not solve any of these earthly issues, but can go a long way to increase awareness among the population. Among the topics of note: global warming, nuclear war, cyberwar, biowar, pandemics, earthquakes, tsunamis, supervolcanoes, blizzards, hurricanes and tornadoes.
Pumped yet? OK: avalanches, landslides, wildfires, floods, droughts, famines, asteroids, alien attacks, solar storms, doomsdays past and future. There, feel better?
So here's 10 of the many Top 10 lists to whet your appetite for Earth's impending doom:
"Top 10 species we'll lose to climate change"
"Top 10 avalanches mostly caused by global warming"
"Top 10 climate change doubters"
"Top 10 times we almost had a nuclear war"
"Top 10 things that will happen when the Yellowstone Supervolcano erupts"
"Top 10 ways to try to stop an asteroid"
"Top 10 signs that the earth is about to be swallowed by a black hole"
"Top 10 ways a particle accelerator mishap could destroy the world"
"Top 10 end-of-world cults you can join now"
"Top 10 ways aliens could kill us all"
So why did Barrett, a legendary children's book illustrator, take on this project? "It's not a very long journey," he said. "The New York Times recently recommended 'Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs' as one of the best books to teach children about climate change. It is, after all, a book about the weather gone awry. Unfortunately we have no toast boats to escape from becoming toast ourselves."
"I feel very strongly that the earth will become uninhabitable unless we do something to eliminate all carbon emissions by tomorrow morning. Yet Parry's meticulously researched book is about more than warming - it's all the ways forces in and out of our control threaten our existence."
The lists are more than just lists. Listen to Parry's introduction of the top species we'll lose to climate change: "The polar bear is the poster-creature of climate change victims, but these ten (on the list) are actually closer to extinction. One of them - a mosaic-tailed rat - is already gone. Oh, we don't care about losing a rat? Hey, just as rats leaving a sinking ship is a warning, maybe we should be warned."
The titles of some of the lists are enough to arouse curiosity, or at least make you read them a second time: "The Top 10 Steps by Which the Biggest Opportunity to Combat Global Warming Was Lost, 1979-1989." Let me see, where was I in 1979?
Or: "The Top 10 Ways the Universe Could - Tomorrow or 2,000 Billion Years From Now - End."
Among the Top 10 Quotes About the End of the World, here's one from Mark Twain: "When the end of the world comes, I want to be in Kentucky, because everything there happens 20 years after it happens anywhere else."
Wasn't life so much simpler when your only worry was whether it would be raining meatballs later in the afternoon?

Why Hank Azaria retired Apu on 'The Simpsons' CELEBRITIES

Texto completo: Hank Azaria recently said goodbye to one of television's most beloved but also controversial animated characters. And he's finally explaining why.
Azaria, who is perhaps best known for bringing to life Apu in the long-running sitcom "The Simpsons," told The New York Times in a recent interview that he made his decision after many years of reflecting, processing and listening to the voices of people who explained why Apu was hurtful.
"Once I realized that that was the way this character was thought of, I just didn't want to participate in it anymore," Azaria said. "It just didn't feel right."
For three decades, the actor has voiced dozens of inhabitants of the fictional town of Springfield. But Apu is perhaps the most problematic, especially through a modern lens: He is an immigrant from India who owns the local Kwik-E-Mart convenience store and is known for his catchphrase, "Thank you! Come again!" His thick Indian accent and singsong voice depict him as simple-minded, and even his last name, Nahasapeemapetilon, has been thought to welcome ridicule.
Through the years, "The Simpsons" actor and the show faced increasing criticism from people who find the character an offensive, racial stereotype. Many of the critics are of Indian descent.
The show's executive producers told The New York Times in a statement that they "respect Hank's journey in regard to Apu. We have granted his wish to no longer voice the character."
But the fate of Apu remains unknown.
"Apu is beloved worldwide. We love him too. Stay tuned," the statement added.
Azaria first announced he was retiring the convenience store proprietor in January on the website /Film.
During an appearance on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" in 2018, Azaria addressed the mounting controversy and added that he was "perfectly willing and happy to step aside and transition (Apu) into something new ... it just feels like the right thing to do to me."
Azaria was initially unwilling to hear the arguments about why Apu's character was divisive, he told The New York Times. But he started listening and now believes his experience can spark more dialogue about representation in popular culture.
"What happened with this character is a window into an important issue," said Azaria. "It's a good way to start the conversation. I can be accountable and try to make up for it as best I can."

Messing with the Jesus John Turturro brings back (beloved?) 'Lebowski' character

Texto completo: When last we encountered Jesus Quintana, the bumptious Latino bowler was going door to door in his new neighborhood, meekly sharing that he was a registered sex offender. That was in 1998, the year the Jesus (John Turturro) cameo-ed in Joel and Ethan Coen's stoner noir "The Big Lebowski."
Turturro reprises the role in the farce "The Jesus Rolls" - which he wrote and directed with the Coens' blessing. It is loosely based on Bertrand Blier's 1974 movie "Going Places," in which two French knuckleheads steal cars, grope women and boink themselves into existentially richer moments of being. I spoke with Turturro about resurrecting the Jesus, zealous disciples and more.

Q: The Jesus of "Lebowski" has just served six months behind bars for what a rival bowler calls "exposing himself to an 8-year-old." Ethan Coen told me that after he and his brother conceived the Jesus in a "purple onesie," it was a short step to making him a pedophile.
A: I never dwelled much on that aspect of the Jesus. I was more embarrassed by the codpiece Joel and Ethan made me wear when I went door to door.

Q: In the new movie, how do you turn a cartoonish child molester into a cartoonish non-child-molester?
A: Pedophilia is a real thing, a horrifying thing. But "The Jesus Rolls" is a comedy, so I said let's address the crime and move on. A flashback in the opening scene reveals it was all a big misunderstanding involving the Jesus' penis.

Q: How big a misunderstanding?
A: Big enough to get him arrested.

Q: Another distinguishing feature of the Jesus is his voice, which is gentle and disarmingly high.
A: I first used the voice in Reinaldo Povod's play "Nijinsky Choked His Chicken" at the Public in 1987. Rei's father had just been released from prison, and that's how he spoke.

Q: Part of what made the Jesus so endearing were his extravagant gestures. He taunted opponents by shimmying and strutting and backpedaling like a cocky prizefighter.
A: A lot of those moves were modeled on Muhammad Ali's, especially his psych-out job on Sonny Liston.

Q: Ethan says you got more mail and, alarmingly, more marriage proposals from the role than any other.
A: I got all kinds of women letters, men letters. Weird ones, racy ones. "I love your body." "I love your outfit." "I'd love to take your outfit off." I made "Lebowski" after returning to the States from Europe, where I filmed "The Truce." I played the writer Primo Levi returning home to Italy from Auschwitz after World War II, and I'd lost a lot of weight for the part - so much that a couple of New York gossip columnists speculated that I was dying. A Fleet Street hack even called my mother in Queens and asked, "Is it true your son has brain cancer?" A friend suggested that I hold a press conference with my head bandaged and thank God for my miraculous recovery.

Q: "The Jesus Rolls" nods toward "Lebowski," but it's not a sequel. Basically, you've inserted a "Lebowski" character into "Going Places" and updated that story to the present day. How did you decide to hitch a ride on a 46-year-old road movie about aimless joyriders whose entire objective is to keep driving until the tank is empty?
A: "Going Places" made a tremendous impression on me. I was 19 and in college when I saw the movie at a second-run theater in upstate New York. It wasn't long after the student riots in Paris, a time of hippies and revolutionaries, and the film was a celebration of freedom in a world of bourgeoise hypocrisy. I was shocked not just by what I was seeing onscreen but by my laughter at the shocking things I was seeing. I remember thinking, "Holy mackerel!"

Q: The original title of "Going Places" was "Les Valseuses," French slang for testicles. The brutish leads - Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere - treated females like they existed solely to service mankind. Roger Ebert condemned the film for what he called its "palpable and embarrassing" hatred of women.
A: And yet Pauline Kael was a big champion. She saw the Depardieu and Dewaere characters as guileless raw innocents for whom almost everything backfires. To me, they were like cavemen - crude, misogynistic and at times a little rough - but they became generous cavemen. They seemed to genuinely care for Miou-Miou, their lover and companion. They also cared about the little band of outsiders they formed with a weathered convict played by Jeanne Moreau, and Isabelle Huppert, a teenage runaway. The generosity of the powerless appeals to some rebellious part of me.
Q: In "Jesus Rolls," you stand in for Depardieu, the mindless mastermind, and Bobby Cannavale is your partner in crime. Audrey Tautou takes the place of Miou-Miou and Susan Sarandon replaces Moreau. How closely did you hew to the "Going Places" screenplay?
A: I intentionally left the screenplay way behind. As a writer and actor it's important to remember you're not those characters, that's not your language, you're not that age. After rewatching "Going Places," I transposed the narrative and read Blier's novel, which is filthy, broader in its concerns and the basis of the film. Then I asked him for permission to repurpose the book and make the two drifters a few decades older. My pitch was simple: Those guys are now middle-aged and they're still idiots. And Blier said, "OK, as long as they're stupid."

Q: The Coen brothers are forever retelling the story of Job. The question isn't whether God exists but what he's up to. Do we have a friend in the Jesus?
A: I really like religious movies, especially if they're about nuns. I was thinking of calling this picture "Jesus, Mary and Peter" because the three principals do good deeds. They solve problems. They don't hurt anybody. Even when they steal a car, they bring it back. Maybe in 20 more years I'll make another movie about the Jesus. As we all know, he already came back once.
Caption: John Turturro got the Coen Brothers' blessing before writing and directing "The Jesus Rolls," which centers on an iconic Coen film character.

Texto completo: Colum McCann's new novel, "Apeirogon," is based on an uplifting true story. It's about two fathers - Rami Elhanan, an Israeli, and Bassam Aramin, a Palestinian - who each lost a young daughter to senseless violence. They have become friends and work together, through an organization called Combatants for Peace, to bring the opposing sides together.
McCann takes their story and drops it to the ground, where it shatters. To read "Apeirogon" is to watch him pick up the shards. As befits a writer who ruminates about the nature of storytelling, there are 1,001 of these shards, each numbered, in an homage to "One Thousand and One Nights," the collection of Middle Eastern folk tales.
This is an early warning sign. It is possible to admire "One Thousand and One Nights" while having learned through hard experience that a writer who derives too much inspiration from it is generally one to avoid, unless what's desired is a self-inflicted intellectual glitter-bombing. Time magazine film critic Stephanie Zacharek, writing on Twitter, recently called "storytelling" a "jazz-hands word." "Apeirogon" is a jazz-hands novel.
In many of McCann's 1,001 shards, we follow Rami and Bassam in something like real time. They attend meetings, give lectures, worry about crossing border checkpoints. In others, we flash back to earlier points in their lives. From multiple angles, we witness the events that led to their daughters being killed. Rami and Bassam no longer want to silo their suffering. They want for their grandchildren what the narrator of Israeli writer David Grossman's novel "See Under: Love" wanted, "to live in this world from birth to death and know nothing of war." You sense you would like Rami and Bassam if you got to know them.
But we are not allowed to settle into the texture and nuance of their experience. We're evicted from the narrative on almost every page so that McCann can tweezer in arty and only vaguely relevant facts.
He's going for a collage effect. He'd like to chime with Shirley MacLaine in "The Apartment," who looks into a broken mirror and says to Jack Lemmon: "I like it that way. Makes me look the way I feel."
McCann's shards are set apart from one another on the page by a thumb's-width of white space. This trending method of organizing a novel (for example, Jenny Offill) is not yet insufferable but has a trap door: It exaggerates a writer's weaknesses.
Offill's weakness is that, despite her comic tone, her wit can fizzle. McCann's is that, even in his best novels, such as the National Book Award-winning "Let the Great World Spin," his work can be humorless and self-important.
"Apeirogon" - the title refers to a shape with a limitless number of sides - is so solemn, so certain of its own goodness and moral value, that it tips almost instantly over into camp, into corn. It's as if the author were gunning for the Paulo Coelho Chair in Maudlin Schlock.
In an author's note at the front of this novel, McCann writes: "We live our lives, suggested Rilke, in widening circles that reach out across the entire expanse." McCann has a gift for quoting others at their most flatulent: "The only interesting thing is to live, said Mitterand"; "Hertzl wrote: If you divide death by life, you will find a circle."
For added effect, McCann repeats lines he likes, such as the Mitterand quote, again and again.
McCann's numbered shards - they ascend from 1 to 500, then turn and begin to descend - offer structure in place of content. "Apeirogon" is not a meal but a table littered with ingredients: a paw of garlic, a frozen lamb shank, two potatoes, a big knob of celeriac, three peas.
When you insist on a lot of white space between paragraphs and sometimes between single sentences, and if your work is humid, the effect can unintentionally verge on the amusing. Each sentence has an apricot-colored scarf tied around its neck. And it's as if the reader has been given 10 seconds and a bong hit between each one; time to squint and nod and say, "So true."
As with Bob Geldof speaking of Ethiopian famine at the time of Live Aid, McCann's ardor is unmistakable. But his analysis of the predicaments that face the Middle East is not raw or original or sophisticated. His message is optimistic - we need to talk more, and understand each other's humanity - and banal.
Great writing, Walt Whitman wrote, is composed of words that are "whirled like chain-shot rocks." Enough rocks have been whirled in the Middle East. And this novel is only tossing around pillows.

All-white kitchen rebellion

Texto completo: Remember your grandmother's avocado-green kitchen? It could soon be yours. Or maybe it'll be pink, mauve, emerald green or buttercup. Anything but white, because the revolt against the white kitchen has begun.
Last November, the cover of Elle Decor featured a Steven Gambrel-designed kitchen awash in a shiny turquoise -- even the ceiling gleamed like an iridescent underwater wonderland. On Pinterest between November 2018 and November 2019, searches for dark green cabinets jumped 367%, plum kitchens went up 107% and pink kitchen walls spiked 121%.
For decades now, cabinets have been relegated to white, brown or maybe black, and it's been even longer since appliances were allowed to be anything but stainless steel. But the Instagram kitchen -- invariably a clean backdrop of basic Shaker cabinets, simple subway backsplashes and marble countertops -- finally has some competition.
Jenny Dina Kirschner, an interior designer in New York, recently painted the cabinets pink for a client in Long Island, giving the room a decidedly '80s vibe somewhere between mauve and millennial pink. The color picked up the pinkish tones in the Calacatta Vagli marble countertop.
"We're starting to see more daring use of color," Kirschner said. "It's a rebellion against the white kitchen."
Breaking the mold is risky when 43% of homeowners choose white cabinets and a third choose white countertops, according to a 2019 Houzz report. Try something bolder than wood cabinets or black soapstone countertops and you might fail. Unlike an unfortunate coat of paint on the living room walls, the wrong choice of cabinetry could cost a homeowner tens of thousands of dollars. And money aside, it's not easy to rip out that chartreuse backsplash if you later regret it.
Yet cracks in the color-free facade are emerging. Between 2018 and 2019, BHG.com consumer insights found a 115% spike in interest in cabinet paint trends and a 10% increase in interest in colorful kitchen cabinetry. And from March 2018 to March 2019, interest in blue and green for paint and home decor rose 50%. Navy cabinets have become increasingly popular along with two-toned ones, with choices like blue for the lower ones and blond wood for the uppers. Greens of all shades have been nudging their way onto the stage, too, appearing as emerald cabinetry, avocado backsplashes and sage pendants.
In a throwback to the 1970s, the age of wacky colored appliances is also back. Want a retro fridge? Big Chill carries them in colors like beach blue, cherry red and pink lemonade. The appliance company BlueStar offers hundreds of color options, as well as custom colors for its products, letting customers personalize down to the color of the doors, trim and dials. Have a specific shade of purple in mind for your oven? Dacor can match a swatch you provide to the color of its appliances.
"Anything goes these days," said Gideon Mendelson, an interior designer in Manhattan. He is currently designing a yellow kitchen for a couple on the North Fork of Long Island, which he described as "a sophisticated buttercup. It's not going to be sweet and cutesy. It's not quite mustard. It's happier than that."
Who doesn't want a happy kitchen? With the world so dreary, a little yellow can go a long way. In these uncertain times, we're drawn to colors that don't need to be impeccable, that can hide the messiness of life. "There's a sense of energy and nourishment in bright colors," said Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of "Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness."
Alessandra Wood, vice president of style for Modsy, an online interior-design service, said that homeowners are looking for comfort and coziness in design choices, so why not our kitchens, too?
"In this really unstable world, we are looking for anything that makes us feel comfortable, and we are definitely turning to our homes to do that," she said.
Just look at the color Pantone chose for its color of the year: classic blue, because it "highlights our desire for a dependable and stable foundation." Paint companies Sherwin-Williams and PPG also ushered in the new decade with blue as their picks of the year in a collective nod to what might soon be our new neutral -- call it bluetral.
We're also living in our homes differently. After decades of relentless moving, Americans are moving at the lowest rates since the U.S. census began tracking our mobility, with fewer than 10% of Americans moving between 2018 and 2019. Baby boomers are aging in place and millennials, facing rising housing costs and stagnating wages, are less likely to house hop. With no plans to stake a "for sale" sign in the front yard, why commit to the safe and listless colors of a staged house?
Greige, that dreary hue that is neither gray nor beige, but took over our homes for over a decade, is decidedly out. The relentlessly white kitchen may be next. It made a lot of sense in the era of house flipping. White looks clean and is unlikely to offend a potential buyer. Who hates white? And if your home is perpetually one renovation away from its next open house, white is a natural go-to color. It's a kitchen designed for future buyers, not the specific tastes of the current inhabitants.
But let's face it: White looks clean only when it is clean. The rest of the time, it is not the most practical color for a room that regularly gets splashed with marinara sauce. There is something to be said for a little color to hide the imperfections.
"We're living in our spaces longer, so there's an extra level of consideration that people are giving to them," Wood said. "We're thinking, 'How do I make this space into a space that I really feel comfortable in?' "
So if there is no buyer on the horizon, if the kitchen remodel is just for you, the view widens. Why not wash the whole room in turquoise? It doesn't really matter what some fictional buyer might think. You can be you and paint the cabinets pink.

Texto completo: Driving on the "other" side of the road was the least of their problems. One wayward driver in Mexico was certain his wrong turn had invited a police shakedown. In Turkey, one breakdown among many ended with local residents helping to build a campfire on a frigid night. In Kenya, a repair took on extra urgency when the travelers realized they were in the middle of a path for drug smugglers.
Getting behind the wheel in a foreign country can give tourists greater freedom to explore but also more ways for things to go awry. For many travelers, the extra adventures are worth the troubles.
It was a torrid, humid day in La Paz, Mexico, two years ago when Chris Collard accidentally turned his truck the wrong way down a one-way road. He quickly realized his mistake and reversed out, but a police officer noticed his error.
"I thought, 'Here we go,'" said Collard, whose experiences with police in other countries have not always been pleasant. An international photojournalist and owner of Adventure Architects, he was expecting to be forced to pay a bribe.
After he explained he was a little bit lost, the officer went to his car and returned with a map, no ticket in hand. "I can help you find this place. Follow me."
What could have been a tense situation instead became a warm memory.
Ray Hyland, a professional adventurer who puts on overland rally automotive events in the United States, and his family bought a 1954 Series 1 Land Rover for $225 in 2012, got it running and shipped it to Britain. They eventually spent nine months driving it from London to Singapore. They noticed on travel forums that people "felt they needed to build a hugely customized vehicle to go camping or 'overlanding,' " Hyland said. "We wanted to point out the folly ... using an extreme example." All five family members, along with their camping gear, were stuffed into the vehicle.
"Maybe not funny at the time, but it broke down every day," he said. One night when it was 0 degrees Fahrenheit in eastern Turkey, "helpful locals tried to build a fire under the engine to warm it up," he added.
The Hylands had planned for the breakdowns. It was cheaper to fix the Land Rover on the road with inexpensive local parts and labor than restoring it before they left Chilliwack (near Vancouver, British Columbia), where they live. Local people stopped often to help, even if language was a barrier.
"Once I improvised and used a pencil to repair a failing carburetor by screwing it into the hole left when a screw fell out on the highway south of Istanbul," Hyland said with a chuckle.
Another part, a seal between the engine and transmission, failed as they were climbing the Himalayan foothills. No spares were readily available, so a mechanic in Darjeeling fashioned one out of leather from an old Gurkha soldier's hat.
Dan Grec, a world traveler, photographer and author, said road trips were the quintessential vacation in his native Australia.
"Growing up, my family went on many camping trips around southern and eastern Australia. This is where I got my love of going new places, camping and just enjoying nature," he said.
In June 2016, he hatched a plan to travel across Africa. Starting in Morocco, Grec drove south on the west coast to Cape Town in South Africa before he headed back north to finish in Alexandria, Egypt. He's proud of this particular adventure: "The entire journey spanned three years through 35 countries," he said. "All told, I drove 54,000 miles."
You don't cover that many miles without some bumps along the way.
In rural Uganda near Lake Albert, after a brief moment of inattention, he crashed his Jeep, and it fell onto its side. No one was hurt, thankfully, and he got a helping hand from local villagers to pull his Jeep back onto its wheels.
Africa brings particular challenges, which Collard has experienced as well.
"Late one night in Kenya," he said, "we got lost on a rough two-track near the Somali border, and our '73 Range Rover stopped running. Laying on my back in the driver's-side footwell, I tried to repair a broken throttle cable with my Leatherman, baling wire, Gorilla tape and headlamp while my buddy Sam Watson kept guard for lions and other critters."
Soon, trucks loaded with bales of khat and armed guards zoomed by -- and they realized they were on a smuggler's route, he said.
There's a common theme with traveling, no matter what happens. Local residents are happy to help, and a friendly smile goes a long way, especially if you don't know the language.
"People are the same around the world. They simply want to go to work and come home to their families," Hyland said. "This is a perspective we can forget when we watch the news."
Marianne Hyland has relished traveling the world with her husband and three sons. "Experiencing the different cultures of the countries we visited and getting to meet the people of other countries is firsthand experience that language and culture is not a barrier to kindness."

Texto completo: At least four Saudi princes have been ensnared in a wave of detentions ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a person close to the royal family said Saturday.
Prince Nayef bin Ahmed, who held senior positions in the military, was detained Friday along with at least three other senior members of the royal family.
The full extent of the roundup remains unclear.
Analysts who follow the royal family said Saturday that the latest wave of arrests raised questions about whether Crown Prince Mohammed would soon seek to take formal power from his aging father, King Salman, 84.
Others suggested that the crown prince, who has established himself as the de facto ruler of the kingdom in the name of his father, was worried about discontent within the royal family as plummeting oil prices strained the country's budget and economy.
Prince Nayef has held positions in the interior ministry and military and once headed army intelligence, according to a Saudi military website.
But he did not appear to have any position in the government at the time of his detention.
He was detained together with his father, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, who is the last surviving full brother of the king.
"It is surprising he would move on Prince Ahmed with the king's authority still there," said Kristin Smith Diwan, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
The recent wave of arrests has sent tremors of fear through the family and raised questions about the status of the king, three people close to the family said.
The king was photographed in recent days meeting with the visiting British foreign secretary.
A doctor with ties to the Saudi hospital that treats many royals said the hospital had received no word that the king was ill.
"It looks like MBS is just taking out all rivals," said Michael Stephens, a scholar at the Royal United Services Institute, using the initials for the crown prince.
"It is either the case that the king is on his deathbed or MBS just thinks this is a good time to bury the bad news," he said.

Texto completo: Ben Affleck, Oscar-winning writer, director of the Oscar-winning "Argo," better actor than you remember -- and, yes, alcoholic divorce -- has four movies coming out this year.
Dad Bod Batman has been banished, and actual films are back on his docket, including his first all-on-him movie in four years: "The Way Back," a poignant sports drama that arrives in theaters March 6. Affleck plays a reluctant high school basketball coach with big problems -- he's a puffy, willful, fall-down drunk who blows up his marriage and lands in rehab.
You read that correctly.
"People with compulsive behavior, and I am one, have this kind of basic discomfort all the time that they're trying to make go away," Affleck said. "You're trying to make yourself feel better with eating or drinking or sex or gambling or shopping or whatever. But that ends up making your life worse. Then you do more of it to make that discomfort go away. Then the real pain starts. It becomes a vicious cycle you can't break. That's at least what happened to me.
"I drank relatively normally for a long time. What happened was that I started drinking more and more when my marriage was falling apart. This was 2015, 2016. My drinking, of course, created more marital problems."
Affleck's marriage to Jennifer Garner, with whom he has three children, ended in 2018 after a long separation. He said he still felt guilt but had moved past shame.
"The biggest regret of my life is this divorce," he said. "Shame is really toxic. There is no positive byproduct of shame. It's just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing.
"It's not particularly healthy for me to obsess over the failures -- the relapses -- and beat myself up," he said. "I have certainly made mistakes. I have certainly done things that I regret. But you've got to pick yourself up, learn from it, learn some more, try to move forward."
"The Way Back" was originally called "The Has-Been." That downer of a title was dropped during development as the film became less focused on what a basketball talent the main character had been in high school, Affleck said. Suffice it to say, no star wants to appear on a poster next to the words "The Has-Been," especially not after two box office disappointments. "Justice League" (2017) took in $658 million, a puny sum by superhero standards, and "Live by Night" (2016), a period gangster drama that he also directed, flatlined with $23 million.
Affleck, 47, has been working like a madman to get his career back on track. The hard truth is that the outcome is not guaranteed. Moviegoers, women in particular, will ultimately decide: Is forgiveness for transgressions still something that society in all of its Twitter-fied polarization allows? To some, Affleck is still the guy who broke Garner's heart and who was accused of groping a talk-show host in 2013. "I acted inappropriately," he said of that incident in 2017, as the #MeToo era dawned, "and I sincerely apologize."
Hollywood has certainly granted Affleck clemency. He just finished acting in "Deep Water," a psychological thriller co-starring Ana de Armas ("Knives Out") that's due in theaters in November. He's on Netflix this month in "The Last Thing He Wanted," an abysmally reviewed mystery anchored by Anne Hathaway and directed by Dee Rees. Affleck has also been working with the Oscar-nominated Nicole Holofcener and Matt Damon on the script for "The Last Duel," which begins filming in France this month. Set in the 14th century, "The Last Duel" re-teams Affleck and Damon as screenwriters for the first time since "Good Will Hunting" in 1997; Ridley Scott is directing.
Affleck has not talked much about his alcoholism since completing a third stint in rehab in 2018. (The first two were in 2001 and 2017.) But the arrival of "The Way Back" has made the subject impossible to avoid. Affleck has also accepted that the second word in Alcoholics Anonymous does not apply to him -- certainly not after he (briefly) relapsed in the fall, turning up smashed on TMZ a few months after making it known that he had achieved one year of continuous sobriety.
"Relapse is embarrassing, obviously," he said. "I wish it didn't happen. I really wish it wasn't on the internet for my kids to see."
Growing up in Massachusetts, Affleck saw his own father drunk almost every day.
"My dad didn't really get sober until I was 19," Affleck said.
"The older I've gotten, the more I recognize that my dad did the best he could," he said. "There's a lot of alcoholism and mental illness in my family. The legacy of that is quite powerful and sometimes hard to shake."
Affleck's younger brother, Casey, 44, has spoken about his own alcoholism and sobriety. Their paternal grandmother took her own life in a motel when she was 46. An uncle killed himself with a shotgun. An aunt was a heroin addict.
"It took me a long time to fundamentally, deeply, without a hint of doubt, admit to myself that I am an alcoholic," Ben Affleck said. "The next drink will not be different."
It seemed like a good moment to point out how many stars had started to speak out about getting sober -- Brad Pitt most notably -- and how that was lessening the stigma of addiction and, perhaps, inspiring people with substance problems to seek help. Jamie Lee Curtis, sober for two decades, appeared on the cover of Variety's "recovery" issue in November. Discussing their sobriety in recent books and interviews have been Demi Lovato, Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Simpson, Demi Moore and, of course, Elton John, who has sponsored Eminem.
Affleck cited the sober A-listers Bradley Cooper and Robert Downey Jr. as "guys who have been very supportive and to whom I feel a great sense of gratitude."
"One of the things about recovery that I think people sometimes overlook is the fact that it inculcates certain values. Be honest. Be accountable. Help other people. Apologize when you're wrong."
Let's talk about honesty for a minute. Shouldn't he have been honest from the start about the back tattoo rather than telling "Extra" it was "fake" for a movie?
"I resented that somebody got a picture of it by spying on me," Affleck said, shifting on the sofa where he was sitting. "It felt invasive. But you're right. I could have said, 'That's none of your business.' I guess I got a kick out of messing with 'Extra.' Is your tattoo real or not real? Of course, it's real! No, I put a fake tattoo on my back and then hid it."
Affleck has a habit of putting himself in the crosshairs. He thought it was a good idea to star (with Damon) as a fallen angel in Kevin Smith's "Dogma" (1999), which Disney decided was too blasphemous for its Miramax label to release. Playing Batman as melancholy and middle-aged was certainly not the safe choice. "The Last Duel" has already provoked indignation on social media; Affleck and Damon play a knight and a squire who are forced to duel after a woman's rape accusation.
And now comes "The Way Back," a spare film with a 1970s vibe about a man imprisoned by alcoholism.
How exactly does he make these choices?
Affleck laughed. "I've never been very risk-averse -- for better or worse, obviously," he said. "Regarding 'The Way Back,' the benefits, to me, far outweighed the risks. I found it very therapeutic."

Virus aids fight against salad bars, ladle lickers

Texto completo: Even with all the media attention on coronavirus, we're missing the really big story:
Those disgusting hot food bars and salad bars at various supermarkets and food courts near you.
People put their hands on the lettuce. They cough on the olives. Multiple hands touch the ladles and spoons.
And government does nothing.
Consider that video that went viral before the coronavirus outbreak. It was of a man at the hot food bar at a grocery store, slurping cream of broccoli soup from the ladle. He put his lips and tongue all over that ladle.
Then he put the ladle back into the soup.
Don't tell me the ladle licker is some isolated case. I'm a germaphobe who grew up in the grocery store business, and I've seen some things.
That's why I've always hated salad and hot food bars. The ladle lickers are out there, and you know it.
Coronavirus is serious business. I'm not mocking what could be a pandemic. The government -- national, state and local -- tell us not to panic.
But I'm a news consumer too, and how can you consume endless stories about quarantines, canceled conventions, canceled sporting events, empty hotels and offices, no personal cups at Starbucks and not feel nervous?
And I'm trying to add my own warning about those hot food and salad bars that are out there.
Since many liberal journalists are politically weaponizing the new coronavirus -- one columnist at The New York Times wants to call it "Trumpvirus" -- I might as well join the club and use the virus for my own political purposes.
I want those salad/hot bars wiped off the face of the earth because they have always bothered me, even before the coronavirus panic.
Why hasn't the government outlawed them? Why hasn't that soup sipper been arrested?
And what's the proper deterrent?
I'd ship him to North Korea. If he tried it there -- even if they did have food -- his entire family would be gone by now.
The problem with contagious viruses is that people panic because they know that others don't follow the rules, like the guy with the ladle.
Yes, it would be an overreaction to go medieval on the guy and lop off his hand and take his tongue. We are not living in the Dark Ages, yet, despite what Sen. Chuck Schumer is trying to do to the republic. This isn't "Game of Thrones."
This is still the land of the free. Clearly, nothing would say "You're not free to lick the ladle," like a large pile of hands and a smaller, neater pile of pink tongues. But we are Americans, not bloodthirsty psychos.
Let's just send the ladle lickers to North Korea.
That soup slurper was captured on video a couple of years ago in pre-coronavirus Chicago. But so what? Human nature doesn't change. Remember those stories of barbarians caught licking ice cream, digging their tongues right in the vanilla before putting it back in the grocer's freezer. Need I say more?
Don't tell me people don't reach into a salad bar and grab strawberries with their fingers "just to see if they're sweet." You ever work in a grocery store? You'd find peach pits in among the radicchio.
"I was at a salad bar at our local store, and I was going to get some lettuce," said a responsible journalist. "Another customer whispered, 'Don't touch the lettuce. See that woman over there? She just put her hands all over it.'"
See what I mean?
I suppose we could blame our local Illinois lawmakers -- the ones not dodging subpoenas in federal political corruption investigations.
If Gov. J.B. Pritzker really cared about the people, he'd form a blue-ribbon panel to write a report that no one will read: "Coronavirus Transmission: A Consequence of Hands and Tongues."
But he won't.
To report this story, I visited a grocery store and spotted a nice fellow standing at the hot bar. He was spooning out some disgusting public vegetables for himself.
"Vegetable medley," he said weakly, and smiled.
Vegetable medley sucks, but I didn't say anything. I just stared at him, silently. He edged away.
An epidemiologist on a news site said we must be careful about the utensils at food bars.
"I would say that things like salad bars, you know, we will have to be very diligent about what are touching and all of these utensils that many people might be touching," said Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University. "That would be where I would see the risk of the transmission occurring, more so than the food that we are actually eating."
Food that we are actually eating? There's no "we" here. You eat it. I won't touch it.
Then I called the health department of a large Midwestern city on a lake. No, it wasn't Cleveland.
"While at this time we're not recommending shutting down salad bars and self-serve food stations, we continue to monitor this situation very closely," said the health official.
He said wash your hands, don't touch your face, stay home if sick, get a flu shot, and cover all those coughs and sneezes.
And I'd like to add this: Please don't sneeze on the lettuce.
And keep your dern lips off the ladle.

What's old can be new again

Texto completo: Derrick Gaddis knew his equipment was nearing the end of its useful life. Two of his logging skidders -- the heavy-duty machines that haul cut timber -- needed to be replaced. But most manufacturers at the time had shifted gears to bigger and heavier models, he said, and no longer made the size of skidders required for what is known as selective harvesting, the type of logging his company does.
He and his co-owners of Henderson Timber Inc., in Sigel, Illinois, devised a solution: What if John Deere, the original manufacturer, could remanufacture the skidder to repair and upgrade it, comporting with current technology? Deere, which already had remanufactured some of its products, was receptive. A beta test in the woods was in the works.
"When you take a puzzle apart with that many pieces, I thought there would be something wrong. But that was not the case," Gaddis said.
Welcome to the expanding sector of remanufacturing. The practice essentially involves taking products or components, whether in disrepair or at the end of their useful lives, to a like-new condition. Accomplished through a variety of processes and advanced by new technologies such as 3D printing, products as small as a coffee maker and as large as a medical imaging machine can now be upgraded. Rather than recycling or merely refurbishing the item to its original state, the process also enhances the product to make it comport with the latest technology.
While at first glance it seems similar to refurbishing, the results differ. A refurbished engine, for example, might be equivalent to one in excellent working condition but has already been in service for 30,000 miles, while a remanufactured engine should be equivalent to one that has not yet been in service, so it is like new, said Nabil Nasr, the director of the Golisano Institute for Sustainability at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
Remanufacturing is an integral part of the circular economy that strives to keep materials in the economy and out of landfills. From an environmental standpoint, the process is superior to recycling, which captures materials, but loses the labor used in initial manufacturing and uses significant amounts of energy, Nasr said.
While remanufacturing does not have a glamorous connotation, companies involved are on the cutting edge of manufacturing and data privacy. CoreCentric Solutions, for example, processes close to 2 million pieces of core -- or components -- each year for use in industrial and consumer products, said Tom Healy, the company's president and chief executive.
CoreCentric's remanufacturing process identifies the parts that have already failed, and with an intricate propriety database, it can predict which parts "are highly likely to fail." The company, based in Carol Stream identifies and replaces the broken parts, and replaces components that have a high probability of failing.
But technology also creates new issues. The refrigerator with the touch screen that allows you to send notes home as well as order food? It can store personal data.
When those products break, remanufacturing requires another layer because of the inherent privacy risks. CoreCentric, as a result, needs to ensure not only that the smaller appliances are physically cleaned, "but these devices need to be cleared and the data removed from the cloud before it can be remanufactured and resold," Healy said.
A growing trend for companies is to plan for remanufacturing in the initial design of a product.
"The circular economy starts at the design phase -- you can't remanufacture a product if it's not designed to be recycled," said Zoe Bezpalko, a manager at Autodesk, which makes industrial design and consumer software products in San Rafael, California. "For example, gluing can prevent recycling. Even black plastic can interfere because it's not recognized by machines at the waste management facility."

FDA banning use of electric shock devices on students

Texto completo: In a rare and sweeping decision, the Food and Drug Administration announced last week that it was banning the use of electric shock devices to correct self-harming or aggressive behavior.
The practice presents "an unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury," the agency said in a statement Wednesday.
The ban is national, but it is targeted at a single school: the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton, Massachusetts, which serves students -- both children and adults -- who have intellectual disabilities or behavioral, emotional or psychiatric problems.
It appears to be the only school in the United States that uses painful electric shocks to discipline students, and the practice has been in place there for decades.
Those students who have been approved by a court to receive the treatment wear a backpack with a battery inside. It has protruding wires that can deliver shocks to the skin when triggered by an employee at the school.
The practice was meant to condition the behavior of students by causing pain when they acted in ways that endangered themselves or others.
"Evidence indicates a number of significant psychological and physical risks are associated with the use of these devices, including worsening of underlying symptoms, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, pain, burns and tissue damage," the FDA's statement said. "In addition, many people who are exposed to these devices have intellectual or developmental disabilities that make it difficult to communicate their pain."
The decision was a culmination of more than a decade of legal battles between the school and its critics, who argued that the electric shock devices were administered excessively and caused lasting damage.
Some of the students' relatives have defended the practice -- saying that it worked to change students' behavior when nothing else could -- and denounced the FDA's decision.
Louisa Goldberg, 66, said that her son, Andrew Goldberg, 39, had brain damage and epilepsy, and that he showed severe aggression as a teenager. There were violent episodes, trips to the hospital, and psychotropic medications that left him sluggish.
His mother said he was placed in physical restraints for hours at a time. "His life was torture," she said.
Andrew Goldberg went to live at the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center at age 19 and began wearing an electric shock device. Louisa Goldberg said her son would receive two-second shocks as part of a broader treatment plan. He has since been weaned off the device and can do things he could not do before, like go to the movies.
"This treatment works, and I will stand by it, and I will fight for it," she said.
In a statement on Thursday, the school said that the FDA had "made a decision based on politics, not facts, to deny this lifesaving, court-approved treatment."
The FDA rarely bans devices, and this decision has been in the works since at least 2018.

Texto completo: McCoy Tyner, a cornerstone of John Coltrane's groundbreaking 1960s quartet and one of the most influential pianists in jazz history, died Friday at his home in northern New Jersey. He was 81.
His nephew Kolby Tyner confirmed the death.
Along with Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and only a few others, Tyner was one of the main expressways of modern jazz piano. Nearly every jazz pianist since Tyner's years with Coltrane has had to learn his lessons, whether they ultimately discarded them or not.
Tyner's manner was modest, but his sound was rich, percussive and serious, his lyrical improvisations centered by powerful left-hand chords marking the first beat of the bar and the tonal center of the music.
That sound helped create the atmosphere of Coltrane's music and, to some extent, all jazz in the 1960s.
To a great extent he was a grounding force for Coltrane. In a 1961 interview, about a year and a half after hiring Tyner, Coltrane said: "My current pianist, McCoy Tyner, holds down the harmonies, and that allows me to forget them. He's sort of the one who gives me wings and lets me take off from the ground from time to time."
Tyner did not find immediate success after leaving Coltrane in 1965. But within a decade his fame had caught up with his influence, and he remained one of the leading bandleaders in jazz as well as one of the most revered pianists for the rest of his life.
Alfred McCoy Tyner was born in Philadelphia on Dec. 11, 1938, to Jarvis and Beatrice (Stephenson) Tyner, both natives of North Carolina. Tyner started taking piano lessons at 13, and a year later his mother bought him his first piano.
At 16, Tyner was playing professionally with a rhythm-and-blues band at house parties around Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
Tyner was in a band led by trumpeter Cal Massey in 1957 when he met Coltrane at a Philadelphia club called the Red Rooster. At the time, Coltrane, who grew up in Philadelphia but had left in 1955 to join Miles Davis' quintet, was back in town, between tenures with the Davis band.
The two musicians struck up a friendship. Coltrane was living at his mother's house, and Tyner would visit him there to sit on the porch and talk. He would later say that Coltrane was something of an older brother to him.
Tyner was 21 when he joined the Coltrane quartet. He would remain -- along with drummer Elvin Jones and, beginning in 1962, bassist Jimmy Garrison -- for the next five years. Through his work with the group, which came to be known as the "classic" Coltrane quartet, he became one of the most widely imitated pianists in jazz.
Harmonically, his sound was strongly defined by his use of modes -- the old scales that governed a fair amount of the music Tyner played during his time with Coltrane -- and by his chord voicings.
Tyner's survivors include his wife, Aisha Tyner; his son, Nurudeen, who is known as Deen; his brother, Jarvis; his sister, Gwendolyn-Yvette Tyner; and three grandchildren.
In 2002, Tyner was named an National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, one of the highest honors for a jazz musician in the United States.

Texto completo: The last time Henriette Reker ran for mayor, she was nearly killed.
Reker was handing out flowers to voters at a bustling market in Cologne, Germany, in 2015 when a man took a rose with one hand and rammed a kitchen knife into her throat with the other. He wanted to punish her for her pro-refugee stance.
Five years later, Reker is running again. But she is an exception. Since she recovered from a coma to find herself elected, far-right death threats have become an everyday reality, not just for her but for an increasing number of local officials across Germany.
The acrimony is felt in town halls and village streets, where mayors find themselves the targets of threats and intimidation. The effect has been chilling.
Some have stopped speaking out. Many have quit, tried to arm themselves or taken on police protection. The risks have mounted to such an extent that some German towns are unable to field candidates for leadership at all.
"Our democracy is under attack at the grassroots level," Reker said in a recent interview in Cologne's City Hall. "This is the foundation of our democracy, and it is vulnerable."
The trend, local officials and analysts said, reflects a worrying breakdown of civility and political discourse in a polarized Germany, where the insidious influence of an angry far right is changing the rules of behavior.
Mayors have not been the only ones to suffer as Germany's political and social fabric has strained. The shootings last month in the western town of Hanau, near Frankfurt, that left 11 people dead were just the latest attacks aimed at ethnic minorities.
Germans who openly support immigration have been targeted, too. Given the decentralized nature of Germany's political system, local officials like mayors may be the most important among them. Attacks against them take on outsize significance.
Over the last year, there were 1,240 politically motivated attacks on politicians and elected officials in Germany, according to preliminary figures released this year by federal police.
A study conducted by the German Association for Cities and Municipalities showed that 40% of the country's city governments had to contend with stalking, harassment or threats. Of the 11,000 mayors in the country, at least 1,500 reported concrete threats.
And people have died. In June, Walter Lubcke, a regional official, was killed on his front porch by a known extremist, the first far-right assassination of a German politician since World War II.
Supporters of far-right ideology were responsible for more than one-third of the reported episodes, nearly twice as many as were committed by supporters of the extreme left, the government said.
But nearly half of all politically motivated attacks could not be attributed to any specific group, reflecting what experts said showed the erosion of civil norms.
Experts and local officials who have been affected said the violence started when the 2008 economic crisis began to bite. But it took on new dimensions in 2015 after Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the borders to more than 1 million asylum-seekers, most of them Muslim and many fleeing wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Andreas Zick, director of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence at the University of Bielefeld, has been tracking the mood of German society for decades.
He said he first noticed groups of people calling themselves "concerned citizens" who were critical of politicians emerge more than a decade ago.
One of their concerns has now grown into a concerted campaign of hate against local politicians and representatives, he said, driven by populist forces such as the far-right Alternative for Germany, a party known by its German initials, AfD.
"The populists have declared the 'elites' as their enemy, and now we are seeing the rise of this politics of hate which has infected the center of society," Zick said.
Barbara Lücke, the mayor of Pulsnitz in the eastern German state of Saxony, has been targeted by hate campaigns.
"The arrival of the refugees was a catalyst," she said, "but it would have happened regardless."
She attributed the rise in violence to a toxic cocktail of an "anything goes" culture on social media, a dearth of social services and a lack of understanding among Germans in the former Communist East about how a representative democracy works.
"We as a society have lost the ability to respect one another, or those in government," said Lücke, an independent.
"There are no boundaries anymore and no understanding for how to respond when my idea of freedom is in conflict with someone else's idea of freedom," she said. "We have forgotten how to resolve conflicts."
By some accounts, the atmosphere has become particularly toxic in eastern Germany, where the AfD wins on average 1 in 4 votes and many more in rural areas.
Burkhard Jung, the mayor of Leipzig, another eastern city, said that in his first nine years as mayor, he did not get a single threat. But that changed when the country took in the refugees.
"Something broke open then -- something came out," he said. "These threats would come. We had to install a security system in our house. Police would sometimes be outside.
"How do you explain that to your children?" he added.
In the five years since she was stabbed, Reker, the mayor of Cologne, said anonymous death threats and constituents writing to say they understand those who want her murdered have poured in.
Shortly after the murder of Lübcke, Reker received a letter signed, "Sieg Heil und Heil Hitler!"
"The phase of cleansing has started," it stated. "Many more will follow him. Including you. Your life will end in 2020."
In Januarty, she buried a City Hall employee who had been stabbed while on the job.
But Reker has refused to change her message. Just recently she asked the Cologne City Council to approve of a plan to welcome 100 additional refugees and 16 unaccompanied child refugees who are stuck in a camp on the Greek island of Lesbos.
The motion was passed. But in response, a representative of the far-right Alternative for Germany, Sven Tritschler, immediately took to the microphone.
"You have blood on your hands," he said.

Texto completo: "One Long River of Song" by the late Brian Doyle (Little Brown, $27) is an excellent, thought-provoking collection of essays that is likely to make you run out and pick up anything else he's written.
It's subtitled "Notes on Wonder for the Spiritual and Non-Spiritual Alike" which might scare some readers away... but in today's trying times, this is great escapism.
Most of the essays are short, only two or three pages; many flow with long sentences, ripe with distinctive, striking imagery.
Doyle covers a lot of territory, offering his thoughts about nature, children and family life, spiritual views and mortality - often with a quirky touch of humor.
He smoothly relates insights about hummingbirds and hawks, the birth and challenges of his children, his love of basketball, fond memories of growing up and much more.
David James Duncan, in a brief introduction, quotes the storyteller:
"I want to write to you like I'm speaking to you... I would sing my books if I could."
It's best to sit back, enjoy the experience and savor these slowly - appreciating and anticipating Doyle's exceptional verbal wonderment.
One longer essay explores the trials of William Blake; another relates a Tibetan folk tale that reveals hidden aspects of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.
Particularly enjoyable is "Brian Doyle interviews Brian Doyle", which first appeared in the online journal "Smokebox "in 2002.
Doyle, who died at age 60 of brain cancer in 2017, lived in Oregon, where he edited "Portland Magazine" for 25 years.
His essays were published in "the New York Times," "the Atlantic," "Harper's Magazine," "American Scholar," "Orion" and numerous other periodicals.
Two of his novels, "Martin Marten" and "Mink River," have frequently been chosen as book reading club selections. Doyle has also written six books of poetry and 13 books of non-fiction.
He has received the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature, the John Burroughs Medal, the Oregon Book Award and three Pushcart Prizes.

Democratic voters fired up for a fight

Texto completo: The best news for Democrats in the Super Tuesday results may not be the surge of Joe Biden, or Bernie Sanders hanging on, or even Mike Bloomberg dropping out. No, the best news is the record and near record turnout of Democratic voters all across the country. Whoever the eventual nominee is, it's clear that Democrats are fired up and ready to vote to defeat Donald Trump.
In Virginia, Democratic primary turnout was the highest on record, surpassing the previous record set in 2008. In fact, 23% of registered Virginians cast ballots on Super Tuesday, which almost doubled primary turnout from 2016.
Utah saw a turnout in Tuesday's Democratic primary that eclipsed previous turnout for any primary held in the state, among Democrats or Republicans.
In North Carolina, voter turnout was also up over 2016 numbers. And early voting had a strong surge — with almost twice as many Democrats in the state casting early ballots compared with Republicans.
Record-breaking voter turnouts
Numbers are still being crunched, but U.S. News and World Report detailed high turnout across the country. Early evidence suggests that Texas saw an increase of nearly a half-million primary ballots cast over 2016 numbers. In Maine, turnout was so high that many polling stations ran out of Democratic primary ballots.
And that's all on top of record turnout in both South Carolina and New Hampshire.
Plus, according to the Human Rights Campaign, LGBTQ voters doubled their representation in Super Tuesday turnout, over previous primary elections.
Other outcomes from the Super Tuesday primaries are still being analyzed, but The New York Times has reported on how Latino voters are expected to provide a decisive surge in California, Texas and beyond.
In other words, if you're looking for your silver lining, Democrats, I got it right here. In a crazy, crowded primary election in which the only thing Democrats consistently seem able to agree on is that they want to defeat Trump, in the primary elections Democrats are indeed enthusiastically showing up.
Let's be honest, there are and have been some amazing Democratic presidential candidates in this election, but no single candidate has yet galvanized a strong and enduring majority of support. That could certainly change any day, but it's notable to see record turnout in primaries when there's not excitement around some single candidate driving that turnout — as we saw, for instance, with Barack Obama in 2008. You've got Democrats turning up in record numbers in Utah to nominate Sanders and Democrats turning up in record numbers in South Carolina to nominate Biden.
The through line doesn't appear to be any one candidate but, rather, Democratic enthusiasm and energy. We're just chomping at the bit to vote for anyone but Trump.
Trump and GOP can't stop us
To be clear, there are some clouds in this silver lining. Young voters aren't turning out at the levels that helped put Obama in the White House and that would certainly help put Democrats over the top this fall. In Texas, for instance, NBC News' exit polls show that the share of Democratic primary voters over the age of 65 was almost twice as high as in 2008, and still overrepresented compared with the state's growing younger population.
There are also concerns about suppression. Part of the record lines reported at polling stations across our nation might have had to do with record turnout, but they also stemmed from Republicans shuttering polling locations and imposing new ID requirements, making voters work even harder and wait even longer to cast their ballots.
For instance, when CNN's Ed Lavandera tweeted about a man at Texas Southern University who spent nearly seven hours waiting to be able to cast his vote, commentator and advocate Keith Boykin noted, "Texas has closed 750 polling places since 2012, many in black and brown communities, causing long lines and waits."
What is extraordinarily and unfortunately clear is that Trump and Republicans don't want an election that includes every voter and treats them equally, just like they don't want our nation to include all of us and treat all of us equally.
And while it is not yet clear who Democrats will nominate as our standard-bearer to face Trump and the GOP in this existential, epoch-defining electoral battle in November, it is increasingly clear that Democrats are fired up for that fight — and in spite of all the obstacles, going to damn well make sure our voices are heard. While we don't yet know who is the ultimate winner of this raucous, energetic Democratic primary, Trump is the loser.

Texto completo: "I've never had characters spill from one novel into another until now, and that wasn't the original plan. I was very late in the process of 'Blackwood' when I realized the man and woman who have broken down in Red Bluff are the man and woman who abandoned young Jack Boucher in Tunica at the beginning of 'The Fighter.'"
Michael Farris Smith
Author
Oxford's Michael Farris Smith reinforces his rising prominence as "one of Southern fiction's leading voices" with his newest Southern noir offering, "Blackwood."
Set in "a landscape of fear and ghosts," this tale of an artist who returns to his (fictional) hometown of tiny Red Bluff, Mississippi, quickly turns dark as he realizes that the heartbreak of his past is now mingled with an evil that has tortured generations.
The recipient of the 2014 Mississippi Author Award, Smith's previous novels include "The Fighter," "Desperation Road," "Rivers" and "The Hands of Strangers." His short stories have received two nominations for a Pushcart Prize, and his essays have been published in the New York Times, Catfish Alley, Deep South Magazine and others.
Smith is a graduate of Mississippi State University, and he began writing while at the Center for Writers at the University of Southern Mississippi.
As a child in 1956, main character Colburn inadvertently witnessed – and unexpectedly participated in - his father's suicide. The weight of this soon begins to drag him into deeper gloom when he returns to his hometown 20 years later. Why did he really go back, and why did you choose to set this story in this time period?
I think I chose to set the novel in the '70s, with the initial event occurring in the '50s, just because this felt like an older story to me. Almost like a tall tale or ghost story you hear told again and again in some small town. I think a lot of people from smaller places can certainly relate to this. As to why Colburn decides to return, I don't know if it's something I can answer so directly. He's been carrying this around for a long time, he's haunted by it, confused by it, curious about it, and so maybe he feels like he's ready to face it.
Another formidable, undeniable "character" in "Blackwood" is the kudzu – the living, invincible vine that could swallow not only the landscape, but any manmade object in its path. Explain its role in this story.
The kudzu is what started this story, much like the idea of endless hurricanes started "Rivers." This is the second time I've had the landscape be the jumping off point. I've always thought the great expanse of kudzu was strange, spooky, dark. We've all seen it, how it takes everything, methodically and patiently. I just had the idea of a valley covered in kudzu and the small town surrounding it, and the whispers and maybe even madness that seems to be living on its edge, and then going beneath the vines to find out what is going on. I let my imagination have it and that was that.
"The voice" seems to pervade the community. Tell us about its intrusion into the lives of those who hear it, and its gossip value among those who have merely heard about it.
The gossip value carries some of the weight, no doubt. Back to earlier when I mentioned that "Blackwood" had the feeling of being a ghost story passed along, year after year, I think the characters in the novel experience the same. One person claims to hear the voice. Another thinks it's ridiculous. Another falls somewhere in between. It seems like those who are drawn to the notion of a voice below are the ones who want to hear it.
Among the many story lines and characters whose lives are beyond "complicated" in this tale is the presence of characters known as the man, the woman, and the boy – who all live tragic lives. In the end, it is the boy with whom Colburn finds an attachment. Why is this quasi-relationship so important to Colburn?
The best way I can answer is that we are all looking for someone to find things in common with, people who make us feel accepted or part of something. Hopefully it comes from family, but for too many people, like Colburn, that isn't the case. He's spent a lifetime with the shadows of his mother and father drifting in his mind, and he has been a loner, isolated, and maybe this is his chance to find that connection he has missed.
The names of the woman and the boy are never revealed, although the man finally tells the local sheriff, "My name is Boucher." How does this fit in with the main character of your previous novel, "The Fighter"?
I've never had characters spill from one novel into another until now, and that wasn't the original plan. I was very late in the process of "Blackwood" when I realized the man and woman who have broken down in Red Bluff are the man and woman who abandoned young Jack Boucher in Tunica at the beginning of "The Fighter." It was such an exciting idea, and the time frame fit, and it gave their story so much more complexity. It raised "Blackwood" to a higher level, and in some ways, I feel like it has raised the level of "The Fighter," as well.
Tell me about the title of the book, "Blackwood," and its significance to the story.
On page 56, I used the description of the "blackwood underneath" in a passage where we first really go under and see what it's like. As soon as I used the word blackwood, I knew that was the title. It fit the landscape but also fit the kind of story I knew I was going to tell.
"I've never had characters spill from one novel into another until now, and that wasn't the original plan. I was very late in the process of 'Blackwood' when I realized the man and woman who have broken down in Red Bluff are the man and woman who abandoned young Jack Boucher in Tunica at the beginning of 'The Fighter.'"

Texto completo: Let's be honest, there are and have been some amazing Democratic presidential candidates in this election, but no single candidate has yet galvanized a strong and enduring majority of support. That could certainly change any day, but it's notable to see record turnout in primaries when there's not excitement around some single candidate driving that turnout — as we saw, for instance, with Barack Obama in 2008.
The best news for Democrats in the Super Tuesday results may not be the surge of Joe Biden, or Bernie Sanders hanging on, or even Mike Bloomberg dropping out. No, the best news is the record and near record turnout of Democratic voters all across the country. Whoever the eventual nominee is, it's clear that Democrats are fired up and ready to vote to defeat Donald Trump.
In Virginia, Democratic primary turnout was the highest on record, surpassing the previous record set in 2008. In fact, 23% of registered Virginians cast ballots on Super Tuesday, which almost doubled primary turnout from 2016.
Utah saw a turnout in Tuesday's Democratic primary that eclipsed previous turnout for any primary held in the state, among Democrats or Republicans.
In North Carolina, voter turnout was also up over 2016 numbers. And early voting had a strong surge — with almost twice as many Democrats in the state casting early ballots compared with Republicans.
Record-breaking voter turnouts Numbers are still being crunched, but U.S. News and World Report detailed high turnout across the country. Early evidence suggests that Texas saw an increase of nearly a half-million primary ballots cast over 2016 numbers. In Maine, turnout was so high that many polling stations ran out of Democratic primary ballots.
And that's all on top of record turnout in both South Carolina and New Hampshire.
Plus, according to the Human Rights Campaign, LGBTQ voters doubled their representation in Super Tuesday turnout, over previous primary elections.
Other outcomes from the Super Tuesday primaries are still being analyzed, but The New York Times has reported on how Latino voters are expected to provide a decisive surge in California, Texas and beyond.
In other words, if you're looking for your silver lining, Democrats, I got it right here. In a crazy, crowded primary election in which the only thing Democrats consistently seem able to agree on is that they want to defeat Trump, in the primary elections Democrats are indeed enthusiastically showing up.
Let's be honest, there are and have been some amazing Democratic presidential candidates in this election, but no single candidate has yet galvanized a strong and enduring majority of support. That could certainly change any day, but it's notable to see record turnout in primaries when there's not excitement around some single candidate driving that turnout — as we saw, for instance, with Barack Obama in 2008. You've got Democrats turning up in record numbers in Utah to nominate Sanders and Democrats turning up in record numbers in South Carolina to nominate Biden.
The through line doesn't appear to be any one candidate but, rather, Democratic enthusiasm and energy. We're just chomping at the bit to vote for anyone but Trump.
Trump and GOP can't stop us To be clear, there are some clouds in this silver lining. Young voters aren't turning out at the levels that helped put Obama in the White House and that would certainly help put Democrats over the top this fall. In Texas, for instance, NBC News' exit polls show that the share of Democratic primary voters over the age of 65 was almost twice as high as in 2008, and still overrepresented compared with the state's growing younger population.
There are also concerns about suppression. Part of the record lines reported at polling stations across our nation might have had to do with record turnout, but they also stemmed from Republicans shuttering polling locations and imposing new ID requirements, making voters work even harder and wait even longer to cast their ballots.
For instance, when CNN's Ed Lavandera tweeted about a man at Texas Southern University who spent nearly seven hours waiting to be able to cast his vote, commentator and advocate Keith Boykin noted, "Texas has closed 750 polling places since 2012, many in black and brown communities, causing long lines and waits."
What is extraordinarily and unfortunately clear is that Trump and Republicans don't want an election that includes every voter and treats them equally, just like they don't want our nation to include all of us and treat all of us equally.
And while it is not yet clear who Democrats will nominate as our standard-bearer to face Trump and the GOP in this existential, epoch-defining electoral battle in November, it is increasingly clear that Democrats are fired up for that fight — and in spite of all the obstacles, going to damn well make sure our voices are heard. While we don't yet know who is the ultimate winner of this raucous, energetic Democratic primary, Trump is the loser.

Russian pianist, Wailuku church are a match made in heaven

Texto completo: However talented, musicians who walk away from a budding career can expect no second chance.
In her native Kazan, in the Russian republic of Tatar­stan, the concert pianist and pedagogue Damira Feldman, familiarly Mira, flew through the conservatory with high honors. But when she moved to Israel as a young wife and mother, friends said not to look back.
“Everyone who emigrates to Israel is a lawyer or a musician,” they told her. “Take anything practical.”
Wise words. She had mouths to feed.
First, she sewed shoes. “There was a pedal at my worktable,” Feldman says. “I put my feet on the pedal and thought, ‘Oh, my God!’ The tears were streaming down. For 10 years I never touched a piano at all.” She was too busy climbing the ladder and learning English — a professional necessity she embraced with enthusiasm.
“It was interesting,” she says, in an accent still heavy with exotic spice.
But look at her now. On Saturday, well into her fourth year as music director at Wailuku Union Church, Feldman serves up “Chopin’s Two Loves,” a banquet of music, commentary and slides, the latest in her series of quarterly solo and chamber music events.
Feldman’s comeback began in 2001, when she remarried and moved to Florida. As a wedding present, her second husband (no longer in the picture) gave her a piano, strictly for her own enjoyment. Then, a new acquaintance found out Feldman had been a concert artist, and — presto! — invitations for private recitals in fine homes came pouring in.
“Within six months I was flying to London and Paris,” Feldman says.
Appearances in fancy government and diplomatic salons paved the way to academic appointments, a long-lasting presence on radio and more.
“My second musical career has been the most exciting,” Feldman says, “much more exciting than the first.”
Vacationing in Toronto in 2016 and contemplating emigration to Canada, Feldman suddenly decided to join a daughter who had moved to Maui instead.
“So, I spent five minutes on the internet,” Feldman says, “and found a new posting for music director in Wailuku.” An email, a phone call — a long phone call — and the job was hers.
But not before “Pastor Robb” — senior minister Robb Y. Kojima — quizzed her on the delicate topic of faith.
“I have a deep knowledge of philosophy,” Feldman says. “Isn’t that sort of the same thing? I told Pastor Robb I was born in Russia where religion was forbidden to us. And I lived in Florida, where whatever church you go to, what do you find? Jews playing for Jesus.”
Call it a match made in heaven. As music director of the Wailuku Union Church, Feldman programs concerts, directs the choir, conducts and plays the organ. On her own time she gives private piano lessons.
“Mira is a force unto herself,” Kojima says. “We never had concerts before she came. Our sanctuary is such a beautiful venue for that, with all the stained glass and vaulted ceilings and the ohia floors. It’s very intimate, and since the concerts are under the umbrella of church outreach, I can say some prayers. Mira’s love of music and our love of God intertwine.”
Almost invariably, the concerts attract a full house. “We can seat 250,” Kojima says, “that’s if we’re sardines and unafraid to touch our neighbors. There’s not really space for standing room.”
To complement the concert series, Feldman runs an annual festival for outstanding amateur pianists — a godsend for eager local devotees like Peggy King of Kula, who ranks herself as “lower advanced.”
“People call Mira a fireball,” King says. “I’m sure glad she’s here.”
As a token of their appreciation, King and her husband host a next-day potluck after-party, where participants can play what they like for as long as they like on a superior Steinway B.
Feldman admits she regards the Kings’ instrument with a twinge of envy.
“We have a Kawai at church,” she says. “It’s not a concert grand, unfortunately. To produce a suitable sound requires lots of attention. Pastor Robb is ready to buy a new one. But he asks how long am I staying. And I think to myself, uh oh. He wants a commitment that I stay and organize concerts. I don’t want to make commitments. So, I’m not pushing him.”

It looks like the Senate race may heat up soon

Texto completo: From the dome to your home. Ramblings, mutterings, keen observations and things you ought to know out of Helena from the mind of Phil Drake.
BRINGING IN THE STEVES: Gov. Steve Bullock is expected to announce his candidacy for U.S. Senate on Monday, at least that is the scuttlebutt.
I've heard him asked dozens of times if he was running, and have asked him myself, only to hear him rebuff the suggestions. If it happens, and he wins the primary, he would (likely) face Republican Sen. Steve Daines (there is another Republican in the primary).
The constant denials by Bullock won't hurt him, I believe, and I think his reluctance was to be expected given he had just bowed from an intense presidential campaign.
I attended the Feb. 29 Democratic fundraiser in Helena, not just to hear Sen. Jon Tester sing, which he did, but to also be there in case the governor would announce his candidacy. What other better venue would there be than a roomful of Democrats?
I put the chances of such an announcement at the Democratic dinner at 1%, which a fellow reporter publicly spanked me about on social media. But if what I am reading in the New York Times and Politico is true, all from anonymous sources, we could have a battle of the Steves.
And it is going to be one nasty fight, even before the starting gate. I heard Mike Dennison of MTN report this race could get into the tens of millions of dollars, as Democrats hope to regain the senate and Republicans want to keep control.
It's going to be a long, long slog until November. Buckle up.
BE TRUE TO YOUR SCHOOL: The governor had a coronavirus news conference Tuesday in which he announced the Department of Military Affairs and his budget director would be a part of.
It's has been a long, long time since I had seen that much Montana media gathered in the governor's reception room. Lots and lots of cameras. I waddled over to a chair on the side and plopped down.
The task force will be led by Adjutant Gen. Matthew Quinn, who oversees the Department of Military Affairs, including the Disaster and Emergency Services (DES) division which handles multi-agency coordination and hazard response planning.
Bullock said DES will work with other agencies, including the Department of Military Affairs, Department of Administration, Department of Commerce, Department of Labor and Industry and Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS).
As the governor rattled off the names of task force members, I was more curious as to who did not have a seat at the table, so far.
I wondered where are the schools?
I don't have kids, but my friends, who do tell me schools are festering pools of diseases in which children come home with all sorts of ailments, and then the parents get sick.
The governor said they would be part of a subgroup. I should have asked a followup question.
Shortly after the news conference the state superintendent's office sent me an email about what they are doing and I hammered out a story. I still think they deserve a big seat at the table. Maybe that will happen.
MY BONEHEAD MOVE ...: The phone started ringing at my home at 7:17 a.m. Sunday.
The caller had the goods on me: "So you support Greg Gianforte?" she asked.
I stammered, mostly because I was up late the night before, still decompressing from covering the Democratic fundraiser in Helena. And I was somewhat shocked I would be called that early on Sunday. Yes, she called at 7:17 a.m. No apology, there never is, she just started talking.
My name was at the bottom of a letter in the Tribune from Bill Harris of Mosby, who had written in support of Greg Gianforte, the Republican gubernatorial candidate.
I don't endorse candidates. I never have and never will. But there was my name. I've seen it before and recognized it.
I'm not making excuses, but here is what happened (if you abhor such explanations you should stop reading now):
I have been doing the twice-weekly Two Cents page since we are in-between city editors. I put my contact information at the bottom of the letters so folks know who they could reach out to. No one told me to do it, but I get frustrated when it happens to me.
I added a couple letters at the last moment and thought I had copied and pasted my contact information at the bottom of the last. Unfortunately, I had moved all the information except my name, which I have always liked seeing in print – until Sunday.
Is it a bad, dumb mistake? You bet. I'll even include the words "stupid" and "incompetent."
We ran a correction in Monday's paper, which few apparently read and I updated the letter online, explaining there had been a change. I have gotten about five emails and about as many calls. But in my mind each complaint equates to 1 million calls. So I have had about 12 million complaints about this error.
I feel horrible. I will for a long while.
It is especially gut-wrenching in that it was a big week of politics for me in the days before I became Montana's newest powerbroker.
I apologize to readers offended by my screw-up. I apologize to letter-writer Bill Harris, because having my name attached dumbs it down. I apologize to gubernatorial candidates and campaigns of Tim Fox, Al Olszewski, Mike Cooney, Whitney Williams and Lyman Bishop. I apologize to colleagues.
And I apologize to Mr. Gianforte. I believe my so-called "endorsement" likely cost him votes.
My number is still 406-231-9021. I will still take calls at nights and weekends, but do me a favor, if it's on a Sunday, I'd appreciate it if you could hold it in until 9 a.m.
Dome Lights appears Sunday, unless the villagers catch me. Email me at pdrake@greatfallstribune.com or call 406-231-9021. I'm based in Helena. Mail me at P.O.Box 1601, Helena, MT 59624.

Texto completo: Why violinists Benjamin Jacobson and Tereza Stanislav, violist Jonathan Moerschel and cellist Eric Byers bill themselves as the Calder Quartet, we do not know. They acknowledge only that the name honors Alexander Calder, the American sculptor who raised the lowly mobile to the condition of high art — but where’s the connection? In the hands of great composers, the string quartet has for centuries been the vehicle for their deepest and most intimate thought. Trailing lavish praise from the mainland’s most demanding critics, the Calder alights at the MACC this week with prime Mozart (K. 387, the “Spring” quartet) and Beethoven (Op. 127, first of his revered “late” quartets). Sandwiched in between is the Swedish composer Anders Hillborg’s recent hazily introspective “Kongsgaard Variation” (2006), a quarter-hour meditation from which materializes, like an autumn sunset, the heartbreaking Arietta that forms the theme of the final movement of Beethoven’s last piano Sonata, Op. 111. — Calder Quartet, 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Maui Arts & Cultural Center’s Castle Theater. Tickets: $ 40- $ 50.

Texto completo: In your recent article about Strong Museum parking, you had a segment in which you listed "alternatives" to the museum parking. However, all the alternatives you mentioned were for other car-parking locations.
While cars are convenient in many cases, you could have also listed the RTS buses that serve that area. While bicycles are a "Toy Hall Of Fame" winner, they are also a cheap and practical means of transportation, even for families. In fact, the city just built a car-free cycle track along Union Street that goes right to the museum.
These alternatives could be especially valuable to families who may not be able to afford frequent visits with the new parking fees.

Bail intended to prevent pretrial flight, not punish poor A recent D&C headline stated "Cash bail in New York: Why the new reforms plummeted in the opinion of voters." The answer is simple – just look into a mirror.
The media – including the D & C – has mishandled the issue to the point where people are making up their minds based on really bad journalism. You conflate two issues: bail reform and keeping bad actors in jail awaiting trial. Bail is not intended to keep people in jail. Its purpose is to get them to report for their court appearances. Bail does not keep bad actors in jail – it keeps poor people in jail. The issue of keeping people does not have an answer in bail unless you believe that poor people are bad and rich people are good.
People who are flight risks and people who are dangerous should be kept. But if kept, they should have a very speedy trial, as it is just plain wrong to keep someone in jail before he/she has been convicted.

Coronavirus shows problems with leadership based on fealty The coronavirus (or as some like to call it Trumpvirus) is causing major damage to our economy. Supply disruptions from China and Europe are slowing down manufacturing. The New York Times reported (3/2/20), "Dunn & Bradstreet, the business research firm, said about 51,000 companies had one or more suppliers in regions of China affected by the virus, almost certainly leading to a broader impact in the month ahead."
The Trump administration chases bogeymen, such as "criminal aliens," rather than real threats such as Russian aggression or climate change or global infections. The administration's last budget wants to cut global health programs by $3billion. In 2018, the Trump administration dismissed the National Security Council's global health team and also dismantled the epidemic fighting infrastructure at the Department of Homeland Security.
It is time for new leadership based on knowledge, not fealty to Mr. Trump. It is time to replace power rooted in privilege with power rooted in reason.

Excellus CEO's salary too large As an Excellus BCBS subscriber, I was appalled to read that Excellus CEO and President Christopher Booth was paid over $3million last year. I find it hard to comprehend how such a large salary and benefit package for Mr. Booth will improve the health outcomes of Excellus BCBS subscribers.
This news provides an additional 3million reasons why the United States should abandon private health insurance companies and replace them with a government-run single-payer system.

Area fortunate in its benefactors While reading the Democrat and Chronicle on Feb. 20 regarding Tom Golisano's book Built Not Born, it reminded me of how fortunate we are in the Rochester area to have many benefactors who have been willing to share their good fortunes.
Almost anywhere there are many reminders of those who have shared, and I am also aware that there many who choose to remain anonymous. To write a list of all who have benefited this area would no doubt take many additional pages.
I was most fortunate to work at a place created by one of the earlier benefactors, George Eastman. My years at Kodak Park were always a pleasure, and most important were the many people I worked with and the many mentors along the way.
Again, we are so fortunate to benefit from many fine persons in this area.

Proud to know Judge Telesca I met Michael Telesca when I joined Brooklea Country Club in the 1980s, knew him for the 22 years I was there and occasionally played golf with him. Michael was indeed a kind and gentle man with absolutely no air about being a federal judge.
In August 2006, I was about to get married to my wife, Monica, on Sept. 10, and we found out she would not have any medical coverage until Oct. 1. I called Michael and asked him if we could have a " secret "marriage in his private quarters in late August so her medical coverage could begin on Sept. 1. Sure enough, Michael said yes, and Monica and I were married on Aug. 30 in a ceremony with my daughter, Karen, and her husband as witnesses.
We then proceeded to have a formal wedding and reception at Brooklea CC on Sept. 10, not letting our guests know that we were already married!
That's the kind of man Michael Telesca was! When I asked Michael if there were any fees for marrying us, Michael told me to make a donation to the Open Door Mission, one of his favorite charities, which I did in his name. I'm proud to have known Judge Michael Telesca!

Resumen: Touching your face is subconscious behavior that increases your risk of being infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus, flu and other diseases.

Texto completo: You might be buying — or making — lots of hand sanitizer to help protect yourself from the COVID-19 coronavirus, but health care professionals are asking you to do something a lot harder: Stop touching your face.
In addition to properly washing your hands, experts say keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth will help protect you from the coronavirus – or the flu and other infections.
Easier said than done.
"Even health experts have trouble not touching their faces!" the Santa Clara County, California Public Health Department posted to Facebook on Thursday.
That followed an article by the Washington Post pointing out that Sara Cody, the county's public health director, had licked her finger moments after urging the public not to touch their face.
“It’s just subconscious behavior," infection prevention expert Connie Steed told USA TODAY on Friday.
She said trying to break the habit has taken a big effort for her and her family.
But it's a habit worth breaking.
Why should I stop touching my face?
Your face contains multiple pathways for infections to easily enter your body, and your hands can be contaminated without you knowing it.
“You can clean your hands all day, but as soon as you start touching things again . . . the germs on your hands increase,” said Steed, the president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.
Hand washing: You're probably washing your hands wrong and don't even know it
Watch: Boost your immune system by doing these things and fend off coronavirus, flu
If we could only see the germs on our hands, we'd find it a lot easier to keep them away from our face, Steed said.
Reducing how often you touch your face is just part of "common-sense basics" for avoiding all types of illnesses, not just the coronavirus currently causing widespread anxiety.
Why is it so hard to stop touching my face?
Because it's a common habit – most people do it all the time without realizing it. APIC estimates the average person touches their face 23 times per hour, based on a small 2015 study.
It's something we start doing as young kids and most of us never stop, Steed said. Becoming self-aware of the problem is a good place to start.
That's what Verge journalist Elizabeth Lopatto tried to do this week as she attempted to count how often she touched her face in a day.
After a few hours she concluded "I am aborting the mission because I touch my face too often. "
What are some tips for breaking the habit?
How-to guides are popping up everywhere.
One common thread: Try your best to do it less, but don't let it ruin your day. As one expert pointed out to the New York Times, stress is bad for your immune system and obsessing over breaking a common habit could create its own problems.
According Steed, there are a few simple things that may help:
Keep your hands busy. One way she fights the urge to touch her face is by using a stress ball to keep her hands occupied. Others have had success fiddling with a rubber band wrapped around their wrist. Or if you're really struggling, you might try tucking your hands under your legs while sitting – then you know for sure they won't drift up to your face.
Have a buddy. Ask someone to help you by pointing out when you're touching your face – you can use a code word to help.
Pay attention to triggers. One common one: Nail biting. If that's an issue for you, there are other tips for stopping that habit.

'A landscape of fear and ghosts'

Texto completo: Oxford's Michael Farris Smith reinforces his rising prominence as "one of Southern fiction's leading voices" with his newest Southern noir offering, "Blackwood."
Set in "a landscape of fear and ghosts," this tale of an artist who returns to his (fictional) hometown of tiny Red Bluff, Mississippi, quickly turns dark as he realizes that the heartbreak of his past is now mingled with an evil that has tortured generations.
The recipient of the 2014 Mississippi Author Award, Smith's previous novels include "The Fighter," "Desperation Road," "Rivers" and "The Hands of Strangers." His short stories have received two nominations for a Pushcart Prize, and his essays have been published in the New York Times, Catfish Alley, Deep South Magazine and others.
Smith is a graduate of Mississippi State University, and he began writing while at the Center for Writers at the University of Southern Mississippi.
As a child in 1956, main character Colburn inadvertently witnessed – and unexpectedly participated in - his father's suicide. The weight of this soon begins to drag him into deeper gloom when he returns to his hometown 20 years later. Why did he really go back, and why did you choose to set this story in this time period?
I think I chose to set the novel in the '70s, with the initial event occurring in the '50s, just because this felt like an older story to me. Almost like a tall tale or ghost story you hear told again and again in some small town. I think a lot of people from smaller places can certainly relate to this. As to why Colburn decides to return, I don't know if it's something I can answer so directly. He's been carrying this around for a long time, he's haunted by it, confused by it, curious about it, and so maybe he feels like he's ready to face it.
Another formidable, undeniable "character" in "Blackwood" is the kudzu – the living, invincible vine that could swallow not only the landscape, but any manmade object in its path. Explain its role in this story.
The kudzu is what started this story, much like the idea of endless hurricanes started "Rivers." This is the second time I've had the landscape be the jumping off point. I've always thought the great expanse of kudzu was strange, spooky, dark. We've all seen it, how it takes everything, methodically and patiently. I just had the idea of a valley covered in kudzu and the small town surrounding it, and the whispers and maybe even madness that seems to be living on its edge, and then going beneath the vines to find out what is going on. I let my imagination have it and that was that.
"The voice" seems to pervade the community. Tell us about its intrusion into the lives of those who hear it, and its gossip value among those who have merely heard about it.
The gossip value carries some of the weight, no doubt. Back to earlier when I mentioned that "Blackwood" had the feeling of being a ghost story passed along, year after year, I think the characters in the novel experience the same. One person claims to hear the voice. Another thinks it's ridiculous. Another falls somewhere in between. It seems like those who are drawn to the notion of a voice below are the ones who want to hear it.
Among the many story lines and characters whose lives are beyond "complicated" in this tale is the presence of characters known as the man, the woman, and the boy – who all live tragic lives. In the end, it is the boy with whom Colburn finds an attachment. Why is this quasi-relationship so important to Colburn?
The best way I can answer is that we are all looking for someone to find things in common with, people who make us feel accepted or part of something. Hopefully it comes from family, but for too many people, like Colburn, that isn't the case. He's spent a lifetime with the shadows of his mother and father drifting in his mind, and he has been a loner, isolated, and maybe this is his chance to find that connection he has missed.
The names of the woman and the boy are never revealed, although the man finally tells the local sheriff, "My name is Boucher." How does this fit in with the main character of your previous novel, "The Fighter"?
I've never had characters spill from one novel into another until now, and that wasn't the original plan. I was very late in the process of "Blackwood" when I realized the man and woman who have broken down in Red Bluff are the man and woman who abandoned young Jack Boucher in Tunica at the beginning of "The Fighter." It was such an exciting idea, and the time frame fit, and it gave their story so much more complexity. It raised "Blackwood" to a higher level, and in some ways, I feel like it has raised the level of "The Fighter," as well.
Tell me about the title of the book, "Blackwood," and its significance to the story.
On page 56, I used the description of the "blackwood underneath" in a passage where we first really go under and see what it's like. As soon as I used the word blackwood, I knew that was the title. It fit the landscape but also fit the kind of story I knew I was going to tell.

Legacy 'unlimited' NASA pioneer Katherine Johnson honored during public memorials

Texto completo: HAMPTON -Rev. Brian Blount didn't know what Katherine Goble Johnson had accomplished at NASA Langley Research Center when he started as pastor at Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church in 1981.
At 24, he was nervous to be in one of his first leadership roles. But Johnson, a pioneering mathematician in the era of Jim Crow who helped take American astronauts to the moon, treated him like he'd been preaching for decades.
"She honored me the way she should have been honored when she was first starting out," said Blount, now president of Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond.
Over 700 people gathered Saturday morning at the Hampton University Convocation Center to celebrate the life of Johnson - a mathematical genius, an African American hero, a faithful church leader, a loving mother and a trusted confidant.
"Grandma, because of you, our world will forever be unlimited," said Michael Moore, Johnson's grandson. "And because of you, I have no bounds."
Johnson's death Feb. 24 at the age of 101 at The Hidenwood retirement community in Newport News drew national attention. Her obituary ran on the front page of The New York Times: "NASA's Shining Star, Undiscovered for Decades."
Her family received an outpouring of tributes; some were read by Carver Presbyterian clerk of session Robin Rattley during the service.
Former President Barack Obama, who awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015, called her a "hero to millions" in a letter to her family. First Lady Melania Trump said she "took our nation to remarkable heights."
Friends and family traveled from across the country to the Peninsula for two days of public memorials. Public viewings were held Friday in southeast Newport News, including one at Carver Presbyterian before a ceremony held by her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha.
Johnson was a diamond member of AKA, with over 85 years of membership. She was initiated in 1934 as a student at what is now West Virginia State University, where she graduated at the age of 18 with degrees in mathematics and French.
Dozens of her sorority sisters filled rows of Convocation Center, wearing pink corsages. They carried the floral arrangements ahead of Johnson's family during the recession.
Winnifred Magee, a kindergarten teacher in New Orleans and a friend of one of Johnson's grandchildren, drove 17 hours to attend the service.
"I can't miss this opportunity to come and share in this experience," Magee said. "I think it's historical."
Her historic role in the American space program - the woman whose calculations early astronauts trusted more than computers - was no secret to those at NASA Langley. Director Clayton Turner delivered remarks at the service and presented her family the flag that was flying over the center when she died.
Three black astronauts inspired by Johnson also spoke - Yvonne Cagle, Leland Melvin and Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space.
"I had to be here also with my colleagues because she is a colleague," Jemison said.
Melvin said he first met Johnson as a young engineer at NASA Langley, a few years after she retired. To Melvin and Cagle, she was a trusted confidant. Melvin, with permission from Johnson's daughters, called her "mom."
"I think about the journey that she's going on now," Melvin said. "We can't calculate the speed that she's traveling to get to heaven."
Despite the role she played, Johnson spent much of her life in relative obscurity, retiring from NASA Langley in 1986.
For her family at Carver Presbyterian, she was a faithful elder who led the youth choir, represented the church in Presbyterian Church's General Assembly and held a variety of leadership roles. Blount called her possibly the most overqualified church finance committee chair of all time.
"Her genius and legend may have been hidden from me, but not her abiding faith, not her genuine love," Blount said.
Rep. Bobby Scott said during the ceremony that he knew Johnson and her second husband, James Johnson, for years before he read Margot Lee Shetterly's book "Hidden Figures" about Johnson and her colleagues' work as "human computers." His father grew up going to Carver Presbyterian.
"There are few people who fought as good a fight, finished as difficult a course and all along kept the faith as Katherine Johnson," Scott said.
But the accomplishments recounted by friends and family Saturday run deeper and farther than NASA Langley.
She started high school at the age of 10, before her family moved 125 miles so that she could go to high school. She was one of three students who integrated West Virginia University's graduate school.
She raised three daughters while working at NASA. She mentored many people, including a young woman who was in juvenile detention through a program at Carver Presbyterian.
Johnson was a teacher to the end. Her daughter, Joylette Hick, said that a month ago, she was teaching one of her friends how to teach French.
"It is the end of a long and glorious life and the beginning of a new time, without her," said her other living daughter, Katherine Moore. "This is where the role model for strength and determination must become real. We all have to keep going and hang in there because she wants nothing less.
"Mom, you're taking your final trip. Safe landing. We love you."

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - On a website called Azerbaijani Eagles, you can commission a murder for $5,000. The site Slayers Hitmen provides more options, with a beating going for $2,000. Death by torture costs $50,000.
But don't expect someone to get the job done. Experts and law enforcers who have studied these sites - almost all of them on the so-called dark web or dark net - say they are scams. There has not been a known murder attributed to any of them.
That doesn't mean the sites aren't involved in a very dark trade. They have become catch points for real people who are looking to pay to have someone killed. And a number of men and women are sitting in jail after paying one of these sites - and getting caught by police.
In one of the most recent cases to make its way through the courts, a nurse from Illinois was sentenced to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to sending $12,000 in bitcoin to the site Sicilian Hitmen International Network. She had hoped to have the wife of her boyfriend killed.
Twenty-four hit-man-for-hire sites are the subject of an academic paper that was shared in advance with The New York Times by Michigan State University professor Tom Holt and student Ariel Roddy.
The paper is the first academic effort to illuminate what has been a subject of endless intrigue. For years, the potential anonymity granted by the internet has fed predictions that there would be marketplaces for death and assassination.
But it was the emergence of the dark web over the past decade or so that allowed hitman sites to proliferate. Unlike most sites on the traditional internet, dark-web sites use technology that allows both sides of an online interaction to hide their identity and location, from each other and law enforcement.
"It's a fantastic opportunity to defraud people because you give them just enough sense of danger," said Emily Wilson, head of research at Terbium Labs, a security company focused on the dark net. "What are you going to do if they don't go through with it?"
When the first hit-man sites were discovered, an assumption was that the dark web was crawling with legitimate assassins waiting to kill on command.
Promotional material posted to the mainstream internet played on that assumption. One site, which provides readers with a link to the dark net address of the 18th Street Gang, holds itself out as a "guide to real hit men, facts and stories." The site claims that people who say hit-man sites are scams are just trying to discourage people from seeking them out.
"Most customers order from reliable hit men sites that have been proven as legitimate," the site says.
On many of the sites examined by the team at Michigan State, considerable effort was expended trying to prove their legitimacy so customers would feel comfortable making a payment in Bitcoin, the digital currency. Hit men are not the sort of thing you pay for with a credit card.
The site 18th Street Mafia includes a page with links to news stories about real killings it says it helped commit. None of the articles, however, indicate that the site, or even a hit man, was responsible.
The site says: "We can provide video proof of our services, with time stamps. Again, such proof is not possible for fake services."
The 18th Street Mafia did not respond to requests for comment.
The representative for another site, Darkmamba, said in an email that proving its legitimacy had been difficult because "the point of our services and many other, including underground criminal forums, is to indeed complete the job without leaving anything that could get traced back to us."
The most prolific research on these sites has been conducted by Chris Monteiro, a systems administrator in London who has pursued his investigations as a morbid passion project on top of his regular job.
Monteiro hacked into one of the sites created by the most notorious purveyor of assassination sites, a figure going by the name Yura.
After breaking into the Besa Mafia site and a few others, Monteiro found information about 283 people who had paid for hit-man services. He also found messages suggesting that the operators had little intention of going through with the killings.
"I need you to help me do some videos to prove the Besa Mafia legit, but WITHOUT killing anyone," the operator wrote in one email, trying to get a contractor to produce lifelike videos. "I am not a murderer and I don't want anyone be murdered."
Law enforcement agencies around the world have been hesitant to collaborate with Monteiro or use his evidence because of the way he acquired it. But Monteiro has worked with media organizations, including Wired and 48 Hours, which have passed his information to law enforcement officials, eventually leading to the arrests of people who paid the sites to connect them with a hit man.
Monteiro has identified nine cases in which people he exposed were arrested in connection with commissioning hits. In one of the most gruesome cases, a man in Minnesota was arrested after he was found to have killed his wife himself when the hit man he had commissioned on the Besa Mafia website for about $6,000 in bitcoin did not come through.
A police investigator in Russia is believed to have been killed by two teenagers who were hired by a drug trafficker on the dark net. An investigation by the BBC found that the killing had been commissioned on one of the broad marketplaces on the dark net where drugs and stolen credit cards are sold.
But there has still not been a killing commissioned on one of the dedicated hit-man-for-hire sites.
"Why would you set up a dedicated site online when you know absolutely that law enforcement are going to be flooding that site trying to find you?" Wilson said. "You are making yourself too big of a target."
Still, the sites have continued to proliferate. A few months ago, a middle-age executive in Singapore was sent to jail for five years after paying the Camorra Hitman site to kill the boyfriend of his young ex-lover in a staged car accident that, not surprisingly, didn't happen.
Wilson, of Terbium Labs, said these sites took attention from the real crime being committed on the dark net, such as the drug markets and the sites selling the sensitive personal information of millions of Americans.
"There is actual crime, but we are too busy talking about some guy who wants to kill his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend," she said.

Texto completo: Hank Azaria recently said goodbye to one of television's most beloved but also controversial animated characters. And he's finally explaining why.
Azaria, who is perhaps best known for bringing to life Apu in the long-running sitcom "The Simpsons," told The New York Times in a recent interview that he made his decision after many years of reflecting, processing and listening to the voices of people who explained why Apu was hurtful.
"Once I realized that that was the way this character was thought of, I just didn't want to participate in it anymore," Azaria said. "It just didn't feel right."
For three decades, the actor has voiced dozens of inhabitants of the fictional town of Springfield. But Apu is perhaps the most problematic, especially through a modern lens: He is an immigrant from India who owns the local Kwik-E-Mart convenience store and is known for his catchphrase, "Thank you! Come again!" His thick Indian accent and singsong voice depict him as simple-minded, and even his last name, Nahasapeemapetilon, has been thought to welcome ridicule.
Through the years, "The Simpsons" actor and the show faced increasing criticism from people who find the character an offensive, racial stereotype. Many of the critics are of Indian descent.
The show's executive producers told The New York Times in a statement that they "respect Hank's journey in regard to Apu. We have granted his wish to no longer voice the character."
But the fate of Apu remains unknown.
"Apu is beloved worldwide. We love him too. Stay tuned," the statement added.
Azaria first announced he was retiring the convenience store proprietor in January on the website /Film.
During an appearance on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" in 2018, Azaria addressed the mounting controversy and added that he was "perfectly willing and happy to step aside and transition (Apu) into something new ... it just feels like the right thing to do to me."
Azaria was initially unwilling to hear the arguments about why Apu's character was divisive, he told The New York Times. But he started listening and now believes his experience can spark more dialogue about representation in popular culture.
"What happened with this character is a window into an important issue," said Azaria. "It's a good way to start the conversation. I can be accountable and try to make up for it as best I can."

Biden, Bloomberg lie about Trump, coronavirus

Texto completo: Things spreading across the globe: coronavirus, the lies being told by Democrats about it and liberal cheerleading when something bad happens because of it.
The virus has reached 22 states in the United States (although it is reasonable to assume that many more cases will emerge in the coming weeks). But that hasn't stopped the American left from saying outlandish things about the Trump administration's response.
Joe Biden, who claims to be the antithesis to Trump's dishonesty, tried to incite public panic while campaigning in South Carolina.
"We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. ... (Trump's) wiped all that out. ... He cut the funding for the entire effort," Biden said, harkening back to his days as Barack Obama's vice president.
Not to be outdone, Mike Bloomberg, who claims to be the antithesis to Trump's incompetence, went even further:
"There's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. And (Trump's) ... defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing."
These candidates, united by a reckless disregard for truth and responsible public rhetoric during a public health emergency, should be ashamed of their galactically irresponsible remarks. The Trump administration has not "wiped out" or "defunded" the CDC or the National Institutes for Health. Further, there are several experts figuring out "what the hell" to do.
According to the Associated Press, funding has increased for both agencies during the Trump administration, and the experts in charge have earned praise from across the political spectrum: Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director, is so good Hollywood based a movie on her work, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the NIH's infectious disease head, has advised six presidents.
It is outrageous that leading Democrats would so brazenly lie to the public about the American government's response. But who will hold them accountable? Let's check in with our national newspaper of record, The New York Times:
"Let's call it Trumpvirus," blared a headline atop a column written by Gail Collins, one of the paper's most well-known writers. Columnist Paul Krugman, also using the "Trumpvirus" label, excitedly tweeted "Dow 25,000!" as the stock market tanked.
Other corners of the American left, ever disdainful of organized religion, pounded Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump tasked with leading the government's response. As governor of Indiana, Pence once said he wanted to pray about a controversial needle exchange program in response to an outbreak of HIV/AIDS in his state. And a photo of his coronavirus task force with heads bowed in prayer earned widespread scorn, with one New York Times Magazine contributor tweeting that America is "so screwed."
I wonder: Do the liberals hammering Pence have the same thoughts about Democratic presidential candidates attending Bloody Sunday church services in Selma this past weekend?
As if we needed another reminder, Donald Trump has broken these people. Absolutely broken them. A virus jumps from an animal to a human halfway around the world and the liberal intelligentsia tries to name it after the American president, cheerleads a decline in the retirement fortunes of millions of Americans and crusades against basic religious practices.
There is no high-minded, we-are-all-in-this-together alternative to Trump. There is no paragon of honesty or virtue or competence waiting to turn the American presidency into a new season of "The West Wing." There is just a disgustingly disloyal opposition, whose happiest recent days were brought on by a global pandemic.
But even as his opposition grows more irresponsible, Trump is not absolved of the need for an accurate, clear and sober public message. He should not minimize the risk or engage in his usual hyperbole. This is where the rubber hits the road on public trust, and Trump needs to get it exactly right or face extreme political damage.
His best course is to simply be calm and honest: More people will get this virus, some will die, and washing your hands is a good way to stay healthy. The administration should give routine updates on progress toward a vaccine, mortality rates and travel advice.

Can our rural roads be saved?

Texto completo: The recent New York Times article "The Struggle to Mend America's Rural Roads" used Wisconsin as a microcosm for the infrastructure crisis that either directly or indirectly affects all Americans.
Personally, I'm tickled with the job the county road department does with my own stretch of country road. But for people in many states and localities, broken axles, wrecked suspension systems, busted tires, emergency road closings and unpredictable weight limits for aging bridges are an ever-looming danger. Shoppers, commuters, tourists, farmers and truckers hauling the nation's food supply are all at the mercy of substandard rural roads.
The normal life span of an asphalt road is 30 years, but many rural roads have been in service for more than 75 years.
Unfortunately, road construction and maintenance do not come cheap. Reconstructing a mile of road costs $300,000; even chip sealing (a kind of short-term patching) costs $17,000 a mile. Some officeholders are better at keeping costs down than others.
All federal, state and local agencies must make hard decisions about finite resources, but some places are less ashamed of their stinginess than others.
Many urbanites – unable to see past their subways and other forms of mass transit – demonstrate a dismaying lack of empathy for fellow Americans who live in "flyover country." ("I didn't force them to live in the boonies.)
To be sure, open-minded city-dwellers can visit the hinterlands and really "click" with the locals and their needs. Their hearts are in the right place. (Or maybe their hearts have shifted to the lower intestine region after hitting one bump too many.)
But even the most sympathetic visitors know that whatever state or federal funding might materialize, the answer must start with the people directly affected. And locals can be reluctant to disrupt the status quo by opening their wallets wider. As John Denver sang, "Country roads, take me home – unless there's a big tax bill waiting in the mailbox!"
Still, I hope the Times article will reignite a long-stalled national discussion of the seen and unseen costs of deteriorating infrastructure. People from all regions, all income levels, all political persuasions must put their petty differences aside, roll up their sleeves and brainstorm solutions.
As Prof. Emmett Brown from "Back to the Future" might have said, "Bipartisanship? Where we're going, we don't need bipartisanship! KA-THUMP KA-THUMP CRASH! AIIIIEEEEE!"

Coronavirus fears make 2011's 'Contagion' suddenly relevant

Texto completo: The 2011 movie "Contagion" does something in its first few minutes that public health officials are still trying to accomplish.
It makes the advice to wash your hands often seem as urgent as that inevitable moment in horror films where the viewers want to yell at the screen, "Get out of the house ... now!"
Life in 2020 is increasingly a nervous waiting game for coronavirus updates. What's the latest headline? Which events have been canceled? How many states have declared an emergency?
This week, even James Bond was put on hold. The release of the 007 movie "No Time To Die" was moved from April to November over worries about theater closings in Italy, South Korea, China and Japan — countries hit hard by COVID-19, the abbreviated name for the virus.
There is a lot of worry happening, along with some panicked stockpiling of toilet paper. So why would anyone want to watch "Contagion," which has climbed the charts faster than a Lizzo single?
Because, in the big picture, it's worth seeing. Sure, it will freak you out. But its message on the need for precautions is beyond powerful.
"Contagion," a well-crafted drama that until recently was relatively obscure, has become a hot rental at online sites like Amazon Prime and iTunes.
Why? As director Barry Jenkins ("Moonlight") told the New York Times, ""I was really curious to see how well it would line up to what is happening right now. It was shocking. It felt like I was watching a documentary that has all these movie stars playing real people."
Nowhere is that more evident than in a scene where CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta — yes, the real guy did a cameo — is interviewing a CDC expert played by Laurence Fishburne.
"Our best defense has been social distancing, no handshaking, staying home when you're sick, washing your hands frequently," says Fishburne.
That sounds exactly like a clip from any and every cable news channel.
Art imitates life so closely in such sequences that you may begin to wonder whether the rest of the movie will come true. And that's a frightening prospect because the screenplay deals with catastrophic loss.
But "Contagion" is fictional. The coronavirus is not the same as the MEV-1 virus imagined by the movie.
In real life, COVID-19, first detected in Wuhan, China, in December, has resulted globally in nearly 100,000 cases and more than 3,300 deaths.
In the film, Gwyneth Paltrow's character brings the MEV-1 virus to Minneapolis after a business trip to Hong Kong, Roughly a month into the made-up time line, the death toll is 2.5 million in America alone.
The COVID-19 death rate has been estimated as 3.4%. The imaginary MEV-1 virus kills more like 20% of those infected.
Clearly, "Contagion" is a worst-case scenario with an all-star cast.
It's a great ensemble. Matt Damon portrays an everyman dad struggling to hold things together for his teenage daughter. Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and Marion Cotillard play dedicated public health experts. Jude Law is intense and reckless as a conspiracy-chasing blogger, while Jennifer Ehle is equally risk-taking, but in a heroic way, as a CDC scientist racing to find a vaccine.
Oh, and — spoiler alert! — Paltrow, as Damon's wife, dies almost immediately after returning home as a result of the lightning-fast progression of the disease.
Soderbergh's 9-year-old movie is a master class in creating suspense out of rather complex science.
Early on, Paltrow's character sits in a Chicago airport bar and coughs occasionally as she waits for a delayed flight. The camera pans to the bowl of nuts that she's been eating from, then to the credit card she hands to the bartender, then to the machine where the card is swiped.
This is a thriller where the danger lies not in criminals or maniacs, but the human touch.
As clues pop up in Hong Kong, London, and Tokyo that a pandemic is emerging, it becomes clear that the villainous germs are outpacing the knowledge of experts. Fishburne and his CDC team must scramble to identify and contain the virus. They track clusters of infections at health clubs and elementary schools and, in Winslet's case, travel to a hot zone. As a result of what they learn, the process starts of creating a vaccine in time to save literally millions of lives. Along the way, they sometimes put their own lives in jeopardy (a nice way of saying that Paltrow isn't the only shocking casualty).
Meanwhile, rumors spread through Law's Truth Serum Now blog that the virus is actually a military or industrial weapon. Law touts a natural cure, forsythia, and brags about having 12 million unique visitors. One of the movie's more gratifying scenes comes when a veteran scientist played by Elliott Gould blasts Law's careless journalistic standards. "Blogging is not writing," barks Gould. "It's graffiti with punctuation."
"Contagion" floats many plot twists that echo with what is known about COVID-19, including tying the origin of the fictional virus to bats and pigs. Recently in real life, China banned the wildlife trade over suspicions that exotic animals infected humans.
In the movie, hospitals are flooded with patients and a National Guard armory is turned into a vast triage center for bed-ridden patients. In real-world Wuhan, China, where COVID-19 was first detected, two hospitals were built to deal with the sick in a little more than a week's time.
Yet "Contagion" takes things to awful extremes. By the time it's over, quarantines are in place is some cities. Rioting and looting have cleared out stores. The president is off somewhere at an undisclosed location. Ultimately, 26 million people in the United States die, and some of them are buried by necessity in mass graves.
Don't mistake "Contagion" for a guidebook. It's just a creative exercise. But pay attention to the movie's cautionary lessons. Learn what precautions and preparations you should be taking. Seek information from legitimate sources and avoid unproven theories and scams that litter social media.
This is serious stuff. If we are able to look back someday and conclude that the United States was over-prepared for the coronavirus outbreak — that the impact wasn't as bad as we feared — well, that would be a blessing.
But we're not through this yet, so keep listening to scientists, doctors and other medical experts.
You don't have to sit through "Contagion" to understand all of this. But it's one heck of a reminder to wash your hands.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - On a website called Azerbaijani Eagles, you can commission a murder for $5,000. The site Slayers Hitmen provides more options, with a beating going for $2,000. Death by torture costs $50,000.
But don't expect someone to get the job done. Experts and law enforcers who have studied these sites - almost all of them on the so-called dark web or dark net - say they are scams. There has not been a known murder attributed to any of them.
That doesn't mean the sites aren't involved in a very dark trade. They have become catch points for real people who are looking to pay to have someone killed. And a number of men and women are sitting in jail after paying one of these sites - and getting caught by police.
In one of the most recent cases to make its way through the courts, a nurse from Illinois was sentenced to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to sending $12,000 in bitcoin to the site Sicilian Hitmen International Network. She had hoped to have the wife of her boyfriend killed.
Twenty-four hit-man-for-hire sites are the subject of an academic paper that was shared in advance with The New York Times by Michigan State University professor Tom Holt and student Ariel Roddy.
The paper is the first academic effort to illuminate what has been a subject of endless intrigue. For years, the potential anonymity granted by the internet has fed predictions that there would be marketplaces for death and assassination.
But it was the emergence of the dark web over the past decade or so that allowed hitman sites to proliferate. Unlike most sites on the traditional internet, dark-web sites use technology that allows both sides of an online interaction to hide their identity and location, from each other and law enforcement.
"It's a fantastic opportunity to defraud people because you give them just enough sense of danger," said Emily Wilson, head of research at Terbium Labs, a security company focused on the dark net. "What are you going to do if they don't go through with it?"
When the first hit-man sites were discovered, an assumption was that the dark web was crawling with legitimate assassins waiting to kill on command.
Promotional material posted to the mainstream internet played on that assumption. One site, which provides readers with a link to the dark net address of the 18th Street Gang, holds itself out as a "guide to real hit men, facts and stories." The site claims that people who say hit-man sites are scams are just trying to discourage people from seeking them out.
"Most customers order from reliable hit men sites that have been proven as legitimate," the site says.
On many of the sites examined by the team at Michigan State, considerable effort was expended trying to prove their legitimacy so customers would feel comfortable making a payment in Bitcoin, the digital currency. Hit men are not the sort of thing you pay for with a credit card.
The site 18th Street Mafia includes a page with links to news stories about real killings it says it helped commit. None of the articles, however, indicate that the site, or even a hit man, was responsible.
The site says: "We can provide video proof of our services, with time stamps. Again, such proof is not possible for fake services."
The 18th Street Mafia did not respond to requests for comment.
The representative for another site, Darkmamba, said in an email that proving its legitimacy had been difficult because "the point of our services and many other, including underground criminal forums, is to indeed complete the job without leaving anything that could get traced back to us."
The most prolific research on these sites has been conducted by Chris Monteiro, a systems administrator in London who has pursued his investigations as a morbid passion project on top of his regular job.
Monteiro hacked into one of the sites created by the most notorious purveyor of assassination sites, a figure going by the name Yura.
After breaking into the Besa Mafia site and a few others, Monteiro found information about 283 people who had paid for hit-man services. He also found messages suggesting that the operators had little intention of going through with the killings.
"I need you to help me do some videos to prove the Besa Mafia legit, but WITHOUT killing anyone," the operator wrote in one email, trying to get a contractor to produce lifelike videos. "I am not a murderer and I don't want anyone be murdered."
Law enforcement agencies around the world have been hesitant to collaborate with Monteiro or use his evidence because of the way he acquired it. But Monteiro has worked with media organizations, including Wired and 48 Hours, which have passed his information to law enforcement officials, eventually leading to the arrests of people who paid the sites to connect them with a hit man.
Monteiro has identified nine cases in which people he exposed were arrested in connection with commissioning hits. In one of the most gruesome cases, a man in Minnesota was arrested after he was found to have killed his wife himself when the hit man he had commissioned on the Besa Mafia website for about $6,000 in bitcoin did not come through.
A police investigator in Russia is believed to have been killed by two teenagers who were hired by a drug trafficker on the dark net. An investigation by the BBC found that the killing had been commissioned on one of the broad marketplaces on the dark net where drugs and stolen credit cards are sold.
But there has still not been a killing commissioned on one of the dedicated hit-man-for-hire sites.
"Why would you set up a dedicated site online when you know absolutely that law enforcement are going to be flooding that site trying to find you?" Wilson said. "You are making yourself too big of a target."
Still, the sites have continued to proliferate. A few months ago, a middle-age executive in Singapore was sent to jail for five years after paying the Camorra Hitman site to kill the boyfriend of his young ex-lover in a staged car accident that, not surprisingly, didn't happen.
Wilson, of Terbium Labs, said these sites took attention from the real crime being committed on the dark net, such as the drug markets and the sites selling the sensitive personal information of millions of Americans.
"There is actual crime, but we are too busy talking about some guy who wants to kill his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend," she said.

Texto completo: The recent New York Times article "The Struggle to Mend America's Rural Roads" used Wisconsin as a microcosm for the infrastructure crisis that either directly or indirectly affects all Americans.
Personally, I'm tickled with the job the county road department does with my own stretch of country road. But for people in many states and localities, broken axles, wrecked suspension systems, busted tires, emergency road closings and unpredictable weight limits for aging bridges are an ever-looming danger. Shoppers, commuters, tourists, farmers and truckers hauling the nation's food supply are all at the mercy of substandard rural roads.
The normal life span of an asphalt road is 30 years, but many rural roads have been in service for more than 75 years.
Unfortunately, road construction and maintenance do not come cheap. Reconstructing a mile of road costs $300,000; even chip sealing (a kind of short-term patching) costs $17,000 a mile. Some officeholders are better at keeping costs down than others.
All federal, state and local agencies must make hard decisions about finite resources, but some places are less ashamed of their stinginess than others.
Many urbanites – unable to see past their subways and other forms of mass transit – demonstrate a dismaying lack of empathy for fellow Americans who live in "flyover country." ("I didn't force them to live in the boonies.)
To be sure, open-minded city-dwellers can visit the hinterlands and really "click" with the locals and their needs. Their hearts are in the right place. (Or maybe their hearts have shifted to the lower intestine region after hitting one bump too many.)
But even the most sympathetic visitors know that whatever state or federal funding might materialize, the answer must start with the people directly affected. And locals can be reluctant to disrupt the status quo by opening their wallets wider. As John Denver sang, "Country roads, take me home – unless there's a big tax bill waiting in the mailbox!"
Still, I hope the Times article will reignite a long-stalled national discussion of the seen and unseen costs of deteriorating infrastructure. People from all regions, all income levels, all political persuasions must put their petty differences aside, roll up their sleeves and brainstorm solutions.
As Prof. Emmett Brown from "Back to the Future" might have said, "Bipartisanship? Where we're going, we don't need bipartisanship! KA-THUMP KA-THUMP CRASH! AIIIIEEEEE!"

Author Michael Koryta takes on new identity

Texto completo: Who is Scott Carson?
In the jacket of his book "The Chill," which came out last month, it's revealed that it's actually a pen name for a best-selling author in New England.
Carson's ties are a little closer to home, though. He's actually Indiana University alumnus Michael Koryta.
"The Chill" was inspired by an April 2016 story in the New York Times with the headline "(New York Mayor Bill) DeBlasio postpones work on crucial water tunnel." The story mentions a 2002 meeting during previous Mayor Michael Bloomberg's first few weeks in the position, when officials discussed emergency preparedness for various disaster scenarios — terrorist attacks and hurricanes, for example.
With century-old tunnels carrying billions of gallons of water into the city, the possibility of their collapse was another very real threat. Koryta said he hopes his story will not only entertain readers, but also help them understand what it means to lose funding to repair our country's infrastructure.
"It really is terrifying," he said. "It reminds me of the loss of community news. It's the sort of thing that it's very easy for a community or country to overlook. At some point, someone will be writing about these dams — and it'll either be front page news of a tragedy, or it'll be a small story inside about someone allocating a budget to fix it."
The former Herald-Times reporter said the New York Times story was an example of how reporters on less "sexy" beats cover crucial topics that often don't get much attention. "The only way that this book came into existence was because a reporter on a municipal beat did a great story that I then saw," Koryta said. "But without that article, there's no book."
Despite its roots in municipal planning, "The Chill" is at its heart a ghost story, so of course, there are ghosts. They include workers who died building water tunnels; families from the historic towns drowned in favor of providing water to the big city; and current-day characters who become ghosts as the story progresses. Interactions between the living and the dead — and progress and disaster — turn a cautionary tale about government spending into true horror.
One character in the book is a woman who was raised in the culture of a town that was claimed by eminent domain to build a reservoir for New York City water. As a girl, she brought the long-dead town to life through her sketchbook.
Koryta enlisted the help of 17-year-old Edgewood High School junior April Strawn to include the sketches in the back cover of the novel. "She's just a stunningly talented artist," he said — too talented, in fact. "I had to ask her to bring her talent down a notch, to make it look like an a child had drawn it."
The result is a spread of rough sketches that help bring the story of the water to life. Strawn's work is paired with haunting archival photos Koryta found in the New York Public Library, documenting a time when villages that had been there for hundreds of years were evacuated.
With the help of his alter-ego, Koryta answered some questions about his new project and the future of Scott Carson.
Q: Why did you decide to take up a pseudonym?
A: Practical and impractical reasons. On the latter, I'd always loved the idea of having a pseudonym and a second writer identity. Seems like fun, and provides some new perspective and new energy. On the former, the practical consideration, it has been nearly a decade since I last wrote a supernatural story, and it made sense to try to provide some brand clarity to the booksellers, where Carson will write only supernatural stories, and Koryta will stay out of his way. I've always had a dream of having a name that strangers can pronounce and spell, too. In a word-of-mouth business, it seems beneficial!
Q: What are some of your favorite pseudonyms by other authors?
A: Always a fan of Joe Hill, who is Stephen King's son but was determined to prove that he could publish without the help of the last name. People question the reality of that story, but I worked with an editor who passed on Joe Hill's first book, and I assure you he didn't know that Hill was King's son at that time. I liked what John Banville did, with Benjamin Black handling his genre side and John remaining in the literary pool. And I'm a big fan of this guy named Mark Twain.
Q: How does Scott Carson differ from your true self, as an author? What makes his writing separate?
A: Sadly, I haven't seen Scott come up with a unique style. His work reminds me of "So Cold the River," "The Cypress House," and "The Ridge." (A comparison that was made in a Publisher's Weekly review, which made me chuckle.) But I'm leaving Scott on the dark side, so we will see what happens to him as time goes by. I mean, he's from New England. Any good Colts fan understands that is morally perilous country, a land that corrupts the soul. I worry for Scott, spending so much time in a place like that.
Q: To follow up the previous question, how do you decide whether something is a Scott Carson book vs. a Michael Koryta book?
A: Anything with the supernatural or a more speculative/magical element will be left in Scott's hands. Koryta is working on a book that features the Blackwell family of "Those Who Wish Me Dead" and "If She Wakes." He's underwater at the moment, so hopefully Scott is being productive.
Q: If Scott Carson were an actual person, what do you image he'd be like? Look like? Do for fun? Where would he live? What does he wear?
A: What do you mean "if" he were an actual person? I know the guy! He's a bit of a homebody, not very social. Lives in a place where the sun goes down early and work is done in the dark. It's a chilly place. He has a fondness for black hoodies, particularly one adorned with movie spoilers. He likes a good whiskey. He's big on long walks with his dog in the cold. The dog is his first editor, and seems often unimpressed by the ideas that Scott offers on those walks.
Q: What are Scott's plans for the future?
A: Well, he's under contract to deliver more books, so I hope he is hard at work. We should be hearing from him again sometime in the next two years.

Dems face a split party following Super Tuesday

Información de publicación: Reno Gazette - Journal ; Reno, Nev. [Reno, Nev]. 08 Mar 2020: D.5.

Texto completo: Super Tuesday has come and gone. A total of 1,357 delegates (34% of the total) were allocated to various candidates on March 3. While most of the delegates from the Super Tuesday are still in the process of being allocated, there are clear trends that give us a good idea of where things are headed in the Democrat nomination contest.
Swing state problem: Bernie has had strong performances in New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, Colorado and Minnesota. They are all swing states in the general election. 12% of Bernie supporters in 2016 voted for Trump in the general election (source: NPR). Expect that number to be higher this time if Bernie is not the nominee.
Racial divide: Blacks are going strong for Biden; Hispanics are going strong for Bernie. In a two-man race, this is an interesting dynamic to watch. The Hispanic factor could easily swing Nevada red if Bernie is not the Democrat nominee.
Biden's gaffes get worse: During his Super Tuesday victory speech, he confused his wife for his sister. A day before, he called it "Super Thursday" before stopping himself. He called Chris Wallace "Chuck" (as in Todd). During the debate he claimed 150 million American lives (about half of the total population) were lost to gun violence since 2007. He botched the Declaration of Independence during a rally in Texas with, "All men and women created ... by the — you know — you know the thing." A single miss is not an issue. Taken collectively, this pattern of miscues is disquieting. In my column "Bob Mueller's last act has come and gone" (Aug. 7), I wrote about the once-great war hero Bob Mueller's disappointing testimony where he looked totally lost. Much like Mueller, Joe Biden, once a dominant figure in American politics, appears to be headed in the wrong direction cognitively at a crucial time.
More progressive weapons backfire: Progressive activists constantly entered Trump rallies in the lead-up to the 2016 election. While I fully recognize one's rights to peaceful protests, entering another person's event to disrupt proceedings clearly crosses the line. That weapon has now turned against the Democrats. Amy Klobuchar had to cancel a rally when protestors stormed the stage. Joe Biden's victory speech was interrupted by protestors nearly endangering the former vice president's physical safety. Bernie's rally in Carson City was interrupted by protestors last month.
Networks deceive: Networks kept "calling" the race and putting a check mark next to the candidate like it is the general election. Somehow, they ignored the fact that unlike the general election, where it is winner-take-all, the Democratic primary allocates delegates proportionally. Take Texas as an example. At last check, Biden had bagged 81 delegates and Bernie had won 72 delegates. Yet the networks declared Biden a "winner" a few hours after the polls closed.
One final point: Just before the South Carolina primary, fresh off a massive win in Nevada, Bernie Sanders appeared to have a clear path to the Democrat party nomination. The New York Times interviewed 93 unelected "superdelegates." According to The Times, they were committed to stopping Bernie Sanders even if it meant intraparty damage. This adds fuel to the Bernie Bros.' perception they are being cheated.
Following Biden's victory in South Carolina and on the eve of Super Tuesday, Klobuchar, Buttigieg and O'Rourke all endorsed Biden. The day after Super Tuesday, Bloomberg dropped out and endorsed Biden. The timing of these endorsements will sure come across to Bernie supporters as an organized attempt by the party to stop Bernie. If Bernie does not win the nomination, these endorsements will come back to haunt the Democrats in the general election and for years to come.

Texto completo: Throughout the month, Shreve Memorial Library is celebrating Youth Art Month (YAM) and giving teens a chance to develop visual arts skills to use after high school.
Libraries offer tons of resources to help teens succeed in school and prepare for life after graduation. Shreve Memorial Library is no different. The library provides homework help, test preparation, creative outlets, and even job opportunities for teens.
Teens and children of all ages can get homework assistance through programs like the North Shreveport Branch's Homework Club. The Homework Club meets on Monday evenings at 4 p.m. and offers a fun place to work on homework assignments, study for a test, and get peer tutoring. In essence, the Homework Club is kids helping kids to make the grade.
Teens looking to further their educations can also prep for big tests like the ACT or SAT with help from the library. Online resources such as Homework Louisiana and Learning Express provide practice tests and study resources for taking the ACT, SAT, AP tests, and more. In addition, the Main (Downtown) Branch of Shreve Memorial Library will host an ACT Practice Test free of charge on Saturday, March 28 from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Teens can practice taking the ACT in a simulated testing facility. The practice tests last three hours and features each of the four tests – English, Math, Reading and Science – that appear on the actual ACT. Teens can register for the test at bit.ly/2SYbjM1.
Throughout the month, Shreve Memorial Library is celebrating Youth Art Month (YAM) and giving teens a chance to develop visual arts skills to use after high school. Teens can learn to paint, draw, and even become a sculptor following in the footsteps of great artists such as Henri Matisse, Michelangelo, Vincent Van Gogh and Gianlorenzo Bernini. Skills learned in these hands-on workshops can be applied to a variety of career fields.
And did I mention that Shreve Memorial Library also provides job opportunities for teens? Now through March 18, teens age 16+ can apply for a paid summer internship at the library. What better way to get real world life experience than with a summer job? To apply, teens must be at least 16 years of age by March 18, have a 2.0 GPA, and be enrolled in high school.
At Shreve Memorial Library, we believe that everyone should be able to dream, discover and do. For more information about teen opportunities at Shreve Memorial Library and to apply for a summer internship, visit www.shreve-lib.org.
What's New at the Library Lady Clementine by Marie Benedict (fiction)
From Marie Benedict, the New York Times bestselling author of The Only Woman in the Room, an incredible novel that focuses on one of the people who had the most influence during World War I and World War II: Clementine Churchill. In 1909, Clementine steps off a train with her new husband, Winston. An angry woman emerges from the crowd to attack, shoving him in the direction of an oncoming train. Just before he stumbles, Clementine grabs him by his suit jacket. This will not be the last time Clementine Churchill will save her husband. Lady Clementine is the ferocious story of the ambitious woman beside Winston Churchill, the story of a partner who did not flinch through the sweeping darkness of war, and who would not surrender either to expectations or to enemies.
When You See Me by Lisa Gardner (fiction)
FBI Special Agent Kimberly Quincy and Sergeant Detective D.D. Warren have built a task force to follow the digital bread crumbs left behind by deceased serial kidnapper Jacob Ness. When a disturbing piece of evidence is discovered in the hills of Georgia, they bring Flora Dane and true-crime savant Keith Edgar to a small town where something seems to be deeply wrong. What at first looks like a Gothic eeriness soon hardens into something much more sinister... and they discover that for all the evil Jacob committed while alive, his worst secret is still to be revealed. Quincy and D.D. must summon their considerable skills and experience to crack the most disturbing case of their careers – and Flora must face her own past directly in the hope of saving others.
We Are the Nerds by Christine Lagorio-Chafkin (non-fiction)
Reddit hails itself as "the front page of the Internet." It's the third most-visited website in the United States – and yet, millions of Americans have no idea what it is. We Are the Nerds is an engrossing look deep inside this captivating, maddening enterprise, whose army of obsessed users have been credited with everything from solving cold case crimes and spurring tens of millions of dollars in charitable donations to seeding alt-right fury and landing Donald Trump in the White House. We Are the Nerds is a gripping start-up narrative: the story of how Reddit's founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, rose up from their suburban childhoods to become millionaires and create an icon of the digital age – before seeing the site engulfed in controversies and nearly losing control of it for good. Based on Christine Lagorio-Chafkin's exclusive access to founders Ohanian and Huffman, We Are the Nerds is also a compelling exploration of the way we all communicate today – and how we got here. Reddit and its users have become a mirror of the Internet: it has dingy corners, shiny memes, malicious trolls, and a sometimes heart-melting ability to connect people across cultures, oceans, and ideological divides.

Texto completo: Have you started planning your summer vacation yet? It'll be sipping-lemonade-by-the-pool season before you know it. I love vacations, but here's what I don't love: Nearly 40 percent of millennials are willing to go into debt for their trips.
Coming back home to credit card bills makes the end of a vacation miserable. I don't want that to be your story. If you start saving up now, you'll be in great shape when it's time to pack your bags.
Here are eight ways to save up and pay for your vacation with your own money:
1. Give your budget a refresh. If it's been a while since you looked at where your money is really going each month, I bet you'll find some areas where you can cut back in a matter of minutes. Then, you can put that cash toward your vacation fund.
2. Brew your own coffee at home. I get it. Fancy coffee with a designer label makes me feel special, too. But if you put that $25 a week into a vacation fund for a while, you'll add a couple hundred bucks or more to your travel budget.
3. Pack your lunch. Peanut butter and jelly today means piña coladas all day on the beach this summer.
4. Order water at restaurants. If you go out to eat, give up extras like soda, appetizers, and alcohol.
5. Save on groceries by shopping generic or at Aldi. Everyone I know swears their grocery bill was slashed in half simply by switching to shopping at Aldi. If you don't have one near you, you can save money buying store brand or generic brand items.
6. Sell your kids' clothes at consignment stores. I'm a huge fan of this! I also love shopping consignment to save money.
7. Sell stuff online through places like Facebook Marketplace. You know there's stuff lying around the house, in the garage, or in your closet that you don't use anymore. Put it to good use by selling it, and put that money toward your vacation!
8. Cancel any unused subscriptions. When's the last time you really watched a show on HBO, or used any of the makeup samples from your Birchbox? I'm not hating on subscription services, but if you don't use them, that's money leaving your bank account each month you could be saving.
Once you try these money-saving tips, you might just make them a habit. Then, you'll be ahead of the game when it's vacation time next year. My free Vacation Budget Worksheet makes it super easy to plan for all your expenses.
Things always cost more than you expect. But this worksheet will help you plan for everything — even the unexpected stuff.
As a No.1 New York Times best-selling author, host of The Rachel Cruze Show, and The Rachel Cruze Show podcast, Rachel helps people learn the proper ways to handle money and stay out of debt. She's authored three best-selling books. You can follow Cruze at rachelcruze.com.

Worst-case scenario would call for drastic measures School closings? Canceled events? It's all possible. CORONAVIRUS IN CONNECTICUT

Texto completo: As of now, doctors and public health officials have limited tools to combat COVID-19, the new strain of coronavirus that has quickly spread across the world.
There is no vaccine. There is no antiviral treatment. There is only preventing the spread through "social distancing," a term that encompasses everything from closing schools to shutting down parks and mass transit.
"When we are dealing with an epidemic, we reach in the tool box and pull out a vaccine," state epidemiologist Matthew Cartter said. "But [with coronavirus], we don't have that."
In a worst-case scenario, the implications for Connecticut could be far-reaching. Public schools could close, colleges could shut down, public places could be deserted, the upcoming presidential primary could be affected.
Cartter was clear Friday that Connecticut does not yet need drastic measures. No one knows exactly how quickly COVID-19 will move or how many people will become sick, though experts say most patients will self-recover, as they would after the flu. With only two confirmed cases linked to the state, Connecticut has not been hit as hard as others.
But given the possibility of large-scale outbreak and the lack of treatment options, wide closures could eventually become necessary, as officials seek to slow the spread enough to treat severe cases.
"Most of us do not remember the kind of control measures that are going to be needed to keep hospitals open, to keep taking care of the most seriously ill," Cartter said, referencing the 1918-19 influenza pandemic.
For the state to impose mass closures, Gov. Ned Lamont would have to declare a civil preparedness emergency, which would give him broad powers over public institutions. Brenda Bergeron, principal attorney for the Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, said Lamont's decision to take that step will depend on conversations with his unified command.
"The governor's office has the state agencies consider what they might need to waive or modify," Bergeron said, "and if there's a need for that, that's one of the reasons he might declare an emergency."
So far, governors in California, Washington, Florida and Maryland have declared states of emergency in response to COVID-19.
Across the world, regions with significant COVID-19 outbreaks have begun to take dramatic precautions. As of Tuesday, 22 countries on three continents had closed schools because of the virus, according to the United Nations, resulting in almost 300 million students left at home. In Italy, all professional soccer games will be played without any fans in attendance for the next month. Disneyland parks in Shanghai and Tokyo have been closed temporarily.
Public officials in the United States have begun to weigh similarly strong responses. One public school district in Washington state has suspended classes for up to two weeks, and the University of Washington said Friday that it would cancel in-person classes and have students take courses and finals remotely while the Seattle area grapples with a growing outbreak. If the virus becomes more widespread, other colleges around the country could follow.
Over the last few days, a growing number of universities have mobilized emergency planning teams to envision what a shutdown would look like, especially if students bring the virus back with them from spring break, which started Friday on many campuses.
Already, some students have been warned that they should be prepared to learn online, as many students studying abroad in Europe and Asia have been forced to do.
On Friday, organizers canceled the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, citing coronavirus. Closures and cancellations are likely to continue in coming weeks and months, as authorities consider even more dramatic responses, such as the cancellation of the Summer Olympics in Japan.
In Connecticut, the state Department of Education says it continues to coordinate with local school districts as they weigh potential responses. Until the state declares a civil preparedness emergency, decisions on school cancellations continue to fall to individual districts.
Writing in the New York Times, University of Michigan medical historian Howard Markel argued that school districts should err toward closing, citing his study on the 1918-19 flu pandemic.
"School closing turned out to be one of the most effective firewalls against the spread of the pandemic," he wrote. "Cities that acted fast, for lengthy periods of time, and included school closing and at least one other [non-pharmaceutical intervention] in their responses saw the lowest death rates."
Most states, including Connecticut, continue to hold widely attended events, such as the UConn men's basketball game in Storrs on Thursday night that drew more than 10,000 fans.
Asked whether those events pose danger, health officials said risk is limited as long as there is no community transmission - i.e. no residents are being infected here in Connecticut.
Travel restrictions could also expand along with the spread of the virus. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have travel advisories of varying severity for five countries: China, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Japan, as well as Hong Kong.
Many colleges, including in Connecticut, have canceled school-related travel. UConn has urged students to cancel all non-essential international trips, including on spring break.
"The coronavirus situation continues to rapidly evolve; because of this, travel restrictions and guidance may also continue to change very quickly," UConn said in a statement.

3 steps to communicate your value to customers

Texto completo: As business leaders, we're often faced with the challenge of explaining what we do. It could be in a casual setting like a dinner party, or a more formal sales presentation to that big new potential account. The problem is, most of us get it all wrong.
We tend to explain what we do in the context of our product or service. We tell people we manufacture industrial drill presses, or sell variable life insurance, or perform massage therapy. While factually accurate, there is a far better way to communicate your value proposition.
Communicating the transformation you create for customers, instead of the mechanics of how you do it, will help people better understand the value you provide. To do so, try to craft your message such that it addresses these three customer promises:
1. After working with me, customers will have no more _______________.
2. After working with me, customer will have a good deal more ___________.
3. After working with me, customers will have less ________________.
No more. More. And less.
If you can explain how you impact customers' lives across these three aspects, you'll create a powerful and emotionally charged connection point.
Instead of saying that you are a corporate travel agency, why not say that your travel services eliminate wasted travel costs and surprises (No. 1), providing customers a lot more peace of mind (No. 2) while having wasted far less time (No. 3)?
Instead of saying you run a cybersecurity business, try saying that you help clients eliminate threats of all types (No. 1), allowing them to devote more resources to serving their customers (No. 2) while having a lot less anxiety and fear over an inevitable cyber-attack (No. 3).
Of course, you can switch up the order and personalize to your style and needs. The point is, getting clear how you specifically help customers eliminate something (No. 1), get more of something (No. 2), and get less of something (No. 3), will dramatically boost the efficacy of your message.
When you study the most persuasive arguments, from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, to award-winning TV commercials to the most effective politicians, you'll notice how the message is shaped to deliver these three promises.
As a next step, gather your team for a 30-minute discussion on how your product or service impacts the lives of your customers in these three ways. Once you're clear on it, these three promises can serve as a powerful foundation that shapes your overall approach to marketing and communication.
Three promises. One gigantic result.

In Connecticut, the state Department of Education says it continues to coordinate with local school districts as they weigh potential responses. Until the state declares a civil preparedness emergency, decisions on school cancellations continue to fall to individual districts.
Writing in the New York Times, University of Michigan medical historian Howard Markel argued that school districts should err toward closing, citing his study on the 1918-19 flu pandemic.
"School closing turned out to be one of the most effective firewalls against the spread of the pandemic," he wrote. "Cities that acted fast, for lengthy periods of time, and included school closing and at least one other [non-pharmaceutical intervention] in their responses saw the lowest death rates."
Most states, including Connecticut, continue to hold widely attended events, such as the UConn men's basketball game in Storrs on Thursday night that drew more than 10,000 fans.
Asked whether those events pose danger, health officials said risk is limited as long as there is no community transmission - i.e. no residents are being infected here in Connecticut.
Travel restrictions could also expand along with the spread of the virus. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have travel advisories of varying severity for five countries: China, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Japan, as well as Hong Kong.
Many colleges, including in Connecticut, have canceled school-related travel. UConn has urged students to cancel all non-essential international trips, including on spring break.
"The coronavirus situation continues to rapidly evolve; because of this, travel restrictions and guidance may also continue to change very quickly," UConn said in a statement.

Texto completo: So, we're down to Joe and Bernie, though more likely
we're down to Joe and Donald.
Virginia played a big role in transforming the presidential election and on Thursday made the front page of The New York Times.
"Overall, 1.3 million voters in Virginia went to the polls on Tuesday, surpassing the votes cast in 2016 by nearly 70 percent," wrote
the Times, "and, even more
stunningly, breaking a previous Democratic record of 986,000 votes set in 2008, when Barack Obama was on the ballot."
That number - 1.3 million voters - along with a variant of the word "stunning," showed up about everywhere in the days since Super Tuesday. The results were a bit jolting, perhaps
indicative of some primal,
political surge.
Who knows? But when that surge gets married to the lawmaking activities in Richmond over the past two months - a manic period of Democratic Party assertiveness - you realize Virginia is on a bit of ride.
To where? Well, the fun lies in the uncertainty.
There's a wonderful little story that art critic Kenneth Clark liked to tell about the people of some ancient Mediterranean city. They abruptly get word of approaching barbarians, likely to wreck, ruin, pillage or worse.
Only, after a period, the people of this city learn that the barbarians have gone elsewhere, that their homeland is saved. Which causes great disappointment among the people, because, after all, it would have been better than nothing.
This goes directly to my working theory of the 2016 presidential election, that some perverse American sense of humor kicked in. Despite the risks involved, rolling the dice on Donald Trump seemed preferable to sure death by boredom at the hands of another self-righteous Democrat.
It sort of worked. Trump always seems to be tempting disaster, but he's not been boring.
My favorite Trump story, which I have yet to see emerge since he took the White House, occurred more than 20 years ago, in the days when he regularly appeared on CNN's "Larry King Show."
Donald and Larry were making merry - politics, his social life, whatever - when Trump paused and said, "Larry, I just have to tell you, your breath is really bad."
I wasn't even paying close attention, but I heard that and thought, "What!"
Poor Larry was flummoxed, reduced to muttering, "Oh, OK, thanks, Donald."
Why? Why would you make a gratuitous observation to the disadvantage of your TV host?
Now we know - ah, yes, more than three years worth of knowing - that Trump may say just about anything at anytime.
Now comes the Democrat and, in all likelihood, we're about to witness a real contest between Trump and Biden over who's more given to untethered verbal expression.
It was mildly amusing, beginning last year, to watch young journalists "introducing" us to Biden. Here's what you need to know, they would start.
Are you kidding? Biden has been with us since winning a U.S. Senate seat in 1972 and ran for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, though he never made it out of 1987.
Why? Because he would just say stuff, including things other people had said previously. Remember Neil Kinnock, the British Labor leader?
It was Times reporter Maureen Dowd, now a celebrated columnist, who upended Biden in 1987 by dredging up a speech by Kinnock that strongly resembled, right down to the rhetorical flourishes, remarks subsequently made by Biden about his hard-fought, working class path upward.
Of course, it's not unheard of to borrow a few things in the speechwriting biz. You can argue oral traditions going back to Herodotus and say, oh, did I forget to attribute that?
But, generally speaking, it's best - for the sake of self-preservation, if nothing else - to reference the source of all stirring words lifted. Just mention Churchill or something.
I will say this about Biden: He doesn't fudge on owning up to his mistakes. "Nobody did this to Joe Biden," he said as he shut down his presidential bid way-back-when. "I'm a big boy. Every other time in my life when I've faced something where I've lost, I have learned a lesson from it."
So, this fall, we're going to benefit from the sum total of Biden's lessons and more than a little unvarnished free thinking. Trump will be doing the same, no doubt.
But it will be the quality of thinking involved - the purposes and the intents, along with the heart and the integrity - that will make the difference.

Texto completo: Nature abhors a vacuum. According to the laws of nature and physics, an empty or unfilled space is unnatural.
International power politics works the same way. When one country cedes or loses influence in a region, another will inevitably rush in to take its place.
In the last three years, decisions made by the Trump White House have created power vacuums in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and even in Latin America. Russia, Syria and Iran have taken advantage of our erratic policies in Syria and Iraq. The collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership along with critical reductions in foreign aid have opened the door to Chinese influence in Asia, Africa and South America. And throughout the world, we are beginning to pay the price for what can only be described as Trump's ongoing assault on experience and expertise in the American diplomatic corps.
We have a President who does not read, will not learn and cannot conceal his contempt for the work of the nonpartisan foreign policy professionals who have been the backbone of our State Department and National Security Council. The most recent example of this contempt was the blatantly vindictive removal of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from his White House office. Vindman, the top NSC expert on Ukraine, had responded to a lawful Congressional subpoena and told the truth about the President's now-famous telephone conversation.
His testimony in the impeachment hearings, along with that of other brave foreign service officers who have dedicated their lives to executing American foreign policy, was truly impressive. These are exactly the kind of professionals who are being forced out of government service. Former Deputy Secretary of State and Ambassador to Russia William J Burns wrote an article in Foreign Affairs Magazine last October entitled "The Demolition of U.S. Diplomacy."
"Not since Joe McCarthy has the State Department suffered such a devastating blow," he said. "In my three and a half decades as a U.S. Foreign Service officer, proudly serving five presidents and ten secretaries of state from both parties, I've never seen an attack on diplomacy as damaging, to both the State Department as an institution and our international influence, as the one now underway."
In an article in USA Today last month, Steven Kashkett, a 30-year State Department veteran, wrote that 44 percent of Trump's appointed ambassadors were not experienced diplomats, but political appointees.
"The current U.S. ambassadors to the U.K., France, Israel, South Africa, and the United Nations are, respectively, two current or former sports team owners, a bankruptcy lawyer, a handbag designer and the wife of a coal magnate," he said.
The statistics are appalling. Dozens of important countries still don't have a U.S. ambassador. As many as half of the top-level jobs in the State Department are still unfilled. Embassies everywhere are understaffed.
There are even serious questions around the world about who is conducting American foreign policy. Rudy Giuliani, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and no doubt others, have been working independently to further the president's personal interests.
In a New York Times op-ed a few months ago, former Foreign Service Officer Bethany Milton, wrote, "No one knows exactly how many employees have left the State Department because of this administration's policies and mismanagement; for every high-profile or well-publicized resignation, there are other officers who quietly decided it was time to retire, go back to school or find a new line of work."
That, unfortunately, sums up what continues to happen in a hollowed-out and demoralized Department of State.
But in Donald Trump's world, "it doesn't matter." After all, he has said, "I make all the decisions." That may be the most terrifying thing President Trump has ever said. Because now that all the foreign policy grown-ups have left the room, it is true.

NY's point man in virus fight

Texto completo: ALBANY - Dr. Howard Zucker right now is the most important person in New York who most New Yorkers never heard of.
He's the state health commissioner who is usually at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's right side these days. He advises Cuomo as the governor directs strategy, medical testing, a corps of hundreds of "health care detectives," and coordinates with federal and local health departments to try to contain the coronavirus.
Typical days the last week began around 4:30 a.m. with new lab results and a day full of meetings and lab analysis, ending around 1 a.m. The rare break was when Zucker left a meeting this week when his 2-year-old son Benjamin fell and bumped his head (he's fine).
"I always felt if you can improve the life of others - whether an individual or many - you should," he said in an interview. "I learned practicing clinical medicine that I have to do everything possible ... it's our role in society."
"But I never expected this kind of situation," he said of the coronavirus threat. "This is an incredible tour de force of government, pulling together all these departments and disciplines."
Beyond coronavirus, Zucker, 60, was a key adviser to Cuomo in his decision to reject hydraulic fracturing for natural gas as a public health and environmental threat. Zucker is also helping lead an effort against vaping and in favor of legalizing marijuana.
It's a long and serendipitous path for a guy who once wanted to be an architect, because he couldn't stand the sight of blood.
Zucker worked in emergency rooms, as a White House fellow during the 2001 terrorist attacks, for the World Health Organization and at Harvard University.
A Bronx-born Yankees fan with a photo signed by Mickey Mantle in 1966, he became one of the nation's youngest doctors at age 22 at the George Washington University School of Medicine, finishing four years of medical school in three. He was trained in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital; in anesthesiology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and pediatric cardiology at Boston Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School.
He has served on boards at Yale and Columbia universities and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Zucker also holds law degrees from Fordham University School of Law and Columbia Law School, which he completed at night, while running an intensive care unit.
"It is about puzzles," Zucker said. "What we are doing with coronavirus is a puzzle, it mixes medicine and forensics and I like trying to figure out what is happening."
For fun, he gets quizzed by his family about the Weekly Health Quiz in the Sunday New York Times and admits he figures out the answer about 95% of the time.
At a 2019 TED talk televised at Cornell University, Zucker seamlessly carried students from Einstein's theory of relativity, to quantum physics, to the Baby Shark dance. He made a point that social media "threatens to tear down public health because of misinformation" by oversimplifying important thoughts into flashes of fact wrapped in opinion.
Zucker, who lives with his wife, Elissa; Benjamin, and 11-month-old Sadie in the Bronx, has widespread support.
At a recent news conference, Cuomo called Zucker his favorite doctor, which is saying something, the governor quipped, because his sister is a physician.
Longtime Senate Health Committee Chairman Kemp Hannon, a Garden City Republican, said Zucker wears many hats, and wears them well.
"Dr. Zucker is uniquely qualified to be the focal point in this coronavirus pandemic, marshaling the state's resources for testing, tracking and reporting," Hannon said. "This situation is a pivotal one where New York and the federal government are cooperating, to date, in a constructive manne

Texto completo: Saturday nights we had a routine. I had a bath and then Mom "set" my hair by twirling the small dark-brown sections around her finger and using dozens of bobby pins to hold them tight as I sat on the thin, green carpet in front of the TV in our small living room.
I was sent off to bed early. "We have a big day tomorrow," Dad would say. He had a paper route, called Bob's Newspaper Delivery Service. Every morning, for eight years, he got up at 4 a.m., picked up his load of papers and delivered them all over West Islip by throwing them wrapped in a rubber band onto his customers' driveways and walkways. Then he went to work as a custodian or, in later years, as a mail clerk for the Plainview Old-Bethpage School District. Mom was the administrative side of the Bob's business, handwriting the bills and addressing the envelopes, collecting the money and paying for the papers each week.
On Sundays, we all helped Dad with his route.
Earlier on Saturdays, my father set up the wooden horses in the garage and placed old doors and plywood sheets on top to make tables where we "assembled" the Sunday papers: Newsday, The New York Times, the New York Herald Tribune, the Daily News among them. The magazine section and all the advertisements had to be inserted into each paper to be hand delivered to the front doors of 800 customers on Sundays. For this he needed a team of people. Dad hired some men to do part of the route, and mom did one, too. I helped my dad and when my brother, Bobby, was old enough, he joined us.
The back of the old blue Rambler was loaded up. Dad delivered to the left side of the street, and I had the right. "Times to 210," he'd say. I'd grab a Times from the back stack and run to the front door. I held the paper in my right hand as I opened the screen door with my left hand and swung it in fast and shut the door, as I'd been taught. Sometimes, the Times was so big I had trouble holding it in my 10-year-old hand, so I had to place it in the bottom of the door and quickly shut the screen door and hope it held. I scooted back into the car to rest and warm up until the next stop. I remember winters when my feet were so cold they pinched.
Four or five hours later, the back of the car was empty and we were on our way to the neighborhood soda fountain shop on Udall Road. I sat at the counter on a shiny red stool as Dad ordered, "two chocolate egg creams." I was a little embarrassed to be seen with my pin-curled head wrapped in a scarf and my hands black from the newspapers, but I wanted that soda. And oh, the sweetness of it!
After a hearty breakfast for all back home, Dad would settle into his recliner by the front door and read the paper, a favorite position and occupation of his for all the years of my memory of him. We cleaned up and mom got the sauce going for the Italian feast we'd have later.
Off came my scarf and out popped a mass of curls! We would dress in our Sunday best and leave Dad to an hour of peace as we trooped off to the Latin Mass at St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church in Brentwood. "Stir the sauce," mom would say, and he did.

Texto completo: Therese Anne Fowler's new novel "A Good Neighborhood" is a cautionary tale about gentrification and the personal toll it can take when cultures collide between longtime residents and newcomers within the intimacy of a shared community.
The premise will be familiar to many intown Atlanta residents who have witnessed the tensions that can arise when upwardly mobile whites move into predominantly black neighborhoods and start making changes and driving up property taxes.
Valerie Alston-Holt is an African American professor who has lived in the leafy Oak Knoll neighborhood of an unnamed North Carolina city for 20 years. She is deeply devoted to two things.One is her son Xavier, a well-liked high school senior who has landed a scholarship to a music conservatory in San Francisco. The other is the environment, specifically plants. Valerie's home is a modest brick ranch on a large wooded lot that she has lovingly landscaped with peonies, irises, camellias, azaleas, jasmine and more. But her most prized plant predates her: an 80-foot white oak tree that towers over the backyard.
"You might not think a tree could mean so much to a person. This tree, though, was more than a magnificent piece of arboreal history; for Valerie Alston-Holt, it was a witness and companion."
Brad Whitman is a successful white entrepreneur and something of a minor celebrity, thanks to his appearance in a series of cheesy TV commercials advertising his heating and air company. He buys the modest home behind Valerie's home and, greasing some palms to skirt local building codes, promptly razes the lot, removing every living thing from the soil. In its place, he has constructed an oversized modern abode that dwarfs the yard and adds a large swimming pool, visible from Valerie's window. He shares the house with his image-conscious wife Julia, teenage stepdaughter Juniper and young daughter Lily.
Brad Whitman is not overtly racist. His racism is subtle and unspoken. For instance, he only employs white HVAC technicians. "Brad understood a truth about his fellow Southern citizens; a great many of them would not open their door to a man of color -- especially a black man, no matter how clean-cut or polite. And Brad couldn't afford to have customers refuse to do business with him owning to their unreasonable fears."
At first, the neighbors make nice, despite Valerie's disgust with the Whitmans' intrusive new home, but two points of tension quickly arise. A romance blossoms between Juniper and Xavier, which is complicated not only by their racial differences but by Juniper's "purity promise," about which much ado has been made. The second is less predictable. It presents itself as a subtle fluttering of leaves from the limbs of the oak tree. Nothing can be done, the tree is dying, most likely a result of the swimming pool construction, which destroyed the tree's shallow root system. Valerie is bereft at first, then she gets mad and sets in motion a series of events that eventually turn tragic.
Fowler is the New York Times bestselling author of the historical novels "Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald" and "A Well-Behaved Woman," about the Vanderbilt family. Her saga of the Whitmans and the Alston-Holts is told from the perspective of a Greek chorus of neighbors who tsk and tut over the proceedings. It's an interesting artistic choice that adds a layer of emotional distance between the reader and the characters. The effect mimics that sense of remove we feel when observing our neighbors' comings and goings from afar and gossiping about it later at the market.
Ultimately what's at stake between Brad and Valerie is more than just an oak tree, their children's budding romance or even their racial differences. The real point of contention is their competing philosophies about how to exist in the world. Brad prizes possessions, status symbols, recreation and cronyism. Valerie values nature, hard work, social justice and saving the planet. It's easy to understand how their passions become inflamed when forced to reckon with one another in such close proximity. Homeownership is a kind of sanctioned self-entitlement. The idea that one's home is one's castle runs deep in our culture. It's no wonder things can quickly turn ugly when the battleground is one's home turf. To a lesser degree, perhaps, it is a drama that plays out in intown neighborhoods across the country.
"A Good Neighborhood" has the unenviable challenge of being published in the aftermath of the "American Dirt" controversy. Like "American Dirt" author Jeanine Cummins, Fowler is a white woman telling a story about a woman of color. But if anything, "A Good Neighborhood" offers a lesson in how an author can successfully write from the perspective of a different race or culture. Valerie and Xavier are not portrayed as racial stereotypes. They are complex, fleshed-out characters with traits both good and bad. Interestingly, it's Fowler's white characters that seem more one-dimensional and predictable. "A Good Neighborhood" would have benefited from Fowler developing the Whitmans with as much nuance as she created the Alston-Holts.
But that's a minor quibble. "A Good Neighborhood"is a
modern-day fable about a very contemporary problem that has bigger ramifications than a row between neighbors that goes too far. It's a timely story about what happens when we fail to consider how our actions affect others and the tragedy that can befall us if we can't coexist with those whose values are different from our own.

Go for the high-end sushi, stay for the more casual dishes. Together, they add up to four stars.

Texto completo: As the host ushered me to my seat at Miyake last week, a pair of visiting restaurateurs seated at the next table paused their ping-pong rally of compliments. The bushy-bearded one in suspenders nodded at me, then continued: "Seriously though, dude, I think you have a better palate than I do. You figured this out in about a minute," he said, gesturing with his chopsticks at the plate of cold-smoked Arctic char set between them both.
"I know we're here to 'borrow' ideas, but that one was tough," conceded the skinny, pomaded one. "It looks like it's gonna be one thing, then it turns out it to be totally different. It's like 'Whoosh, surprise!' "
Later that evening, I'd learn what he meant, when I was served the same dish as part of that night's omakase, the chef's tasting menu ($78). Ochre pearls that appear to be caviar are actually pickled mustard seeds, their tang redoubled by a curd-like yuzu gel. Together, the two components exclaim their tartness in all caps, a mission statement to offset the cherrywood smoke and savory glaze on the crisp-skinned fish. In one mouthful, both a slap and a caress.
Superimposing contrasting ideas lies at the heart of what makes chef/owner Masa Miyake's eponymous restaurant one of the city's most enduringly successful restaurants, nearly 14 years after it opened in its first home on Spring Street in Portland's West End.
Walk too quickly past Miyake's current digs - a former furniture store in the heart of the Old Port - and you'll miss the whispered clues that this is more than a fancy sushi joint. Start with the pristine, plate-glass window, its interior lined in translucent white roller blinds drawn asymmetrically to different lengths, or the stacks of mammoth rice sacks flopped nonchalantly into the field-of-view of passing pedestrians.
It may be one of the city's most expensive restaurants, but Miyake revels in toying with the pieties of formal dining. If you're after a multi-course sushi or sashimi meal presented with artful, kaiseki-style plating and pacing, you can absolutely find that. But equally, Miyake is a place where more casual dishes thrive, powered not by visual flourishes, but by their connection to the principles of washoku, or, in part, seasonal cooking.
Take the yaki uni, nobody's candidate for most beautiful dish of the year, a cold-smoked cedar box of mineral, vibrant orange sea urchin "tongues" blanketed with an Italian-inspired layer of truffle-infused mascarpone, scallions and golf-tee-shaped enoki mushroom tips ($14). It is not a perfect plate - some strips of the peak-season, Maine-sourced uni are improperly separated, so that pulling one drags out a tangle of three, even four at a time - but what matters here are the gorgeous, heady flavors and ductile textures.
Then, as if to confound expectations, the homely-yet-tasty yaki uni is served as part of the same omakase meal as a nigiri platter laid out with a painterly eye for color, shape and balance. Aligned in Morse code dashes along the plate, three portions of pressed, delicately vinegared rice: the first draped with a pale coral slice of dainty kinmedai snapper, flown in that morning from Toyosu (formerly Tsukiji) Market in Tokyo; the next, a soy-basted slice of otoro (tuna belly); and the last, a glistening, butterflied sweet botan shrimp (each $6-$8, if ordered a la carte).
Every dish seems to offer a tiny mosaic of contradictions. Across several plates, these dissonances keep the meal interesting, even when, occasionally, dishes fall short of their potential.
During my recent omakase dinner, I was wowed by the sight of a pottery cup of savory Maine crab chawanmushi custard finished with a fluttery sheet of gold leaf. Conceptually, it's a nesting doll of clever references: Miyake's visiting deputy chef is named Kanazawa, also the name of a Japanese city known for both gold leaf and crab (which, not accidentally, is "kani" in Japanese). Brilliantly conceived but nearly flavorless, the chawanmushi left me bored after a few mouthfuls. Even after excavating a single, slippery green gingko nut at the custard's center, I set down my spoon as I realized that it, too, was bland.
Other dishes, like the isobe age, a crunchy, tempura-battered roulade of flounder, tasted fantastic, but were difficult to eat. Here, a soggy mess of spinach at each roll's center waterlogged the fish and its crust, leaving flounder shrapnel everywhere.
Five years ago, in a four-and-a-half-star review of Miyake, this paper's former critic noted similar difficulties managing another unwieldy dish, the butabura (seared pork belly) served with a smear of celery root purÃ©e ($17). Not much has changed, except that now, the smoky, sweet pork comes topped with a crisp fried oyster. The dish remains as appealingly fatty and well-grilled as ever and continues to be a frustrating test of manual dexterity.
More troubling are a few wobbles on the chef's choice sashimi platter ($22), normally one of Miyake's strongest dishes. Alongside superb elements like a single slice of barely marinated salmon propped up against a half-moon of lemon, a firm white strip of kampachi with a fine-spun brininess, and a ringed sake cup filled with slightly nutty cubes of ankimo (monkfish liver), I encountered two off-key components. The first, a rose-bordered slice of tai (sea bream) with a questionable funkiness, and the second, a curvy chunk of heat-kissed lobster tail whose flavor was snuffed out by garlic oil.
All the more puzzling, considering that, in the demi-chirashi ($21), a toasted-sesame-sprinkled bowl of sticky sushi rice topped with yet more sashimi, every ingredient - from soy-marinated shiitake mushrooms to mackerel, tamago (a sweet egg omelette) and tobiko (pinpricks of orange caviar) - is extraordinary in every regard.
As a light, a la carte meal, the demi-chirashi makes an excellent option. Combine it with a tiny pitcher of warm, yeasty Ozeki Junmai sake ($13), and you've got a template for enjoying dinner at Miyake at a (relative) bargain price.
Indeed, perhaps we've been thinking about Miyake the wrong way all along. Just ask general manager Courtney Packer: "Sometimes people think maybe it's only a spot for a special occasion, or that there has to be a real reason to come here...that it's fancier than it is," she says. "I don't think it needs to be seen that way. Yes, there are people who want to splurge and go all out, but we also have a lot of regulars who get just one dish and have a favorite sake on the menu. In that way, it can be an accessible restaurant."
I've spent the past week mentally assembling my own version of a Miyake regular's meal. One morning, I'll settle on an order of the fiery binchotan (tabletop charcoal grill) seared kamo aburi (duck breasts), with their crisp-and-citrusy, yuzu-kosho-slathered exterior ($17). (How Miyake-san's team manages to achieve such a precise, pink bulls-eye at the meat's center every time is one of life's great mysteries.)
Another day, I'll switch to his spicy mustard-dressed slivers of raw salmon strewn with capers, amaranth microgreens and chiffonade of oba (shiso) ($14). Really, each component is there to support the dish's actual star: a single preserved yamamomo - a sangria-colored Japanese berry, knobbly and burstingly sweet like an astringent black currant. What looks like a fish dish turns out to be all about fruit.
Whoosh, surprise!

Texto completo: Pittsburgh is where Mike Cefalo grew up, and the Benedum Center is where he went to see the best of Broadway as it came through Pittsburgh. Now he's returning for his hometown professional debut, and it's in one of the best.
He arrives this week with the national tour of "The Band's Visit" - the most acclaimed Broadway play of the decade after "Hamilton" - as Telephone Guy. It's a role that earned a supporting actor Tony Award for Adam Kantor, one of 10 won by the subtle sultry show, with a spirit that reflects the 2007 that inspired it.
"It's like the indie-film Broadway musical," is how he describes the 90-minute show that New York critics raved about as "ravishing" and "romantic."
Gushed Ben Brantley of The New York Times: "With songs by David Yazbek and a script by Itamar Moses, 'The Band's Visit' is a Broadway rarity seldom found these days outside of the canon of Stephen Sondheim: an honest-to-God musical for grown-ups. [The show] flows with the grave and joyful insistence of life itself."
The tour stars Chilina Kennedy ("Beautiful: The Carole King Musical" on Broadway) and Sasson Gabay, the original band leader from the indie film that inspired the musical.
Mr. Cefalo is the Pittsburgh kid in the cast. He boasts many regional gigs since graduating Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio, in 2017. He doesn't have any local credits - unless you count North Allegheny High School and Vincentian Academy musicals - but he includes his hometown in his program bio. It begins, "Originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ..."
He lives in New York these days, but his cellphone has a 412 area code. You can take the kid out of Pittsburgh ...
"To come full circle and make my professional debut at the Benedum, where I grew up seeing shows, is insane," Mr. Cefalo said by phone during a February tour stop.
If his name sounds familiar, that's probably because you've heard of Cefalo's Banquet and Event Center in Carnegie.
"That's my uncle," says Mr. Cefalo, an only child who comes from a "giant" family.
"I hope that Pittsburgh audiences get a chance to see [the show], if my family doesn't buy out the entire Benedum Center, which is very likely."
Many of them came to see him when the tour opened at the Kennedy Center, but "it will be a different ballgame" coming home for the tour, which opens Tuesday. While he's here, he will be staying "in my home, sleeping in my bed."
After attending St. Teresa of Avila in Ross from kindergarten through eighth grade, and then Vincentian Academy in McCandless his freshman year of high school, Mr. Cefalo switched to North Allegheny, attracted by the district's music program.
"I immediately joined choir and did the school musical every year," he said. "The production quality there is insane, so it felt like a professional theater, truly, and it made me realize I wanted to do this, and could do this, as a career."
He earned a degree in musical theater at Baldwin Wallace and moved to New York as soon as he graduated, working at regional theaters before landing "The Band's Visit" tour.
He did try out for Pittsburgh CLO a few times, "but it wasn't the right kind of fit," he said. "I made it through their final callbacks every single year, but I'm not much of an ensemblist, and that is truly what they are looking for in college kids."
He saw "The Band's Visit" when he was a senior in college and was so enamored with it that he kept returning. "It blew me away every single time I saw it, and when I got the audition, I was, like [he claps], 'Let's make this happen.'"
Mr. Cefalo had callbacks for both the tour and replacements for the Broadway production, but the latter closed in April 2019 before that could happen.
The musical takes place in 1996, when the Alexandria Ceremonial Police Orchestra of Egypt is headed by bus for a performance at a cultural center in Petah Tikvah, Israel. Through a misunderstanding, they are instead sold tickets to Bet Hatikva, a sleepy desert town where the bus comes once a day. Once they realize the mistake, they are already stranded overnight. The denizens of Bet Hatikva take them in, led by the charismatic Dina (Ms. Kennedy), owner of the town's cafe.
The lovelorn character of Telephone Guy is a romantic who waits day and night at a pay phone, willing his girlfriend to call him.
The character is not just an odd guy in a sleepy town. He represents a hopefulness that others have lost in the desert heat.
"Everyone does check in on him," Mr. Cefalo noted, "and every time Dina checks in and asks, 'Has she called yet?' she makes an impulsive decision to drive her life in a different direction. We talked about that in rehearsals, so it was interesting, that balance of me saying the exact same thing, and as soon as she sees me, she decides to make a change and try something new.
"When the show finishes and you think back on it, it makes a lot of sense why he's there. All these characters are longing for something and have kind of given up hope. But he's the one guy in town who is still actively hoping for something and is the only one being optimistic, albeit in a very strange, David Lynch kind of way. It's bizarre, but it works."
Mr. Cefalo got the role by winning over the creative team with, among other things, his talent for dialects.
"I think that was much to my advantage during the audition process," he said. "This show has its own very distinct vibe when it comes to the storytelling, and I picked up the Hebrew pronunciations really easily when I was auditioning, so I think they knew they wanted me."
He figures he sang "Answer Me" - Telephone Guy's big number - a trillion times for the creative team.
Now he's singing for his family and a distinctly Pittsburgh audience, and he can hardly contain his enthusiasm for the little musical that could.
When "The Band's Visit" won all those Tony Awards, it was competing against more traditional musicals with the kind of pop sound and bells and whistles seen in "SpongeBob the Musical" and "Mean Girls."
Mr. Yazbek's award-winning score reflects a gentler, mesmerizing deep dive into Middle Eastern tunes.
"If you're on the fence for any reason, take the leap, come see the show," Mr. Cefalo said. "It's 90 minutes, no intermission, you're in and out quickly - and it will hit you like a train."

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders is no Che Guevara, but he's the best, post-Teddy Kennedy, that America's far-left has produced. He is neither eloquent nor Instagram-smooth, but his grumpy-geezer vibe has given socialism a jolt of energy.
What perplexes those of us who were alive and paying attention during the previous century (OK, boomer) is that socialism would be rearing its head at all, much less presenting an old-school liberal like Joe Biden a serious challenge.
"Democratic" socialism is the modern qualifier of choice, but as National Review columnist David Harsanyi recently observed, "No one says, 'Hey, let's give democratic fascism a shot!'
"At their core, both ideologies are authoritarian," wrote Mr. Harsanyi, ". [but] academics and our cultural stewards have whitewashed one of them."
Indeed, Hitler's Nazi regime seized power as the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and despite some early window-dressing of "privatization," the state ran all war-related industries and closely controlled the rest. The socialists of the left went all-in with collectivism. In the end, the contemporaneous totalitarianism of the Nazis, the Bolsheviks, the Maoists and the rest of that evil list resulted, cumulatively, in the deaths of hundreds of millions of humans.
Why would anyone want to whitewash any of this? If right-wing excesses are a slippery slope to fascism and left-wing excesses are a slippery slope to communism, shouldn't we seek to avoid either extreme?
Yes, of course, but it is hard for us mortals to see the follies that unfold closest to where our heads and hearts dwell. As Mr. Harsanyi and many other conservatives correctly note, the nation's intellectual and cultural centers are strongly left-leaning. Universities in particular are hives of "progressive" thought, actively hostile to philosophical diversity.
Although surely most academics would eschew violent revolution and re-education camps, they excuse anti-liberty excesses among like-minded peers because if they mean well, so too must their overly ardent brethren, right?
And why exactly does socialism appeal so strongly to academics, artists and other intellectuals? Perhaps because it "means well." Under socialism, all people will have enough and be equal! Who could argue with that?
Socialism strokes both moral and intellectual self-image. It demonstrates its believers' moral virtue (without the déclassé aspects of religion), and it affirms their intellectual superiority, too. The theorists and experts of academe know how the rest of us should live; they'll be creating and running the system after the revolution. They are confident they'll be spared; their university posts and cable-news talking-head spots will endure.
While fascism springs from a more populist well (the masses hungering for a powerful leader to recover a more glorious past), socialism begins with select enlightened individuals who know how to make a brave new world - by force, if necessary.
Historically, fascism has looked back in anger. Socialist collectivism has been a cold-blooded push for an idealistic future. Both have produced mass death.
But the left's whitewashing of extreme leftist ideology has largely succeeded, at least in the minds of our young. Why?
Perhaps because Western Democracy's battle against communism was a cold war, not a hot one, that ended with a whimper. The depravity of the Soviet Union and China are so vast they defy accurate body counts, but there were no Nuremberg trials for them.
Though thousands, perhaps millions, are still dying in China and North Korea, we can't imagine that happening here. No, American socialism would bring destruction by bureaucracy - death by a thousand paper cuts.
That's the best-case scenario. Worst case? Wall Street freaks out, economic collapse unleashes social chaos and chaos triggers martial law. But an authoritarian of any stripe could precipitate this, as could coronavirus hysteria.
It's easy for people on the left to condemn fellow citizens who feel so betrayed by representative democracy and its elites that they'd support a right-wing candidate with authoritarian tendencies.
The left is failing to perceive, however, that in choosing socialism, they're doing the very same thing.

PITTSBURGH STARTUP MINDING THE GAP WORKS TO IMPROVE DANCERS' MENTAL HEALTH

Texto completo: Kathleen McGuire Gaines' career in ballet appeared to be heading in the right direction. She studied in the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre School's pre-professional program and did well in San Francisco Ballet's competitive training environment.
And then she quit.
"Long story short, I stopped dancing because of untreated depression," she says. "This is not something I realized at the time, or frankly for many years, because depression and mental health in general wasn't something that was discussed a lot in the studio. I just figured I wasn't tough enough."
In 2017 - more than a decade after she put away her pointe shoes - she penned a piece for Dance Magazine titled "Why are we still so bad at addressing dancers' mental health?" In it, she shared her story, and it went viral online overnight, she recalls.
"In a way, I found it comforting because I wasn't alone, but it was equally upsetting because I don't really want that much company in that experience," she says. "After that, dancers and mental health professionals from all over the world started reaching out to me, sharing their stories."
Ms. Gaines has since turned those stories and her own experiences into Minding the Gap, a Pittsburgh-based social good startup that's on a mission "to see mental health treated with the same seriousness as physical health in dance culture," according to her website. On Sunday, it will hold its first dancer wellness fair in Point Park University's George Rowland White Performance Center, Downtown. The daylong event will feature a mindful meditation session with celebrated former American Ballet Theatre principal Susan Jaffe, yoga, an introduction to Gyrokinesis, mental health resources and free physical therapy screenings with UPMC Sports Medicine, among other activities.
In late 2018, Ms. Gaines left her job as the director of development for the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy to grow Minding the Gap full time. The nonprofit operates out of the Ascender coworking space in East Liberty, where it's part of its incubator program. She manages the daily tasks and long-term goals, with advisory support from Brian T. Goonan, a clinical psychologist in private practice in Houston, and Leigh A. Skvarla, a Pittsburgh-based national certified counselor and performance consultant. For research input, Ms. Gaines consults with Liliana Araújo, a psychologist, lecturer and researcher in performance psychology at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music&Dance in London.
So why can dance be so detrimental to a person's mental health?
"There are some inherit risks to being involved in this art form that are going to challenge certain aspects of your personality and coping skills," says Ms. Skvarla, who earned a doctorate degree in sport and exercise psychology from West Virginia University. She also received a master's degree in counseling from WVU and studied dance as a minor while an undergraduate student at Bucknell University.
For example, dancers often have to spend several hours a day, multiple days a week, perfecting their craft - all the while wearing tights and leotards and assessing their body placement in a mirror. Plus, it's an art that's about telling stories and conveying emotion, usually without being permitted to say anything out loud.
"I tip my hat to them because a lot of them are doing it at very young ages, real formidable years and you're still trying to figure out who you are," she adds.
Then there's the fact that many professional dancers retire from the stage by the time they're in their 30s and have to pursue another path.
"Dance is something you do. It's not who you are, and yet you may feel that dance is your calling," Ms. Skvarla says. "How do you navigate those two things to stay healthy?"
For Ms. Jaffe - hailed by The New York Times as "America's quintessential American ballerina" - a regular meditation practice helped her stay grounded during her professional career, which included 22 years as a principal with American Ballet Theatre. She's now the dean of dance at University of North Carolina's School of the Arts.
"It changed me so much from the inside out," said Ms. Jaffe, who still routinely wakes up at 4:45 a.m. to meditate for about 45 minutes. "Meditation really broke through some things that I didn't even want to let go of, things I didn't even know were an issue."
She's since developed a six-hour online program called "The Effect of Intention" that she's implemented in five dance schools and universities so far. It introduces students to some of the science and research behind meditation, as well as helps them get acquainted with their own meditation practice. At the dancer wellness fair in Pittsburgh, she will be leading a master ballet class and sharing a portion of her meditation series in a separate session.
Moving forward, Ms. Gaines would like to provide more resources like this event and will continue to raise awareness about the need for better mental health support in dance. Another goal for Minding the Gap is to help fund more research. While some studies involving mental health in dance do exist, Ms. Skvarla says, they often involve small, specific sample sizes.
"That means the findings are relevant only when they can be applied to a similar population," she explains. "The good news about it is there's a lot of opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike."
Filling in these voids in research and resources is not only important to help keep dancers healthy but also to keep their audiences robust for years to come.
"I did not go to a dance performance for almost four years after I stopped. It was far too painful for me," Ms. Gaines says. "There's data that shows that at least 50% of the dance audience is current and former dancers. We need people to leave their training as dancers feeling emotionally cared for enough to want to continue to care for the art form."

CDC: OLDER PEOPLE SHOULD STAY HOME WHEN POSSIBLE TRUMP ADVISES PUBLIC TO 'BE CALM'

Texto completo: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is encouraging older people and people with severe chronic medical conditions to "stay at home as much as possible."
This advice is on a CDC website that was posted Thursday, according to a CDC spokeswoman.
Early data suggests older people are twice as likely to have serious illness from the novel coronavirus, according to the CDC.
A Trump administration official told CNN that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "is in the process of doing targeted outreach to the elderly community and those that have serious underlying health conditions."
President Donald Trump used his visit to the CDC in Atlanta to once more quell the growing alarm that has prompted travel to be curtailed and events to be canceled from coast to coast.
Before departing Washington, D.C., Mr. Trump signed an $8.3 billion COVID-19 response funding bill at the White House and instructed the public: "Be calm. It will go away."
"We have very low numbers compared to major countries throughout the world. Our numbers are lower than just about anybody," Mr. Trump said about cases of the virus.
But his messaging was more scattered at CDC headquarters, reflective of the on-again, off-again, back-on-again nature of the trip itself. The White House had announced early Friday that Mr. Trump's trip to the CDC was canceled because of concern about a possible infection there, but that person tested negative and Mr. Trump ended up going after all.
The CDC guidance comes as two top infectious disease experts with ties to the federal government have advised people over 60 and those with underlying health problems to strongly consider avoiding activities that involve large crowds, such as traveling by airplane, going to movie theaters or concerts, attending family events, shopping at crowded malls and going to religious services.
Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime adviser to the CDC, said people in those two groups "should strongly consider not doing these activities at this juncture."
"This ought to be top of mind for people over 60 and those with underlying health problems, such as heart or lung disease, diabetes, or compromised immune systems," Dr. Schaffner added. "The single most important thing you can do to avoid the virus is reduce your face-to-face contact with people."
Michael Osterholm, the former state epidemiologist for Minnesota, agreed.
"I think clearly the time has come to take these steps," said Mr. Osterholm, who has served on committees advising the federal government on public health issues and is director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
Both experts, who are over age 60, said they have taken some of these steps themselves.
"When my wife and I need to go shopping, we're going late at night when there are no crowds, and we get in and out efficiently," Dr. Schaffner said.
He added that his wife often goes to a bridge club with dozens of other people - but not anymore.
"She enjoys bridge and it's an important part of her life and it keeps her mentally active, but she's going to give it up for a while," he said.
Mr. Osterholm said he has canceled some air travel plans.
"It's always been easy to be abstract when you're a public health person when something's happening in Africa or Asia or the Arabian peninsula," he said. "But now it's happening here, and we have to internalize this."

Texto completo: BRADENTON, Fla. - COVID-19, the newly discovered coronavirus, continues to be a topic around the sports world.
On Friday, a Division III men's basketball game at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore was played in an empty gym. The game is the first known American sporting event played without fans because of COVID-19, of which more than 400 cases have been confirmed in the United States, according to The New York Times.
Later that day, news started to come out about the NBA telling teams to prepare for the possibility of playing without fans or media in attendance.
LeBron James spoke out and said he didn't want to play without the fans. Pirates pitcher Jameson Taillon understood the sentiment but also believes that caution is essential.
"It sounds cliché, but you have to follow whatever medical advice you get from the trainers and doctors," Taillon said before the Pirates' spring training game Saturday against the New York Yankees. "I agree with LeBron - as players we play for the fans. Without the fans, we're nothing. At the same time, if it's a couple of weeks playing without fans to make sure everyone stays safe, then I'm all about that."
Bryan Reynolds has a bit of experience playing in an empty big-league park going back to his days at Vanderbilt. Of course, those circumstances were different.
"We played at Dodger Stadium against TCU. It was quite weird. Eerie. Quiet," Reynolds said. "It was strange how you were able to hear all the sounds. It was so quiet. We were used to playing at these loud SEC ballparks. It was harder than usual to get up for the game with no fans there."
Baseball players probably have more experience than other athletes playing games in (nearly) empty ballparks. Before they become major leaguers, they often play before sparse crowds in the minor leagues.
"I enjoy the fans; they make the game fun. They bring a lot of the vibe and excitement," shortstop Kevin Newman said. "It'd be so strange to play a game without them there. I hope it doesn't come down to that."
MLB already has sent out protocols for players to follow amid COVID-19 concerns. The Pirates took the extra step of deep-cleaning their Bradenton facility after cases in Manatee County and nearby Hillsborough County. Part of the protocols includes limiting high-fives with patrons and not signing autographs with pens from fans.
"It's tough," Newman said. "I appreciate any fan that wants my autograph. But right now we can't risk it until we figure out what's going on. It's hard because I see the excitement from fans when their favorite player gives them a few moments of their time."
Newman also is taking another extra step in games.
"I don't lick my fingers anymore," Newman said. "I try to be highly aware of it while I'm playing because I used to do it all the time. I make sure not to touch my face and regularly am washing my hands."
Taillon knows it would be unconventional to play with a genuinely empty ballpark. And before you make your PNC Park attendance joke, even a crowd of 10,000 is a far cry from no fans.
"It would be interesting to hear every little thing that happens," Taillon said. "It'd be different, but once a big-time hitter like Anthony Rizzo or Mike Trout steps in the box, they're trying to beat me. The competitive juices take over from there."
Around the horn
Erik Gonzalez played in his second game at third base Saturday as he returns from a foot fracture. Colin Moran likely is going to be the starting third baseman when the season opens in less than three weeks in Tampa, Fla. But Moran played first base Friday against Toronto and hit a home run. Philip Evans played second and third base.
Pirates manager Derek Shelton expects Moran to play some first even though he's the starting third baseman. The goal is for Moran and other players to give the roster as much flexibility as possible.
"We are trying to get different views, different looks on the field. There will probably be a time where Colin starts at first and goes to third or starts at third then goes to first," Shelton said. "We are trying different ways to think about it to get guys different looks. The big thing, personally, is I don't want them to be surprised if they have to switch positions in a game.
"If that is the case, that's something that's on me, and I don't want someone to be unprepared."
Jose Osuna mostly plays the corner infield positions as a utilityman, but he played Friday in right field. Cole Tucker has spent time at second base, as well.
About that grievance ...
There has been a few questions on the topic of the players union and its grievance accusing the Pirates of not using revenue-sharing money to improve the on-field product as required under the collective bargaining agreement.
First, there isn't a second grievance against the Pirates as some outlets have reported. Union chief Tony Clark and the MLBPA filed an amended claim against the Pirates, along with Tampa Bay and Miami. The original complaint, which centered on the 2017-18 offseason and was filed in 2018, is still awaiting a hearing date.
There is no public record of how much money teams receive in revenue sharing, but according to Cots Contracts, the Pirates are going to have the lowest projected payroll in baseball at about $57 million when the season starts. The Pirates' argument is that payroll isn't the only way to make the team better. They'll point to their facility in the Dominican Republic, for instance. The team would argue money is being spent on technology, the draft and international signings.
Where will this go?
That's the hardest question to answer. At some point, there will have to be either a hearing or an agreement to drop the complaint. If that hearing happens, the Pirates will have to give an account of how they spent their revenue-sharing money as required. If they can, then this dies. If they cannot, things will get interesting, especially heading into negotiations for a new CBA in 2021.

Texto completo: As the Democratic presidential field narrows to two front-runners with different ideological bents, their campaigns and the national groups gearing up to support their general election bids are eyeing several different geographic paths to win back the White House, starting pragmatically in the Rust Belt - where experts say it's easiest - to more aspirational routes in the Sun Belt.
The path to beating President Donald Trump and securing the necessary 270 electoral votes will require the eventual Democratic nominee - either former Vice President Joe Biden or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - to hold onto all the states that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 while flipping a combination of states that Mr. Trump carried.
The most conventional path, according to experts and pollsters, runs through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where Mr. Trump won by a total margin of about 77,000 votes en route to winning the electoral college, but not the nationwide popular vote. Democratic groups have been pouring resources into these three states since last year, aiming to convince working class voters and suburban women that Mr. Trump has not carried out his promises.
But with handicappers noting that Wisconsin has run more red since 2016, Democrats are also eyeing the swing state of Florida and traditionally-red states like Arizona, Texas and Georgia, where a win in even one would make the Midwest less of a mathematical necessity for the party's nominee.
Kyle Kondik, who manages the University of Virginia Center for Politics' D.C. office and edits its nonpartisan elections newsletter Sabato's Crystal Ball, said no matter who the Democrats choose to be their nominee, the general election starts at a 50-50 toss-up against the incumbent Republican president.
In an analysis for the center released late last month, Mr. Kondik wrote that the Democrats nominating Mr. Sanders would start the party off with "somewhat of a penalty" in the electoral college, perhaps complicating his chances in the Sun Belt's highly-educated suburbs.
"Certainly some Democrats would say that Sanders would start at a disadvantage. I think a lot of Republicans would say that, too, and I think Sanders would have more to prove in the Sun Belt than Biden, at least to start," Mr. Kondik told the Post-Gazette, "but I think it'd be dangerous to write off Sanders as a possible general election winner, too."
Both of the Democratic front-runners have insisted that they, unlike their opponent, would be best to win back the "blue wall" of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by appealing to working class voters.
A recent memo from the Sanders campaign noted that he performs well against Mr. Trump in head-to-head general election polling in the three "industrial battleground states," noting his strength with suburban voters, young people and the working class. It even pointed to a statement from Mr. Trump's campaign manager, in which he said Mr. Sanders is "tough in places where people are making $12 an hour."
Mr. Biden, too, has touted his appeal to working class voters that sided with Barack Obama twice then flipped to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Kondik said the former vice president could be more "palatable" in the suburban areas of Pennsylvania where Democrats will have to do better than they did four years ago.
Tough to flip
No matter the candidate, Wisconsin could be the hardest of the three for Democrats to flip, Mr. Kondik said, because it's less diverse - and because Republican support in the suburbs of greater Milwaukee, for example, hasn't eroded enough.
Charles Franklin, who has directed the Marquette Law School Poll in Wisconsin since its inception in 2012, said six polls since August have shown a tight race, with both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders running slightly ahead of Mr. Trump in most cases - but almost all within the margin of error. The school's most recent poll in February showed Mr. Sanders over Mr. Trump by 1 percentage point and Mr. Biden tied with the president, though it was administered before three prominent moderates in the field lined up behind Mr. Biden.
Noting that Mr. Trump's approval numbers have improved over the past year in Wisconsin with more favorable perceptions of the economy, Mr. Franklin said he expects a high turnout and a general election that could tip either way between now and November.
"An economic downturn would be a challenge for the incumbent," Mr. Franklin said. "But perceptions of whether the Trump administration handles the coronavirus outbreak well or poorly is also likely to play a role as every president is judged by how they handle crises."
While Mr. Kondik and several other experts consider Michigan an easier target for Democrats, his colleague, Seth Moskowitz, has pointed out that if the Democratic nominee wins there and in Florida, they would win the presidency even if Mr. Trump held onto Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina.
Mr. Trump won Florida by about 1.2 percentage points in 2016 and launched his 2020 re-election campaign there.
Russell Tuff, chair of the Republican Party in Trump-friendly Collier County, Fla., said he'd have a difficult time imagining Florida not voting for Mr. Trump again, with income levels rising statewide and "anyone who wants to work [having] a job."
"Unless some major catastrophe happens, why would anyone vote for a leadership change?" Mr. Tuff asked.
But according to the Tampa Bay Times, Democrats in Florida are heavily pursuing the state's fastest growing demographic: Hispanics. The party has hired dozens of staffers there, many of whom are bilingual, to engage with Latino voters, The Times reported. Mr. Trump got about 35% of the Latino vote in 2016.
Mr. Moskowitz also has written that Democrats wouldn't have to win any of the Midwestern states if they flipped Florida and Arizona, which Mr. Kondik deemed "the best target for Dem-ocrats among the usually Republican Sun Belt states that have been be-coming more competitive."
There hasn't been a major poll of Arizona since early January, before the race consolidated. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders were in statistical ties with the president in head-to-head matchups, but Mr. Biden fared better in polls in 2019.
This week, Mr. Biden picked up the endorsement of U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who said Mr. Biden represents "Arizona values."
"I am voting for former Vice President Joe Biden - a pragmatic, practical leader best positioned to get things done for everyday families," Ms. Sinema said in a statement passed along by the campaign.
Though Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told an Arizona Republic podcast recently that voters there rejected "Trumpism" in statewide elections in 2018, Mr. Trump rallied in the state in February, talking up the creation of more than 230,000 jobs in the state since he took office.
Of the two Democratic contenders, Mr. Kondik said polling suggests Mr. Biden might do better among white suburbanites in highly educated areas in Arizona, though he acknowledged "you could flip it around" and say that Mr. Sanders could inspire greater minority turnout.
The Sanders campaign has insisted he is strong with Latinos, which will help him in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Texas.
Mr. Sanders is neck-and-neck with Mr. Biden in the delegate count after the former Vice President won 10 of 14 states on Super Tuesday. Though Mr. Biden holds a slight advantage, both have more than 570 delegates, more than a quarter of the way toward the 1,991 needed to win the nomination on the first ballot.

HONEY, WE BLEW UP THE PRESIDENCY DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT SHRINK FROM EXPRESSING HIS IMPULSES

Texto completo: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.
The vital primary in this battleground state that has provided a vital margin in two of the five elections this century is a little more than a week away, and already voters here are confronting a new political reality.
It was only three months ago that House Democrats, knowing that the Republican-controlled Senate would resist their impassioned arguments and their passel of arguments, impeached Donald Trump. With an eye on history and the stain their action would put on the president, they hoped to cut Mr. Trump down to size.
Instead the 45th president is living large.
Large enough to visit Democratic primary states like this one to taunt putative rivals. Large enough to defy Congress and complete a wall across the Mexican border. Large enough to intervene in Justice Department proceedings. Large enough even to alienate his greatest Cabinet ally, Attorney General William Barr.
Perhaps even large enough to weather the storm created by Typhoon Coronavirus (and its attendant economic ravages) to defeat whomever the Democrats run against him in the November election.
Less than three decades ago, Time magazine put on its front a minuscule picture of Bill Clinton with the piercing cover title "The Incredibly Shrinking President." That 1993 edition of the magazine came to symbolize the diminution of the presidency in American civic life.
Now Americans are contemplating an incredibly expanding presidency.
"Trump's repeated efforts to push through his agenda continues the march of expanding presidential power we have seen in recent presidencies," said Shirley Anne Warshaw, a presidential scholar at Gettysburg College. "But what separates Trump from his recent predecessors is the complete disregard for the rule of law."
The prospect of impeachment terrified Lyndon Johnson, who as a result dared not stray from his path in Vietnam. The impending impeachment of Richard Nixon sent the embattled president on an alcoholic bender and a diversionary-move trip to the Middle East. The real impeachment of Bill Clinton, only two decades ago, led the humbled chief executive to assert his sorrow, express his apology and redouble his determination to pass his agenda.
Mr. Trump, in the identical situation, said he was experiencing a "day of celebration."
But the Trump mix of what he regarded as his exoneration and what he declared was "celebration" brought on a new burst of aggressiveness - and new challenges to the centuries-old balance of power between the legislative and executive branches.
The president's assertiveness on his border wall is a prime example. By diverting millions of dollars Congress appropriated for the military to the wall, Mr. Trump is contributing to what must now be regarded as the incredible shrinking legislative branch.
Other presidents have struck at the power of the purse that the Founding Fathers placed squarely in the hands of the Congress; Mr. Nixon, for example, was a pioneer in withholding spending that Congress expressly approved.
But the Nixon action - which bore the term "impoundment" - was different in tone and spirit. He failed to carry out the wishes of Congress, to be sure, but in bridling what he called the "credit-card Congress," Mr. Nixon could cite the discretion of the executive in dispersing funds appropriated by Congress.
Mr. Trump's initiative has taken the Nixon act to a new level. He can cite national security; that is a handy presidential rationale, used by Dwight Eisenhower, for example, as his explanation for building the interstate highway system that of course has been used primarily by civilians, business and vacationers.
But both houses of Congress have immigration and border security panels, and by any reasonable reading the wall comes under their remits.
That is why Republicans joined Democrats in decrying Mr. Trump's action. Though GOP lawmakers defended the president in the impeachment trial that followed the House action, lawmakers of both parties jealously guard the functional prerogatives of the Congress, with spending at the top of those centuries-old rights.
The founders may have created the balance of powers but a series of presidents and lawmakers have created a swing in that balance.
After the Civil War, the balance alternated between a president, Andrew Johnson, who had his own (lenient) ideas about how to treat the devastated South, and the Radical Republicans who wanted to punish the defeated Confederacy and extend new rights to the former enslaved. That resulted in the impeachment of the 17th president, who was saved from removal from office by a single vote in the Senate.
In the aftermath of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, a former Senate majority leader, held sway over Congress and pressed through massive Great Society domestic spending initiatives. But once opposition to the Vietnam War gathered force, Congress reasserted itself.
The balance wobbled so dramatically during the Nixon administration that followed Johnson's that by the beginning of the president's second term the liberal historian Arthur M. Schlesinger would publish a book called "The Imperial Presidency." Congress responded that same year with the War Powers Act that sharply curtailed the president's flexibility in projecting American force abroad.
Now Mr. Trump is throwing new challenges to the balance of power - and to its stepchild, the separation of powers. By expressing outrage at last month's sentencing of Roger Stone, his occasional adviser, he is threatening to wield the power of the pardon.
That power is specifically granted to him in the Constitution. But a swift expression of it in the wake of Mr. Stone's guilty verdict would create new tensions with the other branch of the government: the judiciary.
That is the branch that could adjudicate such a pardon in relation to the Constitutional provision giving the president "power to grant reprieves and pardons for offense against the United States, except in cases of impeachment." The Stone matter grows directly out of matters considered during the Trump impeachment. The Constitution does not grant the president room to grant such pardons if he is impeached but not convicted.
Even without considering the Stone matter, Mr. Trump has expanded the powers of the executive. A president who does not shrink from expressing his impulses does not make for a shrinking presidency.

Texto completo: Movie review
★★★
THE TIMES OF BILL CUNNINGHAM
Directed by Mark Bozek. At Kendall Square, Coolidge Corner. 74 minutes. Unrated.
In today's age of online exhibitionism, the self-effacing, photographic obsessiveness of Bill Cunningham might seem quaint.
From 1978 until his death, in 2016, at 87, Cunningham would prowl the streets of Manhattan every day on his bicycle and snap pictures of anyone whose attire caught his eye. Every week he would put together a full-page collage of these snapshots in his New York Times column, “On the Street." By night he would attend elite affairs and photograph the rich and famous in their finery for his feature “Evening Hours."
But unlike those armed with selfie sticks today he was appalled by the notion of including himself in his pictures. “It's best to be in the background as much as you can and never disturb the action," he says in an interview in Mark Bozek's film “ The Times of Bill Cunningham ." “I think of myself as a fashion historian. The camera is another instrument to record it." Though working in a different medium, he shares the ideal of many documentary filmmakers — to reflect the world with minimal intrusiveness in order to discern the truth behind its appearances.
Conducted in 1994, the interview makes up the bulk of the film, and Cunningham shares entertaining anecdotes as well as some insights into his method and aesthetics, which Bozek illustrates with a generous sampling of his subject's photos as well as rare pictures of the man behind the camera. Almost painfully self-deprecating, Cunningham has a goofy laugh and the Boston accent of a native of West Roxbury (which lies “in the shadow of Fenway Park," notes the voice-over narrator, Sarah Jessica Parker, perhaps speaking metaphorically and not geographically).
Raised in a strict Catholic family that did not approve of his fascination with the ladies' bonnets he observed at Mass, he escaped to New York as a teenager, there becoming a milliner, designing hats for people like Jacqueline Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Katharine Hepburn. In 1967 a friend gave him an idiot-proof Olympus camera, and Cunningham discovered his true calling, roaming the city and shooting anyone who caught his eye. One day he took a picture of a woman wearing a fur coat he liked and discovered she was the reclusive septuagenarian Greta Garbo. The Times bought the photo, and the rest is fashion history.
Cunningham's joviality breaks only a couple of times during the interview, and these moments of abrupt silence and suppressed tears are startling. One occurs during a discussion about how he manages to overcome his shyness and take pictures of strangers. After recovering his composure, he explains his ambivalence about photographing the homeless — balancing the violation of their privacy with his desire to record a different kind of fashion. “It's like being in the Middle Ages," he says over a montage of these pictures. “Dusk setting on the streets and you see figures with great packs on their backs digging in trash cans."
Another such moment happens later when Bozek, perhaps following up on the previous emotional response, asks “Are there things that are sad in what you see?" Cunningham nearly weeps, a black screen follows, and after this pause the interview resumes. Cunningham brokenly says, “AIDS has been so … tears me apart … these extraordinary talents that we've lost. …"
Bozek does not press Cunningham on these painful moments, though one might wish he did (Richard Press's fine 2010 documentary “Bill Cunningham New York" doesn't get much deeper). He lets his subject's joie de vivre prevail. Like Cunningham in his pages in The New York Times, Bozek presents this snapshot history with few captions and little commentary, allowing the viewer to fill in the gaps.
A Q & A with Bozek, Trish Jarvis Simonson, Cunningham's niece, and Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum curator Pieranna Cavalchini will follow the 2 p.m. screening at the Coolidge Corner on March 8.

Texto completo: New releases
★★½ Greed From director Michael Winterbottom and star Steve Coogan (“The Trip" and sequels), a scattershot satire about the vulgar, privileged one percent, British division, that's almost as funny as it is furious. A large, milling cast blunts the movie's edge and the sense of moral disgust is heavy even if you share it. Well worth a look, though. (104 min., R) (Ty Burr)
★★½ Lucian Freud: A Self-Portrait This documentary about the British painter is two films. The one about him and his uncompromising art is engrossing. The one consisting of slick, touristy establishing shots is reductive prettiness. It's like being served wormwood and gall with a tray of condiments. “Aren't those flesh tones formidable?" “Uh, sure. Wanna pass the mayo?" (86 min., unrated) (Mark Feeney)
★★½ Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band The subject of Daniel Roher's documentary is just what its subtitle says. Robertson, the group's guitarist and chief composer, is well spoken and a winning presence, which balances Roher's weakness for stylistic trickeration. The film is lively and of interest even to non-Band fans. That said, as the group starts to break up, there's a distinct VH1 “Behind the Music" vibe. (102 min., R) (Mark Feeney)
★★ Onward Two teenage elf brothers embark on a quest to be reunited with their dead dad in what feels like the most generic Pixar movie to date — a perfectly OK CGI kids' movie that could have been made by any other animation studio. Tom Holland, Christ Pratt, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Octavia Spencer provide the voices. (102 min., PG) (Ty Burr)
★★★ The Times of Bill Cunningham For nearly four decades the late Bill Cunningham filled his New York Times column with pictures he'd taken of strangers whose clothes he liked. It was a people's history of fashion, and this documentary tries to probe Cunningham's own history. It doesn't dig deep, but it doesn't have to: The man we see is funny, insightful, cagey. (74 min., unrated). (Peter Keough)
★★ The Way Back A high school basketball movie with a side of addiction drama and a star, Ben Affleck, who channels his own demons in empathetic ways. It's earnest, old-fashioned, and sturdily made, and would that were enough to make it good. Director Gavin O'Connor hits every cliche of the genre. (108 min., R) (Ty Burr)
★★½ Wendy After eight years, Benh Zeitlin has delivered his follow-up to the arthouse hit “Beasts of the Southern Wild" — a funkified retelling of “Peter Pan" that starts with the cosmic-ramshackle brilliance of his debut and slowly descends into entropy and tedium. Some brilliant things here, and some half-baked ones too. (112 min., PG-13) (Ty Burr)
Previously released
★★★ 1917 Director Sam Mendes tries mightily to re-create World War I as an immersive Sensurround cataclysm by following one soldier (George MacKay) in real time across a devastated landscape using what appears to be a single camera shot. At times the movie works as a profoundly sorrowful epic; at others, the gimmick is front and center. (119 min., R) (Ty Burr)
★★★½ Beanpole The title character (Viktoria Miroshnichenko) is a naive, shell-shocked survivor in the devastated landscape of post-World War II Leningrad. Bleak as a Russian winter, this is the second film by Kantemir Balagov, a fearsome, uncompromising talent who plunges us into a world without comfort. In Russian, with subtitles. (137 min., unrated)
★★½ Emma. A rambunctious, overly broad adaptation that proves the Jane Austen “brand" has become more or less meaningless. Anya Taylor-Joy is the privileged Miss Fixit of the title, and Johnny Flynn the neighboring hunk waiting on the horizon. More clueless than “Clueless," it starts disastrously but settles down into amiable acceptability. (125 min., PG) (Ty Burr)
★★★ The Invisible Man What if the Invisible Man were your boyfriend — and not the good kind? Elisabeth Moss fights back against her vengeful mad-scientist ex in a remake cannily retooled for an era of gaslighting men and the women who see through them (literally). Plot holes aside, it's a twisty little chiller unashamed of its B-movie bona fides. (124 min., R) (Ty Burr)
★★★★ Knives Out An old school murder mystery breathed into riotous new life by writer-director Rian Johnson, this is pound for pound among the most entertaining movies of 2019. With Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, and Toni Collette. Go. (136 min., R) (Ty Burr)
★★★★ Little Women Writer-director Greta Gerwig has gently rearranged Louisa May Alcott's 1868 classic novel so that the emphasis falls almost as much on the other March sisters as on Jo (a fine Saoirse Ronan). It's a lovely, wise film with resonances to today that don't feel out of place. With Florence Pugh (a revelation as Amy), Emma Watson, and Timothée Chalamet as Laurie. (134 min., PG) (Ty Burr)
★★★★ Portrait of a Lady on Fire Celine Sciamma's 18th-century tale about the relationship between a painter (Noémie Merlant) and her subject (Adèle Haenel) is a stately yet thrilling movie of body, heart, and mind — a film that works as both academic theory and ravishing drama. With Valeria Golino and Luàna Bajrami. In French with English subtitles. (121 min., R) (Ty Burr)

Texto completo: HERVIS ROGERS WAITED. And waited. And waited.
As light melted into darkness, he stood in line at Texas Southern University, a historically black college in Houston, for more than six hours to exercise his constitutional right to vote.
By the time he cast his Super Tuesday ballot, it was Wednesday morning.
“I figured it was my duty to vote. I wanted to get my vote in to voice my opinion. And I wasn't going to let nothing stop me. So I waited it out," Rogers told CNN. Asked why he stayed when others left, he said, “It's, like, the way it was going, [it] was set up for me to walk away."
This is not what democracy looks like.
Rogers is right. Those oppressive wait times and labyrinthine lines along sidewalks, through courtyards, in hallways, and on stairways are not an accident or bureaucratic snafu. They're meant to deter voters. Every person who walked away — because they had to work, tend to family, or were just plain tired — was a victim of voter suppression, courtesy of the Supreme Court.
By a 5-4 vote in 2013, the high court decided that racism was over and neutered the Voting Rights Act. Absent the federal oversight once mandated in states with deep histories of discriminatory voting tactics, Texas has shut down hundreds of voting sites. Most of them are in predominantly Democratic cities, including Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio, and in areas with large Black and Latinx populations.
No area has been more severely crippled than Harris County, where Rogers and many others waited hours to vote. At Texas Southern, there were only six poll workers. Its 10 voting machines were all 20 years old, and half stopped working for parts of the long day. By the time Rogers became the last person to finally cast his ballot at 1 a.m. Wednesday, former Vice President Joe Biden had already been declared the winner of Texas's Democratic primary.
Shuttering polling places or making those sites barely operable is just as effective in lowering voting rates in communities of color as poll taxes or so-called literacy tests were decades ago. (And for some people, being forced to miss a day of work to vote amounts to a poll tax.) Yet there are people like Rogers and all those who stood in line with him, leaning on walls and shifting their weight from one foot to the other, refusing to be denied.
This is why I scoffed when Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for the New York Times, recently revealed that he does not vote. “As reporters," he said, “our job is to observe, not participate." From time to time, this is a tiresome conversation that journalists feel compelled to have, and in my experience, it is usually white men who believe voting somehow violates their journalistic purity.
When they speak of objectivity, I hear privilege. It's easy to self-suppress when those who look like them have never had to fight for this foundational right of democracy. They will never have that right threatened or denied by voter purges or ever-changing voter ID laws. When Republicans gerrymander districts with “surgical precision," they won't feel that weight because this nation, created for them, has never lined up against them. Not voting is a luxury they can afford because even if they shun the ballot, their voices will always be heard, their lives will always matter.
What Texas — and to be clear, it's neither just Texas nor one region of the country — wants is to silence those historically ignored. Yet while Republican officials tried to thwart democracy, Rogers and all who waited to vote strengthened it. They are this country's soul. If America ever lives up to its values, these are our shepherds. And they know this battle, waged for more than 150 years, won't end after the last primary.
Of those long lines to vote, Rogers said, “If it happens again, I would do the same thing all over again."
In this nation's damaged democracy, he, and likely millions more, may have no other choice.

What a Man Wants to Wear

Texto completo: Gabriela Hearst likes to say that she wouldn't be a fashion designer if she didn't understand the subtle ways in which a female body can shape-shift over the course of a day -- how a woman's waist, for example, can fluctuate in size between morning and evening. That may sound like a surprisingly unglamorous concern for a luxury clothing brand, but Hearst's namesake label, which she founded in New York City in 2015, is remarkable not only for its attention to high-level craft and luxurious materials -- including merino wool sheared from sheep reared on the 17,000-acre ranch she inherited in 2011 from her father in her native Uruguay -- but also for her minute focus on how her clothes, whether a figure-skimming, graphic-printed knit dress or an ankle-length trench, make women feel. As Hearst, 43, sees it, "It's an upside to be a woman designing for women."
How, then, does she approach her latest undertaking -- designing clothes for men? In May of last year, Hearst presented a small pre-fall men's collection of chunky speckled wool sweaters and slate gray tailoring, and in July, she followed with a 23-style resort offering of lightweight powder-blue and putty-colored suiting, as well as crew-neck knits in off-kilter pastel shades like faded butter yellow or dusty lilac. Though many of the pieces are crafted by a family-owned tailoring company in Parma, Italy, and though there are sporty elements (an ivory cashmere polo shirt, a suede bomber jacket the color of wet sand), they don't fall neatly into either of the two major categories that define contemporary men's clothing: streetwear and suiting. Rather, Hearst's collections offer considered, well-crafted everyday clothes for modern professional men -- a niche filled by Jil Sander in the late 1990s and rarely since. A collaborator in the venture is the British graphic designer Peter Miles, whom Hearst has been working with since he created the brand's logo six years ago, and whose personal style she has long admired. "There's an ease to the way he dresses -- and an elegance, but it's not pompous or ostentatious," Hearst says. Still, though Miles provides occasional knowledge of the technical details of men's clothing (he has been a client of the same Spitalfields tailor since 1993) and can offer feedback from a wearer's perspective, Hearst relies heavily on her imagination.
Designing garments for someone unlike yourself -- "it's a different psychology," Hearst says -- turns out to be a more complex exercise in empathy. This is of course very nearly the same imaginative leap that myriad male designers who create clothes for women have been making for the past century. Women may be relied upon to do much of the handwork in ateliers, but the majority of people who have really determined the way we dress -- with major exceptions, including Coco Chanel, Miuccia Prada, Donatella Versace and Rei Kawakubo -- have been men: Cristóbal Balenciaga, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Lacroix, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford, Giorgio Armani, Marc Jacobs, Nicolas Ghesquière, Riccardo Tisci and Karl Lagerfeld among them. It's a persistent disparity. In 2017, 85 percent of the students enrolled at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology were female, but in 2015, only 14 percent of major clothing brands had a woman at their head, according to a Business of Fashion survey. Though fashion, like so many industries, is beginning to reckon with the consequences of longstanding and deep-rooted gender imbalance, female designers are still in the minority, and women making clothes for men are a rarity.
Yet Hearst is not the only female designer at the head of an established women's wear label to have delved into the male psyche -- Stella McCartney, Isabel Marant and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of the Row launched men's lines in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Clare Waight Keller, the artistic director at Givenchy -- which has done men's ready-to-wear since 1969 -- introduced men's looks to the brand's couture collections in 2018. These designers join a group of women who began their careers in men's wear, among them Grace Wales Bonner and Emily Bode, and one could argue that, between the lot of them, much of what a certain sort of man most wants to wear now is being designed by women. This shift comes at a time when people are especially aware of how rigid notions of gender can prove harmful, making the question: How, in 2020, can we create clothes for men that feel timeless without reinforcing regressive ideals of masculinity? Hearst often envisions she's designing for someone who is part wind-swept gaucho and part well-heeled urban journalist -- a blend of her rancher father and her husband's father, the New York newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst Jr. -- but also someone whose self-regard is not impervious. In a 2005 article in The New York Times, Tom Ford was quoted as saying, "Of course there are many more gay male designers. I think we are more objective. We don't come with the baggage of hating certain parts of our bodies." Hearst, on the other hand, feels strongly that insecurity is not an affliction unique to women. "I hope they make him feel good and confident," she says of how she wants her garments to comfort their wearer, adding, "because we know what an insecure man is."
While Savile Row tailors traditionally stitch buttons inside the waistband of trousers to allow a wearer to adjust their size, Hearst learned from her husband, the media executive Austin Hearst (who was also the brand's first male fit model), that belt loops enable a more flattering cinch. "He told me the belt acts like a girdle for men," she says. She also landed on a high rise on her flat-front wool formal pants so as to flatter the waist, and she likes to temper the stern lines of a suit with a midnight blue pullover or navy knit polo shirt.
This sort of thinking suggests that the very act of a woman offering up a fantasy of manhood in an arena dominated by male fantasies of women can be a revelatory gesture. If men's ideas about how a woman should dress have at times felt constrictive -- "He doesn't dress women, he upholsters them," Coco Chanel once said of Christian Dior, whose postwar wasp-waisted New Look shapes heralded a return to more traditional female silhouettes after the liberating advent of women's trousers -- the impulses of the women currently at the forefront of men's wear are by contrast generous and freeing. Waight Keller's couture collections use finishes long associated with women's wear (sequins, delicate floral embroidery) that encourage men to experiment with new identities, and at the Row, the Olsen sisters are creating men's suiting so sublimely minimal it is almost self-effacing, as though its wearer has more cerebral concerns than tailoring. Similarly, Hearst says that her ideal customer is, above all, a man with "a modern brain," someone who is engaged with the issues of our time, such as climate change -- the brand exclusively uses biodegradable packaging -- and dissolving gender lines altogether. If men have historically designed for women as they think they ought to be, these women are designing for men as they hope they might be.

Texto completo: "Seattle is freaking out," one man said as he passed a Starbucks in downtown Seattle that was closed after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus.
SEATTLE -- Machele Miely, on her way to meet a friend for coffee in downtown Seattle on Saturday, stopped to snap a photo on her phone of a sign posted on the door of a Starbucks saying that the store was temporarily closed and that it was sorry for the inconvenience.
The sign said nothing about why it was closed, but Ms. Miely knew the reason: coronavirus.
"People are trying not to panic, while preparing to panic," said Ms. Miely, 41, who works as a project manager for a construction company and had a small bottle of hand sanitizer clipped to her belt -- a must-have accessory in recent days.
The coronavirus has hit the Seattle area harder than anywhere else in the United States, with 16 deaths in Washington State, most from an outbreak at a nursing home northeast of the city. The virus and its public health implications and consequences have rippled out, affecting how and where people work and where and when they gather in groups. And on Friday, a Starbucks employee at a downtown location was confirmed to have the virus, closing that store and forcing residents to confront the reality that even a small daily ritual like a morning cup of coffee would be affected by the virus.
Starbucks started here in Seattle, and with its expansion and close association with the city starting in the early 1970s, the company has imprinted Seattle as America's coffee city, an often gloomy town where a strong grande on a late winter morning can cut the chill.
"Seattle is freaking out," said Lenny Galaviz, who stopped to take a photograph through a window of the closed store, a Starbucks Reserve, where alcohol is also served and special glass beakers are lined up for cold brews and other specialty drinks.
Mr. Galaviz, 58, works in the warehouse at CenturyLink Field, a Seattle sports stadium, selling beer and soft drinks to the crowd. He moved to Seattle only about a year ago from Maine, and now many of his friends back home have been calling in concern. "They're all saying, 'Be careful, be careful,"' he said, peering in through the glass.
Starbucks, in a posting on the its website, has said the company is following health authority guidelines in trying to protect customers and employees, and has taken additional steps to reduce the risk of exposure at its stores -- barring customers from using their own coffee containers, for example.
"Our focus remains on two key priorities: caring for the health and well-being of our partners and customers, and playing a constructive role in supporting local health," Rossann Williams, president of company-operated business in the United States and Canada, said in the statement.
One would-be customer at the closed store, Terry Murphy, said he thought the response to the outbreak has gone beyond the reality of the risk.
"I honestly think this is being exaggerated," said Mr. Murphy, 65, who was dropping off his daughter for her job at the Seattle Art Museum, just opposite the Starbucks, before starting his own job as a driver for Lyft, the ride share company. "I went to another Starbucks yesterday and I have a cup that I bring in, and they made the thing, and then made me take their cup and pour it into mine," he said. "I said, 'What?' But apparently that's the policy now."
Cindy Fisher, 57, a nurse who works in electronic medical records at the University of Washington, said her office was now empty, like much of the rest of the university, with people there working or taking classes remotely.
Ms. Fisher, who stopped by what Starbucks calls its original location, at Pike Place Market, said she was not terribly worried about the virus -- frequent hand-washing and keeping your hands from your face goes a long way, she said -- but she feared the economic effect of people staying home and avoiding crowds.
"I'm in Pike Market today to support the local vendors," she said.
RoShaine Perry, a car salesman from Sacramento, Calif., who was visiting Seattle with his wife, Yna -- and posing for photos in front of the glass windows of the 1970s vintage Pike Market Starbucks -- said his religious faith was a strength at times like this.
"There's risk in everything you do in life," said Mr. Perry, who is 34. "But there's a bigger eternity, we feel like, out there," he added. "So we just believe, have faith and keep moving."
Ms. Miely, the construction project manager, said she found it reassuring, if not quite comforting, that the Starbucks with the sick employee had closed down temporarily.
"I'd rather see Seattle act out of an abundance of caution and close things early and often to keep people safe," she said.
In any event, the closing was no big loss to her, coffee-wise; she was heading to meet a friend at a competing coffee place two doors away, and said she would have passed the Starbucks even if it had been open. "Their coffee always tastes burned," she said.

Texto completo: Christy Harmon, a photo editor on the Culture desk, spends most her spare time reading. She shares a few things she likes beyond the comfort of her Kindle.
WORLDS BEYOND EARTH
The new planetarium show at the American Museum of Natural History is a stunning refresher on the solar system in the most epic of settings. The short film highlights what can go wrong with the Earth by looking at the fate and history of our neighboring planets. I walked away thinking every lawmaker should have to see it.
BILLIE EILISH
Billie's sweet whisper of a voice has been a favorite for a while. I listen to her on my walk to work. She's on my running playlist. I have a Billie song for every life situation. If you're lucky you can catch her on her world tour; she's playing Madison Square Garden on March 15.
ALL THAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND
The fact that Erin Lee Carr's memoir involves her father, David Carr, who was a beloved media columnist at The New York Times, is just a bonus. Her book examines family relationships, addiction and grief from the perspective of a young woman finding her way through all of it.
AMERICAN FACTORY
Watching Netflix's Oscar-winning documentary, I was struck by the difference in working styles, safety regulations and culture between Chinese factory workers brought to Ohio and the Americans they worked alongside. As a photo editor, my biggest question after watching "American Factory" was "How did the filmmakers get this kind of access?"

2 Indie Movies, 2 Oddly Similar Titles

Texto completo: "Never Rarely Sometimes Always" is not "Sometimes Always Never." But the teams behind these indies didn't consider changing names. Why not?
Despite what your brain may tell you, "Never Rarely Sometimes Always" is not the same movie as "Sometimes Always Never." The former (in theaters March 13) is a neo-realistic drama that examines the hurdles a 17-year-old Pennsylvania girl faces to get an abortion in New York City. The latter (in theaters April 17) is a whimsical British dramedy starring a Scrabble-obsessed Bill Nighy on a hunt for his estranged son.
Both are small, indie films. Both have spring release dates. And both are eager to find a distinct audience, despite sharing overlapping titles of the same rearranged words.
Yet neither considered changing the title to avoid confusion. Why not?
The director and writer Eliza Hittman originally called "Never Rarely Sometimes Always" simply "A" when she began working on the script in 2012. "'A' as in abortion movie, as in 'The Scarlet Letter,"' she said. "I didn't think it was a title that would resonate with audiences ultimately, and I knew I was searching for something more dynamic."
The final title came about through Hittman's conversations with Planned Parenthood employees and refers to the possible answers to a series of questions that intake counselors ask patients to assess if they've been the victims of intimate partner violence. Its meaning is only made clear when it's spoken repeatedly during a key emotional scene in the film.
"There is something about the repetition of it that really struck me, the rhythm and repetition," she said. "And obviously, the intimacy of the conversation. I knew in the narrative that we were building to an intimate revelation."
"Never Rarely Sometimes Always" premiered in January at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won a special jury award, and Hittman said there was never any pushback on her title choice along the way.
"Obviously, when I was thinking about using it as the title, I did an IMDb search to see if there were any films that shared the same title and nothing came up," she said, referring to the internet movie database site. She recalled that executives from Focus Features, which is distributing her film, mentioned "Sometimes Always Never" in an early meeting "but I don't think anyone felt it would create confusion. It seemed like their film had been made a while ago, so I was a little surprised" to see that it was being released around the same time.
Across the Atlantic, "Sometimes Always Never" quietly debuted at the 2018 London Film Festival and in several international markets. Its title likewise changed from inception to release.
It was originally called "Triple Word Score," like the Frank Cottrell Boyce book it is based on. But legal discussions with Hasbro over the rights to the Scrabble phrase made that a less than ideal choice. And while shooting in 2017, the director Carl Hunter felt instantly moved when Nighy spoke the line, "Sometimes, always, never," to his on-screen grandson as he taught him the buttoning rule for a three-button suit (top: sometimes, middle: always, bottom: never).
"The title was in the script all the time. We just didn't spot it," Hunter said. "Sometimes you read words and they're great, but then when those words are in the mouth of an artist, all of a sudden they occupy a very different world."
When he heard Nighy deliver the line, "a shiver went down my spine," he said, adding, "I thought, 'That should be the title. It's philosophical. It's poignant. And it's poetic."'
Hunter's background as an art director also led him to visualize the phrase on a potential poster. "I look at words very carefully from the point of view of typography," he said. "To me, I can see those three words, and they occupy a wonderful space."
Not everyone was on board.
"We had lots of long, hard discussions over whether to change the title," the producer Roy Boulter said. "There was concern from the marketing department that it wasn't an easy name to hang onto -- 'Triple Word Score' is much easier to remember than 'Sometimes Always Never.' But then you'd get people going into the cinema thinking they're going to get a Scrabble drama, and that's not what it's really about. It just came to the point that it would cause us a lot less hassle with Hasbro."
While "Sometimes Always Never" was originally slated for an October 2019 U.S. release, the American distributor, Blue Fox Entertainment, pushed it to March and eventually April to try to find a noncompetitive window. "We are a small English indie and so we've got to give ourselves a big chance," Boulter said. "You only get one go at release."
Jessica Tabin, a vice president at the Creative Impact marketing agency, said the two movies' convoluted titles were detrimental -- both on their own and in light of their now month-apart release dates.
"Honestly, it's not like anybody wins, and I'm surprised no one made the change," said Tabin, whose agency has worked on promotional campaigns for "Parasite," "The Report" and other films. "I really feel like a short concise title always helps. Obviously, not every movie is 'Lincoln' or 'Goodfellas,' so sometimes you have to do a little bit of explaining in your title. But that's what taglines are for."
Tabin also noted that it's not just about what title works when spoken or seen on a poster, but also what makes the most sense when marketing to moviegoers who increasingly find out about films on their phones.
"A really lengthy title isn't going to play very well on your really small screen if you're looking through film titles, or for search purposes when you're looking for movie tickets," she said.
"Never Rarely Sometimes Always" and "Sometimes Always Never" aren't the only 2020 releases with titles that have wound up playing outsize roles in marketing and reception.
In February, after the Margot Robbie comic-book movie "Birds of Prey" fell $ 12 million short of expectations on its domestic opening weekend, Warner Bros. announced a "display change" for the title at theaters and ticketing sites, where it's now "Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey." While the film was technically always titled "Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)," Tabin noted that "nobody remembers the parenthetical portions of titles" and many probably didn't connect the dots that "Birds of Prey" was "the Harley Quinn film."
Meanwhile, the title of Autumn de Wilde's adaptation of Jane Austen's "Emma" was styled with a period, much to the chagrin of grammar-conscious copy editors. "There's a period at the end of 'Emma' because it's a period film," de Wilde told Radio Times in Britain. (The New York Times opted against using the punctuation for clarity's sake.)
"A lot of times misplaced punctuation or all lowercase or all caps might stop you in a good way because you're not used to seeing it," Tabin said. "It's there for a reason, and it's causing you to potentially want to look into it further. And maybe with 'Never Rarely Sometimes Always,' the thought process is it's so confusing that it catches your eye."
Ultimately, it's difficult to gauge how much of a role a movie's title plays in its box office success or failure, and perhaps the parallel appellations of "Never Rarely Sometimes Always" and "Sometimes Always Never" will even work in their favor.
"Whether it worries me or not, I'm not quite sure," the "Sometimes Always Never" director Hunter said. "In a strange way, because of Eliza's film having a similar title, the phone has been ringing and people want to talk. So maybe, actually, it's a very good thing."

Texto completo: The interior designer Billy Cotton imbued a couple's old Greek Revival home with European antiques, Americana-inspired accents -- and an easygoing mood that recalls the region's agrarian heyday.
IN 2009, CELEBRITY fashion stylist Thomas Christos Kikis agreed to go on a date with Derek Curl, a film producer, at an East Village dive bar. Kikis, wanting to impress, wore his best Thom Browne suit. Curl, a burly, bearded Southerner, arrived in jeans and a camo trucker hat and ordered them each a bourbon and a beer. The unlikely pair hit it off; three months later, they moved in together. In the subsequent years, their careers have pulled them in different directions: Kikis to Los Angeles, where his clients live and work, and Curl to Europe, where he owns several film distribution companies. Yet the two have found common ground -- and a home -- in a farmhouse in Andes, N.Y., three hours north of New York City.
They discovered the area by chance. In the early days of their relationship, Kikis, 35, would tag along on Curl's film shoots in the Catskills, exploring local auction houses and antique stores. On one such trip, Curl, 46, noticed that there were a number of affordable 19th-century American houses in a style he calls "the poor man's Greek Revival" -- slightly ramshackle properties with neo-Classical pediments and columned porches that reminded him of the antebellum architecture of his Georgia childhood. He had only three requirements when they began house hunting: "I wanted a Greek Revival; a large, old dairy barn with a stone foundation; and a creek running through the property." Kikis had just one: to be no more than 12 minutes from a place where you could buy The New York Times.
The search took years, but one day in 2016, they came upon a 2,000-square-foot, two-story, three-bedroom white-clapboard 1854 house with a large weathered barn surrounded by five acres of rolling fields. They bought it and did a light exterior renovation, but for the interiors, they enlisted Billy Cotton, the 38-year-old New York-based designer known for his exuberant, off-kilter interpretations of American vernacular. Recently appointed the creative director of Ralph Lauren Home, Cotton was raised in a Federal-style house in Burlington, Vt., and his first job was with the decoupage artist and East Village shopkeeper John Derian. His classic New England sensibility -- he favors straight lines, simple stripes and the innate minimalism of colonial architecture -- is tempered by his formal training in industrial design at New York City's Pratt Institute, as well as his deep affinity for French Modernists, including Jean Prouvé and Jean Royère.
Cotton also loves a good back story; he believes it endows a space with soul and a source of intrinsic warmth. His narratives tend to unspool gracefully, starting quietly and growing more colorful and eclectic as one proceeds through the environment. For Kikis and Curl, he envisioned a home that had been built for a refined family that had migrated from a small European city to begin anew on a farm in the New World, carrying with them only a few bits of antique finery. As such, the public areas downstairs are decidedly ascetic, as were rural homes of the era. The austere kitchen, with simple cabinets painted Shaker red and wide pine-plank floors, has walls of 4-by-4-inch vintage off-white Delft tiles, sourced from different lots, which gives them a subtle patchwork quality. In the sparsely furnished parlor, beside a rough-hewn mantle-less brick fireplace (Cotton convinced the couple not to replace it), a pair of low-slung settees covered in blue-and-white ticking face each other, and a 19th-century mahogany grandfather clock stands in the corner.
BUT THE STAIRCASE hallway, with its original turned-walnut banister, gives a hint of the idiosyncratic adornment that Cotton has created in the upstairs rooms. Here, the moldings and door frames have been painted bright white, in contrast with the cream background of the vintage-feeling Zuber wallpaper, which is alive with flowering vines and birds. The faded red stair runner, with a Swedish geometric pattern, seems particularly daring in this context. Soft light comes from a simple midcentury Italian pendant lamp in an unexpected shade of matte tangerine.
In the master bedroom, Cotton's love of mixing color and pattern reaches full bloom, with peacock-blue moldings and walls papered in a dense indigo block print. To camouflage the chamber's low, slanting ceiling, typical of the period, he covered it with a similar-scale block-printed fabric in red and gold. A pair of Italian gilded and painted oak twin beds -- one from the 18th century, the other a 20th-century copy -- have been made into a king-size one, draped in a patchwork quilt, while on the floor, Cotton has layered a red-and-black Tunisian rug over a geometric Turkish runner. In the corner, he added a Louis XVI-style chair covered in worn green leather. The small spare bedroom upstairs has been turned into a cozy refuge as well: Cotton created a corner bed nook from a small closet and painted the paneling a pale blue. The wall behind the mattress, which is covered by a windowpane-checked blanket, is decorated with a piece of faded red Sardinian fabric and a mirror whose glass has clouded with age. The tiny space can be closed off from the rest of the room with a striped curtain, and a red 1960s sconce serves as a reading light.
The designer pushed the couple to embrace such juxtapositions, which they might never have considered themselves -- although he played up the house's intrinsic Americana, he paired it with midcentury Italian lighting and vibrant wool Berber rugs. He also encouraged their reimagining of the barn, which Curl plans to use for aging bourbon.
But Cotton's main accomplishment is making the place feel like home. The house has become such a haven from urban chaos that the couple recently decided to give up their West Village apartment altogether. Here, they spend time with their new friends, from the county butcher to the town lawyer to the dairy farmer next door. On weekends, they pick blackberries, swim in the trout pond down the road or fish for bass in the Pepacton Reservoir. And when they return, leaving their muck boots at the paneled front door, they are enveloped in a quiet beauty that years ago they could not have imagined for themselves: the glow of a vintage Scandinavian pendant light on the polished dining-room table, the feel of a Moroccan carpet beneath their feet, the tang of pine and wild ginger in the near distance.

Francesca Mari is a journalist based in Rhode Island who writes about housing, inequality, abuses of power, con men and Alzheimer's.
She was previously a senior editor at The California Sunday Magazine and a writer and editor at Texas Monthly. Her article this week about private equity firms becoming single-family housing landlords was completed as a 2019 Calderwood journalism fellow at the MacDowell Colony. "One talking point that raises my eyebrows is when people say millennials are choosing to delay homeownership," Mari says. "For many of us, it's not a choice. Wage stagnation, student debt, the overexpansion of Wall Street and its many predatory practices: We're living in grossly unequal times, and the fact that homes have become an investment vehicle has put them even further out of reach."

Texto completo: The surf school will provide the board and a wet suit if necessary, but here are a few things to keep yourself safe and comfortable while still able to move around freely.
Compared to other sports, surfing requires less gear to get started. But if you are planning to take lessons on your next beach vacation, you will want to pack a few things to keep yourself safe and comfortable while still being able to move freely. No need to buy a wet suit -- along with a board, the surf school will provide one if it's necessary -- but consider bringing the following items. And don't forget a tube of good reef-safe sunscreen.
Unity Loose Fit Long Sleeve Rashguard
Avoid board rash with this comfortably loose shirt -- leave the skintight gear to the pros! -- that also guards against U.V. rays. ( $ 40 from Billabong)
O'Neill Hyperfreak Hydro 20" Boardshorts
These shorts feel like a second skin in the water. They never hang up, no matter how contorted your movements. ( $ 85 from O'Neill)
Seea Swami's Playsuit
Seea suits are built with surfing in mind. They stay in place, so you can move freely in the water uninhibited by suit malfunctions.( $ 150 from Seea)
Nikon W300 Camera
Ask a friend or the instructor to document your progress with this waterproof camera -- it's way easier that trying to capture yourself using a GoPro. ( $ 330 from Walmart)
Indosole ESSNTLS Flip Flops
These stylish beach sandals come in a wide range of colors for men and women. Careful, though: Indosole sizes tend to run a little small. ( $ 32- $ 40 from Indosole)
Surf Survival: The Surfer's Health Handbook
Staying safe in the water is, ultimately, your responsibility; this book -- written by three physicians who also surf -- covers every conceivable wave-riding situation. ( $ 11 from Amazon)

Cash Condolences, and Beer Emojis, via Venmo When Campaigns Fizzle

Texto completo: The race is over. The race to the bar is on.
When Senator Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the presidential race on Thursday, it was a devastating blow for her supporters and the 1,000-some staff members she had hired from coast to coast. But within hours, hundreds of alerts began popping up on their phones: emojis of whiskey pours, clinking champagne flutes, sloshing beer mugs, martinis and red wine glasses.
Plus, cash. Lots of cash.
Welcome to the unseen and surprise Venmo economy of collapsed campaigns in 2020, where political operatives have been, for months, sending drinking money digitally to their friends, former colleagues and rivals using the money-transferring app.
"It's like a Candygram but in 2020," said Lily Adams, the former communications director for Senator Kamala Harris. "But better and far more useful."
The practice has spread unexpectedly and unplanned from campaign to campaign, like a viral video with a life of its own: $ 10 here, $ 25, even $ 100. It peaked this past week as Ms. Warren followed Tom Steyer, Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar and Michael R. Bloomberg to the exits.
Drinks soon followed at the bar.
"A campaign staffer doesn't want your thoughts and prayers," said Lis Smith, the hard-charging former senior adviser to Mr. Buttigieg, who has both sent and received campaign-concluding Venmo cash. "They just want your cash for Bud Light and shots of Jameson."
The crucible of presidential campaigns -- even unionized ones like much of the Democratic field had -- is intense. The hours are long, the scrutiny is severe and the pressure is extreme. Then, in an instant, it's over.
"I'm not an astronaut," Ms. Adams said. "But I would imagine that it's like leaving the earth's atmosphere -- and all that fire and pressure -- and suddenly you're in zero gravity and it all stops."
The campaign, that thing that had grounded them for months and sometimes years, is gone. Those who have experienced that swift change in pressure have sought to ease re-entry with a slosh fund of sorts.
Chris Hayden, the deputy communications director for Ms. Warren, had never heard of this tradition until, all of a sudden, he started getting cash alerts midday Thursday.
"It is very appreciated and I intend to use it on junior staff," Mr. Hayden said in an interview from the bar at about 5:30 p.m., where his table of colleagues had instructed the waitstaff not to let the beer pitchers run dry. "I did not know about this!"
Some operatives have already gone through the exercise twice, having jumped from one losing 2020 campaign to another. Such is life in a race where an unwieldy 28 Democrats ran for president, and only three remain.
"The first one I got was when Beto dropped out," said Aleigha Cavalier, who was former Representative Beto O'Rourke's national press secretary. Her friend, Hannah Bristol, a Warren aide, sent her an unsolicited $ 10 that day ("For a drink or Nutella").
"She's one of the younger, hipper people in my life," Ms. Cavalier, 32, said of Ms. Bristol, 27.
Ms. Cavalier went on to work for Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, in his last-minute bid. When he quit in February, she got more cash via Venmo. So when Ms. Warren exited the race, she returned the favor. "We're family," Ms. Cavalier said of a cross-campaign culture of respect. "You take care of each other."
Anecdotally, Democratic campaign professionals reported fewer funds flowing to aides of Mr. Bloomberg when he dropped out. After all, the self-funding multibillionaire had been treating aides to campaign-issued Apple laptops, catered meals, furnished Manhattan apartments and salaries that dwarfed the rest of the field. He spent more than $ 550 million on advertising alone.
On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg's team decamped to the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square after he quit the race. The former mayor himself showed up and stayed for hours, taking pictures with those who wanted them. There was no need for Venmo; the billionaire's campaign covered the tab.
The amount of money being deposited is not insignificant.
Addisu Demissie, who was Senator Cory Booker's campaign manager, said he had sent out about $ 600 on Thursday. When Mr. Booker dropped out, he similarly received hundreds of dollars, all unsolicited.
"There has definitely been a little economy of this," he said. "It really did mean a lot that day we got out. People know what the fight is like."
Zach Graumann, who served as campaign manager for the businessman and political outsider Andrew Yang, got his first Venmo not the day his candidate dropped out but when his beloved Buffalo Bills lost in the N.F.L. playoffs. Ms. Smith, the Buttigieg adviser, sent him some commiserating cash.
He and Erick Sanchez, Mr. Yang's traveling press secretary, used it to pay for some go-kart racing at a casino complex in Burlington, Iowa.
"After Andrew dropped, she sent money over," Mr. Sanchez recalled. "After Pete dropped, I sent money over."
This week, the practice spread beyond the inner sanctum of campaign staff to surrogates -- and even some strangers -- on the internet.
Brandon Wolf, a gay-rights activist and survivor of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., endorsed Ms. Warren last fall after a personal phone call from her and traveled the country as a surrogate. On Thursday, he jumped on Twitter to praise Ms. Warren's "liberty green" army -- her campaign's adopted color.
"Tired: asking Warren staff what's next," he wrote. "Wired: buying Warren staff a cocktail."
He suggested her aides list their cash-collecting IDs in the thread "so the good people of Twitter can thank you." Dozens did.
"This is our digital way of buying each other a drink at a bar," Mr. Wolf said in an interview.
Priyanka Aribindi, who works in marketing for Crooked Media, a progressive media company, and supported Ms. Warren, posted something similar. Both tweets had more than 2,000 likes.
Alexis Krieg, a Warren spokeswoman, replied to Ms. Aribindi's thread with her Venmo handle suggesting that "your contribution will help support my big, structural sips of single malt" -- a play on Ms. Warren's promise of "big, structural change."
She scored about $ 250, mostly from strangers.
"I have no idea who these people are," Ms. Krieg said. "But I love them."
She used the proceeds to purchase Lagavulin 16, a single malt Scotch whisky.

Texto completo: The announcement came as the number of patients in New York rose to 89, including a Queens driver who worked for Uber.
ALBANY, N.Y. -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency on Saturday as the number of coronavirus cases in New York rose to 89, which include a Queens driver who worked for Uber and two unexplained positive tests of patients 200 miles to the north.
Moving on multiple fronts to curb the spread of the virus, Mr. Cuomo said the state of emergency would allow New York's government to respond faster by lifting regulations.
The governor's announcement came as concerns about the outbreak grew in New York City, which has 12 confirmed cases, up from six that were disclosed as of Friday. The epicenter in New York State continues to be just north of the city, in Westchester County, where there are 70 cases in total.
These cases were mostly, if not all, related to a cluster in Westchester that first came to the authorities' attention after a New Rochelle resident, a 50-year-old lawyer, was confirmed as New York's second coronavirus patient.
State officials said they were testing dozens of mouth and nasal swabs from people who might have been exposed to the lawyer, who has been hospitalized but whose condition is said to be improving. Technicians are working around the clock at private and public laboratories, including a major site near the State Capitol.
In the United States, more than 380 cases of the virus have been confirmed, and at least 19 people have died, according to a New York Times database.
Despite the spread in the state and the mounting toll of the virus, which has killed more than 3,500 people worldwide, Mr. Cuomo sought to calm the public during a news conference in Albany.
"You know what's worse than the virus -- the anxiety," Mr. Cuomo said, noting that most patients would suffer mild or no symptoms.

The declaration of emergency will allow the state to speed up the purchasing of supplies and the hiring of workers to assist local health departments that have been handling the monitoring of thousands of self-quarantined patients, Mr. Cuomo said.
"Somebody has to go knock on their door, once a day," he said. "This is labor intensive."
The declaration would also allow officials to skirt purchasing regulations, if necessary, he said.
Still, there were signs that the outbreak was spreading, including a pair of patients in Saratoga County, north of Albany -- the first such confirmed cases outside of the New York City region.
On Friday night, the Uber driver from Queens tested positive, and the case prompted more than 40 doctors, nurses and other workers at a hospital there to go into voluntary self-isolation over fears that they might have been exposed to the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday.
The man, 33, walked into St. John's Episcopal Hospital in the Far Rockaway section of Queens on Tuesday and reported flulike symptoms. He went home and returned later when his symptoms worsened, an official said.
Dozens of workers at the hospital are now being tested, officials said.
"Obviously, 40 people are out," said Councilman Donovan Richards Jr., a Democrat who represents Far Rockaway. "The hospital will need to replace those people temporarily. They will need money to do that. They need supplies. We need to keep the health care up and running."
Tom Melillo, a hospital spokesman, said that the patient remained in quarantine at the hospital on Saturday, and that hospital officials were monitoring everyone who might have been exposed to the patient.
A spokesman for Uber, Andrew Hasbun, confirmed that the man worked as a driver for the app. The company is assisting health officials to determine whether the man exposed passengers to the illness, Mr. Hasbun said.
The man was not licensed to pick up passengers in the city or at its two airports, but he was free to drop off passengers in the five boroughs, the company said. Those limitations might affect the number of people he exposed to the virus.
Other cases in New York City include three family members who live in the Upper West Side, two Brooklyn women in their 60s and 70s who showed symptoms after returning from a cruise in Egypt and a Brooklyn man in his 30s who remains hospitalized after visiting Italy, one of countries with the biggest outbreaks outside China.
Several of the new cases announced on Saturday in upstate New York added a layer of mystery to exactly how residents were contracting the coronavirus.
In Saratoga County, the two new cases involved a 57-year-old pharmacist and a 52 year-old woman who may have contracted the virus through contact with a Pennsylvania resident at a conference in Miami.
The source of contraction seemed more direct in Westchester County: All 23 new cases announced on Saturday involved people who had been in contact with the New Rochelle man, Mr. Cuomo said.
The man, a partner at a small Midtown Manhattan law firm, had attended synagogue services before becoming symptomatic.
Public health officials closed the synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, and asked that anyone who had attended services, a bat mitzvah or a funeral there recently isolate themselves as a precaution.
Also on Saturday, the governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont, said a New York doctor who commutes to work at Bridgeport Hospital tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Lamont said the physician did not show visible symptoms while treating patients and isolated himself.
New Jersey officials said four people in the state had tested positive for the virus: a 32-year-old man, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 30s, all from Bergen County near New York; and a man in his 60s from Camden County, in the southern part of the state.
Mr. Cuomo on Saturday did not say how many New Yorkers were now isolating themselves at home over fears they might have been exposed to the virus. But as of Friday, New York officials said they had asked about 4,000 people in the state to self-quarantine.
About 2,300 of that quarantined group were in New York City, and most of them had recently returned from five countries where the outbreak has been most severe: China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea.
In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said the state was aggressively testing as many people as possible.
"We want to find positives," the governor said, adding that while some people might be disconcerted by the rising number of patients, it showed that the solid medical detective work was underway. "We say, 'That's good news, that we know who the people are."'
New York City officials have asked the federal government to send more diagnostic kits for the coronavirus, saying in a letter on Friday that the city's limited capacity to test had "impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic."

Texto completo: Gray Kunz, the Swiss chef who grew up in Singapore, cooked in Hong Kong and broadened New York's vision of fine dining in the 1990s at the luxurious Manhattan restaurant Lespinasse, died on Thursday in a hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He was 65.
The cause was a stroke, a representative for his family said. Mr. Kunz had homes in Brooklyn and Clinton Corners, in Dutchess County, N.Y.
After a traditionally rigorous culinary apprenticeship in Switzerland that began at age 16, Mr. Kunz led kitchens in Hong Kong, New York and Shanghai.
In 1994, his cooking at Lespinasse received a four-star review from The New York Times restaurant critic Ruth Reichl, who cited its "Old World" comforts combined with "aggressive" and "exciting" flavors.
At his death, he was in charge of two restaurants, both called Café Gray Deluxe, in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Gray Kunz was born on Feb. 24, 1955, in Singapore and spent his first decade there, where his Swiss father and Irish mother lived at the time. Malay was his first spoken language, and he learned about food in Singapore's markets and food stalls, which he credited with developing his palate in ways that pushed him beyond the confines of his European training.
Asian ingredients were not entirely new to American fine dining in 1994. Soon after he arrived in New York in 1992, Florence Fabricant of The Times mentioned Mr. Kunz in an article titled "Lemon Grass in the Ragout? Asian Spices Enter French Cooking."
But few Western chefs had as much expertise in the cuisines of Asia as Mr. Kunz, who worked in Hong Kong's Regent hotel for five years after leaving Switzerland and spoke Cantonese along with French, German and English.
"No one else was doing curried ragout of squab with a mung-bean crepe" or using ingredients like tamarind and makrut lime leaves in fine dining, said the New York chef Andrew Carmellini, who worked at Lespinasse from 1992 to 1996. "Every young chef wanted to learn from him."
Other alumni of Lespinasse, housed in the St. Regis hotel on East 55th Street off Fifth Avenue, include the chefs Corey Lee of Benu in San Francisco and Rocco DiSpirito and Floyd Cardoz in New York.
Mr. Kunz was also a leader in vegetable-forward menus and local sourcing of ingredients, having trained with Frédy Girardet in Crissier, Switzerland, one of the first fine-dining restaurants to boast its own on-premises garden.
People who worked with Mr. Kunz often cite his combination of exactitude and kindness. Jimi Yui, an architect and frequent collaborator, said it was chronic perfectionism that had forced Mr. Kunz to invent a cooking tool that has become standard equipment for young chefs: the wide-handled, shallow-bellied "Kunz spoon," used specifically for making and plating sauces.
"He went through every spoon in every kitchen, but none of them had just the right size, shape, and weight," Mr. Yui said.
After leaving Lespinasse in 1998, Mr. Kunz waited more than five years to open his first eponymous restaurant, Café Gray, planned as one of the culinary anchors of the Time Warner Center while the building was still under construction at Columbus Circle.
He had passed the time partly by writing his cookbook, "The Elements of Taste" (2001), with Peter Kaminsky. But Café Gray received mixed reviews on opening in 2004 and never drew a regular following. It closed in 2008, along with Grayz, Mr. Kunz's Midtown foray into upscale bar food.
In 2009, the restaurant was reincarnated in Hong Kong's Upper House hotel as Café Gray Deluxe, which at one time had a Michelin star. A Shanghai branch opened in 2018.
Mr. Kunz is survived by his wife, Nicole; his children, Julie and Jimmy; and a brother, Kevin.

Texto completo: Christophe Girard, a deputy mayor of Paris, disavowed years of association with the writer and said he learned only recently of the author's abuses.
PARIS -- A powerful deputy mayor of Paris, who has been criticized for his links to the pedophile writer Gabriel Matzneff, said on Friday that he had learned only recently of the author's abuse of prepubescent boys and teenage girls.
Despite a long association with the writer, the deputy mayor, Christophe Girard, in an interview with The New York Times, denied almost any knowledge of the abuses by the writer, who has written and spoke openly about his pedophilia since the 1970s and even dedicated a book to him.
Instead, Mr. Girard said he had discovered Mr. Matzneff's abuses only after reading "Le Consentement," or "Consent," which was published in early January. The book is the first account by one of Mr. Matzneff's former victims, Vanessa Springora.
On Wednesday, Mr. Girard was questioned as a witness for four hours by detectives now investigating Mr. Matzneff. Only then, he said, was he shown book passages in which Mr. Matzneff wrote about having sex with boys.
"It's horrible," said Mr. Girard, who oversees culture for the Paris government.
Since an article in The Times on Feb. 11 revealed Mr. Girard's links to Mr. Matzneff, the deputy mayor has come under severe criticism in the French news media, on social media and by political opponents.
His four-hour questioning by the police on Wednesday came at a particularly bad time, as he campaigns for municipal councilor in Paris. The next morning Mr. Girard, who had previously rejected interview requests by The Times, offered to talk.
He did so for two hours on Friday, and used the time to deflect the revelations that have threatened to undermine his candidacy in the elections, scheduled for March 15, as part of the Paris en Commun group of Mayor Anne Hidalgo.
According to recent polls for the first round of voting, Mayor Hidalgo, a Socialist, has slipped to second place behind Rachida Dati, a candidate of the Republicans, a party on the right.
Feeling that he had become a "liability," Mr. Girard said he volunteered to withdraw from the electoral contest -- but that his offer had been refused by the Paris en Commun's campaign manager.
The campaign of Paris en Commun said in a statement Friday that Mr. Girard remained a candidate because he had simply been called as a witness in a judicial case that has nothing to do with the political group.
Since the publication of "Le Consentement," France has been roiled by revelations about the longstanding support the writer received by a cross-section of the French elite.
In 1986, as a then top aide of the designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé, Mr. Girard helped arrange payment for a hotel where Mr. Matzneff stayed for two years.
Mr. Girard tried to minimize the extent of his relations with Mr. Matzneff, saying that he has never read even a single book by the author and that he had never gotten a hint of his pedophilia.
"Maybe I'm a little naïve, and you might think otherwise," Mr. Girard said.
But while he initially said that he had first learned of Mr. Matzneff's pedophilia on reading "Le Consentement," he later said that he had heard of it in 2013, when Mr. Matzneff won a prestigious literary award -- and some anti-pedophilia groups protested.
Mr. Girard was the mayor of Paris's 4th arrondissement at the time. He said he now regretted not having spoken out against the writer, though he said other government officials, including culture ministers, were also silent.
"Why should I have been the white knight of French morality?" he said.
Since the mid-1970s, Mr. Matzneff had written extensively and talked openly, on television and in countless written interviews, about engaging in sex tourism with boys in the Philippines and about what he described as great love affairs with a series of girls in their early teens in France.
In 1974, Mr. Matzneff published a full-throated defense of pedophilia titled "Les Moins de Seize Ans" ("Under 16 Years Old"). The book made him famous in literary circles, earning him appearances on a famous literary television program, Apostrophes, and a regular column in Le Monde.
Mr. Girard, who started working for Mr. Saint Laurent and Mr. Bergé in 1977, said that though he had literary interests, watched Apostrophes and read Le Monde, he had never heard Mr. Matzneff's name until 1986.
"Matzneff, for me, I learned of him, of his name and of his existence as a writer" in 1986, Mr. Girard said.
It was in 1986 that, he said, Mr. Bergé asked him to help Mr. Matzneff because the businessman believed the author was sick with AIDS.
In a recent interview with The Times, Mr. Matzneff said that thanks to Mr. Girard, he was able to stay for free at a hotel for two years with Ms. Springora, while he recovered from eye surgery.
In "Consent," Ms. Springora writes that staying at the hotel allowed him to evade police officers who had begun visiting his apartment.
Mr. Girard said he was only an intermediary, acting on Mr. Bergé's orders. But Mr. Matzneff referred to Mr. Girard as his patron and dedicated to him his diary of that era, "La Prunelle des mes yeux," or "The Apple of my eye."
The diary details Mr. Matzneff's relationship with the 14-year-old Ms. Springora.
"Me, I don't remember ever having read it," he said of the diary. Mr. Girard could not explain why he told Le Parisien newspaper last month that he had read "parts" of it.
Mr. Girard said he had dinner a few months ago with Mr. Matzneff, but did not consider him a friend. Mr. Girard acknowledged that in recent years, he and the writer dropped the "vous" in addressing each other and adopted the less formal "tu" -- generally used in French society by people with close ties.
"Me, I don't use 'tu' much in general," said Mr. Girard, but he could not explain why he used it with Mr. Matzneff.
In recent weeks, the police -- long criticized for not investigating Mr. Matzneff -- have raided his publisher's offices, the author's apartment in Paris and the hotel room on the Italian Riviera where he has been hiding. In addition to Mr. Girard, the police have also summoned other high-profile individuals for questioning.
Many of Mr. Matzneff's former supporters have distanced themselves or even attacked him in public, as public opinion has turned against a French elite that condoned or even championed Mr. Matzneff's practices and writings.
"Frankly, I wouldn't take his phone call," Mr. Girard said. "First, I think he'll have the decency not to call me. I think he's somewhat aware of the harm he's caused me."

Lebanon Says It Will Default On Some Debt

Texto completo: The decision will appease protesters who have clamored for the government to prioritize domestic concerns. But it does little to solve the nation's financial woes.
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Lebanon will default on $ 1.2 billion in foreign currency debts coming due on Monday, the prime minister said Saturday, as the country lurched deeper into an economic crisis that has set off widespread antigovernment protests and left the country grasping for a foreign bailout.
Amid a rapid devaluation of the Lebanese pound, shortages of imports, a slow-motion bank run and thousands of layoffs, the decision is likely to appease protesters who have clamored for the government to prioritize domestic concerns over repaying the Eurobond, as the debt is known.
But it brought Lebanon, one of the most indebted countries in the world, little closer to a resolution of fiscal problems that go back decades.
"The reserves of hard currency have reached a critical and dangerous level," Prime Minister Hassan Diab said in announcing that the government would not make the debt payment. "It is necessary to use these funds to secure the basic needs of the Lebanese people."
Some economists and policymakers had argued against a default to preserve Lebanon's unblemished record of repaying its debts, pushing instead to restructure it. Without giving specifics, Mr. Diab said the government would seek to negotiate with creditors to restructure the rest of its foreign currency debt, which totals $ 31 billion.
In recent weeks, the government has been consulting with the International Monetary Fund, signaling that it would seek a bailout if its divided political factions can reach a consensus. But any international aid package is likely to come at the price of austerity measures that will be difficult for an already frustrated Lebanese public to accept, and promises of reform that previous governments have repeatedly made and broken.
Yet there appears to be little choice but to look outside of Lebanon for help.
The country has floundered in the grip of simultaneous political and economic crises for nearly half a year, as the remittances from Lebanese working abroad, aid from Gulf countries and financial wizardry at Lebanon's banks, which had kept the economy buoyant for years, began to collapse.
The slumping economy helped drive hundreds of thousands of Lebanese across the country into the streets in mid-October, denouncing the political elite for mismanagement and corruption that have left the country unable to provide basics such as 24-hour electricity and reliable running water.
That forced the government's resignation and led to a monthslong political vacuum, during which the economy slid further. But the cabinet that eventually replaced it, a mixture of policy experts and political appointees led by Mr. Diab, has failed so far to gain public confidence or head off further economic damage.
Though the official exchange rate remains unchanged at 1,500 Lebanese pounds to the dollar, the pound's value is spiraling down on the black market, where money changers' rates have topped 2,500 pounds to the dollar in recent days.
Businesspeople in Lebanon's import-dominated economy cannot get the dollars to bring in goods from abroad; Lebanese who are paid in pounds but owe tuition or mortgages in dollars are frantic, watching their spending power evaporate.
To make matters worse, Lebanese banks, fearing a run on deposits that would shred the banking system, have capped at a few hundred dollars a week the amount that account holders can withdraw.

PARIS -- Twice a year, the luxury fashion houses of the world present their ready-to-wear clothing for the coming season. This creates an international traveling circus of retailers and reporters, high-spending customers and Instagram influencers, executives and a small army of public-relations professionals, many traveling from New York to London to Milan and finally to Paris.
This year, the caravan's arrival in Milan in mid-February intersected with an outbreak of Covid-19, the new coronavirus, in Italy, then the country worst hit by the illness outside of Asia.
And so, a thousand or so very well-clad people wondered for a few weeks: Would they become a global public health menace, a vector of transmission from the elite front rows of fashion shows to the world at large?
The final leg of this monthlong tour arrived for a week in Paris starting on Feb. 24. On the first day of shows, the number of reported cases of coronavirus in France was just 14; by the last day, there were more than 200, and the country had banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces.
Many attendees were sleep deprived; some were already sneezing and coughing from seasonal colds. Design houses were handing out face masks before their shows. Several high-profile American buyers and magazine editors, including those from T: The New York Times Magazine, decided to leave Paris early; some didn't come at all. (The United States communications team for Chanel and Louis Vuitton was told to stay at home.)
The largest of the shows were attended by up to 1,000 guests. Another show took place in a sealed plastic tube, as if it were its very own petri dish.
By midweek, Americans had begun strategizing with their employers in New York about their returns to the United States. Would they need to self-quarantine -- work from home -- and for how long?
At Lacoste, the penultimate show of Paris Fashion Week, roughly 20 to 30 percent of media guests had canceled.
What remained uncontained were the rumors. The Miu Miu show was going to be canceled, people said. (It was held as scheduled, but Miuccia Prada, the designer, chose not to host her usual post-show meet and greet, although she had performed the same ritual less than two weeks earlier, after her Prada show in Milan.)
With some transport in Italy grounded, Louis Vuitton was rumored to have used the personal jet of Bernard Arnault, the head of the parent company, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and the third richest man in the world, to transport its handbags from coronavirus-infected Italy to less infected France.
"I wish I had invented that!" said Michael Burke, the Louis Vuitton chief executive, when asked about the rumor.
At the Vuitton show on Tuesday, held in a closed courtyard at the Louvre, Antonio Belloni, the group managing director of the company, was pantomiming fist bumps rather than greeting people with a handshake or a double-cheek kiss, the industry standard.
It was an eerie setting: The museum's staff had walked out on Sunday amid concerns about the spread of coronavirus, effectively closing the French monument. (After three days, the Louvre reopened on Wednesday.)
Sidney Toledano, the chief executive of LVMH Fashion Group, shared squeezes of hand sanitizer from his pocket-size bottle with Jonathan Newhouse, the chairman of Condé Nast, and both of their wives.
At one show, a New York Times journalist was approached by a reporter from another outlet. Was it true, the reporter asked, that someone at The Times had already contracted the virus? (It was not.) At the next show that day, a Swiss fashion executive recoiled when another Times reporter tried to greet him with a handshake, avoiding the gesture (and eye contact).
The End of Fashion Shows?
The crisis has accelerated a question hanging over fashion in recent years. Runway shows are expensive, laborious and environmentally harmful. Are they still worth absorbing an entire month?
Before the Alexander McQueen show in Paris on Monday night, François-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of the luxury conglomerate Kering -- owner of Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga -- wondered whether the industry should begin digitizing showrooms and considering a new system. (Throughout fashion week Mr. Pinault joked, or half-joked, that he had been taking his temperature twice a day to monitor for fever, a symptom of coronavirus.)
Anna Wintour, the artistic director of Condé Nast and editor of Vogue, said she had also been thinking about the future.
"At a time of crisis, we have to think about a radical reset," she said.
As coronavirus spreads -- more than 90,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths have been reported worldwide -- the industry isn't so sure about its ability to move forward.
Rakuten Fashion Week, scheduled to begin on March 16 in Tokyo, was canceled. (Japan has, at this time, only slightly more cases than France.) Subsequent fashion weeks in Shanghai and Beijing have been postponed.
Ralph Lauren, who planned a runway show in April in New York, has canceled his show. Burberry has postponed an April show in Shanghai. Gucci has canceled a show in San Francisco in May, and Prada has canceled a show planned for that month in Tokyo. And Versace just announced it would postpone its cruise show, which was scheduled for May 16 in an as-yet-undisclosed location in the United States.
Ms. Wintour conspicuously stayed in Paris through the end of the shows,-- as did editors from other Condé Nast titles, including Vanity Fair and Teen Vogue. She and her team had been discussing how best to support emerging designers in the current climate.
"They are a creative force and the generation we look to to lead the way forward," Ms. Wintour said. "If they are all having cash flow problems -- as I am sure they are, because of low retail traffic in the showrooms and supply chain issues and people wanting to stay out of public spaces -- anything we can do to support them is important." She was hoping to announce a plan in the next few days.
"We can't let them fall by the wayside," she said.
After Paris, Ms. Wintour planned to visit London before returning to the United States. Other editors said they would return to their New York offices on Monday -- 14 days after they left Milan, the recommended time for self-quarantine set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after visiting regions where there has been significant presence of coronavirus.
Others will not go back to their offices for two weeks after leaving Paris -- mid-March, at the earliest.
The Real Industry Crisis
"Empty seats at shows are not the problem -- it is what is happening in showrooms, the holdups in the supply chains and what they might mean," said Pascal Morand, the executive president of the Fédération Française de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, the organizing body of Paris Fashion Week. "It is the uncertainty and not knowing how long the situation will last."
Designers don't just show their collections at these four big fashion weeks in February and September. They also sell them.
Fashion buyers employed by retailers (Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's, for example) and e-commerce platforms (Net-a-Porter, Matches Fashion) negotiate order sizes and prices with brands and decide what goes into stores. This happens during intimate showroom appointments separate from runway presentations.
This season's orders have been down, designers said. Not necessarily for big companies like Valentino, Vuitton and Tod's, their executives said, but for smaller independent houses, and particularly for those whose production takes place even partially in China.
In an effort to stop the spread of the virus, thousands of Chinese factories, already closed over the celebratory New Year period, have yet to reopen, bringing manufacturing to a near standstill and headaches for many fashion companies that produce samples and wares in the country. Significant added costs from order backlogs and logistics delays are now expected, as well as a looming threat to global trade.
And it's not just China. Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, wrote of the effect of Covid-19, "The key numbers to watch -- at the moment -- are the growth in cases in the provinces of Bergamo, Cremona and Brescia," some of the Italian production hubs.
With many luxury boutiques closed in mainland China, sales down almost 90 percent, and retailers in key luxury hubs like Paris already counting the costs of a significant decline in Chinese tourists, a reduced number of fashion insiders in the front rows of Paris and Milan is the least of the industry's concerns.
Jefferies Group, an investment bank, estimates that Chinese buyers accounted for 40 percent of the $ 305 billion spent on luxury goods globally last year, making the Chinese the fastest growing luxury shopper demographic in the world. Buyers are concerned that continuing travel bans will reduce their spending.
"There has definitely been a drop in buyers from all over the world, especially from China and Hong Kong," said Ayse Ege, a founder of Dice Kayek, a luxury women's wear label in Paris.
"Lots of buyers are saying their budgets have been cut," Ms. Ege said. "Some have also asked whether they can cancel orders or have discounts, given the lack of visibility on what might happen next."
At the end of the fashion tour, buyers typically return to Milan for further appointments with Italian designers and showrooms. This year, those have been canceled. Milan is now, according to one boutique owner, a ghost town. One local restaurant, normally a kind of fashion central, made less than 100 euros in a recent evening. The fashion directors for Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue did not stay through the end of Paris shows.
But, Ms. Ege added, buying has not stopped completely. It is just happening remotely. Unable to touch and see the products up close, buyers have been video chatting with designers throughout Milan and Paris, using these conversations, along with high-definition look book photos and sales line sheets, to make decisions for the fall season.
Ikram Goldman, the owner of the influential Ikram boutique in Chicago, said that while she has cut back on orders -- "with an unstable economy and late deliveries, we are taking precautions," she said -- she is still trying to look for and buy from new designers.
"They are the future, and we can't forget them," Ms. Goldman said.

Texto completo: Readers react to an editorial in favor of ranked-choice voting and offer their own ideas for a better way to elect a president.
To the Editor:
Re "The Primaries Are Just Dumb" (editorial, Feb. 27):
Thank you! The primaries are dumb, along with wasteful, confusing, divisive, interminably long and undemocratic. Our proclivity for constant entertainment, the opportunity the current system affords those least qualified to serve as president, and televised food fights disguised as "debates" have put our country and our democracy in grave danger.
Standardize the process across all states, eliminate complicated caucuses and shorten the length of time it takes to pick a nominee. Ranked-choice voting, in which voters rank the candidates in order of preference, makes the most sense. And no campaigning before March 1 of election year. Daily life without the constant depressing drumbeat of election politics would be refreshing.
John C. Ficor

To the Editor:
As a feminist, I have long been an advocate of ranked-choice voting. While the editorial makes sound claims on the benefit to the voter, it could have included a much-needed analysis of the impact ranked-choice voting has on diversifying the candidate pool.
Cities where ranked-choice voting has been implemented are twice as likely to have a female mayor, and the council is more likely to be gender and racially diverse. A consensus candidate emerges from a ranked-choice voting model, and -- even better! -- that consensus candidate is more likely to be reflective of the population he or she serves.
At every level, we need to be looking at our political systems through the lens of justice across race, gender, class and orientation and build an electoral system that both empowers the voter and enables greater diversity among those we cast votes for. Anything less is "just dumb."
Erin Vilardi

To the Editor:
While ranked choice, or instant-runoff, voting may seem ideal in abstract, it is flawed for a number of reasons. First, it is easily manipulated, as voters can rank candidates who are likely to win lowest to increase the chances of victory for their preferred candidate. An instant-runoff voting system would encourage insincere voting and ruin the whole point of ranking candidates.
Second, instant-runoff voting may declare a candidate as the winner even though a majority of people preferred another candidate. This happened in the 2009 Burlington, Vt., mayoral election, in which the incumbent, Bob Kiss, won even though a majority of people preferred the Democratic candidate, Andy Montroll.
The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow proved in 1951 that no ranked voting system can be truly fair, and it therefore should not be introduced into our democracy.
Ethan Hwang
Palo Alto, Calif.
To the Editor:
Ranked-choice voting is certainly one alternative to improve our current outdated system. However, I'd more strongly advocate for approval voting, which allows voters to choose all the candidates on the ballot they approve of, and the candidate with the most votes wins. It's super simple, avoids the mathematical and mechanical complexity of ranked-choice voting and achieves more complete voter representation.
It's easier for voters to understand and for election officials to count, thereby increasing voter engagement and making it less expensive to adopt. The results provide us with a candidate approved of by the most voters, making unity more achievable, and giving a true mandate for governance.
Debra Morrison
Seattle
To the Editor:
How about this: Instead of voting for your candidate of choice, you vote against those candidates you would not want in office. Yes, it would be a radical change in how voting is conducted, but it reflects how many of us actually decide to cast our ballots: We choose the least objectionable candidate.
In all elections, including a primary, we would cast "no" votes for some, or none, or even all of the candidates, and at the end of the day the winner would be the person with the fewest "no" votes. A true consensus -- which, incidentally, would never have led to the nomination of Donald Trump.
When the winner of an election will by definition be the person who best understands that success will not be achieved by riling up the base but by appealing to the most voters, a new breed of politician will arise: those who are truly committed to getting things done for all the people.
Glenn Goldstein
Chappaqua, N.Y.
To the Editor:
I agree that ranked-choice voting would improve considerably the process for choosing a party candidate. But it wouldn't fix a much greater problem with the primary process. Currently debates are the main mechanism by which one candidate rises to become the nominee. So ask yourself: How much time does a president spend debating? And how much does debating skill translate to presidential effectiveness? The answers are obvious: none and none.
To the argument that the debates offer insight into the candidates views, I'd respond that the insights often are about other candidates' words or actions from 10 or 20 years ago. And really, who cares? I want to know how that candidate will deal with the critical issues of our time.
There are ways to improve the process. One way is to junk our present debate structure and let the candidates make their case directly to the people. Attack-dog skill should be retired as a factor in choosing a president.
David Blake
Santa Rosa, Calif.
To the Editor:
The editorial board's endorsement of ranked-choice voting, or R.C.V., in primary elections is welcome. However, the editorial mixes up the virtues of two different forms of R.C.V.: the single-winner variety (in which voters rank candidates, and if nobody gets a majority of first-place rankings, candidates are successively eliminated until someone has more than 50 percent of the vote), and the multi-winner version (which awards delegates proportionally to candidates' vote totals).
The board correctly notes that a major advantage of single-winner R.C.V. is eliminating the "risk of 'spoiler' candidates"; likewise, this voting system reduces the chance of splitting the vote among similar candidates. Unfortunately, these advantages are lost in the proportional representation version of R.C.V.
Until Super Tuesday, it looked likely, even with R.C.V., that the moderate candidates in this year's Democratic primaries would act as spoilers for one another and split the centrist vote, giving Bernie Sanders a plurality, but not a majority of delegates (and putting Democratic leaders in a difficult bind).
Still, there is a solution to vote-splitting and spoilers in primaries: Use single-winner R.C.V. at the national level. That is, have voters in each state rank the candidates and then combine their ballots nationwide to determine the overall R.C.V. winner -- and party nominee.

To the Editor:
Thank you for your editorial endorsing ranked-choice voting in presidential primaries. There may be no single more useful way to reduce the now seemingly insurmountable divide between citizens of our country. This would, as you point out, give all voters a sense that they have been heard, and would result in the election of a candidate supported, at least in part, by the greatest number of voters. This would be an electoral process that would feel genuinely democratic and would create the most national good will toward whichever candidate is eventually elected.
Betsy Johnson

To the Editor:
The primary calendar should be determined by each state's ranking in voter turnout in the previous election. This will reward states with a high level of civic involvement and penalize those that enact measures to suppress minority voting.
Gilbert Tauber
New York
To the Editor:
Why does the United States not just have a national Primary Day? Just like Election Day, but to vote for who will be the nominee who will represent each party in the upcoming general election? Other countries do it. Why can't we?

Texto completo: With a toddler, an infant, and alarm clocks going off at the wee hours of the morning, sleep rules abound.
The married media duo Jamie and Brian Stelter reach distinct audiences. As the traffic anchor and "Mornings on 1" a co-host at NY1, Ms. Stelter, 38, wakes New Yorkers up and helps them navigate traffic snarls. And as the chief media correspondent for CNN Worldwide and the anchor of CNN's "Reliable Sources" on Sunday mornings, Mr. Stelter, 34, breaks down the week's top stories for a global viewership.
Mr. Stelter is also a producer, whose book, "Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Daytime Television," served as source material for "The Morning Show" on Apple TV Plus, where he served as a supervising producer. His next project, "After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News," an HBO documentary directed by Andrew Rossi and for which Mr. Stelter served as executive producer, will have its premiere on March 19.
Ten years ago, the couple met when Mr. Stelter, then a media reporter at The New York Times, asked Pat Kiernan, the NY1 anchor, to play matchmaker via Twitter. They live with their daughter, Sunny, 2, and infant son, Story, near Columbus Circle in Manhattan.
TRENDING EARLY Brian: My alarm is set somewhere between 5:30 and 6:30, depending on the news cycle. If I didn't set an alarm, the kids would wake us up by 6:30 anyway. Lately they've been trending early. Jamie: I like to say I gave birth to a rooster, not a child.
THE ARRANGEMENT Jamie: I give Story his first bottle of the day. If Brian is at work doing one of his early-morning reports, then we're watching him on TV, making sure Sunny likes the color of the tie he's wearing. Brian: Let me interject. My show is on at 11, but sometimes they'll have me on in the 7 a.m. hour to promote what's coming on at 11. Jamie: I make Sunny's breakfast. We share some kind of fruit-eggs-toast situation, then our nanny comes around 8:30. Brian: I usually go to the Starbucks four blocks away for a bacon Gouda sandwich and a cold brew. And I Uber to and from work, lest anybody think I have some fancy town car waiting for me.
PREP Jamie: I'll throw in a load of laundry and a lot of times I'll start to prep Story's food for the week. I purée all his food. I try to sneak out to Whole Foods for Oatly oat milk, which is kind of a running joke. They don't do a good job of stocking it. After that we load up the kids and go to the park. We pack all the food and all the toys in the stroller like we're leaving for a day trip. It's a little Clark Griswold.
THE WOMAN IN BETWEEN Brian: At work, there's lots of last-minute changes happening. I'm keeping an eye out for breaking news, then I'll adjust things accordingly. Jamie always texts me at 10:40 to wish me a good show. One funny thing is that Jamie and I have the same makeup artist. She splits her time between CNN and NY1. What I love about it is that it's this continuous conversation, because she knows what Jamie's been doing and she knows what I've been doing.
SLEEP RULES Brian: The show's over at noon, and then I postgame with the producers. By 1 I'm starting to fade. I feel pretty exhausted. I feel like I have three jobs: the show, dad duty and the newsletter. A nap is crucial. I nap the same time Sunny naps, from 2 to 4. Jamie: We have lots of sleep rules in our house. One is he cannot come home until she's already asleep. If he comes home and she's awake, she'll get riled up. Brian: I look at the WiFi cameras above each crib to be sure it's OK. I've slept on the couch in my office before.
SELFIES IN THE BACKYARD Jamie: After naps, we'll go back to the park for another round. We are so lucky to live so close. It's literally our backyard. We always find it's easier to be out of the house with the kids than inside. Brian: We have just the right amount of recognizability, where we can be flattered by the attention and take some selfies but it's not distracting for the kids. What I like most is when people recognize Jamie but not me. That's fun.
EARLY TO BED Jamie: We have dinner at 5 or 5:30. Story has his bath and his bottle by 6:30, when Sunny and Daddy are playing crazy in the house, soccer or something. I get emotional when I put him down every night because he grows so fast. Then all of a sudden my alarm clock for the next day gets a lot more real. It'll go off at 2:40 instead of 2:50 because I wash my hair on Monday. In an ideal world I'm asleep by 8:30.
MORE SLEEP RULES Brian: Once I say good night to Jamie I pivot to the newsletter for CNN. I do it six nights a week. On a good night, I file to my editor at 10 and go to bed at 11 or midnight. Jamie: One other sleep rule we have is that there should be no movement in our bedroom during the last hour of my sleep. If Brian's already in there, he can't get up to go to the bathroom. If he's not in there yet, he can't go in until I'm awake.
LOVE LETTERS Every Sunday night, I start a new email to Jamie that becomes our email for the week. They're what we call our love letters. Jamie: It can be, "Story woke up and I had to soothe him," or "Don't forget I have to go to this dinner on Tuesday." Sometimes it can be romantic. Brian: I like choosing the subject line, because it sets the tone for the week. It's a nice way to end the day, summing up our lives in an email.
Sunday Routine readers can follow Brian and Jamie Stelter on Twitter and Instagram at @brianstelter and @JamieStelter.

Texto completo: Key officials in recent days have corrected or clarified the president, who has sought to project calm as the coronavirus continues to spread in the United States.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Saturday continued sending contradictory signals about its response to the coronavirus, as a top federal health official appeared to walk back President Trump's claim that "anyone who wants a test can get a test."
The health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II, cautioned that only those who have gone through a doctor or medical professional can be approved for a test, a message that appeared to undercut Mr. Trump, who delivered his promise on Friday as he toured the Atlanta headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"You may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test," Mr. Azar said at an off-camera briefing at the White House. "That is our medical system in the United States, in the same way that you may not get a cardiac medicine if your doctor doesn't prescribe that."
Mr. Azar's comments were another instance of key officials in recent days correcting or clarifying Mr. Trump, who has sought to project calm and preparedness as the coronavirus continues to spread in the United States. More than 100 new cases were announced in the United States on Saturday, including two deaths in Washington State and dozens of new cases in New York State.
The communications clash between the president and top officials overseeing the federal government's response to the coronavirus could obscure valuable knowledge about it, said Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the author of "The Public Health Crisis Survival Guide: Leadership and Management in Trying Times."
"Things change in a crisis -- the advice may change in a crisis," said Dr. Sharfstein, a former top F.D.A. official who teaches a class on the topic at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "And so it's really important for the public to have confidence in the messages and the messengers so that they understand and believe new information and advice."
Mr. Azar on Saturday defended Mr. Trump's phrasing, saying it reflected a recent shift by federal health agencies, which have loosened testing regulations. The C.D.C on Wednesday lifted all restrictions on testing for the coronavirus.
"What the president said yesterday at the C.D.C., that is consistent with what the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. are saying, which is we as regulators, or as those shipping the test, are not restricting who can get tested," Mr. Azar said. "We are leaving that to the professional judgment of doctors and public health officials."
Mr. Trump used "shorthand" to make that point, Mr. Azar said.
"What he meant to say is we're not in the way of that," Mr. Azar said. "And he knows the numbers. We brief him daily."
Mr. Azar's assertion echoed one made by Vice President Mike Pence at a White House news conference Friday evening, in which the vice president said that doctors treating potentially symptomatic Americans could contact local officials and have state labs do the testing.
During a visit to the mask producer 3M in Minnesota on Thursday, Mr. Pence acknowledged the constraints of testing. "We don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward," he said.
In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has remained publicly upbeat, minimizing the potential consequences of the virus, which he has said could disappear this spring in warmer weather. "A vast majority are going to be fine," the president said on Friday about Americans who have the virus, portraying it as similar to the flu.
"I'm not concerned at all," the president said on Saturday when asked about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House.
In private, White House officials have cast Mr. Azar as "alarmist."
On Friday, Mr. Trump characterized the government's testing aptitude as "amazing" and called the C.D.C.'s test "perfect," statements that have been roundly disputed by scientists and health officials who have expressed alarm over the speed with which the C.D.C. has tested and over the quality of its tests.
Consistent messaging, Dr. Sharfstein said, helps with the "fear of the unknown."
"Testing is a more confusing topic than it can seem," he said. "People can be overly reassured by a negative test or overly panicked by a positive test. Having a thoughtful approach to testing is important."
The number of people who can be tested for the coronavirus and the number of tests available are fluid, federal officials said on Saturday at the White House briefing.
Dr. Stephen Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, said that 1.1 million tests had been shipped to private health labs as of Friday evening, and hundreds of thousands more were being surveyed for quality at the C.D.C. on Saturday. He said that between public health labs and C.D.C. tests, the total number of samples that have been tested was over 5,860.
Pressed over whether an ill person who consults a doctor and is recommended for a test can get one in a timely way, Mr. Azar said on Saturday that "there's no reason that should not happen."
Doctors and patients across the nation have painted a much different picture of availability, clamoring for tests they believe are in short supply. In California, only 516 tests had been conducted as of Thursday. Health officials in Washington State have more cases than they can currently process. In New York City, officials have pleaded for more test kits from the C.D.C.
State officials facing a growing number of cases criticized the Trump administration this weekend for what they described as its contradictions. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said that he was "battling" mixed messages from the federal government.
"You have the president saying anybody who wants a test can have a test, it's beautiful," he said on MSNBC. "You have the vice president saying we can't do the tests. We don't have the capacity."
"That confusion, I think, adds to the fear and the frustration of people, because if government doesn't know what it's doing, well then people feel they're really alone," Mr. Cuomo added.
After Mr. Pence visited Washington State this week to signal the administration's support for the state, where 14 deaths have been connected to a nursing home in the Seattle area, he praised its governor, Jay Inslee. Mr. Trump then called Mr. Inslee a "snake."
"Let me just tell you we have a lot of problems with the governor," Mr. Trump said in Atlanta on Friday. "So Mike may be happy with him, but I'm not, OK?"
Mr. Inslee wrote on Twitter that it was "important for leaders to speak with one voice."
"I just wish the president and vice president could get on the same page," he said.
Mr. Trump has also sought to contain public alarm by registering fewer cases of the coronavirus, a decision that public health experts say risks misleading Americans about where the virus has spread. The president said he would prefer not to let 3,533 people on a cruise ship held off the coast of San Francisco to disembark onto American soil, even if they were placed into quarantine, in part because it would inflate the number of American infections. Nineteen crew members and two passengers of the ship have tested positive for the coronavirus.
Two passengers on the ship, Cookie Clark, 76, and her husband, Joe Clark, 81, of Oakdale, Calif., said they had been watching the news constantly and were angry when they heard Mr. Trump say on Friday that he preferred the ship not dock in the United States.
"As American citizens, we have a right to be back on U.S. soil," Mr. Clark said.
Ms. Clark, a retired realtor, said she was appalled. "We're just numbers to him," she said.
Josh Michaud, an associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that it was in the public's interest to know where cases of the virus were as soon as possible.
"That's going to be the foundation for developing an effective response. You need to know where the disease is to erect the resources," Mr. Michaud said. "If you don't, you're flying blind."

Texto completo: Times reporters and editors take careful measures in their personal lives to remain objective in their work.
In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more of this series here .
Ever since a young publisher named Adolph S. Ochs bought The New York Times in 1896, its mission has been "to give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved."
Independence remains the bedrock of our journalism. But what does it mean in practice?
As journalists, we work hard to set aside our personal views and approach every assignment with an open mind.
Bill Keller, a former executive editor of The Times, used to say that one of the most important things for reporters to do is to report against their own preconceptions, to actively seek out perspectives that might be contrary to their own.
Maggie Astor, a politics reporter, puts it like this: "I don't think it's possible to live in the world -- much less be immersed in politics day in and day out -- and not have opinions. But part of my job, when I'm reporting and writing, is to ask myself, 'Would I pose this question this way, or would I write this article this way, if my own opinions were different?' And if the answer is no, I stop and recalibrate."
As New York Times employees, we are required to extend this self-scrutiny beyond our work, to the places where our personal and public lives intersect. Newsroom staff members may not participate in political advocacy, like volunteering for candidates' campaigns or making contributions.
"And, by extension, we ask them to be very careful and mindful about other contributions and donations they make and volunteer work they do," Philip B. Corbett, The Times's standards editor, explains.
We should not wear campaign buttons or display any other insignia of partisan politics, such as bumper stickers or lawn signs. Nor may we serve on government boards or run for public office.
This goes for reporters, editors, photographers, artists, designers, researchers and other staff members in every news department of The Times, not just for those who cover politics.
We asked several colleagues how they think about political impartiality.
Kim Severson, a national food correspondent, considers the importance of applying the same rules to everyone in the newsroom:
You might think it doesn't matter if a reporter profiling a chef or testing a new recipe campaigns for a school board candidate or goes to a rally, but it does. Every Times journalist, no matter how unrelated to politics our beats may seem, has to uphold the same standards of impartiality when it comes to politics. Anything that puts a dent in that standard hurts the paper and makes it harder for the reporters who work on the front lines of political coverage.
Elizabeth Dias, a national correspondent covering faith and politics out of the Washington bureau, puts readers ahead of what she does in her free time:
I don't go to marches, though that's the hobby du jour in Washington right now. When my friends point out that Americans have the right to free assembly, I agree. I just also think of another First Amendment right, freedom of the press, and that is my focus. Impartiality, for me, is not about hiding something I really think, or trying to keep my real views from being exposed. It is about trust. I think about my readers a lot. I want them to trust me.
Not attending a rally or a march is one thing, but what about voting -- wouldn't a neutral journalist decline to choose a candidate in order not to take sides? Mr. Corbett draws the line:
I think voting is a baseline action as a citizen. I wouldn't feel comfortable suggesting that our journalists shouldn't vote. But we don't need them to go any further than that.
Some of our journalists, including our chief White House correspondent, Peter Baker, do go further, though:
As reporters, our job is to observe, not participate, and so to that end, I don't belong to any political party, I don't belong to any non-journalism organization, I don't support any candidate, I don't give money to interest groups and I don't vote.
I try hard not to take strong positions on public issues even in private, much to the frustration of friends and family. For me, it's easier to stay out of the fray if I never make up my mind, even in the privacy of the kitchen or the voting booth, that one candidate is better than another, that one side is right and the other wrong.
Stephanie Saul, a politics reporter, votes but has opted out of one part of the process:
For more than 25 years, my New York voter registration has been "no party." It places me in the category of a swing voter, so I get lots of door-knockers trying to sway my vote.
There are many ways that journalists work to steer clear of politics in their personal lives, but doing so isn't always easy or straightforward. Social situations can be particularly challenging. Hanna Ingber, a newsletter editor and the former editorial director of the newsroom's Reader Center, grapples with how to approach the subject on dates:
These days, it can feel like politics is everywhere and everything is politically charged. Even dating apps ask for your political affiliation. It's easy not to fill out that question, but what happens when a match asks about your views or which candidate you support? As a journalist, I struggle with how much to say -- and prefer interrogating my dates on their opinions. Perhaps we need a policy on this: On Date 7 you are allowed to express your political perspectives.
What if we're talking about issues instead of candidates -- issues that may often be associated with the left or the right but that also transcend politics? Ms. Astor strives to keep everything in perspective:
I think it's crucial to remember that the goal is fairness and truthfulness. My opinions on, say, economic policy should not influence my reporting in any way. But while "climate change is real" is technically a "side," it's also the truth. "Racism and misogyny are wrong" is a "side," but also a basic element of human decency. So it's important to me to remember the difference.
Perhaps the biggest challenge, says Michael Slackman, our International editor, is being aware of implicit bias , our unconscious attitudes and beliefs. To look beyond the prism of their own life experiences, his foreign correspondents have to know what they don't know and immerse themselves in the countries they cover. Through in-depth, on-the-ground reporting, they take nothing at face value. And they are relentless at questioning and pushing back against those in charge -- an instinct, Mr. Slackman notes, that frequently extends off the job.
I'm genetically distrustful of authority. It's about fairness and justice, not specific causes. The powerful need to be held accountable. The voiceless need to be given a voice. That's in all corners of my life.

Texto completo: The real Elizabeth Warren crashed "Saturday Night Live" after suspending her 2020 presidential campaign this week.
The show's opening sketch featured Kate McKinnon as Fox News host Laura Ingraham, assuring viewers they had nothing to worry about when it came the coronavirus, dubbing concern over the virus "liberal fan fiction. "
McKinnon's Ingraham was joined by guests including Donald Trump Jr. (Mikey Day) and Eric Trump (Alex Moffat). Day's Trump Jr. promised that his father has "everything under control" as his brother nodded along while playing with his newest toy – a thermometer, which beeps to indicate he has a high temperature.
Ousted MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews (former cast member Darrell Hammond) made a brief appearance, telling Ingraham he may "get in trouble for saying this, but you look great. "
Ingraham's final guest: Elizabeth Warren – no, not McKinnon as Warren. The real one.
More 'SNL': James Bond may be delayed over coronavirus concerns, but Daniel Craig offers a sneak peek
Speaking to McKinnon's Ingraham, Warren said she's "doing just fine," thanking her family and friends for being supportive after she suspended her campaign – asking questions like "What do you need?" and "Were you electable?"
Will the senator endorse Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders? Warren says "it's tough. "
"Maybe I'll just pull a New York Times and endorse them both," she said.
All in all, Warren is "so proud of our campaign. " Most notably, "not only did I not accept money from billionaires, I got to give one a swirly on live TV. "
McKinnon, who typically plays Warren on "SNL," then traded her Ingraham outfit to match the one the real Warren was wearing. The two Warrens stood next to each other as McKinnon thanked the politician for her contributions.
"I'm not dead," Warren quipped. "I'm just in the Senate. "

Why the D.C. chapter of the Harry Potter Alliance is taking up transgender rights

Texto completo: The January meeting of the D.C. chapter of the Harry Potter Alliance took place on a Saturday at East City Bookshop, a store just blocks from the U.S. Capitol where you can buy Ruth Bader Ginsburg baby onesies and bring your children to Drag Queen Storytime. More than a dozen attendees " almost all women in their 20s and 30s " formed a circle near the fantasy and young adult sections downstairs. Organizers called it an unusually good turnout for their niche activist group, in which fans of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world promote literacy, human rights and civic engagement in Washington and beyond.
The day's agenda mostly consisted of planning for the year. How would the alliance join get-out-the-vote efforts for the upcoming elections? Should the group push for D.C. statehood? Launch a book drive? Set up a Little Free Library, a miniature bookcase where passersby swap reading material? Then, about a half-hour in, communications director Danielle Ternes offered another suggestion. 'It might be a good idea right now to do something for transgender rights,' she said, 'in the current climate.'
The 'current climate' originated in December, when Rowling tweeted in defense of Maya Forstater, a British tax researcher who lost her job for making statements widely perceived as anti-trans. Rowling's #IStandWithMaya tweet caused a firestorm on social media, as LGBTQ advocates rose up in condemnation. 'Trans women are women,' the Human Rights Campaign tweeted. 'Trans men are men. Non-binary people are non-binary. CC: JK Rowling.' Critics labeled the author a bigot and a 'TERF' " a trans-exclusionary radical feminist. Vox went so far as to declare that she had 'just ruined Harry Potter.'
Many Potter fans joined in the denunciation. On Facebook, the D.C. chapter of the alliance posted that Rowling's 'transphobic views are completely unacceptable and hurtful to so many who have been inspired by her work.' It wasn't the first time the author had drawn political criticism from die-hard devotees: She'd previously been accused of transphobia for liking a tweet referring to 'men in dresses,' which her spokesperson blamed on the author 'holding her phone incorrectly.' But nothing had caused this level of blowback. 'She's done lots of stuff before that's crossed the line,' Ternes told me, 'but not far enough that people had to confront it. This is what forced people to confront it.'
It may seem unusual for a group of literary fans to be speaking out against the political views of the author of their beloved books " but none of this should be a surprise. Since its founding in 2005 as a 'novel' approach " pun intended " to social change, the Harry Potter Alliance, which is now active in 30 countries spanning six continents, has tried to push Rowling's fans beyond writing fan-fiction and adapting the sport of Quidditch for non-magical Muggles who can't fly on broomsticks. Its most famous effort was a successful 'Not in Harry's Name' campaign, which in 2014 ensured that all Potter-themed chocolate products from Warner Bros. would be fair trade.
New York University adjunct professor Zoe Fraade-Blanar highlights the group's work in her book 'Superfandom: How Our Obsessions Are Changing What We Buy and Who We Are,' co-written with Aaron M. Glazer. According to Fraade-Blanar, Rowling's presence on social media increases a sense of intimacy between the author and her fans. But it also intensifies disagreements. 'Because fandom is often used to help people form their own identities,' Fraade-Blanar told me, 'when that fan object changes unexpectedly ... you're not just changing someone's hobby. You're actually changing a part of them.' This can lead to feelings of sadness, outrage or even betrayal " and ultimately the kind of social-media pile-on that overtook Rowling.
Potter fandom includes a large number of LGBTQ people, especially young people, who felt deeply hurt by Rowling's actions. Jackson Bird, a New York-based activist who spent half a decade as the alliance's national communications director, credits fellow fans with embracing him when he came out as transgender in 2015 at 25. In a December op-ed in the New York Times, he wrote that Rowling's tweet was 'like a punch in the gut' and a stark contrast to his fan community, which 'adhered to the values we learned from the books about being yourself, loving those who are different from you and sticking up for the underdog.'
Bird told me recently that he understands fans for whom Rowling is 'basically canceled.' He still believes that 'if she had a goodwill conversation with a trans person " or even a cis person who could educate her on some of this stuff " we could break through.' But in December, Rowling declined a request from the LGBTQ group GLAAD to talk about trans issues. (She did not respond to a request for comment for this article.)
At East City Bookshop, alliance members eagerly discussed how to communicate their support for trans people. Maybe members would hold a fundraiser for a local trans group. Maybe they'd host a readathon of books with trans characters. Maybe they'd do something special for D.C. Pride this summer.
In the meantime, they continue to celebrate Harry Potter, believing that their allegiance is bigger than the books or Rowling. Marieka Cober, the D.C. chapter organizer, has a yellow lightning bolt " like Harry's famous scar " tattooed on her ankle; she says it represents the friends she's made through Harry Potter fandom as much as the text itself. When it comes to fans challenging Rowling, Cober invoked a line from the end of the first Potter book. 'It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies,' Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore tells his young pupils, 'but just as much to stand up to our friends.' The Harry Potter Alliance plans to be around and standing up for a while " 'as long as J.K. Rowling has a Twitter account,' Ternes said.

Texto completo: This article contains spoilers for "Love Is Blind."

The hottest thing in dating right now is not being able to see the person you're talking to.
Yes, that's the premise of "Love Is Blind," Netflix's wildly popular reality-TV dating show that puts singles in pods where they can talk but not see one another. The only way to reunite sans divider is to chat so long that you fall in love and get engaged.
But the appeal of sightless dating goes well beyond Netflix. "Married at First Sight," which pairs off strangers in unions that they have eight weeks to decide to keep or ditch, is gearing up for its 11th season. For the past year, a New York comedy show called "UpDating" has been attracting large crowds to watch two strangers fumble through their first date while blindfolded. November saw the launch of a queer dating app called Lex, where people post text-only personal ads in search of their perfect match. And in January, a dating app entrepreneur started S'More, where users can see one another's photos only after they exchange several messages.
The eyes may be the "windows to the soul," but clearly we're realizing that sight alone won't lead us to our soul mates. Can taking it away, ever briefly, correct for our overly visual superficiality?
The hosts of "UpDating" - Brandon Berman, 25, and Harrison Forman, 28 - think their show resonates with audiences because a lot of them are on dating apps. "You're just seeing a picture to decide if you like someone or not," Forman said in a phone interview. "On a blind date, it's the opposite. You're still judging - but it's by personality, vibe, energy."
For the first half of "UpDating," two daters converse while blindfolded. Then the blindfolds come off, and everyone gets to see the reaction. Will, a 30-year-old New Yorker who was on the "UpDating" stage last month, said in a phone interview that he went on the show to deliberately take himself out of his comfort zone. (He spoke on the condition that only his first name be used, for personal privacy reasons.)
"If you're an attractive person in a large city with so much options, you get chosen so easily just because you're hot," Will said. "When you just have to rely on your wits, you really find out if you're a fun person or not." He found the experience a bit jarring because he wasn't just talking to one person, as he might on a first date - he was talking to his date and an audience of about 80.
Will's date, Emily Beard, 24, actually thought he was more attractive when she couldn't see him. "I really did like him blindfolded, but once they came off I was like, 'Oh, God, no.' "
The problem? She's into a more clean-cut look, and Will's hair was longer than she generally goes for. And we're not talking Jesus locks here. Will has a couple of inches of hair.
Even while blindfolded, much of their conversation focused on height. Beard is a taller woman who likes to wear heels. They haven't been out again.
The disconnect between blind and visual dating was the entire premise of "Love Is Blind." This is still television, so of course everyone is conventionally good-looking. But what's more striking, and perhaps where the blind aspect was applied even more strictly, was in terms of the calendar. These daters had fewer than 40 days to date, get engaged, live together and then make a decision at the altar: We're getting married or parting ways. That's not just an experiment in whether love is blind to physical attraction, it's a question of whether love is blind to how a person, and a relationship, unfolds over time.
Even though some of those pod conversations were deep and revealing, they're just the beginning of a connection. The pod talks were reminiscent of people on first, second and third dates using the famed "36 questions" as shortcuts to intimacy. Those questions, which went viral in a New York Times Modern Love column in 2015, might help forge a bond between two people.
But no amount of conversation is a perfect substitute for the intimacy of time. Sure, this person you just met seems to want the same things, but can they put their needs aside to attend to yours? What are they like in a crisis? How do you handle being apart? What will you do if she has a jealous or mean streak? How does he talk to his mother?
Dating apps have encouraged first impressions to be so heavily based on looks that many daters never land in deep-question territory. Cameron Hamilton said the superficiality of app dating is what led him to "Love Is Blind." Before signing up for the show, "I was doing the dating apps, and I was finding myself picking the wrong people for me," he said in a phone interview last week. "I was making quick judgments based on how they looked and was ignoring their personality. So I thought that this might be a chance to get to know someone on a deeper level, an emotional level, first."
Perhaps the show's daters were giving one another more time and opportunity to connect than they would have if they'd been swiping through the exact same pool on Tinder. But emotional connections can be just as fleeting as the purely physical ones.
The show's more telling conversations happened once the daters were back in real life. At one point, Damian Powers and Giannina Gibelli shouted at one another in separate rooms, from the kitchen to the bedroom. For his fiancee, Jessica Batten, Mark Cuevas set up a romantic spread - rose petals strewn about and a nice meal, the makings of an intimate date night - with each of them on opposite sides of a wall. Jessica remarked that the gesture was so romantic. But these two couples, who had trouble having difficult conversations face to face, also happen to be ones who didn't make it.
On the other side, Amber Pike waited until she was engaged to Matt Barnett to tell him about her student loan debt and shaky work history. The late revelation reinforced just how little these people knew about one another. He seemed concerned but not so much as to break their commitment. He must have seen more potential in her, in the two of them together, than he saw reason to flee.
Which might actually be the most reassuring thing about this crazy experiment. After all, any relationship, whether you're marrying after 40 days or after four years, will deal some wild cards along the way. It doesn't matter so much what those twists or challenges are, so much as how you deal with them - and whether you're both willing to take them on together.

Texto completo: At least one uncle, cousin charged with treason in bid to consolidate power

Four senior princes including two of the most prominent members of the Saudi royal family have been detained in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, a move that could be designed to further strengthen the position of the kingdom's de facto ruler, according to two people close to Saudi leadership.
Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, an uncle of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and one of his cousins, Mohammed bin Nayef, were taken into custody Friday morning, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss highly sensitive internal Saudi matters.
The princes were charged with treason, a serious accusation for which they could receive the death penalty.
Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as crown prince and heir to the throne in 2017 when King Salman elevated one of his sons, Mohammed bin Salman, to the role and gave him wide authority to effectively run the kingdom.
Mohammed bin Nayef had earlier served as the country's interior minister, developing a close working relationship with U.S. security officials.
Both the arrested men could claim a more senior place in the line of succession to Mohammed and were seen as potential rivals to the throne.
The Saudi authorities subsequently detained two close relatives of the senior princes.
The brother of Mohammed bin Nayef, Nawaf bin Nayef, was detained on Friday in the hours following his father's arrest. On Saturday, the son of Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, Nayef bin Ahmed, was also detained, said the person familiar with the arrests. It was unclear whether they had been taken into custody or placed under house arrest.
The two princes had returned together from a hunting trip late Thursday when they received a call summoning them to meet the crown prince at 7 a.m. Friday at the royal palace, said one of the people who had been briefed on the events by members of the royal family. When they arrived, they were taken into custody, according to the account.
The arrests come at a sensitive time for the kingdom, with oil prices plummeting and Mohammed's decision to halt visits to Mecca in response to the coronavirus outbreak stoking discontent. The arrests were first reported by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
The royal family also has faced international criticism over the October 2018 murder of Washington Post contributing columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi. The United Nations blamed what it called an "extrajudicial execution" on Saudi state agents, and U.S. intelligence officials have privately told Congress that Mohammed, who is often called by his initials, MBS, was responsible.

The crown prince has been consolidating his power over the past couple of years, seeking to disarm critics and silence dissent at home and abroad.
While he has succeeded in concentrating authority in his own hands to a degree that's highly unusual in the kingdom, it's unclear what kind of opposition he might face to becoming king when his elderly father dies. It is also uncertain what may have prompted the reported detentions.
Some Saudi commentators said the arrests suggest rifts within the royal family over the succession of the crown prince, whose strong-arm tactics have alienated many princes.
"The arrest of several senior disgruntled princes such as [Ahmed] and MBN [Mohammed bin Nayef] reflects a growing discontent with the 'Son King' over his despicable hegemony and erratic social, economic, foreign and religious policies," tweeted Madawi al-Rasheed, a Saudi academic based in London and a fierce critic of the crown prince.
Hugh Miles, editor of ArabDigest.org, a subscription service offering political analysis about the Middle East, noted that fissures within the royal family could present long-term difficulties to the crown prince once he takes the throne.
"Although many questions still remain about what has happened in Saudi Arabia in the last 24 hours, what is clear is that MBS is now facing ruling Saudi Arabia without the backing of the rest of the royal family," said Miles, who is based in Cairo. "This is a major problem for him because any would-be Saudi King is expected not only to have the royal family's full allegiance, but also to be able to prove it."
As a son of the founder of the Saudi kingdom, Prince Ahmed was senior in the line of succession but was passed over in favor of a new generation of younger princes. He had been living in Britain, afraid to return after he made comments that appeared to criticize the crown prince. He returned to Saudi Arabia in 2018 following Khashoggi's killing after being given assurances for his safety, according to the person with knowledge of the arrests.

Rise gives establishment one last chance

Texto completo: I don't know about you, but the election results this week filled me with more hope than I've felt in years. It felt like somebody turning down the volume.
The angry and putrid shouting that has marked the last four years - and that would mark a Trump vs. Sanders campaign - might actually come to an end. Suddenly we got a glimpse of a world in which we can hear each other talk, in which actual governance can happen, in which gridlock can be avoided and actual change can come.
But the results carried a more portentous message as well. For those of us who believe in our political system, it's put up or shut up time. The establishment gets one last chance.
If Joe Biden wins the nomination but loses to Donald Trump in the general election, young progressives will turn on the Democratic establishment with unprecedented fury. "See? We were right again!" they'll say. And maybe they'll have a point.
If Biden wins the White House but doesn't deliver real benefits for disaffected working-class Trumpians and disillusioned young Bernie Bros, then the populist uprisings of 2024 will make the populist uprisings of today look genteel by comparison. "The system is rotten to the core," they'll say. "It's time to burn it all down."
Some people are saying a Biden presidency would be a restoration or a return to normalcy. He'll be a calming Gerald Ford after the scandal of Richard Nixon.
But I don't see how that could be. The politics of the last four years have taught us that tens of millions of Americans feel that their institutions have completely failed them. The legitimacy of the whole system is still hanging by a thread. The core truth of a Biden administration would be bring change or reap the whirlwind.
There would be no choice but to somehow pass his agenda: a climate plan, infrastructure spending, investments in the heartland, his $750 billion education plan and health care subsidies. If disaffected voters don't see tangible changes in their lives over the next few years, it's not that one party or another will lose the next election. The current political order will be upended by some future Bernie/Trump figure times 10.
This week's results carried a few more lessons:
Democrats are not just a party; they're a community. In my years of covering politics I don't think I've ever seen anything like what happened in the 48 hours after South Carolina - millions of Democrats from all around the country, from many different demographics, turning as one and arriving at a common decision.
It was like watching a flock of geese or a school of fish, seemingly leaderless, sensing some shift in conditions, sensing each other's intuitions, and smoothly shifting direction en masse. A community is more than the sum of its parts. It is a shared sensibility and a pattern of response. This is a core Democratic strength.
Intersectionality is moderate. Campus radicals have always dreamed of building a rainbow coalition of all oppressed groups. But most black voters are less radical and more institutional than the campus radicals. They rarely prefer the same primary candidates.
If there's any intersectionality it's in the center. Moderate or mainstream Democrats like Biden, Clinton and Obama are the ones who put together rainbow coalitions: black, brown, white, suburban and working class.
The new Democrats are coming from the right. Bernie Sanders thought he could mobilize a new mass of young progressives. That did not happen. Young voters have made up a smaller share of the electorate in the primaries so far this year than in 2016 in almost every state, including Vermont.
Meanwhile there were astounding turnout surges in middle-class and affluent suburbs. Turnout was up by 76% in the Virginia suburbs around Washington, Richmond and parts of Norfolk. Turnout was up 49% overall in Texas. Many of these new voters must be disaffected Republicans who now consider themselves Democrats.
It's still better to work the room than storm the barricades. Biden grew up in a political era in which politics was still about persuasion, not compulsion; building diverse coalitions, not just firing up your base. He's been able to win over many of his former presidential rivals and cement a series of valuable alliances, especially with Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.
As Ezra Klein pointed out in Vox, Sanders tried to win over the Democratic Party by attacking the Democratic Party and treating its leaders with contempt. In fact, some Sanders surrogates are attacking Biden's skill in building coalitions as a sign of evil elitism, as something only those nasty insiders do.
Biden's wins this week, and his incredible polling surges in states like Florida that are soon to vote, make it likely that he will win and Sanders will lose this primary contest. But that doesn't mean that legitimate crises that are driving the Sanders voters - or the legitimate crises that are driving Trump voters - will go away.
Their problems will still be all our problems. And if our current system can't address them, then that system will be swept away.

Texto completo: Health care benefits all
Picture three routine scenarios:
1. A nanny with three children is standing in line behind you at the Thrifty Mart.
2. A busy fellow packs up your latest Amazonian order.
3. A restaurant wait-person serves you up those amazing Tuscan spaghetti and meatballs.
Are you better off when all three have health care? Or would you rather they came to work sick because they could not afford the time off? Just asking.

Vote to bring back civility
Gerry Branch is right in his letter “Civility has been lost” (Our Readers' Views, March 3), but is wrong about where its loss comes from. Donald Trump has been vicious and aggressive from the first day of his campaign to become president. Probably nothing in any letter against him has been as uncivil as separating children from their parents at the border.
If the letters against him are uncivil, they are a reaction to his incivility. It is very hard to respect a political party that would support a candidate like Donald Trump. I have respect for people like John McCain who stood up against Trump's demands, but most of the GOP today doesn't deserve any. Trump himself is at the center of the whirlpool of hate that exists in America today. Civility will not come back to this country until we elect a president that accepts and supports the diversity of the people in this country — no doubt a Democrat.

Engagement requires both sides
“Political Engagement? Teachers setting course” praised the teachers and school system actions in the front page article of the March 1 paper about politics in the classroom (“In Our View, The Columbian, March 4). The article quoted Jerry Price: “We don't want sheep” and “We need people who can actively engage and be meaningful members of the community.”
The problem is the Woodland High School teacher said “I don't know what normal is” as the students rapid-fire flipped through CNN, Washington Post and New York Times. My question is, are they also showing conservative sources of news, Fox, Washington Examiner or Wall Street Journal? If you don't teach or expose the students to the other side of the argument how will you produce anything but sheep who can't support a meaningful argument about any current news topics? That sounds more like indoctrination rather than education.

Local GOP shows true colors
I offer a hearty “thank you” to Clark County Republican Chairman Earl Bowerman and the local party's executive board for their public support of white nationalist state Rep. Matt Shea, R-Spokane Valley, who was invited to emcee the local party's Lincoln Day fundraiser. Their actions have removed any doubt, if such doubt still existed, that the local party has run off the rails into the Trumpian swamp of bigotry and incivility.
As one who proudly remembers the local party's proud recent history with state Reps. Richard Smythe and Don Carlson; party activists Jim Fowler and Drs. Paul Dygert and Bob Bedrossian; Clark County Republican Chair and 1976 Clark County First Citizen Naida Pithoud; east Clark County Congressman Sid Morrison; Clark County Commissioners Dick Granger and Vern Veysey, among others, I thank Bowerman and Co. for their stunning but clarifying actions.

Regulations harm equestrians
Clark County's robust equestrian community does things right when it comes to building relationships, businesses, strong youth and showing up at county hearings voicing issues. They own their numbers!
Ongoing disputes over abusive regulations and fees are now causing harm and putting these folks at risk (“Clark County horse owners decry fine threats at council meeting,” The Columbian, Feb. 19). If the county stays on this regulatory road, there is no way to know how many equestrian facilities and barns will be able to weather the financial storm codes and fees have created. This community has a long history of neighborliness, giving hearts, and taking care of things better than bureaucracy can ever hope to achieve.
Equines are probably at the very heart of the county's unique rural character. However, Clark County failed to conduct outreach to these folks. Imposing costly regulations on barns and arenas without conducting outreach and eyeing impacts from regulatory actions is like controlling coffee without asking Starbucks. People's livelihoods depend on their barns and arenas. The county's approach was shortsighted. This neglectful approach results in harm to a community that should be elevated and defined as a regional asset.
The assumption is, if the facilities are regulated and causes displacement, the effects on rural communities would be minimal. Nothing is further from the truth.

Horse ordinances are unreasonable
Re: “Horse regulations require new task force” (The Columbian, Feb. 23): The editorial opinion that a task force to look at existing ordinances regarding barn operations makes sense. However, the council needs to put a moratorium on enforcement actions for operating barns or barns with construction permits. If barn owners cease operations, an untold number of barn employees will lose their jobs. This includes trainers, grooms, stall cleaners, and it will impact commercial hay and milling operations and food and tack suppliers including stores like Wilco and smaller feed and tack shops. The ordinances are not reasonable on their face.

Medal of Honor plaque found in Hermitage yard. Who is the owner?

Texto completo: The night of the tornadoes, Darlene Williams locked herself in her bathroom with a flashlight and her Australian Shepherd mix, Bodhi, and hoped for the best.
The next morning, unscathed from the storm, she took her dog out in the yard to survey the damage. Yellow insulation covered everything like snow — the trees, the grass, the power lines, her car. Glass crunched beneath her feet.
And then, in the side yard of her Hermitage home, she noticed something different.
"I saw something glistening in the sun," she said.
When she picked it up, she realized that a priceless personal keepsake had been blown in by the storm.
It was the Medal of Honor recognition for James Howard II.
The copper plaque was attached to black cardboard base, the adhesive on the back suggesting it had been ripped from its home. Perhaps something far away.
Now, she wants to get it back to where it belongs.
"I have family members in the military," she said. "It's always great to see folks honored for their service and heroism."
In the aftermath of the Tennessee tornadoes, many are trying to reunite those impacted by the storms with what they have lost.
On a Tennessee Tornado Lost and Found Facebook page, hundreds are posting pictures of an heirloom quilt and a wedding announcement, wrinkled photographs and a sweet kitty cat, all which have shown up in their yards and in hopes of getting belongings back to owners.
In Lebanon, one woman posted a photo of a warped white paper — the exam results for a new certified clinical medical assistant. Within an hour the owner had been found.
"That is mine! Yes!," she responded after being tagged by a mutual friend in the post. "How amazing are you! I was waiting on it. I got the news I passed on the 27th and they were going to mail that to me for proof of records! And I never got it. We never thought about our mail! Oh my gosh!"
Another posted a letter from "Mom" dated 2004, which mentions Ella Jane sitting up on her own and someone passing out at a Christmas play. That, too, was returned.
Facebook is not the only place for reunions. An area at the Cookeville Community Center has also been set up for such a purpose — a place to recover personal items that had been blown away, some of them for multiple miles into areas far from those damaged by the tornado.
New items arrive each day.
"We were just putting tons and tons of stuff in backpacks," said Ashley Walkner, who dropped off items Thursday at the community center after volunteering in the impacted areas Wednesday. "We found like insurance cards and driver's licenses and just random things in piles. We were trying to collect all that we could. If it seemed personal, we just tried to keep it. ...
"This isn't like litter pickup. These are people's lives."
Flight combat against the Nazis earns highest military honor When Williams found the Medal of Honor plaque in her yard, she wanted to know more about the man being honored.
The story of Howard's life is incredible.
The only fighter pilot to win the Medal of Honor in aerial combat over Europe in World War II, Howard earned the nation's highest military honor in January 1944, after he single-handedly took on 30 Nazi aircraft that hampered a mission by Allied bombers over Germany, according to the Los Angeles Times.
He destroyed at least four enemy airplanes and damaged others before he was forced to return to England, the L.A. Times reported.
Howard was born in China. His parents were missionaries in Canton, and he spent his first 14 years in China, according to his obituary in the New York Times. After attending the U.S. Navy's flying school in Florida, he joined the American volunteer group, the Flying Tigers, and helped to defend China against the Japanese.
In 13 months of action over Burma and China, he flew 56 missions and was credited with shooting down six Japanese planes, according to the New York Times.
He died in 1995, at the age of 81.
Now, Williams hopes to find the person who owns the keepsake that honors Howard's service and his memory. A tribute that has endured.

She was the original ‘Rosie’ in the iconic WWII poster

Texto completo: Rosalind P. Walter, 95

Since entering the cultural zeitgeist in 1942, many women have claimed to be World War II-era poster icon Rosie the Riveter, but only one could claim to be the original.

Her name was Rosalind P. Walter.

She died Wednesday, the New York Times reported. She was 95.

Three other women, Mary Doyle Keefe, Naomi Parker Fraley and Geraldine Hoff Doyle, were all at one point identified with the Rosie poster, but it was Walter who inspired the character.

Born in 1924 to a wealthy family, Walter grew up in Long Island, N.Y. When WWII broke out, she got a job riveting the metal hulls of Corsair fighter planes at a Connecticut plant. It was there that newspaper columnist Igor Cassini wrote about Walter. His column was seen by songwriters Redd Evans and John Jacob Loeb, who penned the song Rosie the Riveter in 1942.

The song caught on and became a hit.

In May 1943, Norman Rockwells painting of a then-19-year-old Keefe sitting with a rivet gun on her lap and lunch box labeled Rosie under her arm appeared on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post. Keefe died in 2015. She was 92.

Seton Hall University professor James J. Kimble, who researched the history of Rosie the Riveter for a 2016 article in the journal Rhetoric & Public Affairs, found that the name Rosie the Riveter was given to the woman it portrayed. That woman was Fraley. She died in 2018 at 96.

The posters artist, J. Howard Miller, took inspiration for his Rosie from a 1942 newspaper photo of Fraley. For years, it was believed that Doyle was the inspiration for Rosie after she misidentified herself as the woman in the original photograph.

It wasnt until after Doyles death in 2010 at 86 that Kimbles research revealed Fraley to be the true inspiration for Rosie.

Yet still, only one woman could claim to be the originator of the Rosie name and mythos. It was Walter, who, as Evans and Loeb wrote, kept a sharp lookout for sabotage sitting up there on the fuselage.

Her friends called her Roz.

Developer tried out facial recognition

Texto completo: A billionaire with ties to St. Petersburg is among a number of private businessmen who have tested a controversial facial recognition technology primarily used by law enforcement, a New York Times story said Friday.

John Catsimatidis, the New York billionaire and regular Sunshine City visitor who has said St. Petersburg needs a skyline, currently has a large mixed-use project planned for Central Avenues 400 block. According to an anecdote in the New York Times story, he used Clearview AIs mobile app in October 2018 to identify a date with whom his daughter was having dinner.

I wanted to make sure he wasnt a charlatan, Catsimatidis told the newspaper.

While Clearviews technology is largely used by law enforcement, the story highlighted how a handful of wealthy individuals  some of them investors in the company  had access to it. Catsimatidis is described in the story as a friend of an investor. Catsimatidis did not return two calls for comment and an email to his company, Red Apple Group.

Clearview sells access to a facial recognition algorithm that purports to be able to accurately identify people by comparing photos or video of them with images harvested from the internet, including social media, that it maintains in a massive database. Privacy advocates said the product raises significant privacy and civil liberties concerns.

Last month, the Tampa Bay Times reported about a dozen Florida law enforcement agencies had tried or purchased the companys technology.

Catsimatidis, the New York Times story said, also piloted the program at one of his grocery store locations in New York City that had problems with shoplifting.

People were stealing our Häagen-Dazs, he told the New York Times. It was a big problem.

Red Apple Group is currently planning a recently approved 45-story condo building and a 20-story hotel project for the parcel in St. Petersburg.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Paul Thompson wouldn’t blame his Shawnee Class of 1999 classmates if they don’t remember him.
Still, he’ll play a key role in the efforts to put a #MeToo movement figure, film producer Harvey Weinstein, behind bars.
Thompson, 38, works as a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles County. Earlier this year, he was assigned as the lead prosecutor on Weinstein’s charges in Los Angeles. Two women allege Weinstein sexually assaulted them in separate incidents in hotels in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills back in 2013.
“I was surprised,” Thompson said by phone last week about being handed such a high-profile case, noting he was just happy to have been put on District Attorney Jackie Lacey’s “Hollywood Task Force.” “It’s a very humbling responsibility.”
Thompson graduated from Kent State University summa cum laude in 2003, where he met his now-wife, Laura, a special education teacher. They moved to California, where he graduated from UCLA’s School of Law in 2006 and started with the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office in March 2007. He’s spent much of his time on the West Coast prosecuting sex crimes.
“I was an average high school student. When I got to Kent State and started studying hard, I started doing well,” he said. “That’s when I thought about law school. … I knew once I was in law school that I wanted to be a prosecutor.”
He said the most difficult part of his job is talking to victims of crimes and telling them they don’t have enough evidence to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, so they wouldn’t be filing charges.
“My heart goes out to these victims, who you’ve talked to and you really believe they were victims of a crime,” he said. “You just can’t prove it to 12 jurors beyond a reasonable doubt. … That’s the hardest part, when you have to tell a victim you can’t file their case after they’ve bared their soul to you.”
Ethical standards keep Thompson from talking about his opinions on the Weinstein case. He spent four or five days in New York, watching the East Coast prosecution of the case. A jury convicted Weinstein of two felony sex crimes, including rape and criminal sexual assault. The jury found him not guilty on two charges of predatory sexual assault. He faces up to 29 years in prison when he is sentenced on Wednesday.
Thompson kept abreast of the child by reading court transcripts, which arrived at his downtown Los Angeles office around 3 p.m. most days. In Los Angeles, Weinstein faces charges of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of restraint and sexual battery by restraint.
Thompson said he eagerly read the work of investigative journalists, including Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor in The New York Times and Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker. Thompson, who worked at The Lima News in the sports department in high school, said he always found print journalism “fascinating” but decided the hours journalists work “really aren’t conducive to having a family,” given the number of nights and weekends worked.
His day job makes him extra protective of his 8-year-old daughter, who is in third grade, when he thinks about sexual assault.
“As a parent, it makes me really, well, not paranoid, but it makes me really cautious,” Thompson said. “I do think it’s pervasive. … I heard numbers like one in six women will between childhood and adult life be victimized at some point in time. It’s just so pervasive.”
He unwinds from the stresses of work by exercising and spending time with his family. He particularly enjoyed coaching his daughter’s basketball team in a YMCA league. One thing he doesn’t enjoy is social media; he dropped his social media accounts about a year ago.
“There are no standards of how truthful or not something is on social media,” he said. “You saw too many opinions based on any number of inaccurate facts. I’d just had enough, mostly from the larger political stuff.”
He returns to Ohio several times a year. While his father passed away a few years ago, his mother remains in Lima. They also visit Laura’s family in Dayton.
He said he hasn’t let the high profile of the Weinstein case affect how he does his work. He doesn’t sound impressed with possible witnesses’ acting resumes, although he still feels for what they’ve been through.
“This one has more media exposure, for sure, but there have been other cases that I’ve been really proud to have worked on,” Thompson said. “It’s kind of sad that just because the victims weren’t celebrity victims they didn’t get as much media coverage.”

Texto completo: A spokeswoman for President Trump's reelection campaign explained that its lawsuits against a multitude of major news publications were designed to hold them accountable.
Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany discussed the libel suits on Friday's edition of Hannity, hours after the campaign filed a suit against CNN. The suit, which centers on an opinion piece from June 2019 regarding the Russia collusion theory, comes on the heels of suits filed against the Washington Post and New York Times.
"Look, we think it will be successful because there is no denying that CNN, that the Washington Post, that the New York Times have all displayed malicious intent. They knowingly published false information," she explained.
"The libel laws essentially now allow you to slander anyone, libel anyone," McEnany added. "And that's why Justice Antonin Scalia said they need to change. But we have to work within the structure we have right now. And you cannot go out there and lie knowingly do so, peddle the Russian collusion narrative, and think you can get away with it. This lawsuit is in an effort to hold the fake news accountable. Bottom line."
Trump campaign: Lawsuit against CNN is meant to 'hold the fake news accountable'
The piece at the center of the campaign's lawsuit against CNN was written by former Federal Election Commission general counsel Larry Noble and titled, “Soliciting dirt on your opponents from a foreign government is a crime. Mueller should have charged Trump campaign officials with it." Noble argued in the piece that special counsel Robert Mueller was wrong not to charge members of the Trump campaign with conspiring with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election.
The Trump campaign's complaint argued CNN was aware the statements in the article were false “because there was an extensive record of statements from the Campaign and the administration expressly disavowing any intention to seek Russian assistance” and still published it.

Texto completo: Blackwater founder Erik Prince helped enlist former American and British spies to help Project Veritas infiltrate liberal groups.
His role in recruiting ex-MI6 officer Richard Seddon and others was revealed in the discovery process of a legal battle between Project Veritas, a conservative organization, and the American Federation of Teachers, according to the New York Times.
Documents show Seddon directed a 2017 operation to make copies of files and make secret recordings in a Michigan office of the teachers' union. He also oversaw an operation, using the same undercover operative, to infiltrate the 2018 Democratic congressional campaign of former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger, who won the contest. That operative, Liberty University graduate Marisa Jorge, was discovered and removed from the campaign.
ATF Michigan sued Project Veritas in 2017, accusing Jorge and Project Veritas of fraud, trespass, theft, conspiracy, and unauthorized surveillance. The union seeks more than $3 million in damages from the group that it described as a “vigilante organization which claims to be dedicated to exposing corruption. It is, instead, an entity dedicated to a specific political agenda.”
Project Veritas, which is led by James O'Keefe, claims its actions are protected by the First Amendment. The case is expected to go to trial in the fall.
Prince, a former Navy SEAL and former head of Blackwater Worldwide, is the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has criticized unions. Both grew up in Michigan.
Prince declined to comment for the report, and Seddon and Jorge did not respond to a request for comment. O'Keefe would not specifically address Prince or Seddon, but he called his group a “proud independent news organization."
Last month, the Justice Department said it was reviewing a 10-month-old criminal referral by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff that accused Prince of misleading congressional investigators in their inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Matthew Schwartz, a lawyer for Prince, downplayed the Justice Department's review.
“There is nothing new here. Erik Prince’s House testimony has been public for more than a year and was available at all times that Mr. Prince met with the Department of Justice during the special counsel’s investigation," Schwartz, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, told the Washington Examiner. "Mr. Prince cooperated completely with the special counsel’s investigation, as its report demonstrates. There is nothing new for the Department of Justice to consider, nor is there any reason to question the special counsel’s decision to credit Mr. Prince and rely on him in drafting its report."

Jennifer Finney Boylan: Bernie angry! Bernie smash!

Texto completo: I stood before a mailbox in Manhattan, holding my absentee ballot for the Maine primary. Bernie angry, I thought happily. Bernie smash.
And I wasn’t even voting for him.
No, my vote had gone to Elizabeth Warren, who from the beginning of the campaign had impressed me with her optimism. Watching Warren, I got the sense that even the long slog of a presidential run could be done with good humor and exuberance.
There was a time when optimism was considered a desirable trait in politicians: Barack Obama and Bill Clinton had it; Ronald Reagan had it in spades.
And Joe Biden has it. In his 2012 victory speech, President Obama hailed him as “America’s happy warrior.” Who knows? It may be that it is this — a sense of buoyancy and hope — that accounted for his extraordinary series of Super Tuesday victories.
Back in the days of Vice President Hubert Humphrey, this was known as “the politics of joy.”
“I enjoy life,” Humphrey once said. “It’s a delight. You only live a short time. You ought to enjoy every fleeting moment.”
Humphrey was the quintessential Happy Warrior, although the phrase didn’t originate with him. It was, in fact, coined by William Wordsworth back in the early 19th century, in a poem that Grover Cleveland is said to have loved so much that he wanted it read at his funeral.
What is a Happy Warrior? It’s someone for whom the battle itself is the source of joy. Or as Molly Ivins once wrote, “You got to have fun while you’re fightin’ for freedom, ’cause you don’t always win.”
Thinking about it now, the idea of politician-as-Happy-Warrior seems quaint, like elbow-length evening gloves for women or men wearing stovepipe hats. Maybe Happy Warriors were a better fit back when the country was, you know, happier. There was a time when optimism — about ourselves, about the nation, about our sense of history — seemed baked into the American character.
Senator Bernie Sanders is not a Happy Warrior. A warrior, definitely. Happy? Not so much.
Not that there haven’t been moments of joy in his campaign. During his last run, a little sparrow landed on the podium while he was making a speech, and the Vermont senator’s face lit up. Then the sparrow took off, and for just a second Sanders watched it fly off and gestured with one hand toward the heavens. “I think there may be some symbolism here,” he said. Nice.
But more often Sanders seems to be driven less by joy than by fire, less inspired by the delights of what President Richard Nixon called “the arena” than by the seriousness of the revolution he is trying to bring about.
There should be bumper stickers: Bernie Sanders: the Crabby Warrior. Sometimes he gets so furious while he’s speaking that he changes colors.
Which brings me back to the Incredible Hulk, and my moment by the mailbox with my absentee ballot.
The Hulk — the greener, angrier version of the scientist Bruce Banner — is known for his talent at tearing things apart: trees, a school bus, even (on one occasion) his own house.
Sanders’ to-smash list is a little different: pharmaceutical companies, college tuitions, the prison system. He is not the Hulk, and not only because he turns red instead of green when he gets his dander up. But like the Hulk, Sanders too is driven, at times, by what seems like rage.
And he’s right: We should be filled with rage.
It’s rage, not joy, that we should feel when we think about the Republican-controlled Senate failing to remove Donald Trump from office for offenses they all know he committed.
It’s rage, not joy, that we should feel when we think about Mitch McConnell refusing to hold hearings for Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.
It’s rage, not joy, that we should feel when we consider our convoluted health care system, and the burden of student debt, and all our crumbling roads and bridges.
We should be filled with rage, not joy, because of all the ways in which our democracy does not work.
And because we are at the mercy of Donald Trump, a man who resembles the previous 43 presidents less than he resembles a villain out of Marvel Comics. And not one of the smart ones, like, say, Thanos, but one of the dumb ones, like Emil Blonsky in “The Incredible Hulk,” who — driven by ego and vanity — transforms himself into a giant destructive blob. That villain’s name: Abomination.
I admit I have spent more hours than I care to admit streaming movies from the Marvel Comics Universe this winter, in an attempt to get through what I pray are the final months of the Trump presidency. It’s one reason, standing there by the mailbox with my absentee ballot, I fantasized about Sanders as the Hulk, and Trump as Abomination.
Once you watch enough of those films, everybody starts to seem like a cartoon. Thinking of the Sanders campaign, I’m put in mind of the first “Avengers” film, when Captain America turns to Bruce Banner at a moment of crisis and notes, “Dr. Banner, now might be a really good time for you to get angry.”
“That’s my secret, Captain,” Banner replies, before hulking out. “I’m always angry.”
The Trump era has left so many people feeling just like this — angry all the time, so infuriated by the cruelty and the lies that we forget that the process of taking him down ought to fill us with joy.
To quote Molly Ivins again, “Keep fightin’ for freedom and justice, beloveds, but don’t you forget to have fun doin’ it. Lord, let your laughter ring forth. Be outrageous, ridicule the fraidy-cats, rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce. And when you get through kickin’ ass and celebratin’ the sheer joy of a good fight, be sure to tell those who come after how much fun it was.”
Hulk smash. But optimism and hope smash too. Why should we not be happy warriors, even as we prepare to battle our archnemesis?
You only live a short time. Enjoy every fleeting moment.

Texto completo: I don’t know about you, but the election results this week filled me with more hope than I’ve felt in years. It felt like somebody turning down the volume.
The angry and putrid shouting that has marked the last four years — and that would mark a Trump vs. Sanders campaign — might actually come to an end. Suddenly we got a glimpse of a world in which we can hear each other talk, in which actual governance can happen, in which gridlock can be avoided and actual change can come.
But the results carried a more portentous message as well. For those of us who believe in our political system, it’s put up or shut up time. The establishment gets one last chance.
If Joe Biden wins the nomination but loses to Donald Trump in the general election, young progressives will turn on the Democratic establishment with unprecedented fury. “See? We were right again!” they’ll say. And maybe they’ll have a point.
If Biden wins the White House but doesn’t deliver real benefits for disaffected working-class Trumpians and disillusioned young Bernie Bros, then the populist uprisings of 2024 will make the populist uprisings of today look genteel by comparison. “The system is rotten to the core,” they’ll say. “It’s time to burn it all down.”
Some people are saying a Biden presidency would be a restoration or a return to normalcy. He’ll be a calming Gerald Ford after the scandal of Richard Nixon.
But I don’t see how that could be. The politics of the last four years have taught us that tens of millions of Americans feel that their institutions have completely failed them. The legitimacy of the whole system is still hanging by a thread. The core truth of a Biden administration would be bring change or reap the whirlwind.
There would be no choice but to somehow pass his agenda: a climate plan, infrastructure spending, investments in the heartland, his $750 billion education plan and health care subsidies. If disaffected voters don’t see tangible changes in their lives over the next few years, it’s not that one party or another will lose the next election. The current political order will be upended by some future Bernie/Trump figure times 10.
This week’s results carried a few more lessons:
Democrats are not just a party; they’re a community. In my years of covering politics I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like what happened in the 48 hours after South Carolina — millions of Democrats from all around the country, from many different demographics, turning as one and arriving at a common decision.
It was like watching a flock of geese or a school of fish, seemingly leaderless, sensing some shift in conditions, sensing each other’s intuitions, and smoothly shifting direction en masse . A community is more than the sum of its parts. It is a shared sensibility and a pattern of response. This is a core Democratic strength.
Intersectionality is moderate . Campus radicals have always dreamed of building a rainbow coalition of all oppressed groups. But most black voters are less radical and more institutional than the campus radicals. They rarely prefer the same primary candidates.
If there’s any intersectionality it’s in the center. Moderate or mainstream Democrats like Biden, Clinton and Obama are the ones who put together rainbow coalitions: black, brown, white, suburban and working class.
The new Democrats are coming from the right. Bernie Sanders thought he could mobilize a new mass of young progressives. That did not happen. Young voters have made up a smaller share of the electorate in the primaries so far this year than in 2016 in almost every state, including Vermont.
Meanwhile there were astounding turnout surges in middle-class and affluent suburbs. Turnout was up by 76% in the Virginia suburbs around Washington, Richmond and parts of Norfolk. Turnout was up 49% overall in Texas. Many of these new voters must be disaffected Republicans who now consider themselves Democrats.
It’s still better to work the room than storm the barricades . Biden grew up in a political era in which politics was still about persuasion, not compulsion; building diverse coalitions, not just firing up your base. He’s been able to win over many of his former presidential rivals and cement a series of valuable alliances, especially with Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.
As Ezra Klein pointed out in Vox, Sanders tried to win over the Democratic Party by attacking the Democratic Party and treating its leaders with contempt. In fact, some Sanders surrogates are attacking Biden’s skill in building coalitions as a sign of evil elitism, as something only those nasty insiders do.
Biden’s wins this week, and his incredible polling surges in states like Florida that are soon to vote, make it likely that he will win and Sanders will lose this primary contest. But that doesn’t mean that legitimate crises that are driving the Sanders voters — or the legitimate crises that are driving Trump voters — will go away.
Their problems will still be all our problems. And if our current system can’t address them, then that system will be swept away.

Texto completo: For the first time, the LDS Church’s biggest investment fund has disclosed its Wall Street holdings, revealing $37.8 billion in stocks and mutual funds.
The federal filing may be the best answer ever to how The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has invested the excess tithing paid by its 16 million members. The detailed list included 1,659 stocks and mutual funds, including household names like Amazon, Chevron and Walmart, that the fund held for the quarter ending Dec. 31.
The investment fund, called Ensign Peak Advisors, quietly submitted the filing Feb. 14 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The stock portfolio appears to represent a large portion of the total value of Ensign Peak, which whistleblowing brothers Lars and David Nielsen said in a complaint sent to the IRS controls assets worth at least $100 billion.
The SEC filing is standard for “institutional investment managers” with assets of at least $100 million.
Ensign Peak Advisors has met that threshold for years, yet the SEC website shows this is the first time the fund has submitted such a filing.
The LDS Church, through a spokesman, declined to answer questions about the recent filing or why it wasn’t submitted before.
“They may have previously read the rules to exempt advisers to religious institutions, and are now disclosing in light of the recent controversy,” said Jeff Schwartz, a University of Utah professor who focuses on corporate and securities law and reviewed the filing for The Salt Lake Tribune.
This filing doesn’t encompass all of the church’s financial holdings. Some assets are held in shell companies that file separately.
In 2018, The Truth and Transparency Foundation, the nonprofit newsroom behind the former MormonLeaks site with a stated mission to disclose information about religions, said it had found 13 such shell companies with assets of $32 billion.
Apple to Zions
Ensign Peak Advisors itself is far larger and more diversified than any of those smaller funds, the Feb. 14 filing shows. About $3 billion of the Ensign Peak Advisors stock holdings — or 7% of the value reported in the filing — was almost evenly split between Apple and Microsoft stock.

Two-thirds of Ensign Peak Advisors’ reported stock holdings came from 100 companies or mutual funds. Of those 100, the plurality of the investment — 26% — was in the technology sector.
The next two biggest sectors were health care, including Johnson & Johnson and Merck stocks; and financial services — stocks such as Bank of America and Berkshire Hathaway.
There also were investments in two Utah-based companies.
The fund reported owning $91.8 million of stock in Zions Bank. That bank can trace its history to a bank founded in 1873 by LDS Church President Brigham Young. The church sold its majority stake in Zions in 1960.
Ensign Peak Advisors also owned $76.7 million of stock in Pluralsight, an online education company based in Farmington.
While the LDS Church owns for-profit insurance and personal investment businesses as well as radio stations and Salt Lake City’s NBC affiliate, KSL-Channel 5, Ensign Peak Advisors invested in those businesses’ competitors. It owned stock in SiriusXM, the three companies that combine to own the local ABC, CBS and FOX affiliates, and in The New York Times Co.
The church counsels its members to not consume tobacco, alcohol or hot caffeinated drinks. And the portfolio reflects that. There were no cigarette or beer manufacturers, nor was there an investment in a coffee chain, such as Starbucks.
Of the 30 companies that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Coca-Cola is the only one Ensign Peak Advisors did not invest in. The fund didn’t own stock in soda makers PepsiCo or Keurig Dr Pepper, either.
Caffeinated sodas are not part of the church’s health code, known as the Word of Wisdom.
Part of the picture
The SEC filing discloses only Ensign Peak Advisors’ holdings in publicly traded companies or funds, and such filings do not include investments in real property or private companies.
How the LDS Church plays the stock market has been the subject of speculation for decades. After the church in 2018 expressed opposition to medical cannabis, for example, some online forums wondered if the reticence was influenced by church investments in pharmaceutical companies that sell opioids.
Roger Clarke, the head of Ensign Peak Advisors, told The Wall Street Journal last month that one reason for the shell companies was to make church investments harder to track so that parishioners with insufficient information didn’t mismanage their own portfolios by trying to mimic what Ensign Peak Advisors was doing. The Journal reported that the fund also owns Florida timberland and investments in big hedge funds.
D. Michael Quinn, a historian who has focused on LDS Church finances, said it’s no surprise the church invests in blue chips stocks. But the specifics offered in the SEC filing represent a milestone for an institution that has been famously secretive about its money.
“It’s great detail that we haven’t had before,” Quinn said, “but it’s only part of the picture.”
Quinn says Ensign Peak Advisors is just one of the church’s investment firms. There are other firms working on both the nonprofit and for-profit sides of the church that combine to handle even more money than the $100 billion Ensign Peak Advisors is said to be worth.
As to Clarke’s concern, Quinn suspects only journalists, academics and historians will be interested in studying the portfolio. He doubts rank-and-file Latter-day Saints will refer to the SEC document for investment advice.
“Members of the church don’t need to do extensive research to invest in blue chip stocks,” Quinn said.
Schwartz, the law professor, believes any penalty Ensign Peak Advisors might face for failing to file a quarterly report until now would be light by the standards of a multibillion-dollar fund. He found one case in which an investment firm failed to file the necessary reports for three years. The SEC issued a fine of $100,000.
“It doesn’t seem like there would be huge penalties,” Schwartz said.
If Ensign Peak continues issuing quarterly reports, the next one would be available on the SEC website in mid-May.
The Nielsen brothers’ complaint, first reported by The Washington Post, drew international attention to the church’s financial interests and shocked many outsiders and members of the faith. The brothers argued that the church was violating tax laws by not spending more of this reserve on charitable purposes.
The church’s governing First Presidency — made up of church President Russell M. Nelson and his counselors, Dallin H. Oaks and Henry B. Eyring — rejected that allegation in a news release, saying the faith “complies with all applicable law governing our donations, investments, taxes and reserves.”
Other Latter-day Saint officials later said they didn’t previously disclose how big the financial reserve had grown because they didn’t want to discourage members from tithing, which is donating 10% of one’s income to the faith.
The church collects that tithing, which it uses to run its operations around the world, and it sends the excess to Ensign Peak Advisors to invest.
Church officials have called the fund a “rainy-day account” to help pay for operations in poorer parts of the world — such as Africa, where the faith is booming — and at some future time when member donations stagnate.

Michelle Goldberg: Trump’s calamitous coronavirus response

Texto completo: Last month, after analyzing figures on epidemics since 1960, The Economist concluded that people die at a higher rate from such disease outbreaks in authoritarian countries than in democratic ones, even controlling for income levels.
This might seem counterintuitive. Autocratic societies have an easier time imposing strict behavioral limits than democratic ones; it’s hard to imagine Italy locking down Milan the way China closed off Wuhan. Without the messy deliberations of democracy, certain kinds of infrastructure can be scaled up much more quickly. “In Norway, one of the most democratic countries in the world, lawmakers have been debating the location of a new 200-bed hospital for seven years,” according to the article in The Economist. “In China, a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat coronavirus patients was recently built in just ten days.”
But democratic countries are far better than authoritarian ones at fact-based policymaking and at sharing the truth with the public. “Non-democratic societies often restrict the flow of information and persecute perceived critics,” The Economist piece noted. We’ve seen this in China. As Li Yuan wrote of coronavirus in The Times last month, “As the virus spread, officials in Wuhan and around the country withheld critical information, played down the threat and rebuked doctors who tried to raise the alarm.”
Unfortunately, you could substitute “Washington, D.C.” for “Wuhan” in that sentence and it would be equally true. So far, Donald Trump’s response to coronavirus combines the worst features of autocracy and of democracy, mixing opacity and propaganda with leaderless inefficiency.
From the beginning, Trump minimized the scale of the crisis, portraying it as a purely foreign threat that could be addressed by closing borders. At a Feb. 26 news conference, he claimed there were 15 cases in America, omitting those diagnosed overseas. “The 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero,” he said. As of Friday morning, there have been more than 230 cases confirmed across the country and 14 deaths.
Trump dismissed Democratic complaints about his handling of the crisis as “their new hoax.” Last week Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s acting chief of staff, told the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference that the media is paying so much attention to coronavirus “because they think this is what’s going to be what brings down the president.” Speaking to Sean Hannity on Wednesday night, Trump seemed to imply that it was OK for people with coronavirus to go to work: “So if, you know, we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better, just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work but they get better.” (He later wrote an angry tweet saying he’d never said sick people should go to work, but he certainly didn’t instruct them to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice and stay home.)
Within the administration, there’s strong pressure not to contradict Trump’s line. In February, when Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned that community spread of coronavirus in America was inevitable, the president was reportedly furious, and the director of the CDC said she misspoke. Pro-Trump media figures like Rush Limbaugh suggested that she was part of an anti-Trump conspiracy because her brother is former Justice Department official Rod Rosenstein, often derided on the right as part of the Deep State.
The Times reported that Defense Secretary Mark Esper has warned the military not to make decisions related to Coronavirus that might “run afoul of President Trump’s messaging,” even as leaders have to make quick judgments about protecting troops stationed in countries with outbreaks. A Pentagon spokesperson took issue with the Times story, calling it a “dishonest misrepresentation.” Still, it seems as if in the midst of this burgeoning crisis, we’re seeing a coordinated, whole-of-government campaign to protect the president from being contradicted.
Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a vice dean at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and author of “The Public Health Crisis Survival Guide,” told me that, reviewing the history of such crises, “One of the huge lessons is: Don’t politicize the communications. You really need credible communicators who people believe.” Trump is the opposite of that. At least half the country distrusts him, and he’s ensured that a good part of the other half distrusts actual experts.
But if this administration is incapable of the basic honesty one expects from officials in a democracy, it also can’t pull off autocratic, top-down coordination. It has utterly failed to ramp up sufficient testing capacity; on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence admitted, “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.”
As I write this, the Grand Princess, a ship carrying thousands of people, is stuck off the coast of San Francisco after a former passenger who had disembarked died of COVID-19, the disease that this coronavirus causes. According to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, 11 passengers and 10 crew members are showing signs of the illness, and Newsom said that number may “significantly understate” the severity of the outbreak onboard. This comes after last month’s disastrous attempt to quarantine people aboard another cruise ship owned by the same company, the Diamond Princess, off the coast of Japan. In the end, 705 people were infected on that boat.
Researchers concluded that if people had been quickly taken off the Diamond Princess, the infection rate would have been only one-eighth as high. Nevertheless, DHS official Ken Cuccinelli told a Senate committee on Thursday that the ship off California can’t be evacuated because U.S. health care facilities lack the capacity to quarantine its passengers. Therefore, at least for now, the Diamond Princess experiment is being run again.
Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of the foreign disaster assistance program at USAID who helped manage the response to Ebola during Barack Obama’s presidency, said a competent administration would have had a contingency plan for a repeat of the Diamond Princess debacle. “It’s one thing to be the first one to make a mistake,” he told me. “It’s pretty different to be the second one to make the same mistake.” He added, “To say we’ve got no way to bring these people off the cruise ship is extraordinary to me.”
Extraordinary, but perhaps not surprising. “It’s like a Xerox copy of Puerto Rico,” Konyndyk said, comparing the administration’s coronavirus response to its mismanagement of Hurricane Maria’s aftermath. Trump’s presidency has caused manifold catastrophes, but so far, most Americans have not seen them up close. That might be about to change. Trump spent much of Thursday afternoon congratulating himself on Twitter for his coronavirus response. If things get really bad, maybe he’ll toss us a few rolls of paper towels.

Rich Lowry: The candidate of the nonbelievers

Texto completo: Once upon a time, Bernie Sanders would have had another political vulnerability besides his socialism — namely, his atheism.
In 2016, a Democratic National Committee staffer had to apologize after the WikiLeaks hack exposed an email he wrote that suggested using Bernie’s atheism against him in the primary.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" />
This year, Bernie’s religion, or lack of it, has barely made a ripple or even occasioned any comment. It used to be expected that serious presidential candidates would have religious faith and discuss it, in keeping with the religious coloration of the country they sought to govern. Just as the taboo against openly socialist candidates has given way, so has the old norm about religiosity eroded nearly to the vanishing point.
Sanders, a secular Jew, doesn’t call himself an atheist. The way he puts it is that he’s “not actively involved with organized religion,” and that he believes in God, just not in a traditional matter.
“To me,” he has said of his religion, “it means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together.”
Asked by Jimmy Kimmel whether he believes in God, he said, “I am what I am. And what I believe in, and what my spirituality is about, is that we’re all in this together.”
Functionally, this means his religion is indistinguishable from the vision of solidarity undergirding his socialist politics.
Indeed, the connection to Israel that Sanders touts to prove that he is not anti-Israel had much more to do with a political commitment rather than a religious one.
He lived for a time on a kibbutz in 1963 as a guest of a secular, socialist youth movement. According to The New York Times, the kibbutz “saw the Soviet Union as a model, and often flew the red flag at outdoor events.” Sanders told a publication called Jewish Currents that “it was there that I saw and experienced for myself many of the progressive values upon which Israel was founded.”
His brother said of Bernie in a 2016 Washington Post interview that “he is quite substantially not religious.”
This makes Sanders an outlier in American life, but less of one than he used to be. According to the Pew Research Center, 26% of Americans say that they are atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular,” up from 17% in 2009. The growth of the religiously unaffiliated can be seen across all demographic groups and regions, but is especially pronounced among young people who are, of course, disproportionately Bernie supporters. Only 35% of millennials attend religious services weekly or once or twice a month, while 64% attend a few times a year, seldom or never.
The nonreligious are Bernie’s base. A Pew survey in January found that Joe Biden’s most supportive religious group was black Protestants at 44%, followed by white Catholics and white evangelicals at 37% each. Bernie’s best groups were agnostics (36%), atheists (30%) and the unaffiliated (28%).
In New Hampshire, Sanders lost to Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg among voters who attend religious services once a week or more and won among voters who never attend. A rare bright spot for Bernie in South Carolina was beating Biden among voters who never attend church, 36% to 24%.
There’s no rule that presidents have to be believers, or Thomas Jefferson never would have occupied the office. But presidential religiosity has advantages. Bill Clinton used it to signal to otherwise politically hostile parts of the county that he understood their values. It fortified George W. Bush under incredible pressure during the war on terror. Barack Obama tapped the rhetorical power of church oratory.
The Sanders phenomenon is another indication of the weakening of American exceptionalism. When the social scientist Seymour Martin Lipset wrote about it decades ago, he underlined American religiosity and resistance to socialism. If he captures the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders will test how much either still matters or applies.

The recent New York Times article “The Struggle to Mend America’s Rural Roads” used Wisconsin as a microcosm for the infrastructure crisis that either directly or indirectly affects all Americans.
(There was supposed to be a hastily called roundtable meeting about the situation last week, but the roundtable bounced out of Bob’s truck and was last seen rolling through a flock of sheep on its way to a watery grave in Simpson’s Swamp.)
Personally, I’m tickled with the job the county road department does with my own stretch of country road. But for people in many states and localities, broken axles, wrecked suspension systems, busted tires, emergency road closings and unpredictable weight limits for aging bridges are an ever-looming danger. Shoppers, commuters, tourists, farmers and truckers hauling the nation’s food supply are all at the mercy of substandard rural roads.
The normal life span of an asphalt road is 30 years, but many rural roads have been in service for more than 75 years. (“Wow! Since the time of Plymouth Rock!” OK, history teachers need more money, too.)
Unfortunately, road construction and maintenance do not come cheap. Reconstructing a mile of road costs $300,000; even chip sealing (a kind of short-term patching) costs $17,000 a mile. Some officeholders are better at keeping costs down than others. (“I’m the county mayor, and I brought a big stack of coupons to negotiate with! And I just turned 62. What kind of senior discounts on asphalt have you been hiding up your sleeve?”)
All federal, state and local agencies must make hard decisions about finite resources, but some places are less ashamed of their stinginess than others. (“Yes, we are a proud pothole sanctuary state.”)
Many urbanites — unable to see past their subways and other forms of mass transit — demonstrate a dismaying lack of empathy for fellow Americans who live in “flyover country.” (“I didn’t force them to live in the boonies. Granted, I’ve tried to force them to stop exploiting the vultures that eat roadkill, but I didn’t force them to live in the boonies.”)
Yes, many people treat rural drivers like second-class citizens. But as Shakespeare’s Shylock observed, “If you prick me, do I not bleed? If I meet you on a narrow road and you force me too far over against the crumbling shoulder, do I not plunge to a fiery death?”)
To be sure, open-minded city-dwellers can visit the hinterlands and really “click” with the locals and their needs. Their hearts are in the right place. (Or maybe their hearts have shifted to the lower intestine region after hitting one bump too many.)
But even the most sympathetic visitors know that whatever state or federal funding might materialize, the answer must start with the people directly affected. And locals can be reluctant to disrupt the status quo by opening their wallets wider. As John Denver sang, “Country roads, take me home — unless there’s a big tax bill waiting in the mailbox!”
Still, I hope the Times article will reignite a long-stalled national discussion of the seen and unseen costs of deteriorating infrastructure. People from all regions, all income levels, all political persuasions must put their petty differences aside, roll up their sleeves and brainstorm solutions.
As Prof. Emmett Brown from “Back to the Future” might have said, “Bipartisanship? Where we’re going, we don’t need bipartisanship! Ka-thump ka-thump crash! Aiiiieeeee!”

Texto completo: MADRID – La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ha confirmado este sábado que ya son más 101,927 el número de contagiados por el nuevo coronavirus y ha alertado de que la mayoría de los nuevos casos se han registrado fuera de China.
Así, hay 21,114 casos confirmados en 93 países ajenos a China tras un incremento de 3,633 casos con respecto al viernes. En cambio, en China se han registrado solo 102 nuevos casos.
En cuanto a los fallecidos, hay 78 muertos en total fuera de China, con lo que la enfermedad ya suma 413 víctimas mortales, según los datos proporcionados por la OMS.
Colombia, el Vaticano, Perú, Togo y Eslovaquia son algunos de los países que se han sumado a la lista en las últimas 24 horas, mientras que en los casos de Islandia, Palestina y Camerún han pasado del listado de países con “solo casos importados” al de “contagio local”. En esta última clasificación están ya 46 países.

Los Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades de Estados Unidos (CDC) han confirmado este sábado 377 casos del nuevo coronavirus en todo el país, 49 de los cuales corresponden a ciudadanos repatriados de Wuhan (3) y del crucero ‘Diamond Princess’ (46). En cuanto a los fallecidos, son ya 17 los casos confirmados, hasta las 4 p.m. del viernes.
Varios medios nacionales como el New York Times o la cadena CNN dan cuenta de entre 370 y 400, en una contabilidad en la que además de las cifras de los CDC, añaden los datos distribuidos por los diferentes gobiernos estatales.
El estado más afectado es el de Washington (noroeste) con 86 casos confirmados, seguido de California, con 79, y Texas, con 19. En los demás estados los casos confirmados son mínimos.

Brooks: Biden’s rise is a last chance for the establishment

Texto completo: I don’t know about you, but the election results this week filled me with more hope than I’ve felt in years. It felt like somebody turning down the volume.
The angry and putrid shouting that has marked the last four years — and that would mark a Trump vs. Sanders campaign — might actually come to an end. Suddenly we got a glimpse of a world in which we can hear each other talk, in which actual governance can happen, in which gridlock can be avoided and actual change can come.
But the results carried a more portentous message as well. For those of us who believe in our political system, it’s put up or shut up time. The establishment gets one last chance.
If Joe Biden wins the nomination but loses to Donald Trump in the general election, young progressives will turn on the Democratic establishment with unprecedented fury. “See? We were right again!” they’ll say. And maybe they’ll have a point.
If Biden wins the White House but doesn’t deliver real benefits for disaffected working-class Trumpians and disillusioned young Bernie Bros, then the populist uprisings of 2024 will make the populist uprisings of today look genteel by comparison. “The system is rotten to the core,” they’ll say. “It’s time to burn it all down.”
Some people are saying a Biden presidency would be a restoration or a return to normalcy. He’ll be a calming Gerald Ford after the scandal of Richard Nixon.
But I don’t see how that could be. The politics of the last four years have taught us that tens of millions of Americans feel that their institutions have completely failed them. The legitimacy of the whole system is still hanging by a thread. The core truth of a Biden administration would be bring change or reap the whirlwind.
There would be no choice but to somehow pass his agenda: a climate plan, infrastructure spending, investments in the heartland, his $750 billion education plan and health care subsidies. If disaffected voters don’t see tangible changes in their lives over the next few years, it’s not that one party or another will lose the next election. The current political order will be upended by some future Bernie/Trump figure times 10.
This week’s results carried a few more lessons:
— Democrats are not just a party; they’re a community. In my years of covering politics I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like what happened in the 48 hours after South Carolina — millions of Democrats from all around the country, from many different demographics, turning as one and arriving at a common decision.
It was like watching a flock of geese or a school of fish, seemingly leaderless, sensing some shift in conditions, sensing each other’s intuitions, and smoothly shifting direction en masse. A community is more than the sum of its parts. It is a shared sensibility and a pattern of response. This is a core Democratic strength.
— Intersectionality is moderate. Campus radicals have always dreamed of building a rainbow coalition of all oppressed groups. But most black voters are less radical and more institutional than the campus radicals. They rarely prefer the same primary candidates.
If there’s any intersectionality it’s in the center. Moderate or mainstream Democrats like Biden, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are the ones who put together rainbow coalitions: black, brown, white, suburban and working class.
— The new Democrats are coming from the right. Bernie Sanders thought he could mobilize a new mass of young progressives. That did not happen. Young voters have made up a smaller share of the electorate in the primaries so far this year than in 2016 in almost every state, including Vermont.
Meanwhile there were astounding turnout surges in middle-class and affluent suburbs. Turnout was up by 76% in the Virginia suburbs around Washington, Richmond and parts of Norfolk. Turnout was up 49% overall in Texas. Many of these new voters must be disaffected Republicans who now consider themselves Democrats.
— It’s still better to work the room than storm the barricades. Biden grew up in a political era in which politics was still about persuasion, not compulsion; building diverse coalitions, not just firing up your base. He’s been able to win over many of his former presidential rivals and cement a series of valuable alliances, especially with Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.
As Ezra Klein pointed out in Vox, Sanders tried to win over the Democratic Party by attacking the Democratic Party and treating its leaders with contempt. In fact, some Sanders surrogates are attacking Biden’s skill in building coalitions as a sign of evil elitism, as something only those nasty insiders do.
Biden’s wins this week, and his incredible polling surges in states like Florida that are soon to vote, make it likely that he will win and Sanders will lose this primary contest. But that doesn’t mean that legitimate crises that are driving the Sanders voters — or the legitimate crises that are driving Trump voters — will go away.
Their problems will still be all our problems. And if our current system can’t address them, then that system will be swept away.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun Expresses Regret Over Criticisms of Leadership and Predecessor; He tells executives they have his support despite sometimes harsh comments

Texto completo: Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told executives that he regretted voicing criticisms of the company's leadership and former CEO in an interview with the New York Times this past week.
Mr. Calhoun, who started as CEO in January, is dealing with the fallout of his candid assessment of Boeing's problems, telling executives they have his support despite sometimes harsh comments published in the article.
"I am both embarrassed and regretful about the article," Mr. Calhoun wrote in a message addressed to Boeing senior leaders, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. "It suggests I broke my promise to former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, the executive team and our people that I would have their back when it counted most. I want to reassure you that my promise remains intact."
Mr. Calhoun, who served on Boeing's board about a decade before being appointed CEO, had vowed to make a fresh start for the beleaguered company. He has said he planned to focus on rebuilding trust in the company and being more transparent.
Boeing has been in crisis since two of its 737 MAX planes crashed within a five-month period, killing 346 people. The MAX has been grounded world-wide since last March and Boeing had to shut down production of the plane earlier this year. The crashes have drawn scrutiny of the plane maker's engineering culture, and damaged the company's relationships with suppliers, customers, and regulators.
In a preliminary report released Friday, House investigators said production pressures, faulty assumptions, and a "culture of concealment," combined with insufficient federal safety oversight, led to the two crashes. Separately, in Boeing's latest reported production lapse, the FAA on Friday proposed a $19.7 million penalty against the company for installing unapproved sensors on hundreds of planes, including some MAX jets. A Boeing spokesman said the company has done a thorough internal review and implemented changes to address the FAA's concerns.
Mr. Calhoun told the New York Times that the challenges he is facing are more than he'd anticipated, according to the March 5 article.
"And it speaks to the weaknesses of our leadership," he said.
He said his predecessor, Mr. Muilenburg, may have increased production of the 737 MAX too quickly at the expense of quality. Mr. Calhoun suggested that Mr. Muilenburg had been chasing a higher share price, according to the article.
"I'll never be able to judge what motivated Dennis, whether it was a stock price that was going to continue to go up and up, or whether it was just beating the other guy to the next rate increase," Mr. Calhoun said, adding that the board had trusted Mr. Muilenburg and his proven record of taking risks that had paid off.
Mr. Muilenburg couldn't be reached for comment.
Mr. Calhoun publicly expressed support for Mr. Muilenburg in the months leading up to his removal in December, but the board eventually became frustrated with Mr. Muilenburg's overly optimistic projections and convinced that he had mismanaged the company's relationship with the Federal Aviation Administration, potentially complicating the plane's return to service, people familiar with the matter have said.
Mr. Calhoun had become more engaged in managing the company after being made chairman in October, when the board stripped Mr. Muilenburg of that role, but has sought to draw a clean break from the company's past missteps .
"I watched the same movie you did—I think I was in the front-row seat, and I might come to exactly the same conclusions you do," Mr. Calhoun said in a call with reporters in January. "My leadership role here at Boeing is intended to make changes that correct a lot of those situations."
A Boeing spokesman said Mr. Calhoun wanted to provide Boeing executives with more context about what he had said in the interview.
"It is important to Dave that his teammates have a full understanding of his views and the context they were given in," a Boeing spokesman said. "And like many interviews, not everything makes it into the story, and Dave wanted to share some of the points he made about the good work of our team and the strength of our portfolio of products and services."
In the message Friday, Mr. Calhoun said that he had wanted to speak candidly about the company's challenges, but hadn't intended to undermine its current leadership team. He said that he was invested in Mr. Muilenburg's success, and that the disappointments he discussed in the interview mostly related to the company's failure to return the plane to service going into the fourth quarter.
"Now is not the time to look behind us. I regret doing it. Now is the time to look forward and build on our foundation," he wrote.
Mr. Calhoun said he maintained his commitment to being more transparent.
"I have said that transparency is a messy process but worth it in the end, and I still believe it."

Resumen: Made in 2011 by director Steven Soderbergh with an all-star cast, 'Contagion' is scary but packs a vital message about importance of precautions.

Texto completo: After watching "Contagion," you won't need a public health official to tell you to wash your hands often, reports the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.
The 2011 movie will scare you into soap and water. It makes that precaution seem as urgent as the inevitable moment in a horror film when viewers want to yell at the screen, "Get out of the house. . . now!"
The coronavirus outbreak has turned life in 2020 into a nervous waiting game for updates. What's the latest headline? Which events have been cancelled? Why aren't there enough test kits? How many states have declared an emergency?
This week, even James Bond went into quarantine, so to speak. The release of the 007 movie "No Time To Die" was moved from April to November over worries about theater closings in Italy, South Korea, China and Japan — all countries hit hard by COVID-19, the abbreviated name for the virus.
Anxiety is rising. So is the number of people watching "Contagion," a well-crafted drama that until recently was relatively forgotten. It's become a hot rental at online sites like Amazon Prime and iTunes.
Why is everyone so eager to see something that is guaranteed to freak them out? Maybe it's the lure of facing your nightmares. As director Barry Jenkins ("Moonlight") told the New York Times, "I was really curious to see how well it would line up to what is happening right now, It was shocking. It felt like I was watching a documentary that has all these movie stars playing real people. ”
Nowhere is that more evident than in a scene where CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta — yes, the real guy did a cameo — is interviewing a Centers for Disease Control expert played by Laurence Fishburne.
"Our best defense has been social distancing, no handshaking, staying home when you're sick, washing your hands frequently," says Fishburne.
That sounds like a clip from every cable news channel right this minute.
Art imitates life so closely in such sequences that you may wonder if the rest of the movie is going to come true That's a frightening prospect, because the screenplay by Scott Z. Burns envisions catastrophic loss.
More: Preparing for an outbreak: What everyone needs to know about novel coronavirus
But "Contagion" is fiction, and the coronavirus, as bad as it's been, hasn't reached the devastation levels of the movie's imaginary MEV-1 virus.
In real life, COVID-19, first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has resulted globally in nearly 100,000 cases and more than 3,300 deaths. So far in America, over 200 cases have been confirmed, with 14 deaths linked to the virus (but there are concerns about undiagnosed cases due to early coronavirus test shortages).
In the film, the MEV-1 virus is unleashed in Minneapolis by Gwyneth Paltrow's character after a business trip to Hong Kong. Within a month, the death toll in America is at 2. 5 million. The worldwide total reaches 26 million.
The coronavirus puts the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions at the most risk. The movie's virus hits the old, young and middle-aged like a freight train. Spoiler alert: Paltrow's death in the first 20 minutes or so reveals this is no ordinary flu.
"Contagion" is a worst-case scenario with an A-list cast. Matt Damon portrays Paltrow's husband, an everyman dad struggling to hold things together for his teenage daughter. Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and Marion Cotillard play dedicated public health experts. Jude Law is intense and reckless as a conspiracy-chasing blogger, while Jennifer Ehle is equally impulsive, but in a heroic way, as a CDC laboratory scientist racing to find a vaccine.
Soderbergh's nine-year-old movie is a master class in creating suspense out of inanimate objects. Early on, Paltrow's character sits in a Chicago airport bar, coughing as she waits for a delayed flight. The camera pans to all the places her germs are spreading: the bowl of nuts that she's been eating from, the credit card she hands to the bartender, the machine where the card is swiped.
Remember how "Jaws" kept you out of the water? "Contagion" makes an equally fierce case for not touching your face — or anything, really.
As clues pop up in Hong Kong, London, and Tokyo that a pandemic is emerging, Fishburne and his CDC team must scramble to identify and contain the virus. They track clusters of infections at health clubs and elementary schools and, in Winslet's case, put their own lives at risk by traveling to investigate the sites.
Meanwhile, rumors multiply that the virus is actually a military or industrial weapon. Law touts a natural cure, forsythia, on his blog without any solid proof, then brags about having 12 million unique visitors to his website. One of the movie's more gratifying scenes is when a veteran scientist played by Elliott Gould blasts Law's careless journalistic standards. "Blogging is not writing," barks Gould. "It's graffiti with punctuation. "
"Contagion" floats many plot twists that echo what is known about COVID-19, like its connecting the origin of the fictional virus to bats and pigs. Recently, in real life, China banned the wildlife trade over suspicions that exotic animal infected humans.
In the movie, a National Guard armory is turned into a vast triage center for bed-ridden patients. In real-world Wuhan, China, where COVID-19 was first detected, two hospitals were constructed in a little over a week's time to deal with the crisis
Yet "Contagion" takes things to awful extremes. At various points in the story, rioting and looting breaks out for food and supplies. Quarantines and curfews are enacted in cities. A grieving Damon can't find a funeral home that will take his wife's body. Eventually, mass graves are necessary to deal with the fatalities.
"Contagion" feels overwhelming, but don't mistake it for a guidebook. It's just a creative exercise that carries a powerful message about fighting fear with knowledge.
The movie will convince you that the more facts you have, the better off you are. Now is the time to prepare. Learn what preventive measures you should be taking. Seek information from legitimate sources and avoid the unproven theories and scams littering social media.
This is serious stuff, and it's not over yet, not by a long shot. You don't need to sit through "Contagion" to know that. But it is one heck of a reminder to keep washing your hands.

Texto completo: There have been over 100,000 cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide, and the virus has killed more than 3,400 people. Confirmed cases in the United States have risen past 300, the New York Times reported Saturday.
The situation is constantly changing. Here’s the latest.
1. Two Connecticut hospital employees have tested positive for the virus.
A New York resident who works in Danbury and Norwalk hospitals has tested positive for COVID-19, officials announced Friday.
That marks Connecticut’s first confirmed case. But no Connecticut residents have tested positive for the virus, according to a release from Governor Ned Lamont.
The patient, who is now self-isolated in New York, contracted the disease after being exposed to the virus in Westchester County, Lamont said.
The employee worked in an isolated part of the hospital, according to Kerry Eaton, Chief Operating Officer of Nuvance Health, the hospitals’ parent company. Other employees who had contact with the patient have been furloughed for two weeks, Eaton said.
“We have been expecting exposure of this virus in Connecticut for several weeks, so its presence should not surprise anybody. This is no cause for panic or anxiety as our public health officials and medical experts have been making every effort to put every precaution possible in place,” Lamont said.
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) released a statement Saturday about the confirmed case.
“We always knew it was a matter of when, not if, the COVID-19 would touch Connecticut. As we continue to monitor possible exposures related to a hospital worker — I stand ready to do everything I can at the federal level to make sure the governor and Connecticut's state and local health officials have all the resources they need to contain and stop the spread of the coronavirus in Connecticut,” he said.
A second employee working at Bridgeport Hospital has tested positive for coronavirus while nine more patients in Connecticut are being tested for the disease. Both cases have been traced back to an outbreak in New Rochelle, New York.
At a Saturday press conference, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency that allows additional resources for local health departments to deal with the outbreak.
2. 11 tests are pending, 42 came back negative
By Friday evening, the state Department of Public Health had tested 42 people in Connecticut for COVID-19, and all of the tests came back negative, Lamont announced in his release.
11 cases were still pending, he said.
The state has one test kit, which has the capacity to test around 600 people. Lamont requested more tests in a letter to the CDC, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Friday his delegation was writing in support of the request.

Connecticut is currently testing those who have shown symptoms of the virus and traveled to a country where the outbreak is more acute, officials told Lamont in a Thursday briefing.
But there may be one more option for folks to get tested: two private labs, Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, would begin processing coronavirus tests, the companies announced Thursday.
3. Connecticut is monitoring at least 200 people for COVID-19
Although the state has only tested several dozen for the virus, it is monitoring some 200 individuals for COVID-19, health officials told Lamont Thursday.
Those monitored were asked to self-quarantine for two weeks.
There are likely cases in Connecticut that have gone unconfirmed because of limited testing, officials have said.
Hearst Connecticut Media reporters Emilie Munson, Ben Lambert, Kaitlyn Krasselt, Katrina Koerting and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

Head to middle school and space with March readings

Texto completo: For a self-described “dork,” Nikki Maxwell sure has a lot of followers.
Over the past decade, the middle-school protagonist of Rachel Renée Russell’s blockbuster “Dork Diaries” series has starred in more than a dozen books that collectively have sold 45 million copies in more than 40 different languages.
Russell will be in Austin this week with “Dork Diaries 14: Tales From a Not-So-Best-Friend Forever” (Simon & Schuster/Aladdin, $13.99). She’ll be at BookPeople at 11 a.m. Sunday along with her daughter, Nikki, who now illustrates the books and whose middle-school years partially inspired the series.
“Tales” follows Nikki and her bandmates as they plan for an exciting summer on tour opening for the band Bad Boyz. But Nikki’s nemesis, school snob MacKenzie, manages to score a spot on the tour as its social media intern. Worse, MacKenzie will be Nikki’s roommate throughout the tour. Or, as Russell might write in the distinctive mix of chatty all-caps, traditional text and illustration that marks her diary-based series, WORSE!!! (Ages 8-12)
The “Dork Diaries” event is one of just several noteworthy author appearances this month in the Austin area. On
March 13, Patrice Caldwell will be at Lark and Owl Booksellers in Georgetown with her new anthology, “A Phoenix First Must Burn” (Viking/Penguin, $18.99). Billed as “Beyoncé’s ‘Lemonade’ meets Octavia Butler,” the collection’s 16 short stories share threads of science fiction, fantasy and magic, focusing on black women and gender-nonconforming individuals.
Caldwell is a Fort Worth native who founded People of Color in Publishing and edited children’s books before turning to writing. The authors collected in “Phoenix” include luminaries such as National Book Award and Carnegie Medal winner Elizabeth Acevedo (“The Poet X”) and National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi (“American Street,” “Pride”) as well as emerging writers.
“Raised on a diet of ‘Twilight Zone,’ ’Star Trek’ and ‘Star Wars,’ I preferred to create and explore fictional universes than live in my real one,” Caldwell explains in her introduction. “But whenever I went to the children’s section of the library to discover more tales, the novels featuring characters who looked like me were rooted in pain set amid slavery, share-cropping, or segregation. Those narratives are important, yes. But because they were the only ones offered, I started to wonder, ’Where is my fantasy, my future? Why don’t black people exist in speculative worlds?’”
Caldwell will appear with anthology contributor Karen Strong, the author of “Just South of Home,” which was named one of the best middle-grade books of 2019 by industry journal Kirkus Reviews. The event begins at 6:30 p.m. at Lark and Owl, 205 W. Sixth St., Georgetown.
Can’t make it on March 13? Caldwell will also showcase “Phoenix” at BookPeople on April 11 at 2 p.m. (Ages 12 and older)
Later this month, Austin author Christina Soontornvat (“Diary of an Ice Princess”) reinvents Victor Hugo’s “Les Misérables” for middle-graders with the thought-provoking “A Wish in the Dark” (Candlewick, $17.99), set in the Thai-inspired world of Chattana. Her story focuses on a young prison escapee, Pong, and Nok, the warden’s daughter, who chases Pong.
“Dark” explores class and privilege through these characters in a propulsive story with magical elements. Soontornvat — whose first picture book, the counting-themed “The Blunders” (Candlewick, $16.99), published last month — will discuss and sign “Wish” at BookPeople at 2 p.m. March 29. (Ages 8-12)
Chris Barton story time and more appearances
Fans of Austin author Chris Barton’s 2010 picture book “Shark Vs. Train” have a new matchup to ponder: “Fire Truck Vs. Dragon” (Little, Brown, $17.99). The powers of fire and water occupy center stage in this story that travels to a camp-out, a birthday party and more, inverting expectations with Barton’s words and Shanda McCloskey’s energetic illustrations. “Fire Truck vs. Dragon” arrives on shelves Tuesday, and Barton will be at BookPeople at 10:30 a.m. March 14 for a read-aloud storytime. (Ages 4-8) … New York Times-bestselling young adult author Ally Carter brings her first middle-grade tale to Austin with “Winterborne Home for Vengeance and Valor” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $16.99), a fast-paced, funny mystery. Carter appears at 2 p.m. Sunday. (Ages 8-12) … David Levithan offers a varied selection of love-fueled tales in “19 Love Songs” (Knopf, $17.99), a young adult exploration of love both requited and thwarted. Many of the selections feature gay men; the collection includes stories with characters from Levithan’s bestselling fiction, including 2013’s “Two Boys Kissing.” Levithan will be at BookPeople at 7 p.m. Tuesday. (Ages 14 and older)

Obama took action on swine flu

Texto completo: Asked about reassuring Americans about the coronavirus, President Donald Trump downplayed the number of people stricken, then went on the attack.
Without mentioning President Barack Obama, Trump criticized the Obama’s administration response to another outbreak — H1N1, commonly known as swine flu.
Trump made the attack during an interview on March 4, 2020, with Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity:
Hannity: “You have said that you are evaluating (the coronavirus) on a daily basis. ... What are we prepared as a country to do to keep our citizens safe?”
Trump: “Well, I just say that it’s, you know, a very, very small number in this country. And we’re going to try and keep it that way as much as possible. I will say, though, the H1N1 — that was swine flu, commonly referred to as swine flu — and that went from around April of ‘09 to April of ‘10, where there were 60 million cases of swine flu. And over — actually, it’s over 13,000. I think you might have said 17—. I had heard it was 13—, but a lot of — a lot of deaths. And they didn’t do anything about it.”
We wanted to fact-check Trump’s claim that the Obama administration “didn’t do anything” as millions of swine flu cases mounted.
The Trump campaign didn’t respond to our requests for information.
Swine flu outbreak
The H1N1 influenza virus was discovered in the United States in the spring of 2009 and spread around the world.
It was originally referred to as “swine flu” because many genes in the virus were similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America.
From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, in the United States, there were 60.8 million cases of swine flu, as well as 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated.
Obama’s acting director of health and human services declared H1N1 a public health emergency on April 26, 2009. That was when the United States had only 20 confirmed cases of H1N1 and no deaths.
Two days later, the administration made an initial funding request for H1N1 to Congress.
Eventually $7.65 billion was allocated for a vaccine and other measures.
On Oct. 24, 2009, six months after his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency, Obama declared it a national emergency.
By then, H1N1 had claimed more than 1,000 American lives, according to the CDC.
When Obama made his declaration, thousands of people were lining up in cities across the country to receive vaccinations, as federal officials acknowledged that their vaccination program had gotten off to a slow start, with some states having requested 10 times the amount they had been allotted, the New York Times reported at the time.
The national emergency declaration allowed the federal government to temporarily waive or modify requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children’s Health Insurance programs. It also permitted doctors and hospitals to bypass certain requirements as they responded to H1N1.
Our ruling
Trump said: “There were 60 million cases of swine flu” during the Obama administration “and they didn’t do anything about it.”
His assessment on the nation’s response is incorrect. The Obama administration issued two emergency declarations, triggering billions of dollars in spending toward vaccines and other public health response measures.
The statement is False.

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week’s hottest new book releases.
1. "My Dark Vanessa," by Kate Elizabeth Russell (William Morrow, fiction, on sale March 10)
What it’s about: When she was 15, Vanessa ended up in a sexual relationship with her 42-year-old English teacher. At the time, she was thrilled by what she thought was a consensual romance. Years later, that same teacher is accused of sexual abuse by a former student. Does Vanessa remain silent and hold on to that illusion, or does she face the ugly truth of her first love?
The buzz: “Russell offers readers an introspective narrative that fully captures the complexity and necessity of the #MeToo movement… This is a frighteningly sharp debut,” says a starred review in Publishers Weekly.
More: Oprah Winfrey dropped 'My Dark Vanessa' book club pick after online controversy
Book review: Mystery lovers will savor suspense of Peter Swanson's 'Eight Perfect Murders'
2. “The Mirror & the Light,” by Hilary Mantel (Henry Holt & Co. , fiction, on sale March 10)
What it’s about: The final book in Mantel’s historical trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell in the court of King Henry VIII.
The buzz: The publisher has kept a tight lid on this one, but the early reviews are rapturous. “With this trilogy, Mantel has redefined what the historical novel is capable of,” says a review in The Guardian.
3. “MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman,” by Ben Hubbard (Tim Duggan Books, nonfiction, on sale March 10)
What it’s about: The Beirut bureau chief for the New York Times paints a gripping portrait of the rise of Mohammed bin Salman, the mysterious and powerful young Saudi Arabian prince who ordered the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The buzz: “A chilling look at the ascent of the current young prince of Saudi Arabia to first-in-line to succession,” says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
4. “A Good Neighborhood,” by Therese Anne Fowler’s (St. Martin’s Press, fiction, on sale March 10)
What it’s about: Two families are at odds in the tight-knit North Carolina community of Oak Knoll. Valerie Alston-Hold, a black professor with a musically gifted, biracial son, objects when her neighbors, the nouveau riche white family, the Whitmans, raze the lot next door to build a showplace. Then their teenagers fall in love.
The buzz: “A riveting, potentially redemptive story of modern American suburbia that reads almost like an ancient Greek tragedy,” says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
5. “Recollections of My Nonexistence,” by Rebecca Solnit (Viking, nonfiction, on sale March 10)
What it’s about: A portrait of the artist as a young woman. In her new memoir, Solnit reflects on her growth as a writer, feminist and activist in 1980s San Francisco, and on finding her voice in a society that prefers women to pipe down.
The buzz: A starred review in Kirkus Reviews calls it “a perceptive, radiant portrait of a writer of indelible consequence. ”

Clinton: Affair managed 'anxieties'

Texto completo: Former President Bill Clinton, recalling the sex scandal that led to his impeachment in 1998, says in a new documentary series that his extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky was a way of "managing my anxieties."
The four-part documentary series, "Hillary," which was released Friday on Hulu, focuses on Hillary Clinton's life, her marriage to Bill Clinton and her unsuccessful campaign for president in 2016.
In the series, Bill Clinton is asked by the director, Nanette Burstein, why he engaged in an affair with Lewinsky, then a White House intern, and whether he weighed the risks.
"Nobody sits down and thinks, 'I think I'll take a really irresponsible risk,' " Clinton says.
Clinton says that he was under enormous pressure, but that his actions were inexcusable.
"You feel like you're staggering around -- you've been in a 15-round prizefight that was extended to 30 rounds, and here's something that'll take your mind off it for a while," Clinton says. "Everybody's life has pressures and disappointments and terrors, fears of whatever, things I did to manage my anxieties for years."
Clinton's explanation drew derisive reactions on Twitter, with some commenters suggesting that the president should have turned to Xanax, Valium or meditation.
The House impeached Clinton on charges that he lied to a grand jury about his affair with Lewinsky and obstructed justice, making him only the second president to hold that distinction until Donald Trump. Like the current president, Clinton was acquitted by the Senate.

Chicago-centric adaptation aimed at young people is a story for all

Texto completo: 'I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter' ***
Most teenagers, and most of us who love one or two, have met Julia: "I don't know why I've always been like this," she says, loudly, "why the smallest things in the world make me ache inside."
The heroine, though, of Erika L. Sánchez's novel "I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter" is uncommonly self-reflective. "The world," she eventually concedes, "is too much in me."
Such souls always make great narrators of novels.
And, as the current Steppenwolf for Young Adults production makes clear, dramatic adaptations thereof.
Along with a strikingly snarky and commercial title that's pitch-perfect for parent-hating teens, Julia's empathetic appeal explains why "Mexican Daughter," the first novel from a writer born and raised in Cicero to Mexican immigrant parents became both a New York Times bestseller and a finalist for a National Book Award. Although she recently taught poetry at Princeton University, Sánchez hardly grew up in privilege: Both of her parents worked in a factory.
"Mexican Daughter" hits the same themes that have sustained young-adult novels since Judy Bloom: sexual confusion, a blossoming sense of self coupled with a feeling of dislocation, and deep waves of personal alienation constantly threatening thrilling talent. What teens never understand, of course, is that most adults deal with the same stuff.
Watching Isaac Gómez's entertaining adaptation with a bunch of school-group kids on Thursday -- I always prefer to see these shows with their intended audience, although you can take your kids on the weekends -- I mused on whether this particular novel really deserved a bigger budget, a deeper dive and a fuller treatment that it gets here. Why can't a teenager be at the center of a mainstage show?
That's not necessarily a criticism of director Sandra Marquez's simple but warm-centered production, which showcases Karen Rodriguez as Julia and also features rich work from Dyllan Rodrigues-Miller. It's just worth noting that more than 500,000 Chicagoans are specifically of Mexican descent, this story is a Chicago story filled with local references to the likes of Myopic Books in Wicker Park or the Luna Cafe or the sights of Pilsen and Evanston, and that a whole lot of overeducated artsy types sit around all day pontificating on the problems of audience diversification and end up producing something pretentious or laden with an agenda foreign to 490,00 of our fellow Chicagoans when, hey, "Mexican Daughter" is right here.
And it's a story for everybody.
There is a fair bit of sex-talk in this show (be warned, especially if you have middle schoolers who might not want to experience that with their teachers or parents; I watched one row of pint-size kids sink further and further into their seats, but that's Steppenwolf for you). And, at times, more in the production than the novel, you feel like you are in some aspirational progressive fantasy of actual life in Chicago, a 20-something remembrance of youth from an adult perspective, although Rodriquez's unfiltered performance works against that tendency.
But on Thursday, the biggest reaction came when Julia, celebrating her quinceañera, danced awkwardly with her dad. "Awww," went my whole row, reacting, as theater audiences invariable do, when the center holds and the formerly alienated come together. Gives you hope for our shared future.
"Mexican Daughter" is, in part, a detective story, wherein Julia tries to get to know the sins of her dead sister, Olga (Rodrigues-Miller), in part to prove that she was not the perfect kid her parents thought. There's a darkness to that quest, of course, since it probes sibling rivalry through the prism of grief: Julia has lost a frenemy she loved, and Sánchez is writing about her journey toward that realization.
Now, this particular staging sometimes gets lost in individual moments at the expense of that overarching tension, but the diversions are such fun, no one really cares. And the thing about this story that works so well is that it understands how kids who suffer that kind of trauma also have to navigate the everyday stuff, simultaneously: It's not like boys stop being boys or friends stop being annoying (this also is true of adulthood).
Gómez is a very skilled playwright in his own right, of course, and it would be great if he could expand his vision. This story could sing, or not. Either way, it has some of the same appeal as Harry Potter: it tells the truth about the dark forces and the hope in the world. Kids know we're not all safe.

On coronavirus, Trump owes us straight talk and a push for guaranteed paid sick leave

Texto completo: We knew, at some point, that it would come to this. President Donald Trump, who has lied to the American people about every facet of his life — his education, his family, his mistresses, his money — is now asking us to believe him about a potential matter of life and death: the coronavirus.
Trump says he's on top of it. But this time, it’s not his life he’s talking about, it’s ours. Should we — and can we — believe him? I hope so. We’re all Americans after all, and while I’m not a Trump fan, he’s our president, and I wish him well in facing down this common threat. If he is able to contain it, with limited damage in terms of lives lost and economic disruption, I’ll be the first to say thanks and give praise.
Yet true to form, Trump has said things that are either misleading or flat out wrong. For example, he has compared coronavirus to the flu and asked if a flu vaccine could be used to fight coronavirus. He has also said that his "hunch" is that the World Health Organization is wrong about the coronavirus mortality rate being 3. 4% (over 30 times deadlier than the . 1% death rate for those who get the common flu).
Disturbances to daily life are growing
Voluntary or involuntary home quarantines could become more common as the coronavirus spreads. The problem here is that tens of millions of Americans lack paid sick leave. What a choice: go to work sick and spread germs (but get paid), or take time off (without pay) to get better. Did you know that we’re one of only two developed nations in the world (South Korea is the other) that do not guarantee paid leave for personal illness?
Tens of millions of Americans also live paycheck to paycheck, and the Census Bureau says about 13 million work two or more jobs. If sick workers are encouraged or told to stay home amid growing coronavirus fears, what will they do? And what if schools and businesses shut down, as we saw in China and Japan and are beginning to see in Washington state?
Then there’s the problem of medical costs for those people just getting by. The Federal Reserve estimates that nearly 40% of Americans do not have $400 on hand to pay for an emergency. Getting tested for coronavirus is expensive, even if you turn out not to have it. If you are infected, there are travel and quarantine costs and missing work. Frank Wucinski got stuck with a $3,918 tab after being evacuated from China with his three-year-old daughter and quarantined by the U. S. government in California. “When the bills showed up,” he told The New York Times, “it was just a pit in my stomach, like, ‘How do I pay for this?’”
Getting priorities straight: Coronavirus isn't about Trump's stock market and 2020 odds. Or at least it shouldn't be.
If the virus spreads across the United States in the coming weeks and even months, there could be many people asking such questions. Making the situation worse, the number of uninsured Americans is rising: The Census Bureau notes that in 2018, for example, 27. 5 million people “did not have health insurance at any point during the year,” an increase of nearly 2 million people from the year before.
This is a legitimate question for Trump as he campaigns for re-election on his largely baseless claim that this may be “the greatest economy in the history of our country. ” If it’s so great, why can’t 40% of Americans handle a $400 expense? And why are so many losing health coverage?
Stock market roller coaster of fear, uncertainty
Fact is, for all of the president’s bluster, the economy grew at a modest 2. 1% rate in the 4th quarter of last year — and that was before coronavirus fears began to ramp up. What might happen now?
The stock market has been on a roller coaster — buckling and bouncing back and buckling again under the weight of fear and uncertainty. Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG, tells me that the U. S. economy could begin to shrink this month, thanks first and foremost to a drop in exports, along with supply chain disruptions, a hit to manufacturing and more.
Fighting coronavirus: Wash your hands and support clean water access around the world
Companies are freezing hiring, canceling sporting events and concerts, and pulling out of gatherings like SXSW. Individuals are also beginning to take precautions — canceling flights, avoiding restaurants, working from home. Economists call this “aversion behavior,” and given the fact that consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U. S. economic activity, any pullback is not to be taken lightly. In fact, Hunter warns, the most likely scenario for U. S. economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 is 0. 9%.
A recession is officially defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. If Hunter’s forecast is accurate, we’re not far off. Going forward, no one knows how bad coronavirus could be, both in human and economic terms. Let’s wish our president and other officials well as they deal with it. Speaking truthfully about the medical and financial predicaments millions of Americans could face, and trying to do something about them, is a good place to start.

Messing with the Jesus John Turturro brings back (beloved?) 'Lebowski' character

Texto completo: When last we encountered Jesus Quintana, the bumptious Latino bowler was going door to door in his new neighborhood, meekly sharing that he was a registered sex offender. That was in 1998, the year the Jesus (John Turturro) cameo-ed in Joel and Ethan Coen's stoner noir "The Big Lebowski."
Turturro reprises the role in the farce "The Jesus Rolls" - which he wrote and directed with the Coens' blessing. It is loosely based on Bertrand Blier's 1974 movie "Going Places," in which two French knuckleheads steal cars, grope women and boink themselves into existentially richer moments of being. I spoke with Turturro about resurrecting the Jesus, zealous disciples and more.

Q: The Jesus of "Lebowski" has just served six months behind bars for what a rival bowler calls "exposing himself to an 8-year-old." Ethan Coen told me that after he and his brother conceived the Jesus in a "purple onesie," it was a short step to making him a pedophile.
A: I never dwelled much on that aspect of the Jesus. I was more embarrassed by the codpiece Joel and Ethan made me wear when I went door to door.

Q: In the new movie, how do you turn a cartoonish child molester into a cartoonish non-child-molester?
A: Pedophilia is a real thing, a horrifying thing. But "The Jesus Rolls" is a comedy, so I said let's address the crime and move on. A flashback in the opening scene reveals it was all a big misunderstanding involving the Jesus' penis.

Q: How big a misunderstanding?
A: Big enough to get him arrested.

Q: Another distinguishing feature of the Jesus is his voice, which is gentle and disarmingly high.
A: I first used the voice in Reinaldo Povod's play "Nijinsky Choked His Chicken" at the Public in 1987. Rei's father had just been released from prison, and that's how he spoke.

Q: Part of what made the Jesus so endearing were his extravagant gestures. He taunted opponents by shimmying and strutting and backpedaling like a cocky prizefighter.
A: A lot of those moves were modeled on Muhammad Ali's, especially his psych-out job on Sonny Liston.

Q: Ethan says you got more mail and, alarmingly, more marriage proposals from the role than any other.
A: I got all kinds of women letters, men letters. Weird ones, racy ones. "I love your body." "I love your outfit." "I'd love to take your outfit off." I made "Lebowski" after returning to the States from Europe, where I filmed "The Truce." I played the writer Primo Levi returning home to Italy from Auschwitz after World War II, and I'd lost a lot of weight for the part - so much that a couple of New York gossip columnists speculated that I was dying. A Fleet Street hack even called my mother in Queens and asked, "Is it true your son has brain cancer?" A friend suggested that I hold a press conference with my head bandaged and thank God for my miraculous recovery.

Q: "The Jesus Rolls" nods toward "Lebowski," but it's not a sequel. Basically, you've inserted a "Lebowski" character into "Going Places" and updated that story to the present day. How did you decide to hitch a ride on a 46-year-old road movie about aimless joyriders whose entire objective is to keep driving until the tank is empty?
A: "Going Places" made a tremendous impression on me. I was 19 and in college when I saw the movie at a second-run theater in upstate New York. It wasn't long after the student riots in Paris, a time of hippies and revolutionaries, and the film was a celebration of freedom in a world of bourgeoise hypocrisy. I was shocked not just by what I was seeing onscreen but by my laughter at the shocking things I was seeing. I remember thinking, "Holy mackerel!"

Q: The original title of "Going Places" was "Les Valseuses," French slang for testicles. The brutish leads - Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere - treated females like they existed solely to service mankind. Roger Ebert condemned the film for what he called its "palpable and embarrassing" hatred of women.
A: And yet Pauline Kael was a big champion. She saw the Depardieu and Dewaere characters as guileless raw innocents for whom almost everything backfires. To me, they were like cavemen - crude, misogynistic and at times a little rough - but they became generous cavemen. They seemed to genuinely care for Miou-Miou, their lover and companion. They also cared about the little band of outsiders they formed with a weathered convict played by Jeanne Moreau, and Isabelle Huppert, a teenage runaway. The generosity of the powerless appeals to some rebellious part of me.
Q: In "Jesus Rolls," you stand in for Depardieu, the mindless mastermind, and Bobby Cannavale is your partner in crime. Audrey Tautou takes the place of Miou-Miou and Susan Sarandon replaces Moreau. How closely did you hew to the "Going Places" screenplay?
A: I intentionally left the screenplay way behind. As a writer and actor it's important to remember you're not those characters, that's not your language, you're not that age. After rewatching "Going Places," I transposed the narrative and read Blier's novel, which is filthy, broader in its concerns and the basis of the film. Then I asked him for permission to repurpose the book and make the two drifters a few decades older. My pitch was simple: Those guys are now middle-aged and they're still idiots. And Blier said, "OK, as long as they're stupid."

Q: The Coen brothers are forever retelling the story of Job. The question isn't whether God exists but what he's up to. Do we have a friend in the Jesus?
A: I really like religious movies, especially if they're about nuns. I was thinking of calling this picture "Jesus, Mary and Peter" because the three principals do good deeds. They solve problems. They don't hurt anybody. Even when they steal a car, they bring it back. Maybe in 20 more years I'll make another movie about the Jesus. As we all know, he already came back once.
Caption: John Turturro got the Coen Brothers' blessing before writing and directing "The Jesus Rolls," which centers on an iconic Coen film character.

Texto completo: The recent New York Times article "The Struggle to Mend America's Rural Roads" used Wisconsin as a microcosm for the infrastructure crisis that either directly or indirectly affects all Americans.
Personally, I'm tickled with the job the county road department does with my own stretch of country road. But for people in many states and localities, broken axles, wrecked suspension systems, busted tires, emergency road closings and unpredictable weight limits for aging bridges are an ever-looming danger. Shoppers, commuters, tourists, farmers and truckers hauling the nation's food supply are all at the mercy of substandard rural roads.
The normal life span of an asphalt road is 30 years, but many rural roads have been in service for more than 75 years.
Unfortunately, road construction and maintenance do not come cheap. Reconstructing a mile of road costs $300,000; even chip sealing (a kind of short-term patching) costs $17,000 a mile. Some officeholders are better at keeping costs down than others.
All federal, state and local agencies must make hard decisions about finite resources, but some places are less ashamed of their stinginess than others.
Many urbanites – unable to see past their subways and other forms of mass transit – demonstrate a dismaying lack of empathy for fellow Americans who live in "flyover country." ("I didn't force them to live in the boonies.)
To be sure, open-minded city-dwellers can visit the hinterlands and really "click" with the locals and their needs. Their hearts are in the right place. (Or maybe their hearts have shifted to the lower intestine region after hitting one bump too many.)
But even the most sympathetic visitors know that whatever state or federal funding might materialize, the answer must start with the people directly affected. And locals can be reluctant to disrupt the status quo by opening their wallets wider. As John Denver sang, "Country roads, take me home – unless there's a big tax bill waiting in the mailbox!"
Still, I hope the Times article will reignite a long-stalled national discussion of the seen and unseen costs of deteriorating infrastructure. People from all regions, all income levels, all political persuasions must put their petty differences aside, roll up their sleeves and brainstorm solutions.
As Prof. Emmett Brown from "Back to the Future" might have said, "Bipartisanship? Where we're going, we don't need bipartisanship! KA-THUMP KA-THUMP CRASH! AIIIIEEEEE!"

Texto completo: A majestic, magnificently quirky house at the end of Beach Avenue in Larchmont Manor has enjoyed the great good fortune to have but three owners in its 115-year history. • Each has lovingly cared for this Westchester architectural treasure that's perched above a gorgeous beachfront stretch of Long Island Sound, with stunning water views from nearly every room. • It is now back on the market for $5,850,000.
'Please Don't Eat The Daisies' The best known owners were Walter and Jean Kerr, who bought the nearly 9,000-square-foot, castle-like house on a whim, in 1955, and raised their six children here over the next half century. Walter Kerr, who died in 1996, was the longtime chief drama critic for The New York Times. He described the style of his house as "neogingerbread."
This is where Jean Kerr, a humorist and playwright, wrote "Please Don't Eat the Daisies," her 1950s ode to suburban life that later became a Doris Day movie and a TV series.
After Jean's death in 2003, the Kerr children sold the house.
The original six-bedroom home on Beach Avenue is in the shape of a quadrangle with a spacious center courtyard. It was once the rather elegant stables and carriage house for the nearby Crocker estate – the main house is now the Larchmont Shore Club.
The current owners, while maintaining most of the home's unique details, have thoroughly modernized and updated the home.
An attic space, for example, was used to create a two-floor master suite with double bathrooms, a windowed walk-in closet, wine fridge, lounge and office space and a wood-burning fireplace, along with a unique enclosed original sleeping porch.
"It is such a loved property and spectacular site and setting," said Pollena Forsman of Houlihan Lawrence, who has the listing. "In Larchmont Manor, the direct waterfront is very coveted, and this house – while not direct waterfront – has the most spectacular views from 16 of the main rooms, hallways and even closets!"
The original owner was Charles King, an automotive pioneer who was also an accomplished architect, artist, poet and musician, who bought the carriage house in 1923 and began redesigning it as a home for his family. Around the same time, the William K. Vanderbilt mansion at Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street was being demolished.
King had 35 truckloads of prime Vanderbilt stuff – including a two-story fireplace, spiral staircase, coffered wooden ceiling, and innumerable windows, beams, pillars and marble handrails – trucked up to Larchmont, to be installed in his new house.
He had carillon bells cast in France and put them in the tower. The Kerrs rigged the bells so they would play an aria from "Carmen" at 6 p.m. sharp every evening to draw the kids home for dinner from nearby homes and beaches.
Updates have turned an awkwardly sited garage, in the middle of one side of the house, into a gracious, modern kitchen and family room with soaring 10-foot ceilings. "It was transformed into a space that every luxury buyer seeks and demands," said Forsman. "There is a huge center island, open to a great room and media room with built-ins."
The current owners also added a proper first-floor mudroom and laundry as well as a game room or playroom on the second floor, where there are also two guest rooms and a bathroom.
While a few rooms were reconfigured, the home has maintained its unusual layout and idiosyncratic charm, with secret panels and doors to nowhere.
"All the original details are here," said Forsman. "When the owners created the new space, they very thoughtfully used reclaimed doors and windows where possible and built new things that were in keeping with what was there."
To have all that, with the water views and not an be in the flood zone, is very unique, added Forsman. "It's extraordinary. Any buyer will appreciate the history and the modern improvements."

Texto completo: Have you started planning your summer vacation yet? It'll be sipping-lemonade-by-the-pool season before you know it. I love vacations, but here's what I don't love: Nearly 40 percent of millennials are willing to go into debt for their trips.
Coming back home to credit card bills makes the end of a vacation miserable. I don't want that to be your story. If you start saving up now, you'll be in great shape when it's time to pack your bags.
Here are eight ways to save up and pay for your vacation with your own money:
1. Give your budget a refresh. If it's been a while since you looked at where your money is really going each month, I bet you'll find some areas where you can cut back in a matter of minutes. Then, you can put that cash toward your vacation fund.
2. Brew your own coffee at home. I get it. Fancy coffee with a designer label makes me feel special, too. But if you put that $25 a week into a vacation fund for a while, you'll add a couple hundred bucks or more to your travel budget.
3. Pack your lunch. Peanut butter and jelly today means piña coladas all day on the beach this summer.
4. Order water at restaurants. If you go out to eat, give up extras like soda, appetizers, and alcohol.
5. Save on groceries by shopping generic or at Aldi. Everyone I know swears their grocery bill was slashed in half simply by switching to shopping at Aldi. If you don't have one near you, you can save money buying store brand or generic brand items.
6. Sell your kids' clothes at consignment stores. I'm a huge fan of this! I also love shopping consignment to save money.
7. Sell stuff online through places like Facebook Marketplace. You know there's stuff lying around the house, in the garage, or in your closet that you don't use anymore. Put it to good use by selling it, and put that money toward your vacation!
8. Cancel any unused subscriptions. When's the last time you really watched a show on HBO, or used any of the makeup samples from your Birchbox? I'm not hating on subscription services, but if you don't use them, that's money leaving your bank account each month you could be saving.
Once you try these money-saving tips, you might just make them a habit. Then, you'll be ahead of the game when it's vacation time next year. My free Vacation Budget Worksheet makes it super easy to plan for all your expenses.
Things always cost more than you expect. But this worksheet will help you plan for everything — even the unexpected stuff.

Attorneys: Suspect offering plea deal Alleged Golden State Killer wants death off the table

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Attorneys for the man accused of being the Golden State Killer said Joseph James DeAngelo Jr. would be willing to plead guilty if prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty, according to new court papers.
The statement from the public defenders representing DeAngelo appears as a footnote in a 41-page dismissal motion filed this month in Sacramento County Circuit Court and obtained by the Los Angeles Times.
"Mr. DeAngelo is 74 years old. He has offered to plead to the charges with a lifetime sentence," the statement says.
Assistant public defender Joe Cress did not respond to a request to clarify the statement. Nor did Sacramento County prosecutor Anne Marie Schubert respond to a request for comment. But victims in the case told The Times they had received a letter from the public defender asking them to tell an independent mediator what they think about resolving the case without trial.
"I would be OK with that," said Kris Pedretti, who was 15 when she was raped in 1976. "But in exchange we want answers. Where he was. What he was doing. He owes us answers. Real answers."
A second victim voiced a similar opinion. Victor Hayes, who was held captive and threatened with death while his girlfriend was raped, said he is more interested in knowing details of how the crimes would have been committed by DeAngelo, a patrol duty police officer for the small northern California town of Auburn.
DeAngelo faces charges for 13 murders and 13 rape-related kidnappings in six counties. Beyond that, he is accused of some 50 rapes and scores of ransackings attributed to a serial predator who attacked women, men and children across a large swath of California in the 1970s and 1980s.
He was arrested in April 2018 based on genetic DNA tracing through his relatives. Prosecutors allege that DNA retrieved from DeAngelo the day of his arrest matches that from eight of the crime scenes, but they have so far been stymied in collecting additional DNA samples from DeAngelo so that crime labs in those counties can run their own tests.
DeAngelo's arrest inspired dozens of other agencies to begin solving violent crimes similarly, fundamentally revolutionizing how cases across the country are investigated. The technique has generated a backlash from some genealogists, legal scholars and privacy advocates who are concerned that the police and the FBI are abusing these databases.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on executions in March 2019, but the death penalty remains legal in the state.

Texto completo: Coronavirus has some in panic mode - but not so much my anatomy and physiology students.
Between their basic understanding of how diseases spread and the hands-on work they're doing in our online learning environment, they know how to keep themselves healthy and spot signs of someone who isn't.
Here's how I, a science teacher who believes passionately in the importance of practical experience and was admittedly nervous about teaching in a virtual classroom, did it.
It all starts with Netflix and The New York Times. I'm a big fan of the Netflix show "Diagnosis," based on Dr. Lisa Sanders' New York Times column of the same name, and one day, it dawned on me: What if I took a similar approach with my virtual anatomy and physiology students, giving them a list of someone's symptoms and asking them to determine what's going on with that patient as if they were a real medical professional?
I calibrated the symptoms to match the medical conditions a high school student would be more familiar with, required that they consult with one another and made it so they'd have to apply what they learned in the classroom.
Still, I knew this alone wouldn't be enough to make students feel as if they were real-world health professionals in training. So I explored another innovation available to online learners: simulators. Simulators can mimic what goes on outside the classroom, or in the case of an anatomy and physiology class, what goes on inside the body.
This technology shows how the circulatory and respiratory systems operate, and also enables students to make certain manipulations. For example, they can dissect and zoom in on different parts, where they'll uncover even more in-depth explanations.
Of course, no one would want to be operated on by a physician who has only worked with simulators. That's why I also took advantage of my schools' unique ability to present students with opportunities for work-based learning.
I brought in industry experts from all over the place - a firefighter and EMT, nurse, and X-ray technician. They talked to my students about what's going on in their field, what their day-to-day work involves, and the skills students will need if they want to pursue a job in that industry.
Hearing from someone with substantial experience made what my students were learning feel all the more real. And even better, they now have a professional connection they can return to when they're ready to take on an internship, apprenticeship or job shadow experience.
With the "Diagnosis"-inspired assignments, simulators and an ability to connect students with people on the front lines of their industry, I now know that hands-on learning isn't exclusively about tangibility. It's about grounding lessons in reality and equipping students with the skills needed to tackle today's and tomorrow's most pressing issues.
My hope is that other educators see this too. It is possible to provide hands-on learning in an online environment. And by doing so, we stand to transform many students' lives - if not the world as we know it.

Texto completo: Remember your grandmother's avocado-green kitchen? It could soon be yours. Or maybe it'll be pink, mauve, emerald green or buttercup. Anything but white, because the revolt against the white kitchen has begun.
Last November, the cover of Elle Decor featured a Steven Gambrel-designed kitchen awash in a shiny turquoise - even the ceiling gleamed like an iridescent underwater wonderland. On Pinterest between November 2018 and November 2019, searches for dark green cabinets jumped 367%, plum kitchens went up 107% and pink kitchen walls spiked 121%.
For decades now, cabinets have been relegated to white, brown or maybe black, and it's been even longer since appliances were allowed to be anything but stainless steel. But the Instagram kitchen - invariably a clean backdrop of basic Shaker cabinets, simple subway backsplashes and marble countertops - finally has some competition.
Jenny Dina Kirschner, an interior designer in New York, recently painted the cabinets pink for a client in Long Island, giving the room a decidedly '80s vibe somewhere between mauve and millennial pink. The color picked up the pinkish tones in the Calacatta Vagli marble countertop.
"We're starting to see more daring use of color," Kirschner said. "It's a rebellion against the white kitchen."
Breaking the mold is risky when 43% of homeowners choose white cabinets and a third choose white countertops, according to a 2019 Houzz report. Try something bolder than wood cabinets or black soapstone countertops and you might fail. Unlike an unfortunate coat of paint on the living room walls, the wrong choice of cabinetry could cost a homeowner tens of thousands of dollars. And money aside, it's not easy to rip out that chartreuse backsplash if you later regret it.
Yet cracks in the color-free facade are emerging. Between 2018 and 2019, BHG.com consumer insights found a 115% spike in interest in cabinet paint trends and a 10% increase in interest in colorful kitchen cabinetry. And from March 2018 to March 2019, interest in blue and green for paint and home decor rose 50%. Navy cabinets have become increasingly popular along with two-toned ones, with choices like blue for the lower ones and blond wood for the uppers. Greens of all shades have been nudging their way onto the stage, too, appearing as emerald cabinetry, avocado backsplashes and sage pendants.
In a throwback to the 1970s, the age of wacky colored appliances is also back. Want a retro fridge? Big Chill carries them in colors like beach blue, cherry red and pink lemonade. The appliance company BlueStar offers hundreds of color options, as well as custom colors for its products, letting customers personalize down to the color of the doors, trim and dials. Have a specific shade of purple in mind for your oven? Dacor can match a swatch you provide to the color of its appliances.
"Anything goes these days," said Gideon Mendelson, an interior designer in Manhattan. He is currently designing a yellow kitchen for a couple on the North Fork of Long Island, which he described as "a sophisticated buttercup. It's not going to be sweet and cutesy. It's not quite mustard. It's happier than that."
Who doesn't want a happy kitchen? With the world so dreary, a little yellow can go a long way. In these uncertain times, we're drawn to colors that don't need to be impeccable, that can hide the messiness of life. "There's a sense of energy and nourishment in bright colors," said Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of "Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness."
Alessandra Wood, vice president of style for Modsy, an online interior-design service, said that homeowners are looking for comfort and coziness in design choices, so why not our kitchens, too?
"In this really unstable world, we are looking for anything that makes us feel comfortable, and we are definitely turning to our homes to do that," she said.
Just look at the color Pantone chose for its color of the year: classic blue, because it "highlights our desire for a dependable and stable foundation." Paint companies Sherwin-Williams and PPG also ushered in the new decade with blue as their picks of the year in a collective nod to what might soon be our new neutral - call it bluetral.
We're also living in our homes differently. After decades of relentless moving, Americans are moving at the lowest rates since the U.S. census began tracking our mobility, with fewer than 10% of Americans moving between 2018 and 2019. Baby boomers are aging in place and millennials, facing rising housing costs and stagnating wages, are less likely to house hop. With no plans to stake a "for sale" sign in the front yard, why commit to the safe and listless colors of a staged house?
Greige, that dreary hue that is neither gray nor beige, but took over our homes for over a decade, is decidedly out. The relentlessly white kitchen may be next. It made a lot of sense in the era of house flipping. White looks clean and is unlikely to offend a potential buyer. Who hates white? And if your home is perpetually one renovation away from its next open house, white is a natural go-to color. It's a kitchen designed for future buyers, not the specific tastes of the current inhabitants.
But let's face it: White looks clean only when it is clean. The rest of the time, it is not the most practical color for a room that regularly gets splashed with marinara sauce. There is something to be said for a little color to hide the imperfections.
"We're living in our spaces longer, so there's an extra level of consideration that people are giving to them," Wood said. "We're thinking, 'How do I make this space into a space that I really feel comfortable in?' "
So if there is no buyer on the horizon, if the kitchen remodel is just for you, the view widens. Why not wash the whole room in turquoise? It doesn't really matter what some fictional buyer might think. You can be you and paint the cabinets pink.

Texto completo: A health event in Gonzales and the Sea Otter Classic at Laguna Seca have been postponed because of the coronavirus.
"After careful consideration, and although we are not experiencing any active cases of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in our community, nor in Monterey County, we have decided to take the precautionary measure of postponing the Community Summit that was scheduled for this Saturday, March 7th at Gonzales High School to a future date," the city wrote in a letter.
Coronavirus is highly contagious respiratory virus that has infected more than 100,000 across the globe, including 260 in the United States. California has treated 70 people for the disease, according to the New York Times.
On Friday, Gonzales announced it would be pushing back the summit, which was planned to celebrate the city's selection for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Culture of Health Prize from among 200 communities that applied.
The prize honored five communities for "pursuing innovative ideas and bringing partners together to rally around a shared vision of advancing health, opportunity, and equity," according to a prior press release from Gonzales.
The event was supposed to run from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Gonzales residents would also receive free T-Mobile hotspots.
The Sea Otter Classic, a four-day bicycling festival that draws tens of thousands to Laguna Seca, and the Bicycle Leadership Conference have also been postponed, the Steinbeck Rotary reported Friday. Information on a new date will be posted at steinbeckrotary.org, possibly by the middle of next week.
They're among the latest events cancelled across the United States because of COVID-19. Austin's SXSW music, film and technology festival was cancelled Friday because of the coronavirus, which is spreading across the world.
In addition, the virus has led to two cruise ships' passengers being quarantined at sea, including the the Grand Princess anchored about 100 miles from Monterey Bay.
The U.S. Coast Guard flew test kits out to the ship Thursday. Of 46 people tested, 21 tested positive, according to USA Today.
Most infected people have mild symptoms, but its fatality rate has bounced between 2% an 3.4%.
That concerns health officials, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because it could easily spread among vulnerable populations.
At least 14 people have died across in the United States and more than 3,200 have died across the world.
The CDC has created a website dedicated to COVID-19.
It says the following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.*
Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath
The CDC offers these tips for preventing COVID-19:
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Follow CDC's recommendations for using a facemask.
CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.
Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, according to the CDC. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.
People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately, the CDC advises.

Texto completo: A majestic, magnificently quirky house at the end of Beach Avenue in Larchmont Manor has enjoyed the great good fortune to have but three owners in its 115-year history. • Each has lovingly cared for this Westchester architectural treasure that's perched above a gorgeous beachfront stretch of Long Island Sound, with stunning water views from nearly every room. • It is now back on the market for $5,850,000.
'Please Don't Eat The Daisies' The best known owners were Walter and Jean Kerr, who bought the nearly 9,000-square-foot, castle-like house on a whim, in 1955, and raised their six children here over the next half century. Walter Kerr, who died in 1996, was the longtime chief drama critic for The New York Times. He described the style of his house as "neogingerbread."
This is where Jean Kerr, a humorist and playwright, wrote "Please Don't Eat the Daisies," her 1950s ode to suburban life that later became a Doris Day movie and a TV series.
After Jean's death in 2003, the Kerr children sold the house.
The original six-bedroom home on Beach Avenue is in the shape of a quadrangle with a spacious center courtyard. It was once the rather elegant stables and carriage house for the nearby Crocker estate – the main house is now the Larchmont Shore Club.
The current owners, while maintaining most of the home's unique details, have thoroughly modernized and updated the home.
An attic space, for example, was used to create a two-floor master suite with double bathrooms, a windowed walk-in closet, wine fridge, lounge and office space and a wood-burning fireplace, along with a unique enclosed original sleeping porch.
"It is such a loved property and spectacular site and setting," said Pollena Forsman of Houlihan Lawrence, who has the listing. "In Larchmont Manor, the direct waterfront is very coveted, and this house – while not direct waterfront – has the most spectacular views from 16 of the main rooms, hallways and even closets!"
The original owner was Charles King, an automotive pioneer who was also an accomplished architect, artist, poet and musician, who bought the carriage house in 1923 and began redesigning it as a home for his family. Around the same time, the William K. Vanderbilt mansion at Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street was being demolished.
King had 35 truckloads of prime Vanderbilt stuff – including a two-story fireplace, spiral staircase, coffered wooden ceiling, and innumerable windows, beams, pillars and marble handrails – trucked up to Larchmont, to be installed in his new house.
He had carillon bells cast in France and put them in the tower. The Kerrs rigged the bells so they would play an aria from "Carmen" at 6 p.m. sharp every evening to draw the kids home for dinner from nearby homes and beaches.
Updates have turned an awkwardly sited garage, in the middle of one side of the house, into a gracious, modern kitchen and family room with soaring 10-foot ceilings. "It was transformed into a space that every luxury buyer seeks and demands," said Forsman. "There is a huge center island, open to a great room and media room with built-ins."
The current owners also added a proper first-floor mudroom and laundry as well as a game room or playroom on the second floor, where there are also two guest rooms and a bathroom.
While a few rooms were reconfigured, the home has maintained its unusual layout and idiosyncratic charm, with secret panels and doors to nowhere.
"All the original details are here," said Forsman. "When the owners created the new space, they very thoughtfully used reclaimed doors and windows where possible and built new things that were in keeping with what was there."
To have all that, with the water views and not an be in the flood zone, is very unique, added Forsman. "It's extraordinary. Any buyer will appreciate the history and the modern improvements."
Pollena Forsman of Houlihan Lawrence has the listing.

Texto completo: The night of the tornadoes, Darlene Williams locked herself in her bathroom with a flashlight and her Australian Shepherd mix, Bodhi, and hoped for the best.
The next morning, unscathed from the storm, she took her dog out in the yard to survey the damage. Yellow insulation covered everything like snow — the trees, the grass, the power lines, her car. Glass crunched beneath her feet.
And then, in the side yard of her Hermitage home, she noticed something different.
"I saw something glistening in the sun," she said.
When she picked it up, she realized that a priceless personal keepsake had been blown in by the storm.
It was the Medal of Honor recognition for James Howard II.
The copper plaque was attached to black cardboard base, the adhesive on the back suggesting it had been ripped from its home. Perhaps something far away.
Now, she wants to get it back to where it belongs.
"I have family members in the military," she said. "It's always great to see folks honored for their service and heroism."
In the aftermath of the Tennessee tornadoes, many are trying to reunite those impacted by the storms with what they have lost.
On a Tennessee Tornado Lost and Found Facebook page, hundreds are posting pictures of an heirloom quilt and a wedding announcement, wrinkled photographs and a sweet kitty cat, all which have shown up in their yards and in hopes of getting belongings back to owners.
In Lebanon, one woman posted a photo of a warped white paper — the exam results for a new certified clinical medical assistant. Within an hour the owner had been found.
"That is mine! Yes!," she responded after being tagged by a mutual friend in the post. "How amazing are you! I was waiting on it. I got the news I passed on the 27th and they were going to mail that to me for proof of records! And I never got it. We never thought about our mail! Oh my gosh!"
Another posted a letter from "Mom" dated 2004, which mentions Ella Jane sitting up on her own and someone passing out at a Christmas play. That, too, was returned.
Facebook is not the only place for reunions. An area at the Cookeville Community Center has also been set up for such a purpose — a place to recover personal items that had been blown away, some of them for multiple miles into areas far from those damaged by the tornado.
New items arrive each day.
"We were just putting tons and tons of stuff in backpacks," said Ashley Walkner, who dropped off items Thursday at the community center after volunteering in the impacted areas Wednesday. "We found like insurance cards and driver's licenses and just random things in piles. We were trying to collect all that we could. If it seemed personal, we just tried to keep it. ...
"This isn't like litter pickup. These are people's lives."
Flight combat against the Nazis earns highest military honor When Williams found the Medal of Honor plaque in her yard, she wanted to know more about the man being honored.
The story of Howard's life is incredible.
The only fighter pilot to win the Medal of Honor in aerial combat over Europe in World War II, Howard earned the nation's highest military honor in January 1944, after he single-handedly took on 30 Nazi aircraft that hampered a mission by Allied bombers over Germany, according to the Los Angeles Times.
He destroyed at least four enemy airplanes and damaged others before he was forced to return to England, the L.A. Times reported.
Howard was born in China. His parents were missionaries in Canton, and he spent his first 14 years in China, according to his obituary in the New York Times. After attending the U.S. Navy's flying school in Florida, he joined the American volunteer group, the Flying Tigers, and helped to defend China against the Japanese.
In 13 months of action over Burma and China, he flew 56 missions and was credited with shooting down six Japanese planes, according to the New York Times.
He died in 1995, at the age of 81.
Now, Williams hopes to find the person who owns the keepsake that honors Howard's service and his memory. A tribute that has endured.

Texto completo: On Monday, Feb. 25, the League of Women Voters held a meeting on the climate crisis at the Tompkins County Library, which was crowded with at least 100 concerned citizens. They introduced the group Extinction Rebellion and the Sunrise Movement of Ithaca.
Thank you, Ithaca, for encouraging such civic activity.
I learned a great deal that evening, including that the temperature in Antarctica just a few weeks earlier was 68 degrees Fahenheit, and the glaciers down there are melting so much faster than scientists expected. This is horrifying, and yet receives so little public attention because it is competing with so much chaos from our current president and his minions. This melting is going to take center stage very soon, and is not reversible. The amount of damage to our coastal cities, our infrastructure, our agriculture, and the other creatures that populate the Earth is almost unimaginable.
The first speaker was from the group Extinction Rebellion and alerted us that 11 of this local group had held a protest in front of Chase Bank in downtown Ithaca. They were arrested by the police and charged. I commend them for their courage and upright actions. They wanted Chase Bank to know that it was not getting away with its typical greed and corruption.
Just by chance, the day following the library meeting, on page 2 of the Business section of The New York Times, a small article appeared announcing that JP Morgan Chase was starting new climate change initiatives, including restrictions on financing of coal mining and Arctic drilling, as well as a $200 billion target to provide financing for sustainable projects. Wow! Direct actions work!
The emissions that we are all adding to the planet are partly from air travel, all from carbon fuels. What if we all take a break from the incessant traveling, especially since the final melt is speeding up more and more. Do we care about our youngsters? Is all that travel really necessary, or is it just a luxury and a status symbol? I admit, it's a difficult ball of string to unwind, yet we have no choice (unless you want to throw in the towel and give up on the future).
Now we have the coronavirus to encourage us to slow down on the travel, since our lives are literally at stake.

A Chinese Mystery and Covid-19's Economic Puzzle

Texto completo: Words I never thought I'd read in the New York Times: "So Mr. Trump has a point."
This concession came in reference to this week's highly unrealistic death rate for Covid-19 announced by the World Health Organization, upping its guesstimate to 3.4%. Mr. Trump pooh-poohed the figure in an on-air phone call with Fox News's Sean Hannity and the Times could hardly jump on the latest outrage bandwagon having written itself one day earlier that the figure "came loaded with caveats." The biggest of these caveats, as you have read elsewhere, is the probable failure of governments in China and elsewhere to detect thousands of mild or symptomless cases. In the New England Journal of Medicine last week, U.S. experts predicted that the American fatality rate may prove closer to the flu's 0.1%.
To seek is to find with the new coronavirus infection. Until recently, the U.S. was doing the equivalent of looking for its lost keys under a streetlight by confining its testing to those with a demonstrable connection to an infected area or person. This was never a reason to take comfort that Covid-19 wasn't already here and spreading.
Containment means quickly tracing the contacts of sick people and encouraging them to quarantine themselves, as well as closing schools, workplaces and public events. In the U.S. and other countries, it probably will not involve the forcible imprisoning of healthy people in their homes as adopted in parts of China. Containment nonetheless is the strategy recommended by the World Health Organization.
In contrast, mitigation means accepting that the virus is running flu-like through society and focusing on the severely ill. As with the flu, the elderly and those in bad health are most in jeopardy. Hundreds of such people die a week from "acute respiratory distress" in the best of times (a whole research literature exists to examine which of these patients gain meaningful benefit from being kept alive with ventilators).
Now this question becomes societal. At what point should we stop working so hard to prevent transmission to people who most likely will have a mild flu- or cold-like experience in hopes of preventing a small percentage of severe cases that require costly medical intervention?
Containment, after all, has costs for people's well-being too: It deprives them of jobs and income as travel is curtailed, events are called off, and restaurants and other businesses empty out in ways that don't happen with the flu.
A debate in the British government and undoubtedly other governments was described in blunt terms by the Times of London this week: "Ministers and officials are considering the trade-off between allowing an acute outbreak, from which the economy would rebound more quickly, or trying to save more lives by imposing restrictions on mass gatherings and transport."
This remarkably important debate is now roiled by the uncertainty out of China. Even as the government there may have changed tactics and started abetting Maoist-style rumors that the virus originated in the U.S., visiting experts have credited an astonishing turnaround. Cases in the epicenter of Wuhan have plummeted precipitously. The spread of the epidemic to other provinces seems to have been all but curtailed.
In a startling statement, the WHO's Michael Ryan claimed in a Monday briefing: "Here we have a disease for which we have no vaccine, no treatment, we don't fully understand transmission, we don't fully understand case mortality, but what we have been genuinely heartened by is that unlike influenza, where countries have fought back, where they've put in place strong measures, we've remarkably seen that the virus is suppressed."
Dr. Ryan here suggests the new coronavirus may be unflu-like in its susceptibility to containment but it's hard to know since nothing similar has ever been tried with the ordinary flu, which is believed to kill upward of 300,000 globally every year.
An unquantifiable factor (if this picture of Chinese success holds up) is how much is due to the strong-arming of the Chinese government and how much to the voluntary compliance of the Chinese people, who apparently have taken to heart instructions to stay home, wash their hands and cover their mouths when sneezing. Witness accounts describe neighbors pressing on travelers alcohol-soaked cotton balls to clean their hands and packs of tissues to be used when pushing elevator buttons. Chinese internet companies reportedly use cellphone and social-media data to alert users when and where they may have crossed paths with an infected person.
To repeat, nothing similar has been tried with respect to flu outbreaks that kill thousands a year because, until now, nobody thought it worth doing. Publics everywhere accepted flu risk (which Covid-19 may be no worse than) as a cost of going about their lives in the world.

U.S. News: Trump Campaign's Media Libel Lawsuits Are Long Shots

Texto completo: A series of libel lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign against large media organizations are likely to run up against tough obstacles and depending on how far they progress, could subject the president to depositions, according to legal experts.
The Trump campaign's defamation claims against the New York Times on Feb. 26, the Washington Post on Monday and CNN on Friday appear to be unprecedented, legal scholars said. Courts have heard defamation lawsuits from governors, an ex-president and a presidential candidate, but legal scholars said they couldn't recall the last time a sitting U.S. president or his campaign elevated grievances against the news media into civil legal action.
The Trump campaign's initial lawsuits concerned two Post opinion pieces published in June 2019 and one in the New York Times in March 2019. Each contain passages implying Donald Trump sought or welcomed Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election or the 2020 race.
The Trump team's libel complaints continued Friday with a new lawsuit against CNN, alleging the campaign was defamed by a lengthy opinion article posted in June on CNN.com. The complaint focuses on a passage stating that the Trump campaign had "assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia's help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table." The lawsuit called the passage "blatantly false." A representative for the network declined to comment Friday.
The lawsuits demand millions of dollars in damages.
President Trump is entitled to the protections of libel law, but his campaign organization could have disadvantages as a plaintiff, legal scholars say.
When it comes to defamation litigation, public figures such as Mr. Trump must establish that not only was a statement false and defamatory, but that it was published with "actual malice." That means showing evidence that the people who wrote and edited the statement knew it was false -- or likely false but they didn't care to print the truth.
Each of the lawsuits emphasize that special counsel Robert Mueller's report on allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election found insufficient evidence that Mr. Trump and his campaign criminally conspired or coordinated with Russia. Suggestions to the contrary are damaging to the campaign's reputation and require expenditures to clear the record, the suits state.
Legal scholars said there is a crucial distinction between statements asserting facts and ones expressing opinions. Opinions are usually treated as protected speech, while an incorrect, defamatory fact isn't.
The Trump campaign declined to comment. Fred Ryan, publisher and chief executive of the Post, said the suits are an affront to the principles of press freedom. A spokeswoman for the Times said the Trump campaign is using litigation to "try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable."

Texto completo: Here's what you need to know about testing for COVID-19:
A doctor will order the coronavirus test based on a medical evaluation and history of recent travel.
The test can be done at a doctor's office, hospital or clinic.
The physician will swab the back of the nose and throat for specimens.
By Monday, two big commercial diagnostic labs operating in Western Pennsylvania - LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics Inc. - will be doing coronavirus testing.
UPMC Health Plan does not cover testing by LabCorp. Check your health plan or contact your insurance carrier to confirm coverage details.
Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna Corp. and CVS Health's Aetna plans are waiving copays and deductibles for coronavirus testing. Other plans may be considering similar offers.
Test results are sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation.
If you test positive, you may be asked to stay at home, away from others, for 14 days. The quarantine is voluntary.
Most COVID-19 cases are mild; some cases are fatal, especially among the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions.

Texto completo: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is encouraging older people and people with severe chronic medical conditions to "stay at home as much as possible."
This advice is on a CDC website that was posted Thursday, according to a CDC spokeswoman.
Early data suggests older people are twice as likely to have serious illness from the novel coronavirus, according to the CDC.
A Trump administration official told CNN that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "is in the process of doing targeted outreach to the elderly community and those that have serious underlying health conditions."
President Donald Trump used his visit to the CDC in Atlanta to once more quell the growing alarm that has prompted travel to be curtailed and events to be canceled from coast to coast.
Before departing Washington, D.C., Mr. Trump signed an $8.3 billion COVID-19 response funding bill at the White House and instructed the public: "Be calm. It will go away."
"We have very low numbers compared to major countries throughout the world. Our numbers are lower than just about anybody," Mr. Trump said about cases of the virus.
But his messaging was more scattered at CDC headquarters, reflective of the on-again, off-again, back-on-again nature of the trip itself. The White House had announced early Friday that Mr. Trump's trip to the CDC was canceled because of concern about a possible infection there, but that person tested negative and Mr. Trump ended up going after all.
The CDC guidance comes as two top infectious disease experts with ties to the federal government have advised people over 60 and those with underlying health problems to strongly consider avoiding activities that involve large crowds, such as traveling by airplane, going to movie theaters or concerts, attending family events, shopping at crowded malls and going to religious services.
Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime adviser to the CDC, said people in those two groups "should strongly consider not doing these activities at this juncture."
"This ought to be top of mind for people over 60 and those with underlying health problems, such as heart or lung disease, diabetes, or compromised immune systems," Dr. Schaffner added. "The single most important thing you can do to avoid the virus is reduce your face-to-face contact with people."
Michael Osterholm, the former state epidemiologist for Minnesota, agreed.
"I think clearly the time has come to take these steps," said Mr. Osterholm, who has served on committees advising the federal government on public health issues and is director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
Both experts, who are over age 60, said they have taken some of these steps themselves.
"When my wife and I need to go shopping, we're going late at night when there are no crowds, and we get in and out efficiently," Dr. Schaffner said.
Meanwhile, Florida health officials said late Friday that two people who tested positive for the new coronavirus have died in the state.
The Florida Department of Health said the two people who died were in their 70s and had traveled overseas.
One of them was a man with underlying health issues in Santa Rosa County, in Florida's Panhandle, according to the statement. It added that the second death was that of an elderly person in Lee County, in the Fort Myers area.
He added that his wife often goes to a bridge club with dozens of other people - but not anymore.
"She enjoys bridge and it's an important part of her life and it keeps her mentally active, but she's going to give it up for a while," he said.
Mr. Osterholm said he has canceled some air travel plans.
"It's always been easy to be abstract when you're a public health person when something's happening in Africa or Asia or the Arabian peninsula," he said. "But now it's happening here, and we have to internalize this."

Texto completo: The House hinted Friday that it might have to arrest former White House counsel Don McGahn and other Trump administration officials to force the federal courts to decide whether congressional subpoenas can be enforced against current and former executive branch officials.
Lawyers for the House Judiciary Committee made the statements in a petition to have the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rehear its lawsuit to force Mr. McGahn to testify as part of a probe into the actions of President Donald Trump.
Last week, a three-judge D.C. Circuit panel ruled that Congress doesn't have the right to have courts enforce its subpoenas and pointed to political tools.
The House lawyers wrote Friday that those tools "only invite further constitutional brinkmanship and are poor substitutes for judicial subpoena enforcement," such as using Congress's inherent contempt power to arrest officials who could then bring legal challenges to their detention.
"The House could direct its Sergeant at Arms to arrest current and former high-level Executive Branch officials for failing to respond to subpoenas, after which the legal issues dividing the branches would then be litigated through habeas actions," the lawyers wrote. "But arrest and detention should not be a prerequisite to obtaining judicial resolution of the enforceability of a Congressional subpoena."
Ohio State reaches deal with victims
Ohio State University reached an unspecified settlement with nearly half of the roughly 350 men who say they were sexually abused decades ago by a team doctor who was jokingly known among some athletes by nicknames like "Dr. Jelly Paws."
The settlement announced Friday is the first for accusers of the late Richard Strauss, who say the doctor groped and otherwise mistreated students for two decades while school officials knew about concerns but did little to stop him.
With the settlement not yet finalized, the school and others involved are staying mum about how much would be paid. Ohio State said in a statement that the payments will not come from tuition or taxpayer or donor money.
Trump campaign sues CNN for libel
The Trump campaign filed a libel lawsuit against CNN on Friday for a column about the president and election help from Russia, the third such action against a news organization taken in the past two weeks.
The campaign said a piece by Larry Noble from last June falsely claims the campaign considered seeking Russia's help in the 2020 campaign. The lawsuit says the article doesn't back up that statement with evidence.
Earlier this week, the campaign sued The Washington Post for similar opinion pieces. A week earlier, The New York Times was the target.
SXSW called off over coronavirus fears
The South by Southwest festival, an iconic event that annually attracts more than 100,000 music fans, technology buffs and pop culture enthusiasts to Austin, Texas, each March, has been called off this year amid growing global fears about a possible coronavirus pandemic.
The cancellation came just seven days before the festival was scheduled to start on March 13.

Texto completo: Here's what you need to know about testing for COVID-19:
A doctor will order the coronavirus test based on a medical evaluation and history of recent travel.
The test can be done at a doctor's office, hospital or clinic.
The physician will swab the back of the nose and throat for specimens.
By Monday, two big commercial diagnostic labs operating in Western Pennsylvania - LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics Inc. - will be doing coronavirus testing.
UPMC Health Plan does not cover testing by LabCorp. Check your health plan or contact your insurance carrier to confirm coverage details.
Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna Corp. and CVS Health's Aetna plans are waiving copays and deductibles for coronavirus testing. Other plans may be considering similar offers.
Test results are sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation.
If you test positive, you may be asked to stay at home, away from others, for 14 days. The quarantine is voluntary.
Most COVID-19 cases are mild; some cases are fatal, especially among the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions.

Texto completo: Welcome back, Weekenders! And wow, are we glad to see you, daylight saving time! We pack 48 hours of fun into 47 hours of clock this weekend, so plan wisely. Stumbling around in a sleep-deprived haze is tough enough without adding regrets about your entertainment choices.
HE SHOOTS: Ben Affleck migrates from supermarket tabloids back to the big screen in “a high school basketball movie with a side of addiction drama," Globe film critic Ty Burr writes in his two-star review. “The Way Back" is no “Hoosiers," but Affleck brings a wealth of lived experience to his portrayal of an alcoholic construction worker at the center of Gavin O'Connor's “earnest and old-fashioned and sturdily made" film. Says Burr: “Regardless of what you think you know about the actor's off-screen life, he gives a better performance than the movie deserves." Now screening .
SAY CHEESE: In “The Times of Bill Cunningham," documentarian Mark Bozek turns his camera on the iconic street photographer — a Boston native — whose timeless images graced the pages of The New York Times for nearly 40 years. “Cunningham shares entertaining anecdotes as well as some insights into his method and aesthetics, which Bozek illustrates with a generous sampling of his subject's photos as well as rare pictures of the man behind the camera," correspondent Peter Keough writes in a three-star review. At the Coolidge .
IN FLIGHT: Eight years after co-writing and directing the rhapsodically received “Beasts of the Southern Wild," Benh Zeitlin is back with “Wendy," a reimagining of “Peter Pan" that earns 2½ stars from Ty Burr. After a strong start, the film's “initial visionary power dissipates into a back half of brilliant notions half-baked and timeless storytelling turned tedious," Burr says of the new release, which Zeitlin wrote with his sister Eliza. “Beware the dream project an artist has carried in his head for too long." Now screening .
ALL AGLOW: With “The Children," the Speakeasy Stage Company mounts a “first-rate production of Lucy Kirkwood's skillfully probing drama," writes Globe theater critic Don Aucoin. “In the contaminated aftermath of a meltdown at a British nuclear power plant, two retired physicists are surprised by a visit to their cottage from a former colleague. They're even more taken aback by the mission that has brought her to their door, one that touches on questions of personal culpability and generational responsibility." Bryn Boice directs Tyrees Allen, Karen MacDonald, and Paula Plum. Through March 28 .
OUTSIDER ART: The Institute of Contemporary Art mounts the “first-ever full survey of the revolution-minded Los Angeles-based artist" Sterling Ruby. The artist's works “represent a sharp undercurrent beneath the country's all-is-well surface," says Globe art critic Murray Whyte. The exhibition “comprises some 70 works along a loose timeline and tracks the artist's fascination with (and unpacking of) dark elements of American culture, from prison architecture to graffiti." Through May 26 .
FROM THE HEART: Award-winning romance novelist Beverly Jenkins discusses “On the Corner of Hope and Main" with Caroline Linden (Callie Crossley of WGBH moderates) at Porter Square Books Saturday. The book is the latest in the “Blessings" series set in the fictional town of Henry Adams, Kan. “Everywhere I go, the readers say they want to move to Henry Adams because of the forgiveness, the love, the sort of uniqueness of . . . how it used to be," the prolific author tells the Globe's Meredith Goldstein.
LAST CALL: Boston Ballet's “rEVOLUTION" assembles work by a dream team of choreographers: George Balanchine (“Agon," with an Igor Stravinsky score), Jerome Robbins (“Glass Pieces," set to music by Philip Glass), and William Forsythe (“In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated"). “The program is riveting from start to finish," writes Globe correspondent Jeffrey Gantz. The final performance of the run is the Sunday matinee.
REMEMBER: Your dining choices near the Opera House no longer include Explorateur, which has closed to make way for Guy Fieri joints Boston Kitchen + Bar and Chicken Guy!, Globe dining correspondent Kara Baskin reports. To visit Flavortown now, head to Guy Fieri's Tequila Cocina, in the Hub on Causeway complex at North Station. On an early visit, Globe restaurant critic Devra First found “real joy at the prospect of this place" but concluded that “it doesn't have enough Guy Fieri going on." (And don't forget to vote in the Globe's Munch Madness competition.)
OR STAY IN: In more news from the world of local let's-just-say-cultural icons who broke out in the 1990s, while Ben Affleck is at the multiplex, Mark Wahlberg is right there in your TV (or other preferred entertainment-delivery system) starring in “Spenser Confidential." “This one is steeped in Bostonia," Globe TV critic Matthew Gilbert says of the film, featuring characters created by Robert B. Parker. Marky Mark plays the legendary private detective, with Winston Duke as his sidekick Hawk. It is streaming on Netflix .
Somewhat improbably, Nanette Burstein's documentary “Hillary" feels even more topical this weekend than it did before Super Tuesday. Hillary Rodham Clinton “talks about the misogyny she has encountered," writes Matthew Gilbert, and “about how daughter Chelsea (also interviewed) kept her parents together when Bill Clinton (also interviewed) was impeached for lying about his affair." The four-part film is on Hulu .
Reality still feeling a little too raw? FX on Hulu introduces itself with “Devs," starring Sonoya Mizuno (“Ex Machina") as a software engineer at a mysterious company in the Bay Area. The supporting cast includes Nick Offerman, Alison Pill, and veteran character actor Zach Grenier. The eight-part sci-fi series, says Matthew Gilbert, “is a cerebral pleasure that gets very philosophical and presses its brainy atmosphere with lots of ponderous soundtrack music and deadpan acting." “Devs," you had me at “Nick Offerman."
BUT REALLY: Remember last week, when Devra First and I encouraged you to tamp down your coronavirus fears and take your appetite (and wallet) to Chinatown? Wash your hands and get over there! “Until the CDC suggests we all self-isolate and live in quarantine, I'll eat in Chinatown the same way I still dine at my other favorite eateries," writes Globe columnist Jeneé Osterheldt. “There is no Boston without Chinatown."
Also last week, I mangled one of the first adages I ever learned in describing what happens when daylight saving time starts. Much as I would love to tell you that it was a test to see who actually got all the way to the end of the Weekender, it was not. Apologies for that, and sincere thanks to readers Joe, Joan, and Robin, who kindly (really! so nicely!) reminded me that when we change the clocks this weekend, we “spring forward." Make the most of your short weekend, Weekenders!

Texto completo: Some say there's an art to a non-apology apology, that it usually involves the word, "if."
I'm sorry if you were offended. I'm sorry if you feel that way.
I regret it if my words were taken out of context.
And there's the vaguely passive-aggressive, and wildly popular variant, sorry, not sorry.
They seem ubiquitous these days, tumbling from the lips of politicians, embroiled corporate executives and celebrities, a never-ending stream of carefully crafted, legally vetted, dodging of responsibility. At least that's the way children's book author Carmen Agra Deedy sees it.
"You know, there are are a million ways to not say 'I'm sorry' nowadays," Deedy said last week from her metro Atlanta home. "It's ridiculous."
Which is why Deedy, the New York Times best-selling author of "14 Cows for America," and Emmy award-winning storyteller, decided to explore that idea in her latest book, "Rita & Ralph's Rotten Day," released Tuesday by Scholastic Press. While Deedy has spent her career writing books for older children, "Rita&Ralph" is her first picture book for preschool and kindergartners. Learning how to say you're sorry, and truly meaning it, is a lesson that can't be taught too early. Yet it's a moral skill that seems to become more and more slippery as we age, she said.
From her TED talks to NPR commentaries on All Things Considered, Deedy has told the story of what it was like growing up in a family of Cuban refugees who settled in Decatur, after fleeing the regime of Fidel Castro. It was in that small Cuban refugee community in Decatur that Deedy learned the art of storytelling, beginning when she was three years old, by listening to adults tell stories of the island. Reading was difficult for her because her dyslexia went undiagnosed until she was an adult. As a child that difficulty, along with her accented speech, made her the target of bullies. But her love of story did not wane. With persistence, she found refuge in books and later, as a young mother in her early 20s, she began writing for kids like her two daughters.
But she never forgot about the bullies who did not apologize. She still remembers them, even now, at 60 years old.
"I physically got beaten up all the time," Deedy said, her voice breaking at the thought of it. "They were privileged kids, and the teacher gave tacit permission for me to be bullied."
The characters in the new book are not archenemies. They aren't even frenemies. They are best friends, but during a game of Stick and Stones, things go awry. The remainder of the book, illustrated by Pete Oswald, explores the roots of a true, heartfelt apology: humility, self-reflection and the maturity to admit you're wrong.
Deedy visits schools across the country half of the year. She said that during the past two to five years, teachers have told her they've seen an uptick in physical fights between kids who don't seem to have good, face-to-face conflict resolution skills. The observations are anecdotal, but Deedy said teachers have told her they suspect the deficit is linked to increased screen time with devices and less person-to-person interaction.
"I'm not a catastrophist," Deedy said. "But our children are starved for human interaction. We are still carbon-based life forms. AI is not going away, but we need to check it."
The way Deedy tells a story in front of a room full of children, but also adults, prompted the Smithsonian to name her to its Library Advisory Board in January.
"Not only is Carmen a consummate storyteller and author, but she has taken her message of creativity and personal narrative into classrooms and public libraries across the country," said Susan Battley, chair of the Smithsonian Library Advisory Board in an email. "Her stories spark imagination and possibility in young minds, and encourage children's learning andempowerment."
In the end, Deedy's characters learn that a true apology, one that is not couched with hedge words or quips, is also a form of empowerment rather than diminishment.

Texto completo: The venue will expand its cultural offerings with a slate of multidisciplinary works, including projects by its master artist-in-residence, Ta-Nehisi Coates.
Throughout the 1970s and until the 1990s, the Apollo Theater in Harlem repeatedly fell on hard times and then bounced back to life again. But recent changes suggest that that is in the past and that the world-famous venue is now thriving.
On Thursday, the Apollo announced a large-scale initiative to present a series of commissioned projects by artists. Supported by a $ 2 million grant from the Ford Foundation and a $ 1 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, "Apollo New Works" includes dance, theater and musical performances, as well as projects by Ta-Nehisi Coates, who became the Apollo's inaugural master artist-in-residence in September.
Among the other participating artists are the dance organization Ballet Hispánico, the storytelling project Black Gotham Experience and the playwright and screenwriter Keith Josef Adkins.
"We felt like we had to take a more forward-looking stance," Kamilah Forbes, the executive producer of the Apollo, said in an interview. The goal is for the venue to not only present new pieces, she said, but "to be a home for these artists to build and cultivate their work."
"Apollo New Works" is also an effort to "make a major shift in equity" and commission more black artists, Ms. Forbes said.
The program follows two recent commissions at the Apollo: the stage adaptation of Coates's acclaimed book "Between the World and Me," and the opera "We Shall Not Be Moved," a co-commission with Opera Philadelphia that was created by the composer Daniel Bernard Roumain and the librettist Marc Bamuthi Joseph.
"Apollo New Works" is "an opportunity to put a much larger stake in the ground," Ms. Forbes said.
The Apollo will showcase many of the projects at two new black box theaters at the Victoria, a former movie theater on West 125th Street that is being redeveloped, and is scheduled to open in the fall.

Texto completo: A fantasy inspired by the music of the Beatles lands on HBO, and a true crime series from FX comes to Hulu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's on TV
YESTERDAY (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. This Beatles-themed romantic comedy from the director Danny Boyle ("Trainspotting") begins when Jack (Himesh Patel), a struggling singer-songwriter, gets hit by a bus during a mysterious global blackout. Suddenly -- and with little explanation as to why -- the Beatles have been wiped from history, and Jack is the only one who remembers them. So he does what any desperate artist would do. He performs and takes credit for their songs, becoming a rock star overnight. But a familiar lesson arises: Fame can't buy love after all. The movie opened to mixed reviews last summer. Some critics said it's best enjoyed if not taken too seriously, while others, like The New York Times's A.O. Scott, said the plot could have dug deeper. "'Yesterday' is more of a novelty earworm than a classic," he wrote. "It wasn't made to last."
THE SHOP: UNINTERRUPTED 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Hosted by Maverick Carter, LeBron James's childhood friend and business partner, this talk show gathers big names in sports, business and entertainment for a no-holds-barred round-table discussion in a barber shop. This new episode features seven guests, including the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the actor Chadwick Boseman and the rapper Roddy Ricch, who discuss their various industries and the basketball star Kobe Bryant's legacy, with occasional comedic relief from the actor Tiffany Haddish.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Last week, "Saturday Night Live" addressed the coronavirus in a cold open with several cast members, along with the host, John Mulaney, and guest appearances by Larry David, Fred Armisen and Rachel Dratch. Now the virus has become more than fodder for jokes: The upcoming James Bond flick "No Time to Die," which was set to open in April, is now opening in November because of coronavirus concerns. But its star, Daniel Craig, had already been set to host this weekend's episode, making it a very early promotion for the movie. The cast will most likely find a way to work the awkward schedule into their skits. Craig will be joined by the musical guest The Weeknd, who released a short film this week ahead of the upcoming album "After Hours."
What's Streaming
THE MOST DANGEROUS ANIMAL OF ALL Stream on Hulu. True-crime fans can probably zip through this new series in a single day. Based on Gary L. Stewart's book of the same name, the show follows Stewart's journey in search of his biological father. After 10 years of digging, he comes to believe his father was none other than the Zodiac -- the unidentified serial killer who murdered six people in Northern California in the late 1960s. All four episodes of the series debuted on FX on Friday, and they are now available to stream on Hulu.

Texto completo: Adam Kucharski studies how diseases spread, but he's not handling viruses in the lab or treating sick people in the hospital. He's a mathematician at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and he uses math to understand outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, SARS, influenza and now Covid-19. His goal is to design better ways to control outbreaks.
In an eerie coincidence, he wrote a book called "The Rules of Contagion," before the current outbreak, which has been published in Britain and will be released in September in the United States. In it he talks about the math of contagion involving not only physical diseases, but also ideas, rumors and even financial crises.
In a recent experiment for the 100th anniversary of the 1918 flu, he worked with another mathematician and BBC presenter, Hannah Fry, of University College London, and collaborators at the University of Cambridge, to create a documentary, "Contagion: The BBC Four Pandemic," using a phone app to track social contacts and map how an infection might spread.
The news of coronavirus epidemics around the world involves a flood of numbers that are a challenge for any nonscientist to digest. I asked Dr. Kucharski to help us navigate some of these numbers, and to tell us which ones we should pay attention to. We talked on the phone and corresponded by email this week. This is an edited version of our back and forth.
We hear a lot about the percentage of sick people who are dying. Is that the case fatality rate?
The case fatality rate measures the risk that someone who develops symptoms will eventually die from the infection.
And how is that rate calculated?
Ideally, we would monitor a large group of people from the point at which they develop symptoms until they later die or recover, then calculate the proportion of all these cases who had died.
So can we just look at the total number of deaths and the current number of cases?
The problem with just dividing the total number of deaths and total number of cases is that it doesn't account for unreported cases or the delay from illness to death. The delay is crucial: If 100 people arrive at hospital with Covid-19 on a given day, and all are currently still alive, it obviously doesn't mean that the fatality rate is 0 percent. We need to wait until we know what happens to them eventually.
Any deaths will be people who got sick two to three weeks ago, so it's not simply deaths at the moment divided by cases at the moment. Plus some cases might be missed: If you have two deaths from two cases, as happened in Iran last month, that most likely means you've missed a bunch of cases.
We've seen all sorts of numbers for fatality rates. Does the latest estimate of 3.4 percent globally make sense?
Early on, people looked at total current cases and deaths, which, as I said, is a flawed calculation, and concluded that the case fatality rate must be 2 percent based on China data. If you run the same calculation on yesterday's totals for China, you get an apparent CFR (case fatality rate) of near 4 percent. People are speculating that something is happening with the virus, where it actually is just this statistical illusion that we've known about from Day 1. I'd say on best available data, when we adjust for unreported cases and the various delays involved, we're probably looking at a fatality risk of probably between maybe 0.5 and 2 percent for people with symptoms.
I had a short Twitter thread explaining this (and predicting the rise) a couple of weeks ago:
What about another number we hear about all the time, R, the reproductive number, or how many people a given patient is likely to infect. Why is it important and what goes into calculating it?
At its simplest, R is the answer to the question: How worried should we be about infection? If R is above one, each case, on average, is giving it to at least one other person. You're going to see growth.
If it's less than one, then a group of infected people are generating less infection. From a policy-planning point of view, it gives you a very clear objective. For example, in the Ebola response in 2014, it was a really prominent part of the response. The aim was to get R below one.
That seems very simple and straightforward, but you write that it's more complicated than it seems. In your book you say that to calculate R you've got to know duration, opportunity, transmission probability and susceptibility (the "DOTS"). Let's take them one by one. What is duration?
How long someone is infectious. If someone is infectious twice as long, then that's twice as long that they are around to spread infection.
Do we know what the duration is for this coronavirus?
On average, we'd probably be looking at a week or two. Of course, if people get hospitalized, then they're not in the community spreading infection in the same way.
The second component is opportunity. How do you determine that?
That's a measure of how many people you come into contact with for every day you're infectious. With something like flu, you're not infectious very long but a lot of your interactions could potentially spread it. Whereas with something like HIV, the duration is much longer but the number of sexual partners you have relative to the number of conversations you have is obviously much lower.
And transmission probability?
This is a measure of the chance the infection will get across during an interaction. For example, during a sexual encounter, the virus won't necessarily get across.
Finally there's susceptibility. How do you determine that?
Susceptibility measures the chance the person at the other end of the interaction will pick up the infection and become infectious themselves.
Once you've got numbers for these four components, what's the equation to come up with R?
If you multiply them together, you get the reproduction number. So if you scale up or scale down any one of these things, it directly affects the value of R.
How does this knowledge help public health planning?
Generally, susceptibility is the easiest one to reduce if we have things like vaccines. If we don't, then we have to think about targeting the other aspects of transmission, such as reducing opportunities through social distancing, or probability of transmission during things like handshakes by encouraging hand washing.
What if you're not in public health, but are thinking about your own personal chances and what your behavior should be?
If you imagine you've got a reproduction number of two, each person's infecting two others, on average. But some situations are more likely to spread infection than others. We've found for things like Covid-19, it's close-knit interactions that seem to be most important.
What we need to think about -- and what a lot of our modeling is certainly thinking about -- is not just how much transmission is happening, but where is that transmission happening. If you're going to change your behavior, think how to reduce those risky situations as much as possible.
If you were the average person, what would you pay attention to -- in terms of the news and the numbers?
One signal to watch out for is if the first case in an area is a death or a severe case, because that suggests you had a lot of community transmission already. As a back of the envelope calculation, suppose the fatality rate for cases is about 1 percent, which is plausible. If you've got a death, then that person probably became ill about three weeks ago. That means you probably had about 100 cases three weeks ago, in reality. In that subsequent three weeks, that number could well have doubled, then doubled, then doubled again. So you're currently looking at 500 cases, maybe a thousand cases.
I think the other thing that people do need to pay attention to is the risk of severe disease and fatality, particularly in older groups, in the over-70s, over-80s. Over all we're seeing maybe 1 percent of symptomatic cases are fatal across all ages. There's still some uncertainty on that, but what's also important is that 1 percent isn't evenly distributed. In younger groups, we're talking perhaps 0.1 percent, which means that when you get into the older groups, you're potentially talking about 5 percent, 10 percent of cases being fatal.
In thinking about social behavior and thinking about your interactions, the question should be, "How do we stop transmission getting into those groups where the impact could be really severe?"

Texto completo: The State Legislature, controlled by Democrats, voted to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would let an independent commission draw district maps.
WASHINGTON -- Democrats in Virginia's State Legislature took a blue-moon political step on Friday and voted to largely strip themselves of the power to draw new political maps next year -- maps that could well have locked them into power for a decade. But to say they acted grudgingly is an understatement.
The State House of Delegates voted 54 to 46 to place a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would establish an independent commission to draw maps in 2021, when population totals from this year's census will form the basis for redistricting. Separate legislation laying out rules for the panel and its actions was sent to a conference committee and seems certain to be approved later.
Nine Democrats, who hold 55 seats in the 100-seat House, voted in favor of the amendment and 46 opposed it. Only support from the Republican minority ensured that the measure would go to the voters, who are expected to approve it.
That was a marked change from last year's bipartisanship, when the Legislature approved an identical version of the proposed amendment, the first move in a two-vote process needed to place such measures on the ballot. At the time, Democrats were in the minority in the House, and the amendment passed with overwhelming support from both parties, 85 to 13. Republicans controlled both houses of the Legislature but were widely expected to lose power, which they did, in November.
Many Democrats had made campaign promises to support the amendment on its second vote, and they were under intense pressure to make good on the pledge. The State Senate had earlier voted, 38-2, in favor of the proposed amendment. But passage in the House was uncertain until the final hours, as African-American Democrats raised questions about protections for minority districts and as others simply appeared to get cold feet.
"All of a sudden, the deal that an overwhelming majority of Democrats were willing to sign on to and campaign for in the fall of 2019 is no longer good enough," said David Daley, an author and senior fellow at the advocacy group FairVote who supported the measure.
Advocates of the amendment nevertheless called its passage a seminal moment. "This is historic for Virginia to take a step forward on changing our broken redistricting system," said Brian Cannon, the executive director of OneVirginia, a grass-roots group that drove the amendment campaign. "It puts citizens at the table with legislators for the first time ever. It takes it out of the smoky back room and adds sunlight and transparency."
The proposed amendment creates a 16-member redistricting body composed of eight legislators -- four each from the two major parties -- and eight citizens. Disputes over boundaries would be settled by a court-appointed special master. If approved by voters, it also would enshrine specific voting-rights protection for minorities into the State Constitution for the first time.
Democrats nationally have sought to capture the high ground on the question of gerrymandering in recent years, as Republican-controlled legislatures drew map after map in the last decade that preserved their holds on power even when voters spurned them.
That said, the leader of the national party's campaign against gerrymandering, the former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., had not publicly supported the Virginia measure. A spokesman, Patrick Rodenbush, said there were concerns that its protections against partisan interference were not strong enough.
On Friday, Mr. Holder said in a statement that he was still concerned about the amendment's protections for minorities, and said he worried that there would be too little time for an independent panel to be assembled and start work before redistricting begins in early 2021. But debate over alternative amendments "helped bring to light some of its weaknesses, many of which, but not all, have been addressed by enabling legislation."
The Virginia debate unfolded as Republicans in three other states have moved to roll back ballot initiatives favoring nonpartisan redistricting that voters approved in 2018.
In Missouri, where 60 percent of voters backed a constitutional amendment mandating nonpartisan maps, the Republican-controlled Legislature is pushing a new amendment initiative that would effectively repeal that overhaul. The citizens group that shepherded the first measure to passage, Clean Missouri, has pledged to fight it, calling the proposal "gerrymandering, plain and simple."
Sean Nicholson, the campaign director for Clean Missouri, predicted that any change the Legislature proposes will be turned down in November. "People voted by an almost two-to-one margin -- Republicans, Democrats, independents -- to pass this in 2018," he said in an interview. "One thing we've seen is that voters are legitimately angry at the idea of politicians trying to overturn their vote."
Michigan Republicans first sought to strip state funds from an independent redistricting commission that voters approved, and then filed suit in federal court last July to abolish it, calling the panel "blatantly unconstitutional."
And in Utah, the anti-gerrymandering group Better Boundaries reached a compromise on a new redistricting procedure with that state's Republican-controlled Legislature, which was poised to neuter a citizen-passed plan handing political map drawing to an independent panel.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Don't Forget Your Tote Bag! Ban on Plastic Arrives" (news article, Feb. 29):
New Yorkers should celebrate the start of their plastic bag ban. I live in Osorno, a small city in southern Chile, which was one of the first in this country to adopt a similar ban, which became national law in 2018.
People here overwhelmingly support the measure. Our rivers and parks are noticeably cleaner. I applaud New York, such a powerful international symbol of the United States, for finally getting on board.

Texto completo: Thousands who have the coronavirus or were exposed have been asked to seclude themselves. It's harder than it sounds.
Stay home unless you must see a doctor. No work, school or shopping. If you must come out of your room, wear a mask. And don't share towels.
If you are among the thousands of Americans now self-quarantined because of possible infection with the coronavirus, these are a few of the new house rules, courtesy of your local health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Among people told to self-quarantine, isolate themselves or stay home are people returning from parts of China and Iran, those who developed symptoms after spending time in other countries with sustained community transmission, and those with no known exposure who are sick.
But many individuals who don't fit neatly into any of these categories and weren't asked to stay home are choosing to seclude themselves anyway, because they don't want to put others at risk. California has more than 5,500 people in self-quarantine. More than 2,700 are in seclusion in New York City alone.
It may sound like a vacation from reality, an ideal time to binge on Netflix and catch up on sleep. In fact, it's not easy to lock yourself away from family and friends. There are practical and logistical challenges, and yawning gaps in the official advice that make it even harder.
The terms of home isolation can be onerous and may last for two weeks, which is the presumed incubation period for the virus. It is especially challenging if you have young children or elderly relatives to care for, or live in cramped quarters with a lot of roommates.
The basics
Isolation If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your elderly aunt. You shouldn't even pet your dog. And definitely no snuggling with your pet (no licking).
If you don't have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. You should use a separate bathroom, if you have one.
No visitors, and no staff, unless it's absolutely essential. Don't take the bus or subway, not even a taxi.
Masks If you must be around other people -- in your home, or in a car, because you're on your way to see a doctor, and only after you called first -- you should wear a mask, and everyone else should, too.
But first, you or one of your friends or family members have to find masks, which are sold out almost everywhere.
Hygiene If you cough or sneeze, you should cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, and discard the used tissue in a lined trash can. Then you must immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
You can use sanitizer, if you can find it, but soap and water are preferred.
Even if you haven't coughed or sneezed, you should wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven't just washed them.
Disinfect Don't share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels or bedding with anyone (including your pets). Wash these items after you use them.
Countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables are considered "high-touch surfaces" -- wipe them often with a household cleanser.
Frequently wipe down surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids, including blood and stool.
Monitoring Keep an eye on your health and call a doctor if your symptoms are getting worse. Make sure to tell the medical staff you are being monitored for the coronavirus.
Household members Family members and other occupants should monitor the patient's symptoms and call a health provider if they see a turn for the worse.
Housemates can go to work or school, but it's going to be their job to stock up on groceries, pick up prescriptions, take care of the quarantined and keep the place clean. They'll be wiping down doorknobs and countertops, doing loads of laundry and washing their hands -- a lot.

When around the patient, household members must wear a face mask, and both mask and gloves if they have contact with his or her bodily fluids. These should be thrown away immediately, never reused.
Elderly members of the household and those with chronic medical conditions are at particular risk if they are infected. Contact with the secluded individual should be minimized.
Other occupants of the home should wash their hands frequently and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. They should stay in a room separate from that of the exposed or sick individual. If feasible, other members of the household should not share a bathroom with the secluded person.
They should monitor their own health, too, and call a doctor if they develop a cough, fever or shortness of breath.
Unanswered questions
No one pays you for self-quarantine. There is no reimbursement for products you may need, no government-paid nurse to stop by the home and help out. Self-quarantine is a hardship for both those who have families and those who live alone.
Not everyone can work remotely. A two-week absence from work can take an enormous financial toll on hourly wage workers who have to clock in and show up to get paid, or who are part of the gig economy with no single employer.
Many Americans, maybe most, live paycheck to paycheck.
"We have to have social interventions to incentivize and support isolation, or we are doomed," said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center.
People with no health insurance, inadequate insurance or no regular doctor will be reluctant to seek care if they have symptoms, fearing steep medical bills, he noted. Undocumented individuals, fearful of being discovered and deported, may avoid diagnosis and care.
"I don't see the state or federal government preparing for this in any way," Dr. Caplan added.
Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, have introduced legislation that would require all employers to let workers accrue seven days of sick leave, while providing another 14 days for immediate use during a public health emergency.
Washington State's website says the health department can help with groceries for those unable to leave their homes and even intervene with employers on their behalf if necessary.
Providing for people who make sacrifices for the greater good is crucial, said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law.
"We ought to have a social compact: If you're sick, whether you've got Covid-19 or not, you should separate yourself from society," Mr. Gostin said. "That's your part of the bargain, you're doing it for your neighbors, your family and your community."
"In exchange," he said, "we as a nation owe you the right to a humane period of separation, where we meet your essential needs like medicine, health care, food and sick pay."

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are longtime allies on the left. But her pool of voters generally doesn't look like his base.
Welcome to Poll Watch , our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election .
Throughout the 2020 presidential race, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have seemed like reluctant foes.
They met with each other before starting their campaigns. They had each other's backs at the debates, until they didn't. Most important, they agreed on how to confront the issues -- boldly and structurally -- if not always on the exact details.
But Ms. Warren's pool of voters, who are casting for an alternative after she dropped out of the Democratic race on Thursday, generally doesn't look like Mr. Sanders's base. There is reason to believe that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could pick up nearly as many of Ms. Warren's former voters as Mr. Sanders does.
"Obviously the more strong liberal policy folks should break more for Sanders than Biden," Paul Maslin, a longtime Democratic pollster, said in an interview. "But I don't know that it's going to be anywhere near unanimous. If Biden is over the hump and is now clearly the accepted candidate as the best to beat Trump, and there's a coalescing of the party around that view, he's going to gain all kinds of support."
There is certainly significant overlap between the core support of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the party's two leading liberals. He is particularly well positioned to usurp the kinds of older millennials and Generation X liberals who often favored Ms. Warren.
Indeed, in a Quinnipiac poll conducted early last month, when Mr. Biden was reeling from a weak performance in the Iowa caucuses, Ms. Warren's voters were four times as likely to name Mr. Sanders as their second choice as they were to pick Mr. Biden.
Even still, only a third of her supporters in that poll pointed to Mr. Sanders as a runner-up. That equals out to less than 5 percent of the Democratic electorate. Besides, a lot has happened in the past month; most other candidates have disappeared from the race, and much of the party has united behind Mr. Biden.
Most troublingly for Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren's support profile has roughly as much overlap with Mr. Biden's as it does with his.
Ms. Warren's base is heavily tilted toward college graduates, women, white people and middle-to-high-earners. It's not as if Mr. Sanders has been unable to win votes in these demographics. For instance, his backers on Super Tuesday were just as likely to be women as to be men.
But there is a working-class tilt to Mr. Sanders's support that does not play out with Ms. Warren's. He is diminishingly popular as you go up the income scale, whereas the opposite is true of Ms. Warren.
If the average Warren voter is an upper-middle-class white woman, Mr. Sanders is in a tough spot: He has serious vulnerabilities among this group. In Massachusetts -- where Mr. Sanders beat Ms. Warren in her home state by five percentage points -- he won just one-fifth of white women with college degrees, making this his weakest such age-education-gender group. Ultimately he lost the state to Mr. Biden by seven points.
"For most suburban or upper-middle-class white women, Joe Biden is a pretty comfortable place to land," Mr. Maslin said.
"There's the Obama connection, there's a sense of stability and experience that's probably pretty helpful, and then to the extent that they're being pragmatic, they probably see him as a potentially stronger candidate against Trump," he added, though he noted that polling did not suggest that either Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders was significantly better positioned for the general election.
The good news for Mr. Sanders is that Ms. Warren's backers are highly likely to identify as liberals -- even more so than his own -- and exit polls suggest that the two candidates' voters tend to agree on the issues.
The bad news for him is that his remaining rival, Mr. Biden, has already shown an ability to win over a solid chunk of liberal voters. In Super Tuesday states with available data, 40 to 60 percent of Biden voters identified as liberals.
But the moderate former vice president isn't an ideal choice for Ms. Warren's voters, either. He has not articulated policy goals nearly as far-reaching or precise as Ms. Warren did. Many of her higher-educated, technocratic-minded voters may struggle to find either candidate convincing.
Ultimately, Ms. Warren's voters are likely to wash out, unless she makes a big endorsement that effectively pushes them one way or the other. And even in that case, it can be hard for candidates to break through with certain demographics that have proved stubbornly averse to them.
The fundamental problems for Mr. Sanders as he looks to stall Mr. Biden's momentum are that he cannot seem to break through with black voters or older voters, in spite of his increasingly targeted appeals to African-Americans and his campaign's focus on his lifelong attempts to preserve Social Security. Ms. Warren's base -- heavily white, and light on voters over 65 -- doesn't have much to offer him on those fronts.

Texto completo: Prebble won the annual prize for female playwrights, for her work about a Russian assassination on British soil.
Lucy Prebble -- the British playwright and writer for TV series including "Succession" -- won the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize on Monday for "A Very Expensive Poison," an acclaimed play about a Russian assassination on British soil.
The Blackburn Prize, worth $ 25,000, is one of the most prominent awards for female playwrights. Previous winners have included Lynn Nottage's "Sweat" and, last year, Jackie Sibblies Drury's "Fairview."
Prebble's play, which premiered at the Old Vic in London last year, is about the 2006 killing in London of Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy, who drank green tea laced with polonium. The play follows Litvinenko as he investigates his own death, and his wife Marina's quest for justice.
Critics praised the play for its inventiveness, as much as its political drive. It included songs, puppets, and even an offstage President Vladimir V. Putin trying to direct the action and divert the audience's attention from the killing.
"If the onstage result sometimes seems messy and scattershot, well, you get the impression that theatrical tidiness has taken a deliberate back seat to outrage," Matt Wolf wrote in a review for The New York Times.
"It's a wonderful one-off," Dominic Maxwell wrote in The Times of London, adding that the play was "as tender as it is clever, as incensed as it is inventive."
"I wasn't expecting to get any international recognition, so it's really thrilling," Prebble said in a telephone interview. Britain and America "are in a similar place culturally and artistically," she added, so the play's message of a woman's struggle to overcome Russian interference clearly struck a chord with audiences and the judges.
Prebble has been shortlisted for the Blackburn Prize several times before, including for "Enron," which told the story of the downfall of this American energy company.
Some 160 other plays were nominated for the award. The 10-strong shortlist included Celine Song's "Endlings," which opens at New York Theater Workshop on March 9, and Anne Washburn's "Shipwreck," which is at the Woolly Mammoth Theater in Washington until March 8.
The judges also gave a special commendation, worth $ 10,000, to Aleshea Harris, for "What To Send Up When It Goes Down," her production about people of color who lost their lives to "racialized violence."
Ben Brantley, The New York Times's co-chief theater critic, called it a "truly remarkable new work" when it opened in 2018 at A.R.T./New York Theaters. It was as much "a ritual" and "a dance party" as a play filled with anger, he said.
In 2014, Phoebe Waller-Bridge also received a special commendation, for "Fleabag."

Texto completo: As a bespectacled pitchwoman, she defied a stereotype. She was also a screen actors' labor leader and a familiar voice ("The number you have reached is no longer in service").
During the germinal days of television, just by being herself, the actress Joyce Gordon made a gender stereotype anachronistic.
"I'm not a glamour girl -- most women aren't," she volunteered in a 1961 interview. "I'm an attractive, up-to-date young woman -- glasses and all."
Confident and, clinically, farsighted, Ms. Gordon, who died at 90 on Feb. 28, became famous as "The Girl With the Glasses," for un-self-consciously wearing her signature eyeglasses on camera as she delivered live, on-air advertising pitches for products like Crisco and Duncan Hines cake mixes.
For all the headlines that her eyewear inspired, though, Ms. Gordon was also known for her voice. She reached radio listeners and television viewers through commercials and promotional announcements. Moviegoers heard her in dubbed foreign films -- as a stand-in, for example, for Claudia Cardinale in Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West," released in the United States in 1969.
And, her agent said, she was the voice in the ubiquitous recording that advised telephone callers in the 1980s and '90s that "the number you have reached is no longer in service."
Her daughter, Melissa Grant, confirmed Ms. Gordon's death, in Manhattan.
Ms. Gordon was credited with blazing other trails professionally. According to the Screen Actors Guild, she broke ground in 1966 as the first woman to head a local unit of the union when she was elected president of the New York branch in 1966. She was the first woman to serve as an announcer on a network TV broadcast of a national political convention, in 1980 on ABC, and the first to do on-air promotions for a network, plugging news and sports programs on NBC for four decades.
"Her stature as a pitchwoman and voice-over talent was indispensable in convincing the advertising industry to take seriously the concerns of commercial performers in the early days of that contract," said Gabrielle Carteris, the president of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
Ms. Gordon pitched many household goods and personal products on television, but, as one interviewer wrote, she "has probably done more for the eyesight of the American woman than all the professionals and their lectures."
Her glasses were not a prop.
She had been squinting into the camera while rehearsing a commercial when an advertising agency representative, observing her in the studio, suggested that she wear her glasses on air. He assured her that he would persuade the sponsor to agree to what would be a radical departure from convention at a time when society still subscribed to Dorothy Parker's acerbic aphorism "Men seldom make passes/At girls who wear glasses."
"Gradually, I realized what he was driving at," Ms. Gordon said of the agency man. "The glasses give me identity and authority."
Moreover, she said, "people tend to feel that I'm natural."
She went on to be profiled in Broadcasting magazine in 1960 under the headline "The TV Girl Who Wears Glasses." TV Guide put her on the cover as the first woman to wear glasses while appearing under her own name as a "TV hostess." ("I enjoy being myself instead of playing a part," she was quoted as saying.)
Ms. Gordon said she had felt awkward on dinner dates because she had had trouble reading menus, but added: "Now I wear my glasses, and it doesn't seem to make any difference to the fellows."
Joyce Gordon was born on March 25, 1929, in Des Moines, Iowa, to Jule and Diana (Cohn) Gordon. Her father, a cosmetics and hair-care industry executive, founded the National Barber and Beauty Manufacturers Association.
Reared in Chicago, Ms. Gordon attended the University of Illinois and the University of Wisconsin. She moved to New York City when she was 19, to pursue a career in entertainment. She landed parts on radio and live television programs, including "Studio One" and "Robert Montgomery Presents." She began doing mostly commercials in the mid-1950s.
In addition to her decades of union involvement, she was also active in civic affairs in Westchester County, N.Y., where she lived, as a member of the White Plains City Council.
She was married to Bernard Grant, an actor who was a fixture on soap operas as Dr. Paul Fletcher in "The Guiding Light" and as Steve Burke in "One Life to Live." He died in 2004. Besides her daughter, she is survived by her son, Mark Grant; her sister, Jill Gordon; and a grandson.
A boom in dubbing foreign-language films for English-speaking audiences revitalized Ms. Gordon's career. She became the voice of Annie Girardot, Jeanne Moreau and other stars in movies by Ingmar Bergman, Jean Renoir and Luchino Visconti, filling a professional niche that requires an actress to give up her own persona.
"You have to try to crawl into the other actor's body, to understand how a shrug, a raised eyebrow, a way of breathing can affect the performance," Ms. Gordon told The New York Times in 1982.
Being cast as a disembodied voice onscreen seemed like a variation on the adage about being heard but not seen. After "Once Upon a Time in the West" was released, a reviewer credited Ms. Cardinale, who was born in Tunisia and spoke Italian with a pronounced French accent, for her command of English. Ms. Gordon was unfazed.
"It's an anonymous kind of gratification," she said.

Texto completo: Robin, a.k.a. the Boy Wonder, celebrates his birthday this week: He made his debut in Detective Comics No. 38 on March 6, 1940, and he and Batman became nearly inseparable in the war on crime. But while Bruce Wayne has nearly always worn Batman's cowl, there have been many different characters behind Robin's mask. Here is a look at some of the men and women who have called themselves Robin.
Dick Grayson
First and foremost is Dick Grayson. Like Batman, Dick lost his family to crime. His parents, circus acrobats, were casualties in a mob-protection racket. Batman (Bruce Wayne) trained Dick to help bring the culprit to justice. The two orphans were a positive influence on each other.
Over the next 40 years, Dick evolved from boy wonder to young adult. In his youth, he helped found the Teen Titans, a group of heroes who were sidekicks to the Justice League. During his time with the Titans, he realized he had outgrown his junior partner status. He became Nightwing in 1984 -- and is still Nightwing today -- though he has spent time in other tights.
Dick's moonlighting gigs in other outfits include filling in for Batman and working as a spy. His espionage years leaned into his status as one of the sexiest DC Comics heroes. While he wore a device that obscured his handsome face, two admirers -- Batgirl, a longtime love interest, and Midnighter, a gay superhero -- were able to recognize him from his derrière.
Bruce Wayne
Bruce Wayne once wore a Robin costume in his youth. He used the Robin identity to hide his own when he sought to apprentice with a famed detective named Harvey Harris. Many years later, Bruce learns he did not fool the detective, when a package and a letter arrive from Harris's estate. "I realized that if you were aware I had learned your identity, you'd always feel insecure, so I never told you," the letter states. "I was right, for you have become the greatest detective of all."
Earth-Two Dick Grayson
The concept of Earth-Two allowed for parallel versions of DC's heroes to have been active from their first appearances in the 1930s and 1940s -- and for them to age accordingly. In 1971, the contemporary Robin (then in college) met his older Earth-Two counterpart, who began his career in 1940, and who first met the Justice League in 1967. The older Robin wore a Batman-Robin hybrid costume that was a bit of an eyesore, and the two sidekicks bonded over feeling underestimated by the more seasoned heroes. By the end of this story, the younger Robin had a snazzy new costume lent to him by the elder one. (Unfortunately, it was not a permanent change.) But the elder Dick died wearing the better costume in 1985 during a story line meant to eliminate the parallel worlds.
Jason Todd
Dick thought he found a natural successor as Robin in Jason Todd, who was introduced in 1982. Like Dick, Jason was an acrobat who lost his parents to crime and helped Batman bring in the villain responsible for their deaths. Jason first wore the costume in 1983, though he dyed his hair black to try to pass himself off as the original Robin.
In 1987, the back story of Batman and Robin and Jason was reset: After many years of fighting crime, Bruce and Dick (who at that point was nearly an adult) argued over the dangers of their line of work and dissolved their partnership. A few weeks later, Batman met Jason, reimagined as a young runaway, as he tried to steal the Batmobile's tires. Somehow the Dark Knight decided Jason should be the next Robin. Holy Hypocrite, Batman!
This version of Jason was headstrong and abrasive and was hated by fans. In 1988, DC Comics set up a telephone poll to decide Jason's fate. The New York Times covered these events in an article with the headline, "Holy Bomb Blast! The Real Robin Fights On!" In the poll, 5,343 people voted in favor of Jason dying in an explosion set by the Joker -- 5,271 voted to keep him. Because this is comics and no one -- except for Spider-Man's Uncle Ben -- stays dead forever, Jason came back in 2005. He is now the antihero known as the Red Hood, a name originally used by the Joker.
Carrie Kelley
A love interest of Bruce Wayne's wore the Robin costume in 1941 to help the heroes on a case, but Carrie Kelley made a real splash as a female Robin in 1986. She was introduced in The Dark Knight Returns, which imagines a bleak future in which an older Bruce Wayne comes out of retirement to protect Gotham City. This story also planted the idea for Jason's death in 1988. A Robin costume hangs in a memorial in the Batcave. Bruce looks at the display and thinks: "For Jason. Never. Never again."
Tim Drake
There was a better reception for Tim Drake, who became Robin in 1989. A young Tim was at the circus the night Dick Grayson's parents died. Several months later, Tim saw Robin on TV performing the same quadruple somersault that Dick performed at the circus along with his parents. Tim realized that Dick was Robin and began to obsessively follow the exploits of the Dynamic Duo. Following Jason's death, Tim deduced that Batman was too reckless alone. He tried to convince Dick to return, but his critical assistance in a case made him the perfect successor. Tim now goes by the alter ego Drake.
Stephanie Brown
The next Robin was Stephanie Brown. She was the daughter of a villain known as the Cluemaster and helped foil his crimes as the Spoiler (her first code name). Stephanie temporarily replaced Tim in 2004 after Tim's father discovered his extracurricular activities and forbade him from being Robin. Her tenure was short-lived, though, after she disobeyed Batman's orders: In an attempt to prove her worth, she initiated a gang war in Gotham City with disastrous results, including sustaining seemingly fatal wounds. (Don't worry, she got better.)
Damian Wayne
The Son of the Demon, an original graphic novel published in 1987, was supposed to be a stand-alone story that had no effect on Batman's continuity. It concluded with Batman unaware that Talia al Ghul, the daughter of one of his enemies, is pregnant with his child. But in 2006, that child, Damian Wayne, then a preteen, made his debut and demanded the role of Robin as his birthright. Batman had his gloved hands full: Damian was trained to be an assassin and did not care for the hero's nonlethal methods. Dick Grayson helped wear down some of his edges when he served as Batman to Damian's Robin, during a temporary absence of Bruce Wayne.
Duke Thomas
Lastly, there is Duke Thomas, who was introduced in 2013 and, two years later, became one of the teenagers in Gotham City's We Are Robin movement. The group members wore the colors of the traditional Robin costume and tried to help protect the city. Duke outshone the others and later assisted Batman against a new villain -- Mister Bloom. Batman offered to provide Duke with further training, which he accepted, but not as yet another Robin. In 2018, he decided instead to call himself the Signal, perhaps beginning a legacy that will last for decades.

Texto completo: "As we enter the moment in this campaign where we come down to a two-person race, I think it important for us to differentiate our records, and I intend to do that," Mr. Sanders said.
DETROIT -- Calibrating his approach for a tough head-to-head primary matchup in a year when many Democratic voters want to put up a united front, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Friday renewed his attacks on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s record on trade while also conceding that Mr. Biden could defeat President Trump.
In Michigan, where the Sanders campaign is running a TV ad featuring an autoworker who says his community has been "decimated" by free trade deals, Mr. Sanders attacked Mr. Biden for his support of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s.
"Joe Biden and I have a very serious disagreement with regards to NAFTA," Mr. Sanders said at a round table he convened of workers, union leaders and economists in Detroit before a rally attended by thousands. "Just last year -- I'm not talking about 20 years ago -- Joe said that voting for NAFTA, quote, was not a mistake, end of quote, and a few years before that he called NAFTA a success," Mr. Sanders said. "Joe, you're wrong. NAFTA was not a success. Voting for it was a big, big mistake."
As a long line of mostly young supporters filed into a downtown convention center, organizers called out for any union members to identify themselves. After major disappointments on Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders is hoping for a comeback next Tuesday as six states go to the polls, none more crucial for him than Michigan, the first of several Midwestern industrial states to vote in the next two weeks. Four years ago, he pulled off one of the biggest surprises of his first presidential campaign when he upset Hillary Clinton in Michigan.
"We are in the midst of a very, very difficult primary process," Mr. Sanders told reporters before taking the stage at his rally. "Come Tuesday, maybe Michigan is the most important state."
Asked about Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's endorsement of Mr. Biden on Thursday, Mr. Sanders sounded miffed. "Well, that wasn't her thoughts when I came here to help her get elected, as a matter of fact," he said.
Speaking earlier on Friday with reporters in Phoenix, Mr. Sanders also condemned Mr. Biden's votes as a senator on trade agreements, while brandishing new attacks over Mr. Biden's record on federal funding for abortions, same-sex marriage and the former "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
But in a sign of the careful approach both candidates are taking while seeking to draw distinctions between their campaigns, Mr. Sanders reiterated multiple times that he would support Mr. Biden if he eventually won the presidential nomination, and, pressed by a reporter, said he believed Mr. Biden could beat Mr. Trump in November.
"I think we are the stronger campaign to defeat Donald Trump, but you have not heard me say that I think that Biden cannot defeat Trump," Mr. Sanders said. "I will certainly do everything I can if he is the nominee."
Speaking by phone to attendees at a fund-raiser in Bethesda, Md., on Friday night, Mr. Biden said: "What we can't let happen is let this primary become a negative blood bath. I know I'm going to get a lot of suggestions on how to respond to what I suspect will be an increasingly negative campaign that the Bernie Brothers will run. But we can't tear this party apart and re-elect Trump."
The Biden campaign sent one of its most high-profile new surrogates to Michigan, Senator Amy Klobuchar, but she was far less visible than Mr. Sanders. She toured the backstage areas of an MGM Grand hotel and casino with union leaders, but the event was off-limits to out-of-town reporters.
Mr. Biden plans to visit Michigan on Monday, but Mr. Sanders -- who canceled an appearance in Mississippi -- intends to campaign intensely in the state, visiting Dearborn, Flint, Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor.
After other major candidates quit the Democratic primary race this week, Mr. Sanders has relentlessly and repeatedly contrasted himself with Mr. Biden.
"As we enter the moment in this campaign where we come down to a two-person race, I think it important for us to differentiate our records, and I intend to do that," Mr. Sanders said in Phoenix.
"Joe has been around for a long time; so have I. And I think people would want to take a look at those records," he added. "All I can tell you, whether it's Iraq, whether it's DOMA, whether it's 'don't ask, don't tell' -- those were difficult votes. I was there, on the right side of history, and my friend Joe Biden was not."
He was referring to the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and the policy that prohibited openly gay people from serving in the military.
As a senator, Mr. Biden supported a broad defense bill in 1993 that included the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, but also voted for a failed amendment that would have removed the policy from that bill. He also voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996.
But as vice president, he said in an interview on "Meet the Press" in 2012 that he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex marriage, a stance that was ahead of the Obama White House's policy at the time.
Mr. Sanders also offered a fresh critique on Friday of Mr. Biden's record on the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions. Until June of last year, Mr. Biden had supported the measure, which critics say disproportionately affects poor women and women of color. He reversed his position after sustaining attacks early in his campaign.
"At a time when women are under severe political assault," Mr. Sanders said, "I think people all over this country -- women and men -- are going to look at the record of which candidate has been consistent and strong in terms of defending a woman's right to choose. On this issue, Joe Biden repeatedly voted for the Hyde Amendment."
Mr. Sanders has watched his delegate lead evaporate after the first three nominating contests as Mr. Biden racked up wins in South Carolina and several Super Tuesday states, including some that Mr. Sanders had hoped would wind up in his column.
Moving forward, the two candidates will essentially go head-to-head next week in six states including Michigan, which will present one of their first tests in a major general-election swing state.
On Friday, Mr. Sanders, who is Jewish, also addressed an episode at a rally for his campaign in Phoenix on Thursday, when a man in the crowd unfurled a flag bearing a swastika before he was removed.
"It is horrific," Mr. Sanders said. "It is beyond disgusting to see that in the United States of America there are people who would show the emblem of Hitler and Nazism. And I was shocked to learn about that."
Separately, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that his team had communicated with the federal authorities about the possibility of Secret Service protection for him. Some Democratic lawmakers have called for added security after Mr. Biden's Super Tuesday address was disrupted by protesters who were able to gain access to the stage.

Texto completo: Readers discuss a possible deal between the front-runners, Mike Bloomberg's influence on the race and running mates.
To the Editor:
For the many disappointed Bernie Sanders supporters (including me), we need to keep our eyes on the ball: saving human civilization (and myriad animal species) from extinction. Here's how: Bernie must call up Joe Biden now and tell him that if he will publicly and enthusiastically endorse a Green New Deal, Bernie will quit the race and work to unite the party.
The genius of it is that the Green New Deal is very popular with voters, especially the young voters Mr. Biden needs, so it's a win-win!
Stephen F. Eisenman
Micanopy, Fla.
The writer is co-founder of Anthropocene Alliance, an environmental nonprofit.
To the Editor:
Re "If You Want Real Change, Don't Vote for Sanders" (column, March 5):
Moved by what he describes as pragmatism, Nicholas Kristof says Joe Biden gives the Democrats a good chance of winning despite the fact that he is "plodding and uncharismatic." Even more appalling is his suggestion that Amy Klobuchar could end up as Mr. Biden's running mate. What, then, is the winning strategy? Centrism, whiteness and lack of charisma times two?
If Mr. Biden does indeed become the Democrats' candidate, and if he is really all about unity, let him reach out to Bernie Sanders's partisans with a V.P. pick that might persuade them not to stay home on Election Day. Stacey Abrams and Representatives Maxine Waters and Frederica Wilson are energetic, charismatic and progressive women of color. Biden/Klobuchar would be Clinton/Kaine 2020.
Bill Adler
New York
To the Editor:
Much of the commentary on Mike Bloomberg's race for the Democratic nomination has treated it as a silly attempt to buy an election by a self-aggrandizing billionaire. It was not. Mr. Bloomberg entered when Joe Biden seemed to be faltering and no viable moderate alternative was available.
As soon as the facts changed he bowed out, vowing to put his resources behind Mr. Biden and many down-ticket Democrats. In short, Mr. Bloomberg has been and is deploying his massive resources for good motives harnessed to good sense.
If America emerges in 2020 with a decent government prepared to tackle serious problems in a realistic way, a good bit of credit should go to Mike Bloomberg.
Jerry L. Mashaw
New Haven, Conn.
To the Editor:
If Mike Bloomberg was sincere in his promise to do whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump, here's an idea of how to put his money where his mouth is: Pledge to establish a super PAC that would match on a dollar-for-dollar basis -- or even better, on a two-for-one or three-for-one basis -- every buck donated to Mr. Trump or his super PACs. What a dilemma for G.O.P. contributors to know that their dollar is worth two or three for the Democratic candidate.
William N. Fordes
Santa Monica, Calif.
To the Editor:
I've been listening to all the commentators complaining that, after all is said and done, the choice for Democrats is between two 70-plus-year-old white guys. Much as I would have preferred for Elizabeth Warren or Amy Klobuchar to win the nomination, I believe that it is noteworthy that, for the first time in American history, neither of the likely candidates for one of our two major parties is a Protestant -- and nobody even mentions that.

Lufthansa to Reduce Flight Schedule
Lufthansa Group, one of the world's largest airline companies, said on Friday that it planned to cut flights by up to 50 percent in the coming weeks because of a rapid decline in demand.
It was only on Wednesday that the carrier, whose airlines include Lufthansa German Airlines, Swiss Air and Austrian Airlines, announced a 25 percent reduction in capacity.
Hiring is frozen, the company said, and some employees will be able to take voluntary leave.
REGULATION
The Fed Puts Cash Under Quarantine
The Federal Reserve is keeping cash coming from Asia under a quarantine, and stands ready to extend that effort to money coming in from other countries as deemed necessary.
Dollars that have returned to the United States from Asia, where the coronavirus first surfaced, have been held for a minimum of seven to 10 days since Feb. 21., a Fed spokeswoman said.
If the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or State Department determines that other countries could also present a risk, the Fed is prepared to extend its new procedures to other incoming cash.
BANKING
Banks Prepare Their Contingency Plans
Banks in New York and London are beginning to hive off small parts of their trading desks so that if there is an outbreak of coronavirus at their headquarters, there will at least be a small contingent of traders located elsewhere who can keep business running smoothly.
Bank of America assigned about 100 people to an office outside of Stamford, Conn., on Friday, a person familiar with the matter said. They will continue doing their regular jobs there until further notice, while everyone else reports to their normal work locations.
JPMorgan's backup crews are going from New York to New Jersey, according to a memo seen by The New York Times. In London, the bank is splitting its traders and sales representatives between its offices in Canary Wharf and two other disaster-recovery offices, one elsewhere in London and one in Hampshire, southwest of the capital.
Morgan Stanley is testing plans that would have some employees in sales and trading, as well as in capital markets, work out of a disaster-recovery facility in West London near Heathrow Airport, a person briefed on the matter said on Friday. In New York, Morgan Stanley is also sending some employees to backup locations in Westchester, another person said.
Citigroup is experimenting with various options for dividing groups of employees among different locations, but a spokeswoman declined to share details.

Texto completo: How we tracked down a campus speech from 1988.
On Tuesday's show, at minute 11:12, you hear a piece of archival tape. It's the kind of historical audio we play all the time, in this case of former Vice President Joe Biden, delivering a speech in the late 1980s.
But the process of obtaining that tape was anything but typical. Here's the story.
About 7:30 p.m. on Monday, we were deep into making an episode about a Virginia voter named Brian Keane, a politically moderate suburbanite whose decision-making seemed to mirror that of many Super Tuesday voters.
During the interview, Brian had recalled meeting Biden on the campus of American University, where Brian ran an undergraduate political union. Biden, then a senator from Delaware, was there to talk to the students.
Clare Toeniskoetter, one of our producers, lowered her headphones and wondered aloud: "Did audio from that decades-old speech exist? And if so, could we put it in the episode?" She asked a fellow producer, Robert Jimison, who was working from New York, to investigate.
Robert began hunting online using American University's website. Our guest, Brian, had told us the speech was in 1989. So Robert began there, searching every corner of the web for a speech from that year. Nothing. Finally, he discovered a newspaper clipping mentioning a Biden speech at American University -- from 1988. Brian had misremembered the date. This was a breakthrough.
But so far, there was no evidence of audio. Robert searched every conceivable audio archive. No dice. Then he tried the university's online library catalog.
It turned out that the library had a single DVD of a speech by Biden, from November 13, 1988. Eureka!
But it was marked "campus only." Hmm. What did that mean?
It meant we needed special permission to get it. By now it was 8 p.m. and the library was closing at 11 p.m. We needed this DVD immediately. Robert called the library. A student employee answered but said he could not help without the permission of his manager, who had gone home for the night. The student did not have his manager's phone number. D'oh!
Clare sent the boss a message on Facebook. The manager said that the DVD belonged to the undergraduate student union that had sponsored Biden's speech and could not be used without its explicit permission. So at 9 p.m., Robert tapped out a Facebook message to the American University student who now ran the group and crossed his fingers.
At 9:45 p.m., the student replied. He said that "The Daily" could use the audio from Biden's speech and sent an email to Robert granting us formal authorization.
Progress. But we had a new problem. How would we get our hands on the DVD right away?
Another producer, Sydney Harper, happens to live in Washington, D.C. Clare called her. Would she be willing to go over to American University to record the audio? Sydney was on a bus heading home. She hopped off and re-routed to the university.
Sydney arrived about 10 p.m. and encountered yet another challenge: getting Biden's speech off that DVD and into a form we could use for the show. She rented a DVD player from a student library worker, connected it to her computer and transferred the audio to her laptop.
By now, it was nearly 11 p.m. Sydney hit send to New York, where Clare was waiting, unsure whether the audio was high-quality enough. Clare opened the file and hit play.
"Good evening and welcome to tonight's program," the recording began. It was Brian, then a nervous-sounding college student, introducing Biden to applause. Then Biden delivered his speech, in crystal clear audio. Clare began to isolate clips from the speech and layer them into the episode.
If it sounded effortless, it was anything but.

The story behind our Super Tuesday episode
On Tuesday's episode, you heard from Brian Keane, a 52-year-old Democratic voter from Arlington, Va. Many listeners wrote in, wondering why the episode homed in on the voice of only one voter.
In the lead-up to Super Tuesday, we worked with politics reporters and data journalists at The Times to identify the types of voters who would be crucial in determining the breakdown of the primary. Our colleagues pointed us to three demographics: affluent suburbanites in states including Virginia and North Carolina, African-American voters in Southern states, and Latino voters in Texas and California.
We set up interviews with three voters across three states. But in the span of 48 hours, after Biden swept South Carolina, Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden. Amy Klobuchar followed. Then came Beto O'Rourke's endorsement. The moderate wing of the party was scrambling to rally around Biden.
We folded our original plan to focus on this moment. The story of Brian from Virginia, the last person we interviewed, captured the anxiety of establishment Democrats that was playing out in real time and the coalescence that was clearly underway.
On 'The Daily' this week
Monday: Joe Biden's lopsided victory last week in South Carolina altered the course of his race for the Democratic nomination. Alex Burns looks at how it happened.
Tuesday: "Can Trump destroy Bloomberg? Can he destroy Biden?" Ahead of Super Tuesday, our producers traveled to Virginia to speak with a moderate Democrat mulling over these questions.
Wednesday: Alex Burns unpacks the results of Super Tuesday, which made the Democratic race effectively a two-person showdown: "We may be headed for something of an immovable object, unstoppable force situation."
Thursday: "There's a sign here that this has been spreading throughout the community undetected for weeks." Mike Baker on the first coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.
Friday: "Their daily reality after the signing has been no different from their reality before the signing." Mujib Mashal on why the peace agreement between the U.S. and Taliban has not led to peace in Afghanistan.

Texto completo: The agency proposed the penalty over the installation of unapproved equipment in the 737 Max and other aircraft.
The Federal Aviation Administration recommended on Friday that Boeing be fined nearly $ 20 million for installing equipment in the 737 Max and other aircraft before its approval.
The announcement came hours after Democrats on the House Transportation Committee slammed both the company and the agency for failing to ensure the safety of the Max jets. Two of the planes crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people and leading to the model's worldwide grounding.
The F.A.A. accused Boeing of installing the equipment, the Head-Up Guidance System from Rockwell Collins, on nearly 800 jetliners from June 2015 to April 2019. The systems included sensors that had not been tested or approved when they were installed, though Rockwell Collins later conducted the necessary testing and risk analysis, the agency said in a statement.
In response, Boeing noted that the proposed $ 19.68 million fine did not involve a safety issue and said a review had found that the systems "met or exceeded" the original requirements.
"We understand the critical importance of compliance with all documentation requirements of the F.A.A.'s certifications," the company said. "We are committed to doing better."
The agency accused Boeing of installing the systems in 618 Boeing 737 NGs and 173 Max planes. Boeing has 30 days to respond to the recommendation. Typically, the final details of such penalties are worked out in legal negotiations between the agency and the offending party.
The F.A.A. proposed a $ 5.4 million fine in January after it accused Boeing of installing substandard components in the Max and other aircraft. That fine has not yet been made final.
Also on Friday, David L. Calhoun, Boeing's chief executive, emailed senior leaders at the company to apologize for remarks he made in a New York Times article published on Thursday.
In the interview, Mr. Calhoun sharply criticized Boeing's former chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, saying he ramped up production rates before the supply chain was ready and angered regulators with overly optimistic projections about the return of the 737 Max.
"I am both embarrassed and regretful about the article," Mr. Calhoun wrote in the email. "It suggests I broke my promise to former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, the executive team and our people that I would have their back when it counted most. I want to reassure you that my promise remains intact."
Mr. Calhoun, who was on Boeing's board for the duration of Mr. Muilenburg's tenure as chief executive, sought to soften his criticism of his predecessor. He added that he did the interview "in the interest of demonstrating transparency and straight talk about our leadership point of view and current situation."
Earlier in the day, the House Transportation Committee's Democratic majority issued preliminary findings from a yearlong investigation into the Max disasters. The majority staff accused Boeing of overlooking safety in the interest of meeting production goals, making misguided assumptions about flight-control software known as MCAS and hiding information from the F.A.A., the public and Boeing customers, among other things. The report also accused F.A.A. management of yielding to Boeing's influence and rejecting the safety concerns of its own experts.
"Our committee's investigation will continue for the foreseeable future, as there are a number of leads we continue to chase down to better understand how the system failed so horribly," the committee's Democratic chairman, Representative Peter DeFazio of Oregon, said in a statement.
The Democrats also argued that Congress should change the F.A.A.'s aircraft certification process. The committee's Republican minority agreed that there were problems with the process and said it was open to bipartisan legislation, but dismissed the idea that the system was "broken or in need of wholesale dismantlement."
The report was released just before the March 10 anniversary of the crash of a Max jet, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, that killed all 157 people on board.
"We have cooperated extensively for the past year with the committee's investigation," Boeing said in a statement about the findings. "We will review this preliminary report."

Texto completo: A collection of online stores offer murder for pay. Researchers say they are scams, but people who want someone dead aren't listening.
SAN FRANCISCO -- On a website called Azerbaijani Eagles, you can commission a murder for $ 5,000. The site Slayers Hitmen provides more options, with a beating going for $ 2,000. Death by torture costs $ 50,000.
But don't expect someone to get the job done. Experts and law enforcers who have studied these sites -- almost all of them on the so-called dark web or dark net -- say they are scams. There has not been a known murder attributed to any of them.
That doesn't mean the sites aren't involved in a very dark trade. They have become catch points for real people who are looking to pay to have someone murdered. And a number of men and women are sitting in jail after paying one of these sites -- and getting caught by the police.
In one of the most recent cases to make its way through the courts, a nurse from Illinois was sentenced to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to sending $ 12,000 in Bitcoin to the site Sicilian Hitmen International Network. She had hoped to have the wife of her boyfriend killed.
Twenty-four hit-man-for-hire sites are the subject of an academic paper that was shared in advance with The New York Times by a professor at Michigan State University, Tom Holt, and his student, Ariel Roddy.
The paper, which is being reviewed for publication, is the first academic effort to illuminate what has been a subject of endless intrigue. For years, the potential anonymity granted by the internet has fed predictions that there would be marketplaces for death and assassination.
But it was the emergence of the dark web over the last decade or so that allowed hit-man sites to proliferate. Unlike most sites on the traditional internet, dark-web sites use technology that allows both sides of an online interaction to hide their identity and location, from each other and law enforcement.
"It's a fantastic opportunity to defraud people because you give them just enough sense of danger," said Emily Wilson, the head of research at Terbium Labs, a security firm focused on the dark net. "What are you going to do if they don't go through with it?"
When the first hit-man sites were discovered, an oft-repeated assumption was that the dark web was crawling with legitimate assassins waiting to kill on command.
Promotional material posted to the mainstream internet played on that assumption. One site, which provides readers with a link to the dark net address of the 18th Street Gang, holds itself out as a "guide to real hit men, facts and stories." The site claims that people who say hit-man sites are scams are just trying to discourage people from seeking them out.
"Most customers order from reliable hit men sites that have been proven as legitimate," the site says.
On many of the sites examined by the team at Michigan State, considerable effort was expended trying to prove their legitimacy so customers would feel comfortable making a payment in Bitcoin, the digital currency. Hit men are not the sort of thing you pay for with a credit card.
The site 18th Street Mafia includes a page with links to news stories about real killings it says it helped commit. None of the articles, however, indicate that the site, or even a hit man, was responsible.
For skeptical members of the media, the site says: "We can provide video proof of our services, with time stamps. Again, such proof is not possible for fake services."
The 18th Street Mafia did not respond to requests for comment.
The representative for another site, Darkmamba, said in an email that proving its legitimacy had been difficult because "the point of our services and many other, including underground criminal forums, is to indeed complete the job without leaving anything that could get traced back to us."
"We use ricin in most of our jobs and due to its nature which does not raise a lot of suspicion," the representative said. Ricin is a poison found in castor beans.
One of the most surprising findings of the study was that the prices charged by these sites were broadly in line with what past academic research has established as the going price for real-life hit men -- about $ 11,000 in Australia and $ 18,000 in England.
The most prolific research on these sites has been conducted by Chris Monteiro, a systems administrator in London who has pursued his investigations as a morbid passion project on top of his regular job.
Mr. Monteiro hacked into one of the sites created by the most notorious purveyor of assassination sites, a figure going by the name Yura.
After breaking into the Besa Mafia site and a few others, Mr. Monteiro found information about 283 people who had paid for hit-man services. He also found messages suggesting that the operators had little intention of going through with the killings.
"I need you to help me do some videos to prove the Besa Mafia legit, but WITHOUT killing anyone," the operator wrote in one email, trying to get a contractor to produce lifelike videos. "I am not a murderer and I don't want anyone be murdered."
Law enforcement agencies around the world have been hesitant to collaborate with Mr. Monteiro or use his evidence because of the way he acquired it. But Mr. Monteiro has worked with media organizations, including Wired and 48 Hours, which have passed his information to law enforcement officials, eventually leading to the arrests of people who paid the sites to connect them with a hit man.
Mr. Monteiro has identified nine cases in which people he exposed were arrested in connection with commissioning hits. In one of the most gruesome cases, a man in Minnesota was arrested after he was found to have killed his wife himself when the hit man he had commissioned on the Besa Mafia website for about $ 6,000 in Bitcoin did not come through.
The British National Crime Agency did monitor and -- working with police in Bulgaria -- take down one of the sites that Mr. Monteiro had targeted, Crime Bay. Its operators were based in Bulgaria.
"Investigations are ongoing, and the N.C.A. will continue to work with international law enforcement partners to identify users of sites like these," said Lucy Sneddon, a spokeswoman for the agency.
A police investigator in Russia is believed to have been killed by two teenagers who were hired by a drug trafficker on the dark net. An investigation by the BBC found that the killing had been commissioned on one of the broad marketplaces on the dark net where drugs and stolen credit cards are sold. It was, by most accounts, the first known assassination to be successfully commissioned on the dark web.
But there has still not been a killing commissioned on one of the dedicated hit-man-for-hire sites.
"Why would you set up a dedicated site online when you know absolutely that law enforcement are going to be flooding that site trying to find you?" Ms. Wilson said. "You are making yourself too big of a target."
Still, the sites have continued to proliferate. A few months ago, a middle-aged executive in Singapore was sent to jail for five years after paying the Camorra Hitman site to kill the boyfriend of his young ex-lover in a staged car accident that, not surprisingly, didn't happen.
Ms. Wilson said these sites took attention from the real crime being committed on the dark net, like the drug markets and the sites selling the sensitive personal information of millions of Americans.
"There is actual crime, but we are too busy talking about some guy who wants to kill his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend," she said.

Hachette Won't Publish
Woody Allen's Book
Hachette Book Group on Friday dropped its plans to publish Woody Allen's autobiography and said it would return all rights to the author, a day after its employees protested its deal with the filmmaker.
"The decision to cancel Mr. Allen's book was a difficult one," a spokeswoman for the publisher said in a statement. "We take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books. As publishers, we make sure every day in our work that different voices and conflicting points of views can be heard."
But she added that Hachette executives had discussed the matter with its employees and, "after listening, we came to the conclusion that moving forward with publication would not be feasible for HBG."
Letty Aronson, Mr. Allen's sister and producer, declined to comment on Friday.
Hachette announced the book deal on Monday, saying its Grand Central Publishing imprint would release Mr. Allen's autobiography, "Apropos of Nothing," on April 7. It described the book as "a comprehensive account of his life, both personal and professional," and said it would include Mr. Allen's writing on "his relationships with family, friends, and the loves of his life."

MEDIA
HuffPost Editor Is Leaving
For a Podcasting Company
In another shake-up of the digital news landscape, HuffPost's editor in chief, Lydia Polgreen, announced Friday that she was departing the website for a sector that many in media see as more of a growth area: podcasting.
Ms. Polgreen, who has led the website since 2016, said in a statement posted on Twitter that she would step down this month to become the head of content at Gimlet Media, the podcast studio known for shows like "Reply All" and "Crimetown." Gimlet was bought last year by the audio streaming giant Spotify along with Anchor, which makes tools for producing podcasts, in a combined deal worth nearly $ 340 million.
Ms. Polgreen is the second top editor of a major digital news outlet to depart in recent weeks, as online publishers continue to struggle. The former editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, Ben Smith, left that website in February after eight years to become a media columnist at The New York Times.
Before she joined HuffPost in 2016 as only the second editor in chief of the site, Ms. Polgreen was an associate masthead editor at The Times, where she previously served as a foreign correspondent and deputy international editor. She took over at HuffPost when Arianna Huffington, the founder, stepped down. MARC TRACY
ECONOMY
U.S. Trade Deficit Shrinks 6% as Outbreak Spreads
The U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than expected in January as imports declined, and further decreases are likely as the viral outbreak that originated in China disrupts the flow of goods.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that the trade deficit fell 6.7 percent to $ 45.3 billion while exports sank 1 percent to $ 136.4 billion in January.
Data for December was revised slightly to show the trade gap widening to $ 48.6 billion instead of $ 48.9 billion as previously reported. Economists had forecast the trade gap tightening to $ 46.1 billion in January.
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit fell $ 2.3 billion to $ 77.7 billion in January.
Falling imports are also likely to lead to shortages, which could hurt both consumer and business spending. In January, imports fell 2 percent to $ 203.4 billion.

Texto completo: Remember your grandmother's avocado-green kitchen? It could soon be yours. Or maybe it'll be pink, mauve, emerald green or buttercup. Anything but white, because the revolt against the white kitchen has begun.
Last November, the cover of Elle Decor featured a Steven Gambrel-designed kitchen awash in a shiny turquoise - even the ceiling gleamed like an iridescent underwater wonderland. On Pinterest between November 2018 and November 2019, searches for dark green cabinets jumped 367%, plum kitchens went up 107% and pink kitchen walls spiked 121%.
For decades now, cabinets have been relegated to white, brown or maybe black, and it's been even longer since appliances were allowed to be anything but stainless steel. But the Instagram kitchen - invariably a clean backdrop of basic Shaker cabinets, simple subway backsplashes and marble countertops - finally has some competition.
Jenny Dina Kirschner, an interior designer in New York, recently painted the cabinets pink for a client in Long Island, giving the room a decidedly '80s vibe somewhere between mauve and millennial pink. The color picked up the pinkish tones in the Calacatta Vagli marble countertop.
"We're starting to see more daring use of color," Kirschner said. "It's a rebellion against the white kitchen."
Breaking the mold is risky when 43% of homeowners choose white cabinets and a third choose white countertops, according to a 2019 Houzz report. Try something bolder than wood cabinets or black soapstone countertops and you might fail. Unlike an unfortunate coat of paint on the living room walls, the wrong choice of cabinetry could cost a homeowner tens of thousands of dollars. And money aside, it's not easy to rip out that chartreuse backsplash if you later regret it.
Yet cracks in the color-free facade are emerging. Between 2018 and 2019, BHG.com consumer insights found a 115% spike in interest in cabinet paint trends and a 10% increase in interest in colorful kitchen cabinetry. And from March 2018 to March 2019, interest in blue and green for paint and home decor rose 50%. Navy cabinets have become increasingly popular along with two-toned ones, with choices like blue for the lower ones and blond wood for the uppers. Greens of all shades have been nudging their way onto the stage, too, appearing as emerald cabinetry, avocado backsplashes and sage pendants.
In a throwback to the 1970s, the age of wacky colored appliances is also back. Want a retro fridge? Big Chill carries them in colors like beach blue, cherry red and pink lemonade. The appliance company BlueStar offers hundreds of color options, as well as custom colors for its products, letting customers personalize down to the color of the doors, trim and dials. Have a specific shade of purple in mind for your oven? Dacor can match a swatch you provide to the color of its appliances.
"Anything goes these days," said Gideon Mendelson, an interior designer in Manhattan. He is currently designing a yellow kitchen for a couple on the North Fork of Long Island, which he described as "a sophisticated buttercup. It's not going to be sweet and cutesy. It's not quite mustard. It's happier than that."
Who doesn't want a happy kitchen? With the world so dreary, a little yellow can go a long way. In these uncertain times, we're drawn to colors that don't need to be impeccable, that can hide the messiness of life. "There's a sense of energy and nourishment in bright colors," said Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of "Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness."
Alessandra Wood, vice president of style for Modsy, an online interior-design service, said that homeowners are looking for comfort and coziness in design choices, so why not our kitchens, too?
"In this really unstable world, we are looking for anything that makes us feel comfortable, and we are definitely turning to our homes to do that," she said.
Just look at the color Pantone chose for its color of the year: classic blue, because it "highlights our desire for a dependable and stable foundation." Paint companies Sherwin-Williams and PPG also ushered in the new decade with blue as their picks of the year in a collective nod to what might soon be our new neutral - call it bluetral.
We're also living in our homes differently. After decades of relentless moving, Americans are moving at the lowest rates since the U.S. census began tracking our mobility, with fewer than 10% of Americans moving between 2018 and 2019. Baby boomers are aging in place and millennials, facing rising housing costs and stagnating wages, are less likely to house hop. With no plans to stake a "for sale" sign in the front yard, why commit to the safe and listless colors of a staged house?
Greige, that dreary hue that is neither gray nor beige, but took over our homes for over a decade, is decidedly out. The relentlessly white kitchen may be next. It made a lot of sense in the era of house flipping. White looks clean and is unlikely to offend a potential buyer. Who hates white? And if your home is perpetually one renovation away from its next open house, white is a natural go-to color. It's a kitchen designed for future buyers, not the specific tastes of the current inhabitants.
But let's face it: White looks clean only when it is clean. The rest of the time, it is not the most practical color for a room that regularly gets splashed with marinara sauce. There is something to be said for a little color to hide the imperfections.
"We're living in our spaces longer, so there's an extra level of consideration that people are giving to them," Wood said. "We're thinking, 'How do I make this space into a space that I really feel comfortable in?' "
So if there is no buyer on the horizon, if the kitchen remodel is just for you, the view widens. Why not wash the whole room in turquoise? It doesn't really matter what some fictional buyer might think. You can be you and paint the cabinets pink.
Caption: The days of the all-white kitchen and plain stainless-steel appliances may be numbered.

When a deadly pandemic meets a personality cult

Texto completo: So, here's the response of the Trump team and its allies to the coronavirus, at least so far: It's actually good for America. Also, it's a hoax perpetrated by the news media and the Democrats. Besides, it's no big deal, and people should buy stocks. Anyway, we'll get it all under control under the leadership of a man who doesn't believe in science.
From the day Donald Trump was elected, some of us worried how his administration would deal with a crisis not of its own making. Remarkably, we've gone three years without finding out: Until now, every serious problem facing the Trump administration, from trade wars to confrontation with Iran, has been self-created. But the coronavirus is looking as if it might be the test we've been fearing.
And the results aren't looking good.
The story of the Trump pandemic response actually began several years ago. Almost as soon as he took office, Trump began cutting funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leading in turn to an 80% cut in the resources the agency devotes to global disease outbreaks. Trump also shut down the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council.
Experts warned that these moves were exposing America to severe risks. "We'll leave the field open to microbes," declared Tom Frieden, a much-admired former head of the CDC, more than two years ago. But the Trump administration has a preconceived notion about where national security threats come from - basically, scary brown people - and is hostile to science in general. So we entered the current crisis in an already weakened condition.
And the microbes came.
The first reaction of the Trumpers was to see the coronavirus as a Chinese problem - and to see whatever is bad for China as being good for us. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, cheered it on as a development that would "accelerate the return of jobs to North America."
The story changed once it became clear that the virus was spreading well beyond China. At that point it became a hoax perpetrated by the news media. Rush Limbaugh weighed in: "It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump. Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus. ... The coronavirus is the common cold, folks."
Limbaugh was, you may not be surprised to hear, projecting. Back in 2014 right-wing politicians and media did indeed try to politically weaponize a disease outbreak, the Ebola virus, with Trump himself responsible for more than 100 tweets denouncing the Obama administration's response (which was actually competent and effective).
And in case you're wondering, no, the coronavirus isn't like the common cold. In fact, early indications are that the virus may be as lethal as the 1918 Spanish Flu, which killed as many as 50 million people.
Financial markets evidently don't agree that the virus is a hoax; by Thursday afternoon the Dow was off more than 3,000 points for the week. Falling markets appear to worry the administration more than the prospect of, you know, people dying. So Larry Kudlow, the administration's top economist, made a point of declaring that the virus was "contained" - contradicting the CDC - and suggested that Americans buy stocks. The market continued to drop.
At that point, the administration appears to have finally realized that it might need to do something beyond insisting that things were great. But according to The Washington Post's Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman, it initially proposed paying for a virus response by cutting aid to the poor - specifically, low-income heating subsidies. Cruelty in all things.
Last week, Trump held a news conference on the virus, much of it devoted to incoherent jabs at Democrats and the media. He did, however, announce the leader of the government response to the threat. Instead of putting a health care professional in charge, however, he handed the job to Vice President Mike Pence, who has an interesting relationship with both health policy and science.
Early in his political career, Pence staked out a distinctive position on public health, declaring that smoking doesn't kill people. He has also repeatedly insisted that evolution is just a theory. As governor of Indiana, he blocked a needle exchange program that could have prevented a significant HIV outbreak, calling for prayer instead.
And now, according to The New York Times, government scientists will need to get Pence's approval before making public statements about the coronavirus.
So the Trumpian response to crisis is completely self-centered, entirely focused on making Trump look good rather than protecting America. If the facts don't make Trump look good, he and his allies attack the messengers, blaming the news media and the Democrats - while trying to prevent scientists from keeping us informed. And in choosing people to deal with a real crisis, Trump prizes loyalty rather than competence.
Maybe Trump - and America - will be lucky, and this won't be as bad as it might be. But anyone feeling confident right now isn't paying attention.

HAIR LOVE'S OSCAR WIN IS A GAME-CHANGER

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES, Calif. - Congratulations to Chicago's own Matthew Cherry on winning an Oscar for Best Animated Short for the heartwarming film, Hair Love. Matthew Cherry, a former NFL wide receiver and filmmaker, set out on a quest to win and win he did.
His award-winning team includes former Patriots wide receiver Matthew Hawkins and Karen Rupert Tolliver who serves as Executive Vice President of Creative for Sony Pictures Animation.
Actress Issa Rae voiced one of the characters and Gabrielle Union and Dwayne Wade were producers on the project as well.
Following in the footsteps of Kobe Bryant, Mr. Cherry is the second Black/African American Male athlete to win an Oscar for Best Animated Short in the Academy's History.
By now, most of us know that Hair Love is according to Matthew Cherry's website "a 7 minute animated short film that centers around the relationship between an African American father, Stephen, his daughter, Zuri and her hair.
Despite having long locks, Stephen has been used to his wife doing his daughter's hair, so when she is unavailable right before a big event, Stephen will have to figure it out on his own.
This sounds simple enough, but we soon come to find that Zuri's hair has "a mind of its own." The film's New York Times best-selling picture book is illustrated by Vashti Harrison.
Matthew's win is monumental for several reasons. One, it helps to dispel the myth that athletes are mere jocks who run around shooting hoops, throwing/kicking balls, or running short distances to fame.
Athletes like the late Kobe Bryant, Matthew Cherry and Magic Johnson have proved that there is life after sports and vic tories ahead, if you stay focused and choose a worthy cause.
For Matthew Cherry, it was natural hair. Let's face it, hair is everything and in our community. Hair can make or break a person's popularity in school and can influence a person's pathway for personal and career success.
Thanks to Matthew Cherry and his team, topics that were once taboo to mention are now coming to fruition and breaking barriers for equitable change.
Hair Love also goes beyond the surface to dispel the myth that Black men do not love their black daughters.
Yes, even in our 'wonderful' African American Muslim community, hair is for many of us an ultimate win or a tragic loss.
As a member of this community, I have personally witnessed sisters' rise to fame, nabbing decent husbands and comfortable or well-to-do lifestyles on the basis of their 'good hair' and/or lighter skin.
Growing up, many of us have images of what beauty is and whether it's from Disney to Pixar to anything in between, long straight or curly locks put us in a place of comfort and envy.
From videos and movie screens for real life scenarios, we are all programmed to believe that "Black men just don't love Black Women with nappy hair." Thanks to Mr. Cherry, that is now partially a myth.
Up until one month ago, I was clueless to the Hair Love project. Amazingly, it wasn't until my 7-year old daughter introduced me to the Short animation via YouTube, that I became aware of the film and its powerful impact.
Once upon a time, my daughter loved her hair and self until at the age of 5 she experienced "JoJo Siwa"on YouTube. Although instructed to watch PBS Kids, her fingers 'discovered' this kid phenomenon on the YouTube for Kids sidebar.
No worries, right? Wrong! What came out of her mouth was heartbreaking, resulting in me hitting the curb of the sidewalk during my parallel park, which I rarely do. "Mommy, why can't I have hair like JoJo Siwa?"
Holding back my tears, of course my typical response was: "Because Allah (SWT) created us in different colors and gave us different hair textures as well."
Alhamdulillah, constantly reminding ourselves of Qur'an Surah 49:13 is rewarding and challenging, especially when explaining to our children who are surrounded with other children who have straight, wavy or curly hair.
Children are smart and they notice the reactions we have regarding what is in our eyes, ideal sets of beauty. These reactions have long-lasting effects and that's exactly why Hair Love is a Game-Changer.
Hair Love's images filled with a dad combing his own daughter's beautifully coiled hair models patience and can begin to check the slandering against some of our girls and women who are referenced as "nappy headed" by random artists, including some 'Muslim' rapper named French Montana or even quell ourselves from damaging our own beautiful children's self-esteem.
Hair Love's victory can help heal those of us who struggle with our own internal hatred of beauty begin to check ourselves when attempting to publicly shame sisters like Beyoncé for allowing her daughter, Blue Ivy to wear her natural hair, as well.
Prior to Cherry's win, he initiated a Kickstarter campaign and sought our animators for what he coined on Twitter as "an Oscar worthy short film idea." Needless to say he acquired the best and raised nearly $300,000 for his project, which exceeded his initial goal of $75,000.
A most welcomed success story, after putting in hard work and long hours along with fighting for natural hair equity by promoting the Crown Act, a law that bans natural hair discrimination from the workplace and in K-12 public and charter schools.
The bill was first introduced last year by State Senator Holly Mitchell and went into effect on Jan. 1, 2020.
New York and New Jersey are the second and third states to follow suit. And on Dec. 5, 2019, Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Congressman Cedric Richmond (D-LA) introduced The CROWN Act of 2019 in both chambers of U.S. Congress, paving the way for federal protections.
This would make it a crime to discriminate against natural hair while protecting students like Deandre Arnold from Texas or 8-year old Marian Scott from Michigan who was denied her right to take school photos.
Imagine how delightful it was to see my daughter praying and hoping for Hair Love to win.
Unsurprisingly, my heart melted when witnessing her expressions as she jumped up and ran over to me, crying in excitement while saying that she loved me, when Hair Love indeed won Best Animated Short for 2019- a priceless moment.
Hair Love shows that with patience, we can all begin to love ourselves and most importantly, each other. Hair Love's win is a win for us all!
For those of you who have long and straight or curly hair, this article isn't a disparage attempt to further divide us.
It is a timely reality to use social justice and equity in paying homage to a Black male who created a team of folks representing love of self.
It's dispelling myths of antiquated and adopted terminology carried over from slavery that pits dark against light or straight, curly or wavy hair against coiled hair that's viewed as nappy and no good.
Hair Love is inclusivity and ensures that no matter what type of hair that you, your daughter, wife, sister or self may have, that anything that is part of our bodies and is created by Allah (SWT) is worthy of love.

Texto completo: Auf Wiedersehen, Sommerfest and Viennese waltzes. Hey there, Summer at Orchestra Hall and a spectrum of concerts, events and surprises.
Finally shedding the “Sommerfest” name “opens up so many possibilities for new annual themes and a very broad collection of music to celebrate,” Minnesota Orchestra President and CEO Michelle Miller Burns said in a statement. “Sommerfest” has been a fixture since 1980, when the orchestra’s summer festival was founded by Leonard Slatkin.
With new Creative Partner Jon Kimura Parker in the lead, the inaugural Summer at Orchestra Hall will have a theme, “The Beethoven Influence.” The theme has been broken down into four parts, one for each week of the festival: Nature, Rebellion, Destiny, Unity. Parker wanted “to explore Beethoven’s own inspirations, as well as how he inspired other people, artists and causes. This inevitably has led us into some really exciting partnerships with artists who will riff on Beethoven to create new works this summer.”
And how. On Friday, July 17 (opening night of Week One), a performance of Beethoven’s “Pastorale” will feature a film depicting nature in Minneapolis by the experimental art collective Free Black Dirt. On Friday, July 24 (Week Two), South Korean composer Unsuk Chin’s “Mannequin” will be dramatized by 10-foot-tall puppets from In the Heart of the Beast.
On Thursday and Friday, July 30 and 31 (Week Three), the six-member collaborative dance ensemble BRKFST will perform an original work to Beethoven’s “Grosse fuge,” bringing in breakdance, martial arts and contemporary dance. On Saturday, Aug. 1, the orchestra and The Moving Company will premiere “The Artist’s Influence,” a play-with-music featuring Nathan Keepers and Steven Epp, directed by Dominique Serrand.
Fifteen concerts are scheduled over four weekends, most featuring the Minnesota Orchestra in the hall or chamber ensembles in the Target Atrium. Six conductors will take the stage, including three women.
Parker will appear often at the piano: for Beethoven’s “Moonlight” Sonata (which he played 27 years ago at Sommerfest) and “Emperor” Concerto; leading his own quintet (with Stewart Copeland, former drummer of The Police) in a nontraditional performance of Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring”; in a relaxed family concert; in the return of the Grand Piano Spectacular (four pianists on four pianos), a beloved Sommerfest tradition; and as soloist in Beethoven’s Third Piano Concerto.
Parker will also host the orchestra’s first free outdoor performance on Peavey Plaza in more than a decade. Mark your calendar for that one: Saturday, July 18, 7:30 p.m. As the orchestra concludes Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture,” church bells will ring out across Minneapolis. This thrilling event will be part of the 12-hour International Day of Music, with performances on multiple stages in and around Orchestra Hall, including one programmed by the Cedar Cultural Center.
With Peavey Plaza finally renovated and reopened – that happened last July, midway through the Latin America-flavored Sommerfest – the orchestra will take full advantage of that space and its own roomy lobby during the summer season. “Sounds and Bites” will feature food vendors and free music before and after all concerts, a regular Thursday evening happy hour performance in the Target Atrium, and a pop-up Night Market on Fridays and Saturdays. The lobby will include art installations and pre- and post-concert experiences that explore the weekly themes: Nature, Rebellion, Destiny, Unity. All outdoor, happy hour and lobby entertainments are open to the public. The only ticketed events are performances in the hall and Candlelight Chamber Music concerts in the Target Atrium.
Wait – will there be a movies and music event? Yes. On Saturday and Sunday, Aug. 8 and 9, Sarah Hicks will lead the orchestra in a performance of “Fantasia.”
Summer at Orchestra Hall runs from July 17 to Aug. 9. View the complete schedule and order tickets here or call 612-371-5656/800-292-4141.
‘My Fair Lady’: See it or don’t?
Five performances remain of this show’s brief run at the Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis. See it or don’t? That depends.
On the plus side: The new Lincoln Center revival, directed by Tony winner Bartlett Sher, earned 10 Tony nominations and widespread critical acclaim. The production, in a word, is gorgeous. The sets are incredible. Henry Higgins’ house is a rotating, two-story, stuffed-to-the-rafters marvel with a spiral staircase, even (briefly) a bathroom. The costumes are exquisite. And the score is filled with classic, hummable songs. In the touring cast, Shereen Ahmed as Eliza and Laird Mackintosh as Higgins are both excellent, and as Eliza learns to speak properly, her voice becomes more luminous and liquid.
On the minus side: The book and lyrics date from 1956. Lines that used to be funny just aren’t anymore. It is not OK to call a woman “so deliciously low – so horribly dirty” or to suggest that “if you have any trouble with her, give her a few licks of the strap.” This language, these attitudes and assumptions are painful to hear. It’s hard to believe people once laughed, and not that long ago.
On the plus side: Sher, like other smart directors dealt misogynistic scripts, has found ways to elevate Eliza and give her agency. She may be a poor Cockney flower girl, but she recognizes opportunity when she sees it, and she makes the most of it. Higgins’ language is abusive and his attitude abhorrent, but Eliza knows her own worth. And although she earlier sings about “someone’s head resting on my knee … who takes good care of me,” she’s clearly capable of taking care of herself. And better equipped than she was before she met Henry Higgins and Colonel Pickering. Eliza offers to pay Higgins for his phonetics lessons. He won’t take her money, so she takes his insults and arrogance. That’s how she pays.
On the minus side: It’s still a terrible story. Two wealthy men bet they can turn a poor woman into someone who dupes other wealthy people into thinking she’s a duchess. In fact, they think she’s a princess – from Hungary! But what do we do these days with terrible stories told to wonderful music? (We’re looking at you, Mozart.) Do we throw them all out and erase history? Or do we illuminate the dark corners, put them in context and understand that’s not who we are now?
“My Fair Lady” continues through Sunday, March 8. FMI and tickets ($40-155).
The picks
Opens tonight (Friday, March 6) at Park Square Theatre : “Face to Face: Hmong Women’s Experiences.” Five local Hmong women share their own stories in a theatrical, emotional performance. Co-written and co-directed by Sara Zatz of New York’s Ping Chong + Company, which specializes in community-specific, interview-based events, and Twin Cities theater artist Katie Ka Vang. 7:30 p.m. on the Boss stage. FMI and tickets ($16-30). Closes March 15.
Opens tonight at the Lab : Pangea World Theater: “Sueño (Dream).” Adapted from the 17th-century morality play “Life Is But a Dream” by Pedro Calderón de la Barca, translated from the Spanish by Obie-winning playwright José Rivera into witty, contemporary language, “Sueño” poses questions like “What are humans?” “What is honor?” and “If life is a dream, who is dreaming us?” Directed by Leslie Ishii. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($18 advance, $22 door). Closes March 22.
Sunday at Macalester Plymouth United Church : Fourth Annual Unity through Music Concert. A benefit for the ACLU of Minnesota, created by Jean Carey, a specialist in repairing woodwinds. This year’s version, “Jazz for Justice,” features the Peter Kogan Quintet. 3 p.m. FMI and tickets ($30/$10 students).
Monday at Bryant-Lake Bowl and Theater: The Theater of Public Policy: The Census. Laugh and learn. T2P2, the comedy improv troupe fueled by facts and grounded in our community, starts its spring season with a topic that affects us all: the census. The guests will be Susan Brower, Minnesota’s State Demographer, and Mónica Hurtado of Voices for Racial Justice. Doors at 6 p.m., show at 7. FMI and tickets ($12 advance, $15 door).
Tuesday at the Ordway: Daniil Trifonov. The New York Times called him “one of the most awesome pianists of our time.” The young Russian pianist everyone is talking about turned 30 yesterday. Less than a week ago, he played the same Bach program at the Kennedy Center he’ll bring to the Ordway next week. Here’s what the Washington Post had to say: “a glimpse of the divine … ecstatic visions … unabashed pianistic prowess … food for the soul.” Got tickets? There might be a few left. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($36-75).
Tuesday at Scott Country Library – Prior Lake : Club Book: Brad Taylor. The author of the New York Times best-selling Pike Logan series, Taylor served more than 20 years in the U.S. Army, including a stint with Delta Force. He’s out with the 14th Pike Logan tale, “Hunter Killer,” in which the elite Taskforce finds itself in the unfamiliar role of the hunted. 7 p.m. FMI. Free. Can’t make it? A podcast will be available in a few days.

A Liar Put Him on Death Row. His Co-Defendant Could Help Set Him Free. Why Won’t He?

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
For more than three decades, Florida death row inmate James Dailey has maintained his innocence, claiming that he played no part in the 1985 murder of 14-year-old Shelly Boggio. On Thursday, the one person whose word could spare his life — his co-defendant, Jack Pearcy — took the stand in a Clearwater courtroom. But when the time came for Pearcy to speak, he sat in the witness box, stone-faced and silent.
The subject at hand was an affidavit Pearcy signed in December, in which he cleared Dailey of any involvement in the killing. “James Dailey had nothing to do with the murder of Shelly Boggio,” it stated. “I committed the crime alone. James Dailey was back at the house when I drove Shelly Boggio to the place where I ultimately killed her.”
No physical or forensic evidence ties Dailey to the gruesome killing, nor has there ever been a credible motive. At his 1987 trial, prosecutors secured his conviction by relying on the dubious testimony of three jailhouse informants. One of them — a prolific con-man-turned-jailhouse-informant named Paul Skalnik — was the subject of a joint ProPublica-New York Times Magazine investigation. He was released from jail five days after Dailey was sentenced to death. (Skalnik has always maintained that his testimony in Dailey’s trial was truthful and that he did not receive any benefits in return.)
The affidavit from Pearcy had helped persuade 6th Judicial Circuit Judge Pat Siracusa to grant Thursday’s evidentiary hearing. Dailey, who had been transported nearly 200 miles from the Florida State Prison in Raiford for the proceedings, watched Pearcy intently, studying his co-defendant from behind his thick-framed, prison-issued glasses.
The stakes for Dailey, who is under an active death warrant, could not be any higher. The 73-year-old was scheduled to be executed on Nov. 7, 2019, but he was granted a stay of execution last fall. That stay expired on Dec. 30. Though Gov. Ron DeSantis has indicated that he will hold off on setting an execution date until the case has played out in the courts, Dailey is running out of options. For Pearcy, the stakes are far lower; though prosecutors argued in a 1986 sentencing memo that he deserved death because he was “the main actor” in Boggio’s murder, he received a life sentence.
Until Pearcy took the stand this week, a question had hovered over the hearing: Would he actually say in open court that he committed the crime alone? Pearcy had previously shown himself to be anything but a dependable witness. Despite proclaiming Dailey’s innocence several different times over the years — most notably in a sworn affidavit he signed in 2017 — Pearcy had never managed to make such a declaration before a judge; when he was called to testify about the 2017 affidavit the following year, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
In a near replay of that hearing, Pearcy remained mute on Thursday as Josh Dubin, a member of Dailey’s defense team, asked him a series of straightforward questions. Each was met with silence.
“It’s déjà vu all over again,” groused Assistant State Attorney Sara Macks.

Saudi crown prince arrests three members of the royal family

Texto completo: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has detained three senior members of the royal family.
The crown prince ordered the arrests of the king’s brother Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, and Nayef’s brother Prince Nawaf bin Nayef, according to the New York Times. The arrests are a sign of Salman’s influence within the country and suggests that the crown prince sees a threat to his power.
Abdulaziz was widely seen inside the royal family as the best chance of stopping Salman’s ascent to king. Nayef is a former interior minister with close ties to U.S. intelligence who was ousted from his ministerial position in 2017 and has remained under house arrest since.
Salman came under international criticism in 2018 after Saudi agents killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi Embassy in Istanbul. Authorities eventually sentenced five people to death in connection with Khashoggi’s death. Two senior officials implicated in the murder were cleared of wrongdoing.
In 2017, Salman ordered the arrests of hundreds of influential Saudi businessmen, including 11 of his royal cousins. The arrests came at the same time as an order barring any member of the royal family from leaving the country.

MSNBC math, or why journalists should stop taking their cues from Twitter

Texto completo: For the millionth time, journalists: Stop taking your cues from social media!

It is lazy. It can also lead to painfully embarrassing moments, including the one where MSNBC’s Brian Williams and New York Times editorial board member Mara Gay asserted that $500 million could be divvied up to provide 327 million individuals with exactly $1 million apiece. BW It is painful to have to say this, but $500 million dollars, divided up, would provide $1 million to no more than 500 people. This leaves 326,999,500 people who get nothing if it is indeed divided into millions.
The moment came Thursday evening as Williams and May highlighted a tweet by Twitter user Mekita Rivas.

The tweet, which I am fairly certain is a joke, reads, “Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads. The U.S. population is 327 million. He could have given each American $1 million and still have money left over. I feel like a $1 million check would be life-changing for most people. Yet he wasted it on ads and STILL LOST.”
Five hundred million dollars split evenly among 327 million people means everyone would get roughly $1.50. The Bloomberg campaign could have bought everyone in America a small cup of coffee. Yet, despite the fact that Rivas’s tweet is a steaming load of nonsense, it managed somehow to make it all the way to MSNBC’s 11th Hour, where host Brian Williams and guest Mara Gay marveled, furrow-browed, at the supposedly disturbing implications of the Twitter user’s hilariously, obviously faulty assertion.

"When I read it tonight on social media,” said Williams, “it kind of all became clear. … It’s an incredible way of putting it.”

Gay, who once blamed the federal government for broken water pipes in East Harlem, New York, added, "It’s an incredible way of putting it. It’s true. It’s disturbing."

By the way, it is most certainly not true.

“It does suggest, you know, what we are talking about here, which is: There is too much money in politics,” she added.

There it is! That is why Rivas’s tweet was highlighted by a major MSNBC news program despite its laughable error. The tweet confirmed the prejudices of host and guest alike, that there was “too much money in politics.” Williams and Gay were primed already to trust Rivas’s conclusion, so they gave little thought to the bad arithmetic that got her there.

Even worse, Williams and Gay were not the only ones who saw the tweet prior to its broadcast and fell for it. For the tweet to appear on-air, it first had to go through an entire production team, including producers and assistants. Think about it: At least five or six people read Rivas’s tweet before it aired, and not one of them noticed what amounts to a basic, grade school-level arithmetic error.

Texto completo: Days after Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren abandoned her campaign for the highest office in the United States, President Trump rejected claims that sexism was a factor.
Speaking to reporters at the White House after signing an $8 billion coronavirus aid package, Trump slammed Warren's "lack of talent" and suggested Americans don't like her as a person.
"I think lack of talent was her problem," Trump said. "She had a tremendous lack of talent. She was a good debater. She destroyed Mike Bloomberg very quickly like it was nothing, that was easy for her, but people don't like her. She's a very mean person and people don't like her. People don't want that."
Contrasting himself with Warren, Trump finished his statement by claiming people like him because he's not mean.
A day after Warren announced she would shutter her campaign for president, dozens of articles were written opining the state of gendered relationships in the U.S. Outlets such as Vox, the Nation, USA Today, and the New York Times suggested Warren's abysmal performances in the primary states she participated in were the result of gender-related discrimination.
Trump and Warren have fought bitterly against one another, with the president repeatedly mocking the Massachusetts senator for her claims to Native American ancestry.
’People don’t like her’: Trump rejects idea that sexism cratered Warren campaign
Warren announced the end of her presidential campaign on Thursday. Speaking to reporters afterward, she dodged what she called a "trap question" about whether sexism was to blame.
“If you say, 'Yeah, there was sexism in this race,' everyone says, 'Whiner," Warren said. "And if you say, 'No, there was no sexism,' about a bazillion women think, 'What planet do you live on?'"

Trump's media lawsuits are about the campaign, not the law

Texto completo: The Trump 2020 campaign knows that its media defamation crusade will fail in court.
But the campaign doesn't care about that. It cares about how these lawsuits burnish a key narrative for mobilizing the base — namely, that President Trump is a Washington outsider taking the fight to unfair enemies.
And it's now abundantly clear that the Trump campaign views these lawsuits as a key reelection tool.
As Fox News reported on Friday, the campaign has just filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN. This joins other February defamation filings against the New York Times and the Washington Post. The CNN lawsuit apparently asserts that a June 2019 opinion article by Larry Noble defamed Trump 2020 with its claim that the campaign "assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia's help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table." This is defamatory, the lawsuit says, "because there was an extensive record of statements from the campaign and the administration expressly disavowing any intention to seek Russian assistance."
To succeed in proving defamation, the Trump campaign would have to prove that CNN showed "actual malice" in its reporting or opinion commentary. Which is to say, that it knew what it was saying was false when it said it or showed reckless disregard for the truth.
Spoiler alert: The Trump campaign will not be able to prove that. Indeed, in CNN's case, it's not even close.
The very same day Noble wrote his CNN piece, Trump said, "I think I'd take it," when ABC News asked whether he would accept a foreign power's offer of damaging information on a political opponent. That context would justify Noble's comments even if they were made in a report, let alone an opinion article.
But as I say, this isn't about lawsuits, it's about mobilizing Trump's base.
The president's campaign knows that one of Trump's key appeals is his willingness to fight for his cause. Trump's base adores what they see as a fighter for their interests against a political and media class that has nothing but disdain for them and their "deplorable" nature. They believe that Trump has been treated unfairly on impeachment, Russia collusion, and much more. And they want someone held to account for it. The lawsuits suggest Trump is standing firm in his fight for them and himself. It will rally them to the flag.
In short, these lawsuits offer a big political win at the cost of a few legal dollars: free publicity that "Trump is your fighter."

'Global espionage operation': US wages all-out campaign to convince UK to reject Huawei

Texto completo: The United States is engaged in an all-out effort to convince the United Kingdom to reject Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from the country’s fifth-generation wireless infrastructure, warning of the national security risks posed by potential backdoor access by the Chinese Communist Party.
Both the Trump administration and the Senate have sent warnings to the U.K.’s leaders this week. The U.S. has long sought to convince allies not to use Huawei, threatening to stop sharing intelligence with countries that don't ban the company in their high-speed wireless networks. The Justice Department charged the Chinese telecom company in a global racketeering scheme linked to Iran and North Korea last month.

U.S. officials said intelligence shows Huawei has been able to access mobile phone networks secretly through “back doors” designed for use by law enforcement for more than a decade, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The British government defied the U.S. in late January when Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the U.K. would allow Huawei to supply equipment in some parts of the network. But several Tories in the House of Commons are trying to ban Huawei from the U.K.’s mobile networks entirely by the end of 2022.

Earlier this week, Defense Secretary Mark Esper told the Senate Armed Services Committee that “if our NATO allies incorporate Huawei technology, it may very well have a severe impact on our ability to share information, to share intelligence, to share operational plans, and for the alliance to conduct itself as an alliance.”
“I think we also need to work together, some countries, on alternatives to Huawei because otherwise, we will find the alliance compromised in due course,” Esper warned.

This echoed comments Esper made last month when he said, “Reliance on Chinese 5G vendors, for example, could render our partners’ critical systems vulnerable to disruption, manipulation, and espionage. It could also jeopardize our communication and intelligence sharing capabilities and, by extension, our alliances.”
U.S. officials told Bloomberg that the National Security Council began an interagency review this week to determine what military and intelligence assets should be removed from the U.K. if Huawei participates in building the country's 5G network.
One U.S. official said one of the purposes of the U.K. review was to assess the effects of “putting smart antennas and computers run by the Chinese Communist Party all over our closest ally.”

Attorney General William Barr said last month that U.S. national security is dependent on pushing back against China’s dominance in 5G technology. He noted China “can monitor and surveil” countries and companies that use 5G equipment from Chinese-backed companies.
The company has denied cooperating with Chinese intelligence.
Huawei was designated a “high-risk vendor” by the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre, and the U.K. government said in January that it would ban “high-risk vendors” such as Huawei from “core” 5G infrastructure but would allow Huawei to build the network and would allow its equipment to handle up to 35% of the nation’s 5G “periphery” system.

The U.K. considers the core separate from the peripheral network, which uses base stations and antennae to link mobile devices to the core, but the U.S. doesn’t believe such a distinction is possible.

China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law “requires Chinese companies, such as Huawei and ZTE, to support, provide assistance, and cooperate in China’s national intelligence work, wherever they operate.”

On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of 20 senators, 13 Republicans led by Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and seven Democrats led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, sent a letter to U.K.’s parliament.
“We express our significant concern with the Government of the United Kingdom’s recent decision to allow Huawei Technologies in its 5G infrastructure,” the senators wrote. “Given the significant security, privacy, and economic threats posed by Huawei, we strongly urge the United Kingdom to revisit its recent decision.”
The senators asked for “commitments” to “work together to advance a comprehensive strategy to secure our 5G systems, which includes devising a comprehensive phase-out strategy to remove Huawei and other high-risk vendors that pose national security threats from our network infrastructure.”

On Wednesday, four Republican senators proposed a bill that would require the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to review the U.K.'s place on the foreign investment “whitelist” if it allows Huawei to build portions of its 5G infrastructure.

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, “Huawei is a global espionage operation masquerading as a telecom company,” and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas warned that “allowing Huawei into Britain’s 5G infrastructure will have consequences.” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said the U.K.’s “misguided decision” means “the U.S. must now reevaluate how we engage with our important ally.” And Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said, “Huawei’s presence in the U.K.’s 5G infrastructure threatens the security of both our countries.”
The crackdown on Huawei is part of the Justice Department’s larger effort to stem China’s activities. The number of arrests related to Chinese economic espionage cases and cracking down on China-based hacking schemes has risen in recent years.

Last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau has about 1,000 investigations open into Chinese technology theft that involve “just about every industry sector.”
Despite the company’s denials to the U.K.’s House of Commons in July about working with the Chinese Communist Party directly in its anti-Muslim crackdowns, a lengthy report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in November revealed Huawei’s involvement in the mass surveillance of millions of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in China’s Xinjiang region, where over 1 million Muslims have been placed in reeducation camps.

Hundreds of internal documents from the Chinese Communist Party leaked to the New York Times in November show the nation’s rulers were deeply involved in the planning and execution of the oppression in Xinjiang.

Christians shouldn't rely on the Supreme Court to fix what they can't

Texto completo: A new Pew Research survey reveals that Christians, particularly white evangelicals, view the Supreme Court more favorably than any other demographic. This isn’t exactly surprising, given that the high court now boasts five conservative, originalist judges and that 6 in 10 white evangelicals want to overturn Roe v. Wade. Yet it does raise interesting questions about the role of religion in our government and what expectations religious people should have of the judiciary.
First, the survey is clear to point out that evangelicals’ views on the judiciary have shifted since President Barack Obama was in office. Pew reports:
In 2015, just after the court legalized same-sex marriage nationally and upheld a key element of the Affordable Care Act, just a third of Republicans and three-in-ten white evangelicals had favorable views of the Supreme Court. But since then, President Donald Trump has appointed two new justices – Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh – and the court has issued a few religion-friendly rulings.
Unsurprisingly, favorable or unfavorable views of the court "also diverge along party lines."
The Pew survey highlights a decades-old problem plaguing Christians and their politics: Are they relying on the government to win the culture wars, or, at least, to upend what they believe to be immoral laws? Based on this survey, it appears that may be the case. Is there anything wrong with that?
This was the thesis of former RedState writer Ben Howe’s book, The Immoral Majority: Why Evangelicals Chose Political Power over Christian Values, released fall 2019. (I reviewed it for the Washington Examiner magazine here.)
Despite being an evangelical myself, I don’t fully agree with Howe’s thesis. He argues that evangelical Christians have sold their souls for a Trump presidency, something he deems far less valuable than I, but Howe's observations about how Christians view the culture wars and how they want to win them remain persuasive, especially in light of this new Pew survey.
In his conclusion, Howe says Christians often twist Romans 8:31, “If God is for us, who can be against us?” which is often a battle cry for evangelicals who are steeped in the culture wars, as undoubtedly, he and I both have chosen to be.
He writes: “But this has shifted into something else. Something more like, ‘If I’m doing something to gain God’s favor, how could He be against me? ’... Christians, in an attempt to 'assist' god in achieving His ends, will work feverishly toward a goal, ignoring how often they separate themselves from God while in pursuit.”
Later, Howe concludes, “The important choice was never between God, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton — the important choice was between self-interest and the idolization of ‘winning’ versus loving God and one another.”
As an ardent supporter of both the pro-life cause and religious liberty, I can certainly understand the temptation Christians have to view the Supreme Court favorably when there are religious liberty cases on their docket and it looks as if a majority of justices interpret the Constitution in an originalist way. But God has not called Christians to love the Constitution above others and himself. “Act justly, love mercy, walk humbly with God,” is what he says he requires.
I fear evangelicals misunderstand the Supreme Court’s role and the role of faith in the public square at times, conflating their desire to be a bastion for truth, faith, and liberty, with love of God and people. Engaging in the culture wars with the double-edged sword of Christianity and government not only can sometimes misuse a branch of government at will but perhaps also conflicts with God’s ultimate directive for Christians.
The Supreme Court is not there to legislate what Christians, or anyone else, have failed to work through the proper channels. The Supreme Court does not exist to make anyone, either evangelicals or atheists, happy with political outcomes. The judicial branch exists to ensure the laws Congress makes are in alignment with the Constitution and nothing more.
It is one thing to hope the Supreme Court will make a ruling to preserve religious liberty or to protect the unborn. It is another, a dangerous, slippery slope, in fact, to depend earnestly on the Supreme Court to rule in a way that coincides with evangelical Christians’ beliefs and only support them if they do.

Texto completo: Detroit Voice for School Choice (DVSC) has announced the group is organizing a protest of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Detroit appearance Friday night.
The Vermont senator has been an outspoken opponent of public charter schools. Last May, Sanders released a policy paper, “A Thurgood Marshall Plan for Public Education,” in which he proposed banning “for-profit charter schools” and announced he was supporting “the NAACP’s moratorium on public funds for charter school expansion until a national audit has been completed to determine the impact of charter school expansion in each state. That means halting the use of public funds to underwrite new charter schools.”
DVSC announced its protest will begin at 6 p.m., prior to Sanders’ 7 p.m. rally at the TCF Center (formerly Cobo Hall) in downtown Detroit.
DVSC advocates for charter schools and school choice. According to the group’s release, the DVSC “will be protesting the notion that charter schools should be a political issue in the campaign.”
Sanders has said public charter schools promote racial segregation.
In an interview with the New York Times last May, Amy Wilkens, vice president at the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, called Sanders’ stance “galling.”
Wilkins continued: “What Brown v. Board of Education did was say that government can’t tell black parents which public schools they can and can’t send their kids to. What Senator Sanders is saying with his attempt to limit charter schools is telling black parents, who overwhelmingly support charters, that they can’t send their kids to charters anymore.”
Sanders and the other Democrat primary front runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, both oppose to charter schools. Former President Barack Obama was a major supporter.
Sanders has called public charter schools in Michigan a “national embarrassment.”
Moneak Parker, a Detroit charter school parent, is the executive director of DVSC and is leading the Friday protest. In a press announcement, the DVSC asserts nearly half of all Detroit students attend charter schools.
Sanders’ plan includes requiring charter schools to comply with the same oversight requirements as public schools; mandating that at least half of all charter school boards consist of parents and teachers; disclosure of all non-public funding sources and financial interests; and support for public charter school teacher unionization.
Richfield Public School Academy is a public charter school located in Genesee County. In a joint statement sent to The Center Square, Robert Wright, president of the board, and Pamela Haldy, superintendent, responded to Sanders’ claims.
“Charter schools in Michigan are public schools; charter schools in Michigan are not private schools and they are not parochial schools,” they said.
“Because charter schools are public schools, they are subject to the same oversight and audit functions from the Michigan Department of Education (MDE) that all traditional public schools are subject to by the MDE,” they said. “Note that many laws in Michigan refer to a charter school as a ‘Public School Academy.’”
Wright and Haldy added: “In fact, charter schools in Michigan are subject to greater oversight than traditional public schools because of the oversight process for charter schools. Oversight begins with the charter schools’ Management Company, then the charter schools’ Authorization Agent, all who conduct oversight operations of the charter school operations and charter school boards,” they said.

Texto completo: The Trump campaign filed a libel lawsuit against CNN claiming the outlet published an opinion piece that contained "false and defamatory" statements about the president.
The complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on Friday, centers on a piece from June, according to Fox News. CNN is based in Atlanta.
"The complaint alleges CNN was aware of the falsity at the time it published them but did so for the intentional purpose of hurting the campaign while misleading its own readers in the process ... the campaign filed this lawsuit against CNN and the preceding suits against The New York Times and The Washington Post to hold the publishers accountable for their reckless false reporting and also to establish the truth,” Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis said.
[Related: 'There will be more coming': Trump signals additional libel lawsuits after suing New York Times]
The piece at the center of the lawsuit was written by former Federal Election Commission general counsel Larry Noble and titled, “Soliciting dirt on your opponents from a foreign government is a crime. Mueller should have charged Trump campaign officials with it."
The piece made the case that special counsel Robert Mueller was wrong not to criminally charge members of the Trump campaign with conspiring with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election. Noble said Mueller "apparently" thought it was "reasonable to assume that top officials" for a presidential candidate were "ignorant to the ban on accepting support from a foreign government," and that it was "a strained view of the evidence."
The Trump campaign's complaint argued CNN was aware the statements in the article were false “because there was an extensive record of statements from the Campaign and the administration expressly disavowing any intention to seek Russian assistance” and still published it.
The president's legal team sent a letter to the publication requesting a retraction and an apology last month, but CNN refused.
CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The piece contains a note near the top that said Nobel "is a CNN contributor and has served as general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center and executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author; view more opinion at CNN."
The lawsuit is the third in a series of complaints the Trump campaign has filed against major media outlets in recent weeks. They also filed complaints against the Washington Post and New York Times regarding opinion pieces they allege were libelous.

Susan Rice and other hawks use sunk cost fallacy to justify staying in Afghanistan

Texto completo: Opponents of a full U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan have relied on many emotionally tinged arguments to make their displeasure clear.
Some, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, have called the agreement between Washington and the Taliban a sad surrender. (Bolton, of course, is reluctant to strike a deal with any of Washington’s adversaries short of full capitulation from the other side.) Others, such as Time columnist David French, have used fear over what might happen in an attempt to get President Trump to reverse course. Others blame the Trump administration for leaving the Afghan government to its own devices, as if sustaining a corrupt kleptocracy in Kabul is Washington’s eternal responsibility.
Yet one of the most emotionally satisfying but logically empty arguments frequently employed is that the White House would be disrespecting the service of hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops over the last 18 years if the United States withdrew from Afghanistan.
Former national security adviser Susan Rice was one of this argument's protagonists, writing in a New York Times op-ed that Trump is cheapening "the sacrifice of the 3,500 American and NATO service members who perished in Afghanistan” by throwing Afghanistan overboard. The Wall Street Journal editorial board ran the same play in their March 1 editorial, as did Sen. Lindsey Graham, who wrote in a statement that “we have fought too hard and sacrificed too much to allow our security gains to slip away.” Even British national security officials such as Ben Wallace, the U.K. secretary of state for defense, deploy them in public remarks.
Yet let’s be clear about what all of these fine men and women are essentially saying: that only through continued investment in blood and treasure can the hard work of U.S. and NATO soldiers be honored. In other words, only by magnifying the failure with more failure can the decadeslong U.S. experience in Afghanistan be considered worthwhile.
There’s a term for this highly dangerous reasoning: the sunk cost fallacy.
While psychologists have different definitions, the sunk cost fallacy is essentially a phenomenon where somebody continues to do something because he or she has already put so much time and effort into a project. People across a variety of industries can suffer from it.
To take one example: A CEO may decide to keep her company on life support simply to reassure herself that the years and millions of dollars she devoted to her firm were worth the trouble. Injecting more capital into the company would keep the doors open, but the CEO ultimately understands that the profit margin would still be dismal regardless of how much cash is invested. Declaring bankruptcy might be the smarter thing, but the boss refuses to do it to spare herself the emotional trauma.
The sunk cost fallacy has been a highly effective lubricant of the U.S. foreign policy machinery as well.
The most clear-cut case is the war in Vietnam, when the Johnson administration continued to deploy tens of thousands of additional soldiers to the rice patties and villages of South Vietnam each year just to hold the line and stall the appearance of defeat. After over a decade of involvement, President Richard Nixon finally saw the futility of it all, cut a deal with the Viet Cong, and got the U.S. military out of the conflict.
Afghanistan is no Vietnam, but it nonetheless suffers from a similar dose of sunk costs. Every dollar spent and every American life lost on the battlefield is used as justification to maintain a status quo that is simply not working. To quit now is spun as a tragedy. But how logical is it to honor tragedy with more tragedy?
Like the CEO who burned through more credit for a failed venture and the American president who couldn’t stomach being remembered as the commander in chief who lost a war, those counseling a reversal of full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan are merely worsening the pain. It would be imbecilic to sacrifice one more American life on behalf of a war in Afghanistan that can only be resolved politically, not militarily.
Yet on foreign policy, voters have lost patience for emotional arguments. It’s time to embrace the reality staring us in the face — the sooner Afghanistan is left to the Afghans, the better off the U.S. will be.

MSNBC's Brian Williams, New York Times editor agree Bloomberg could give every American $1M with money spent on ads

Texto completo: MSNBC host Brian Williams and New York Times editorial board member Mara Gay talked about how Michael Bloomberg's failed presidential campaign could have given $1 million to every person in the United States instead of using the money on ads.
An interview Thursday evening touched on a Tuesday tweet from journalist Mekita Rivas, who said: "Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads. The U.S. population is 327 million. He could have given each American $1 million and still have money left over, I feel like a $1 million check would be life-changing for people. Yet he wasted it all on ads and STILL LOST."
"When I read it tonight on social media, it kind of all became clear," Williams said about the tweet. "He could have given each American $1 million and had lunch money left over. It’s an incredible way of putting it."
"It’s an incredible way of putting it. It’s true. It's disturbing," Gay said. "It does suggest what we are talking about here that there's too much money in politics."
Critics on Twitter quickly pointed out that $500 million would not nearly be enough to give each American $1 million dollars. That sum would only be $1.53 a person — enough to buy each American an item off of the McDonald's dollar menu.
Later in the show, Williams acknowledged the foggy math.
"Turns out Mara and I got the same grades at math. I’m speaking of the tweet we both misinterpreted. He could give each American $1," Williams said. "Again, I didn't have it in high school. I don't have it tonight. I stand corrected. Sorry about that. The tweet is wrong."
Bloomberg ended his presidential campaign on Wednesday and endorsed Joe Biden. He spent $558 million on television and digital campaign advertisements. iFrame Object

Workplace vs. coronavirus: ‘No one has a playbook for this’

Texto completo: San Francisco • At Facebook on Thursday, the questions from spooked employees came thick and fast.
The evening before, the social network had disclosed that the coronavirus had been diagnosed in a contractor in its Seattle office and had said all employees in that city should work from home until March 31.
Other Facebook employees, some of whom had recently traveled for work, soon began asking their managers and one another: Who was the contractor? Had that person been near them? And what did that mean for their work?
That same alarm has now spread through other companies around the world, despite escalating efforts by many of the firms to deal with disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak that started in China. Microsoft, Amazon, Ford Motor, CNN, Citigroup and Twitter have put employees through work-from-home drills, dusted off emergency-response plans and ordered increasingly stringent safety measures to protect their workers.

Even so, the coronavirus has moved faster than their preparations. Amazon said this week that two employees in Europe, who had been in Milan, were infected with the virus and that one employee at its Seattle headquarters had also tested positive for it. HSBC said on Thursday that the coronavirus had been diagnosed in an employee at its global headquarters in London. And AT&T said a retail employee at one of its stores in San Diego had tested positive.
The challenges faced by workplaces have become a new front in the battle over the coronavirus, which has spawned more than 90,000 cases and caused more than 3,000 deaths around the world. While factories in China had already been closed by the outbreak and are now just ramping back up, global white-collar companies have rarely grappled with this scale of disruption — or the level of fear that has gripped workers.
“No one has a playbook for this,” said Dan Levin, who runs a small company outside Chicago, Cain Millwork, which makes furniture and wall paneling. He said he was planning to have some of his office employees work from home.
Many corporate memos, including those from HSBC and Facebook, now mention deep cleaning of office spaces and self-quarantining. Face-to-face job interviews have been all but banned by some firms, in favor of interviews conducted by teleconference.
At Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Washington, near a cluster of coronavirus cases, employees swapped stories this week about the outbreak in internal chat rooms. In one online conversation on Wednesday, which The New York Times reviewed, a Microsoft employee wrote of a rumor that someone at headquarters had been infected.
“Could it be true?” he wrote. “FWIW,” he noted, the corporate emails telling employees to work from home “don’t mention that NO Microsoft employees had been infected.”
Frank Shaw, Microsoft’s chief spokesman, said the company was not aware of any verified cases in its workforce. He said Microsoft had tried to communicate clearly to its employees that “we are using the advice being given from local officials and public health officials.”
Inside Amazon, while some workers emailed each other about whether masks provide effective protection, many were scrambling to deal with business problems caused by the virus, according to four employees who were not authorized to speak publicly. Those included whether Amazon will have enough products to offer for Prime Day, its summer sale event, or have enough drivers to handle a surge in online grocery orders as the virus spreads.
The depth of employee anxiety has forced senior executives to take calming measures. Uber sent out a memo to staff on Wednesday saying it had formed an internal task force to handle its response to the virus, according to a copy viewed by The Times.
The ride-hailing company urged employees to have empathy for one another, to make “data-driven decisions” and to restrict all nonessential travel until April. Uber added that it was working with an epidemiology consultant for further guidance.
“Much of this situation is new — not only for Uber, but for the world,” Andrew MacDonald, a senior vice president at Uber, wrote in the memo. “We won’t get everything right from the start.”
At its headquarters in Mountain View, California, Google also increased the amount of hand sanitizer available to employees, putting it in conference rooms and kitchen areas.
Other companies have tightened their travel restrictions. Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have said senior managers must approve international business trips. Walmart said on Thursday that employees could travel internationally only for “business-critical trips” and that it was limiting their travel to conferences and trade shows in the United States. And at CNN, the chief executive officer has begun personally vetting all intercontinental travel.
How companies have altered their response to the coronavirus over time has been evident with Twitter. On Sunday, the San Francisco social media company said it was suspending all nonessential travel for employees. A day later, it encouraged all of its employees — it has just over 5,000 — to work from home if they were able to.
Then on Thursday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, appeared at a financial conference in San Francisco and said he was rethinking a plan he had formulated to work remotely from Africa for three to six months this year.
“Everything happening in the world, particularly with coronavirus, I have to reconsider what’s going on and what that means for me and for our company,” said Dorsey, who is also facing a challenge from activist investors.
The measures that companies are taking in response to the virus may shift workplace behavior over the long term. Telecommuting, which has been in and out of favor for decades, may become more ingrained. The use of digital tools for remote collaboration may also rise.
Yet in the near term, having workers stay home could be devastating for some smaller businesses. Robert Luft, who runs a company in Cincinnati that installs technology in health care facilities and distribution centers, said an outbreak that prevented his technicians from showing up to work would put his business in a precarious situation.
“If it’s unsafe for people to have them on site, that definitely impacts my business,” Luft said. “Unfortunately there isn’t any type of contingency plan.”
Because Microsoft’s employees in the Seattle region are supposed to work from home for several weeks, the company does not need as many services from the vendors whose workers staff its cafes, drive its shuttles and support other on-site needs. On Thursday, the company said it would continue to pay the 4,500 hourly employees who work in its facilities, even if they are needed for fewer hours.
At Facebook, the company has been working on contingency plans for the impact of the coronavirus since January. Executives have tried to walk the line of hewing closely to advice from public health officials while trying not to cause a panic among employees, two Facebook employees said.
The social network quickly canceled its participation in a half-dozen events — from its annual F8 developer conference to its presence at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas — and has worked to use its products to help health experts study the spread of the virus. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said in a post this week the company was giving unlimited free Facebook ads to the World Health Organization to distribute information to users.
When one of its contractors was found to have the virus on Wednesday, Facebook shut down two of its four offices in the Seattle area — in Bellevue and Redmond — for a deep cleaning, according to two employees.
An Amazon employee who was later found to have the virus had also separately visited one of Facebook’s Seattle offices last month, prompting fresh concerns among employees. Facebook said it carried out “targeted deep cleaning and enhanced sanitation measures” at the office building that the Amazon employee had visited.
The company has also tried to keep its 44,000 employees sticking to business as usual. On Wednesday, it held a training session for managers on how to supervise teams of remote workers, the two employees said. And the social network was staying on course with a weekly question-and-answer session led by Zuckerberg on Thursday, which would be live streamed from Facebook’s Silicon Valley headquarters.

Texto completo: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced more temple and stake center closures on Thursday as the coronavirus spreads, marking the first closures in the U.S. and Europe due to the virus.
The Rome, Italy, location was added to the church’s list of temporarily closed temples, bringing the total number to five. As of Thursday, 148 people in Italy has died from COVID-19 — the highest number of deaths in any country outside of China, The New York Times reported.
Church services at the Bothell Stake in Seattle were also suspended amid the Washington outbreak, which has infected more than 70 people and resulted in 11 deaths.
In late February, the church announced the virus was hindering its missionary efforts across large parts of Asia.
Temples in Taipei, Taiwan; Seoul, South Korea; and Fukuoka and Sapporo, Japan, have shut down. The Hong Kong and Tokyo temples already were closed for renovation.
Missionaries planning to serve in Japan, Cambodia, Thailand, Mongolia, Singapore and South Korea have had their proselytizing curtailed in some way, including postponing start dates or receiving new, temporary assignments. Some near the end of the missions will return home early.
Missionaries in Hong Kong already were sent to new, temporary assignments.

Texto completo: So sorry, Democratic millennials. You’ve got to drop the idea that baby boomers control everything. When it comes to the Democratic presidential nomination, the finalists are too old to qualify.
Bernie Sanders, 78, and Joe Biden, 77, were both born during World War II. Is that a problem? I’ve always had a theory that as people get older, if they’re lucky, they get better and better at a more limited set of skills. (I use this argument frequently when the issue of my inability to keep computer passwords straight comes up.)
If it’s true, we’d really have an argument for Biden, who has endless experience working with Congress and dealing with foreign leaders. Sanders, on the other hand, is very, very, very good at giving his one basic speech. I believe he could deliver it while being swung from a crane over the Statue of Liberty.
Whoever wins, of course, will run against Donald Trump, 73, who has never made any attempt to actually learn how to run a country but has super-perfected his genius for bragging and insulting people on television
Trump is already making a big deal about Biden’s tendency to garble his words when he’s talking in public. “WATCH: Joe Biden confuses his wife with his sister,” tweeted the president’s campaign.
That was when Biden was making introductions during his victory speech Tuesday, and it was actually sort of funny. (“Ah, you switched on me!”) But I hope the Democrats are stockpiling video for the final campaign of, say, Trump’s speech at the Lincoln Memorial praising America’s revolutionary army for the time it “rammed the ramparts” and “took over the airports.”
Or the time he told a crowd “the kidney has a very special place in the heart.” Or the time he called his wife “Melanie” in a tweet. Or the time he demanded the media look into the “oranges” of the Mueller investigation. Or the time he referred to the midterm elections as the “midtown and midturn.” Or . …
We could go on and on. And you know, before November I bet we will.
Super Tuesday ruined the presidential hopes of Mike Bloomberg, 78, who bowed out with an endorsement of Biden. “I’ve always believed that data should inform our decisions,” Bloomberg said in what was nevertheless a very emotional address for him.
Well, money won’t buy you everything. But it will certainly make Bloomberg a venerated Biden supporter. He’ll be fine. Most of us would never get over having spent $600 million to win the delegates from American Samoa. But financially for Bloomberg, that’s pretty much like blowing $10 on a bad cheeseburger.
Elizabeth Warren, 70, was the youngest serious candidate in the Super Tuesday battle, and it certainly wasn’t any help. Coming in third in her home state was a terrible way to end a campaign. But when Americans in the future look back on her career, they’ll remember Warren as one of the pioneers who, like Hillary Clinton, helped to get the nation used to the idea that there’s nothing unusual about voting for a woman to be president.
Either Biden or Sanders, if elected, would be the oldest American entering a first presidential term. As of right now the record is held by Trump, who was 70, followed by Ronald Reagan, who was 69. Reagan went on to a second term that many people felt was marred by a certain … mental slippage. It’s sort of hard to tell whether Trump is failing in that way since he was so awful when he started out.
Well, we’ve had plenty of presidents who seemed to go off the rails in the prime of life. And these days an average man of 77 has about a 10-year life expectancy. That goes up if he doesn’t smoke or drink. And I’ll bet it really skyrockets if he has the entire staff of Walter Reed hospital at his beck and call.
The first time age was a big issue in a presidential election was back in 1840. William Henry Harrison, the Whig candidate, was 67 and his opponents referred to him as “a living mass of ruined matter.”
Harrison promptly released a doctor’s report: “vivacity and almost youthfulness of feelings. … Bodily vigor as good as that of most men his age. Subject to no disease but periodic headache.” For its time, it was probably more thorough than the one we got from Bernie Sanders.
Then, of course, Harrison got elected, went to Washington, and died a month after the inauguration. The only lesson the nation should derive from that story is that it’s a bad idea to give an extremely long inaugural speech in inclement weather.
Trump, who revels in his ability to attach insulting adjectives to people’s names, calls Sanders “Crazy Bernie.” That’s a tad ironic coming from a man who has been driving the nation nuts for more than three years.
The president calls Biden “Sleepy Joe,” which is maybe an age-related insult. But from Biden’s point of view, it’s not bad at all. Right now there’s nothing the nation would welcome more than a president whose worst flaw is making everybody feel like taking a nap.
We could so use some downtime.

Nicholas Kristof: Why Biden is the change candidate

Texto completo: If you want to oust President Donald Trump this fall and then achieve far-reaching changes such as universal health care, who should you vote for?
Until last week, the answer for many was Bernie Sanders, the champion of a “political revolution” that includes “Medicare for All.” But increasingly there’s a sense that in practice the real “change candidate” may be Joe Biden — because he has a better chance of winning the presidency and helping to elect a Democratic Congress — and that’s why he was the big winner Super Tuesday.
This was a triumph of pragmatism, an embrace by voters of a candidate they like rather than one they love, and that’s why Biden is now apparently the Democratic front-runner.
“I’m here to report that we are very much alive,” Biden announced after his Super Tuesday victories. Until South Carolina voters weighed in Saturday, people were checking his campaign to see if rigor mortis was setting in.
Angry Bernie voters may protest furiously that it was the “establishment” that revived Biden to seize a prize that seemed theirs. But that’s wrong. Biden’s rescuers weren’t party elders but a marginalized constituency that is often taken for granted: Southern blacks.
It was black voters who gave Biden a huge win in South Carolina on Saturday, reviving his fortunes and clarifying his role as the alternative to Sanders. It obviously helped that Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar exited the race and, along with Beto O’Rourke, endorsed Biden in time for Super Tuesday (and Klobuchar may end up Biden’s running mate, while Buttigieg could end up in a Biden cabinet). But this wasn’t a coronation; it was a groundswell among moderates fearful that a Sanders nomination would be a Republican dream.
We in the pundit world are awful at predictions, and we should all be humbled by the conventional wisdom of 2016 that Trump was unelectable. Still, Sanders is the single most liberal member of the Senate, according to GovTrack, and old-timers remember what happened to Barry Goldwater on the right and George McGovern on the left. Democratic members of the House — who presumably know something about their own districts — say that it would be harder for them to win with Sanders at the top of the ticket.
At a dinner with a dozen Democratic House members recently, I was struck by how worried some were that a Sanders nomination would cost them any chance of a Democratic Senate and might even hand the House itself back to Republicans.
I’m closer to some of Sanders’ positions than to Biden’s, and I particularly admire Sanders’ leadership and authenticity on human rights issues like Yemen. But I don’t think Sanders would be able to accomplish his aims as president any more than he has been able to as a senator (he was a primary sponsor of only seven bills that became law, and they are mostly insignificant items, such as naming post offices or designating “Vermont Bicentennial Day”).
What the Democrats need to stage a revolution, or even a healthy evolution, is to win not only the presidency but also the House and the Senate. Democrats flipped the House in 2018 with moderate candidates running on a practical, limited agenda, while progressives running in swing districts did poorly, and that’s a lesson for 2020.
Winning the Senate for Democrats got tougher with Roy Moore’s defeat in the Republican primary in Alabama on Tuesday, for Moore would have made it easier for Sen. Doug Jones, a Democrat, to be reelected. The betting markets suggest that Republicans have a better chance of winning the House than the Democrats do the Senate.
Republicans sometimes seemed giddy about the prospect of a Sanders nomination. Trump’s tweets suggested that he was terrified of Biden and Mike Bloomberg, and it’s no accident that Republicans were calling for investigations into the Biden family rather than into allegations about the Sanders family and Burlington College.
In Arizona, when Sen. Martha McSally tried to discredit her Democratic rival, Mark Kelly, her strategy was to release an ad accusing him of being a “Bernie Bro.” Being a “Biden Bro” conjures something less frightening.
Biden is plodding and uncharismatic, but he has solid working-class credentials, and he’s also one of the most decent people in politics. His empathy is hard-won from the pain of the loss of two children. Samantha Power, the former ambassador to the United Nations, says Biden would give out his private cellphone number to strangers who had suffered great personal loss, saying: If you feel low and have no place to turn, call me.
I think the Democrats with Biden have a good chance of winning the presidency, holding the House and perhaps taking the Senate. An economic slowdown seems likely because of the coronavirus, which also highlights Trump’s administrative incompetence. And Republican rhetoric about Democrats as socialists — the theme of the Conservative Political Action Conference this year was “America vs. Socialism” — is laughable if Biden is on top of the ticket.
So while Biden’s proposals aren’t as soaring as Sanders’, nor as comprehensive as I would like, they strike me as more achievable. In that sense, Biden may be the real candidate of change.

TESTING FOR COVID-19 VIRUS TO BE AVAILABLE IN PITTSBURGH

Texto completo: No cases of COVID-19 have yet been reported in Pennsylvania, but testing for the new coronavirus will be rolled out in Pittsburgh and across the country by Monday as private companies begin offering the service.
Burlington, N.C.-based LabCorp said its test for the new coronavirus would be available starting at 6 p.m. Thursday. The test will detect the presence of the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease.
"We have been intensely focused on making testing for COVID-19 available as soon as possible, working with the government and others to address this public health crisis," LabCorp President and CEO Adam H. Schechter said in a prepared statement.
Also Thursday, Secaucus, N.J.-based Quest Diagnostics Inc. said it would roll out a nationwide test for the new coronavirus starting Monday. Neither company will collect specimens for testing, which is usually done with a throat swab.
Instead, specimens will be collected by the patient's physician and forwarded to labs for analysis.
The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have also been doing testing for the coronavirus, but the entry of private companies into the market is expected to ramp up the number of tests that can be performed while cutting turnaround time.
LabCorp says its results will be available in three to four days. Quest officials were unavailable for comment.
Both lab companies have operations in Western Pennsylvania, with coverage of the tests by Medicare and most insurers, subject to the usual co-pays and deductibles of individual plans. Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield covers both the LabCorp and Quest tests; UPMC Health Plan only covers ones done by Quest.
Quest has had a joint venture with UPMC for lab services in the greater Pittsburgh area for 22 years. UPMC controls 49% of the venture, Quest 51%.
A doctor's order is needed before testing.
Other laboratories may also soon begin testing.
On Saturday, the Food&Drug Administration gave approval for 300 to 400 academic medical center laboratories nationwide to develop their own tests to identify the new coronavirus.
At a news conference Tuesday, UPMC said it was working to develop its own test, but officials were not available Thursday after announcements by the two private labs.
The new coronavirus, which spreads through contact with tiny droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze, was first identified in the Chinese province of Hubei in December.
At least 205 cases have been reported in 17 states, most in California and Washington state.

IMMIGRATION RIGHTS GROUPS RALLY AGAINST COLCOM

Texto completo: "Dime con quien andas y te dire quien eres ... Tell me who you associate with, and I'll tell you who you are."
In opening remarks, Guillermo Perez ended his statement by speaking in Spanish, then translating. It was a key point that would be stressed during a rally Thursday morning Downtown outside the office of the Colcom Foundation - a group known for its historic immigrant population-control campaigns and hefty funding of national immigration-reform groups.
Several members of local immigrant rights activist groups gathered near Stanwix Street and the Gateway T station and held signs critical of Colcom, asking that local civic and environmental nonprofit groups reject support from them. Members from the Pittsburgh Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, Thomas Merton Center, Veterans for Peace and Bend the Arc participated.
Moderated by Mr. Perez, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the LCLAA, additional members from each group also spoke and called for Pittsburgh to "drop Colcom" and reject support from the organization during the brief rally, which lasted less than an hour. The occasion marked the launching of a public campaign calling for thousands of groups in southwestern Pennsylvania to end their association with Colcom.
Founded in 1996 by Cordelia Scaife May, a philanthropic conservationist who served as chairman until her death in 2005, the Colcom Foundation has poured millions into a network of groups that have backed policies now pursued by President Donald Trump: militarizing the border, capping legal immigration, prioritizing skills over family ties for entry and reducing access to public benefits for migrants, according to The New York Times.
The foundation supports and helps fund many groups that have nothing to do with immigration reform or population control, however. The American Bird Conservancy, Tree Pittsburgh and the League of Women Voters of PA Citizen Education are a few examples.
"I cannot say that they've only done bad things," said Ben Gutschow, a junior at Winchester Thurston School and member of the youth-led environmental movement Fridays for the Future PGH. "Planting trees, providing crucial funds and promoting a positive quality of life I consider a good thing [by the Colcom Foundation]. But if we must compromise our values to allow discrimination, there should be no such place for this foundation here in Pittsburgh."
"I am tired and fed up with being told to go back to my country," said the student, who is from Guatemala.
In line with remarks made by Mr. Perez during the rally's opening, others called for local business entities to "cease legitimizing" the Colcom name, "until they divest from this mission of hatred and fear," said Dan Galvin of Veterans for Peace.
"Colcom's racist ideology shifts the blame toward the blameless and away from those who are most responsible for the environmental threats we face - namely those who poison our planet through fossil fuels."
At the end of Thursday's protest, participants handed out green pieces of paper listing a number for the foundation. "Call the Colcom Foundation and ask them to STOP funding white nationalist hate groups," the paper reads.
Several local civic and environmental groups are listed on the foundation's website as major grant recipients last year, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform and the Center for Immigration Studies. Nearly 70 Pittsburgh organizations received grants of $50,000 or more in the fiscal year ending in June 2019, according the foundation's website. The total amount of grants paid that fiscal year was $30,709,777.
Despite the criticism, the foundation's vice president, John Rohe, said Thursday the foundation is "pro-immigrant, and has zero-tolerance for the white nationalists." As the child of German immigrants himself, he said it's a misconception to think the organization is against immigrants.
"To be concerned about the level of immigrants due to overpopulation is not anti-immigrant," he said. "We hope to nurture the American dream for people who do come here."
The foundation's goal, according to Mr. Rohe, is to consider the long-term sustainable level of immigration. "How do we protect jobs and wages for underprivileged people in the U.S.?" he said. Protesters claimed Thursday that the foundation hides anti-immigrant sentiments in environmentalism. Yet, Mr. Rohe said he invites everyone, including the groups who protested Thursday, to an "informed conversation" in a "pro-immigrant, racially neutral manner."
"The long-term solution is to think of what level of immigration incentivizes employers to pay a living wage and to employ dignity upon labor," he said. "If you flood the labor pool, wages will be reduced, competition for jobs will reduce opportunities. We have 40 states that are confronting water issues in the foreseeable future."
"If we ignore these issues, it will be the underprivileged minorities who will be the first to pay the price."

Texto completo: Events across the country are being canceled due to the growing threat of the coronavirus, but it's business as usual in Western Pennsylvania.
While precautions are being taken at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in Pittsburgh and at the Monroeville Convention Center, event leaders are monitoring the spread of the virus with no current plans of calling off scheduled conferences.
"Fortunately, we're very lucky here in Pittsburgh," said John DeSantis, executive director of the Pittsburgh Home & Garden Show. "I think everybody understands we need to be careful, but we don't need to be alarmed at this point. Those of us who aren't in the hot spot areas ... we've had time to prepare."
The annual event opens today and runs through March 15 at the Downtown convention center. Now in its 39th year, DeSantis said it draws 350,000 people from a 200 mile radius -- from Cleveland to Harrisburg and from Lake Erie to Charleston, W.Va. More than 1,800 exhibits will be set up over 10 acres of floor space.
DeSantis said they are following the lead of the Allegheny County Health Department. All of the restrooms and dining areas have been scrubbed. Event officials have switched to antibacterial soap in the bathrooms and added hand sanitizer stations to areas where money and food are handled. Workers will wear gloves.
Shutting down
While Pittsburgh-based conventions are taking precautions, events across the country have been canceled as the virus spreads. As of Thursday, there had been 199 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. and 12 deaths so far, according to a New York Times tracker.
In Columbus, Ohio, the trade show associated with the Arnold Sports Festival has been postponed, officials announced this week. The festival itself will continue, just with spectators barred from the event. No coronavirus cases have been reported in Ohio.
A higher education technology conference in Orlando announced its April conference will now be done virtually, with four confirmed covid-19 cases in Florida.
In Austin, Texas, SXSW will go on as planned despite a number of companies and keynote speakers pulling out. That includes Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, the Austin American-Stateman reported. Texas has 12 confirmed cases of the coronavirus.
Internationally, the Inter-Pacific Bar Association conference in Shanghai slated for April was postponed until October. Similarly, the International Trademark Association's April conference in Singapore was postponed until 2022. Officials are working with event attendees to refund flights.
"Once you cancel one of these puppies it's not like you can turn around and go somewhere else because there's hotels and everything," said Dennis Unkovic, an international attorney with Pittsburgh-based Meyer, Unkovic & Scott LLP.
Locally, companies are also working to prevent the spread of the virus.
At the Bayer Group, internal and external gatherings of large groups have been restricted, along with the participation of external consultants, suppliers and visitors in meetings, according to spokesperson Daniel Childs.
International travel to and from high-risk countries like China, South Korea and Italy has also been reduced to a minimum.
At PNC Bank, which has plans in place to address the emergence of a pandemic, officials are monitoring the virus, said spokesperson Marcey Zwiebel. She added that officials have shared symptoms and methods of transmission with employees along with safe travel guidelines that follow recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Monitoring the spread
At the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, no events have been canceled at this time, said general manager Tim Muldoon.
"Obviously, everyone is keeping a close eye on it and it's kind of a fluid situation," Muldoon said. "Right now, we're definitely open for business."
Depending on the spread of the virus, Muldoon said officials will work with future event organizers on a case-by-case basis.
According to spokesperson Maureen Vogel, the National Safety Council's Northeast Conference & Expo planned for March 11 at the Pittsburgh convention center will continue as planned. She noted that officials are following coronavirus developments along with tips from the CDC and the U.S. Department of State.
"We urge all employers, including those planning to send staff to conferences, to assess their unique workplace environments and needs and make decisions accordingly," she said.
Officials for Encore Championship, a cheerleading competition slated for March 21-22 at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, said they are also monitoring the coronavirus and will make decisions based on the CDC, local health officials and event partners.
Officials with the Monroeville Convention Center did not return calls for comment.
Steel City Con is slated to be held there April 17-19.
"We have no plans for a cancellation of our April event," said co-owner of Steel City Con co-owner Robert Stein. "At Steel City Con, we are very cognizant of sanitary conditions with celebrities, vendors and fans at every show and will continue to be vigilant maintaining that standard moving forward."
The same is true for others across the region, DeSantis said.
"Pittsburghers are very prudent about this stuff," he said. "They do things to keep their families safe."

Texto completo: As travelers worldwide place their plans on hold because of the growing threat of the coronavirus, officials at Pittsburgh International Airport said Friday that things there are business as usual.
Bob Kerlik, a spokesman for the Allegheny County Airport Authority, said the airport has not received notice of flight reductions. He said there's been no quantifiable impact locally from the virus, which leads to the disease known as covid-19.
"As for passenger counts, in January we were up 3.2% year-over-year," he said.
The global toll of the novel coronavirus continued to rise this week, with cases topping 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The first suspected positive cases of the virus were confirmed in Pennsylvania on Friday.
State health officials said they contracted the virus through travel.
One of the two presumed positive cases is an adult from Wayne County who recently traveled to a country where the coronavirus is present, officials said. Another adult in Delaware County recently traveled to a part of the United States where the virus is present.
Kerlik said Pittsburgh International has no direct flights from China, Iran, South Korea or Italy, so any passenger screenings would happen before travelers land in Pittsburgh. The airport has emergencies plans in place, he said.
Beyond that, he said, the airport has upped its cleaning regimen, focusing heavily on common areas like restrooms, trains and moving walkways. Restrooms are being cleaned every two hours, and handrails in the trains four times a day.
He said about 30 hand sanitizer stations were installed throughout the terminals as well as at the entrance to the trains that move passengers between the landside and airside terminals.
Effect on airline industry
The airline industry has been crippled by the spreading virus, according to reports. Business Insider reported Friday that the Dow Jones Transportation index has plummeted more than 15% in the past month, and airlines are offering employees unpaid leave and postponing planned hiring.
The International Air Transport Association, an airline industry trade group, estimated this week that global revenue losses for the industry could reach between $63 billion and $113 billion. Even if the virus had been contained largely to China, the association still projected nearly $30 billion in losses.
White House officials Friday began mulling tax relief options for the airline, travel and cruise industries, according to The Washington Post.
One traveler told The New York Times that her flight from Los Angeles to New York was half empty. "A lot of us in the main cabin had our own rows," she said.
United Airlines announced this week that it will waive change fees for any travel scheduled for the next 12 months that is booked between March 3 and March 31. It has suspended flights between the United States and Beijing, Chengdu, Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Some service has been suspended between Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and Seoul, and CNBC reported Wednesday that it will cut domestic and Canadian flights by 10% next month.
Delta and American are also waiving change fees for flights booked before the end of the month.
Those who are keeping their travel plan -- or still mulling a summer vacation -- should pay close attention to any travel insurance they might purchase.
"Unfortunately even though the coronavirus has impacted travel on a worldwide scale, it is not listed as a covered event under most travel insurance policies," said Kasara Barto, a spokeswoman for the trip insurance comparison website Squaremouth. "Things like epidemics, pandemics and viral outbreaks in general typically aren't listed (in policies)."
Erin Gavin, an insurance product analyst with the website Insure My Trip, said travelers still making plans should seek out policies that allow cancellations for any reason.
She said most people want to be able to cancel their trips because they're scared, but fear -- based on the spreading virus or otherwise -- is never covered.
Some policies might cover CDC guidelines and travel advisories, but it varies, she said.

Trump campaign files 3rd lawsuit against a news organization

Texto completo: NEW YORK —
The Trump campaign filed a libel lawsuit against CNN on Friday for a column about the president and election help from Russia, the third such action against a news organization taken in the past two weeks.
The campaign said a piece by Larry Noble posted last June on the CNN website falsely says that the campaign considered seeking Russia's help in the 2020 campaign and “decided to leave that option on the table.” It made the complaint in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Atlanta, where CNN is based.
The lawsuit said the article doesn't back up Noble's statement with evidence, and that CNN and Noble had both shown a pattern of bias against Trump.
The network had no comment on the lawsuit, a spokeswoman said.
Earlier this week, the campaign sued The Washington Post for similar opinion pieces that discussed the Trump campaign welcoming Russian help in 2016. A week earlier, The New York Times was the target, for a Max Frankel op-ed suggesting Trump and Russia had an understanding to exchange campaign help for more favorable policies toward the country.
“The Trump campaign is trying to send a message, both to the press and the public, that you criticize the president at your peril,” said Brian Hauss, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberty Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.
After the lawsuit against the Times, First Amendment lawyer Theodore Boutrous wrote in the Post that the action had little chance of success in the court.
“Trump's lawsuit may be frivolous,” Boutrous wrote. “His intentions are serious and dangerous to us all.”
The Time, Post and CNN have all been frequent targets of Trump's Twitter attacks against the press. During Trump's presidency through this week, he's tweeted about CNN 191 times, with 106 of those tweets containing the word “fake.”
Jenna Ellis, senior legal adviser to the Trump campaign, said the publications had recklessly published false statements and intentionally misled their readers.
“False statements are not protected under the U.S. Constitution,” Ellis said. “Therefore, these suits will have no chilling effect on freedom of the press. If journalists are more accurate in their statements and their reporting, that would be a positive development, but not why these suits were filed.”
The lawsuits make no differentiation between news reporting and editorial pieces. Noble is a CNN contributor and a former general counsel of the Federal Elections Commission.
His article was published under the “CNN Opinion” banner and includes a note that Noble's opinions “are solely those of the author.”
The lawsuit claims the article caused damage to the campaign in the “millions of dollars.”

Captan a supuesto agente de ICE con arma larga en calle de El Bronx

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Un supuesto agente del Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE) fue captado en un video cruzando una calle en El Bronx con un arma larga.
Las imágenes que han alarmado a inmigrantes en el condado neoyorquino fueron reseñadas por Telemundo esta semana.
El video correspondería a una intervención de autoridades migratorias federales en Nueva York el pasado 3 de marzo.
Los residentes temen que lo anterior sea parte de un incremento en la presencia de agentes de “La Migra” en las calles de ciudades santuario como Nueva York.
“Toda la gente se espanta y ya uno no sabe qué hacer”, dijo una hispana entrevistada por Telemundo.
“Todos íbamos a salir cuando escuchamos que empezaron a hablar en inglés”, indicó un joven identificado como Mauricio, al tiempo que agregó que es la tercera vez que los agentes visitan el espacio.
El reporte destaca que la movida podría estar ligada a los nuevos esfuerzos del gobierno de Donald Trump para intervenir más en demarcaciones donde la cooperación con las autoridades federales de inmigración es limitada.
“Desgraciadamente, ya lo estamos nosotros viviendo acá en esta área”, agregó otra inmigrante.
ICE ha intensificado sus operaciones en las llamadas ciudades santuario con vigilancia las 24 horas y más presencia de agentes de élite alrededor de los hogares y los centros de trabajo de indocumentados para aumentar los arrestos y deportación de estos inmigrantes, reportó este jueves la agencia Efe quen hace referencia a un informe de The New York Times.
La oficina tiene previsto enviar a las calles de ciudades como Nueva York a cientos de agentes en las próximas semanas para reforzar sus operativos y patrullar las calles en coches que no estarán identificados.

Texto completo: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Restaurants in some 100 countries use Lavu’s online management platform, putting many of its customers on the frontlines of the battle against coronavirus.
To help, the Albuquerque-based company announced this week it will waive its monthly fees for any restaurant forced to shut down from the virus.
“We’ll waive the fees our customers pay monthly to keep their service up and running if a city is quarantined and the restaurant is forced to close,” said Lavu CEO Saleem Khatri. “We’ll do that for any customer around the world…If they’re closed one week, we’ll waive the fees for one month, if two weeks, we’ll take care of two months of payments.”
Restaurants and small businesses face some of the hardest challenges as the coronavirus spreads across the globe, because most achieve profitability through lean operations and thin margins, making even a short closure difficult to navigate.
“Cash is always tight,” Khatri said. “Any prolonged slow down can have a detrimental impact.”
Restaurants operating in places with coronavirus outbreaks have been hit hard. In Beijing, about 70% of all restaurants remain closed, the New York Times reported Thursday.
In King County, Washington, the site of the largest coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., restaurants and small businesses have reported marked declines in customer traffic, including Lavu customers in the area.
“We have multiple customers in Washington state and in the King County area,” Khatri said. “I spoke with several of them this week who said people are worried and panicking and restaurant traffic has slowed down. If that lasts even a few months, it will make life very hard for them.”
The virus is spreading to many more states, but there are no confirmed cases to date in New Mexico.
Congress approved $8.5 billion this week to help fight the virus at the federal and state levels. It includes money for subsidized loans for small businesses impacted by the contagion.
Lavu launched in 2010 with proprietary point-of-sale software for restaurants to manage all services on mobile devices in real time on a single platform, including front-end customer service and back-end administration.
Most Lavu customers are in North America, but the company is rapidly growing its base in Asia, particularly in Thailand and Malaysia.
“So far things are normal there, but we’re watching the situation closely,” Khatri said. “I think we should all prepare for a potential slowdown. We don’t know what the economic impact will be, but it could be meaningful.”

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Un supuesto agente del Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE) fue captado en un video cruzando una calle en El Bronx con un arma larga.
Las imágenes que han alarmado a inmigrantes en el condado neoyorquino fueron reseñadas por Telemundo esta semana.
El video correspondería a una intervención de autoridades migratorias federales en Nueva York el pasado 3 de marzo.
Los residentes temen que lo anterior sea parte de un incremento en la presencia de agentes de “La Migra” en las calles de ciudades santuario como Nueva York.
“Toda la gente se espanta y ya uno no sabe qué hacer”, dijo una hispana entrevistada por Telemundo.
“Todos íbamos a salir cuando escuchamos que empezaron a hablar en inglés”, indicó un joven identificado como Mauricio, al tiempo que agregó que es la tercera vez que los agentes visitan el espacio.
El reporte destaca que la movida podría estar ligada a los nuevos esfuerzos del gobierno de Donald Trump para intervenir más en demarcaciones donde la cooperación con las autoridades federales de inmigración es limitada.
“Desgraciadamente, ya lo estamos nosotros viviendo acá en esta área”, agregó otra inmigrante.
ICE ha intensificado sus operaciones en las llamadas ciudades santuario con vigilancia las 24 horas y más presencia de agentes de élite alrededor de los hogares y los centros de trabajo de indocumentados para aumentar los arrestos y deportación de estos inmigrantes, reportó este jueves la agencia Efe quen hace referencia a un informe de The New York Times.

Collins: The presidency is an old boys’ club

Texto completo: So sorry, Democratic millennials. You’ve got to drop the idea that baby boomers control everything. When it comes to the Democratic presidential nomination, the finalists are too old to qualify.
Bernie Sanders, 78, and Joe Biden, 77, were both born during World War II. Is that a problem? I’ve always had a theory that as people get older, if they’re lucky, they get better and better at a more limited set of skills. (I use this argument frequently when the issue of my inability to keep computer passwords straight comes up.)
If it’s true, we’d really have an argument for Biden, who has endless experience working with Congress and dealing with foreign leaders. Sanders, on the other hand, is very, very, very good at giving his one basic speech. I believe he could deliver it while being swung from a crane over the Statue of Liberty.
Whoever wins, of course, will run against Donald Trump, 73, who has never made any attempt to actually learn how to run a country but has super-perfected his genius for bragging and insulting people on television
Trump is already making a big deal about Biden’s tendency to garble his words when he’s talking in public. “WATCH: Joe Biden confuses his wife with his sister,” tweeted the president’s campaign.
That was when Biden was making introductions during his victory speech Tuesday, and it was actually sort of funny. (“Ah, you switched on me!”) But I hope the Democrats are stockpiling video for the final campaign of, say, Trump’s speech at the Lincoln Memorial praising America’s revolutionary army for the time it “rammed the ramparts” and “took over the airports.”
Or the time he told a crowd “the kidney has a very special place in the heart.” Or the time he called his wife “Melanie” in a tweet. Or the time he demanded the media look into the “oranges” of the Mueller investigation. Or the time he referred to the midterm elections as the “midtown and midturn.” Or . …
We could go on and on. And you know, before November I bet we will.
Super Tuesday ruined the presidential hopes of Mike Bloomberg, 78, who bowed out with an endorsement of Biden. “I’ve always believed that data should inform our decisions,” Bloomberg said in what was nevertheless a very emotional address for him.
Well, money won’t buy you everything. But it will certainly make Bloomberg a venerated Biden supporter. He’ll be fine. Most of us would never get over having spent $600 million to win the delegates from American Samoa. But financially for Bloomberg, that’s pretty much like blowing $10 on a bad cheeseburger.
Elizabeth Warren, 70, was the youngest serious candidate in the Super Tuesday battle, and it certainly wasn’t any help. Coming in third in her home state was a terrible way to end a campaign. But when Americans in the future look back on her career, they’ll remember Warren as one of the pioneers who, like Hillary Clinton, helped to get the nation used to the idea that there’s nothing unusual about voting for a woman to be president.
Either Biden or Sanders, if elected, would be the oldest American entering a first presidential term. As of right now the record is held by Trump, who was 70, followed by Ronald Reagan, who was 69. Reagan went on to a second term that many people felt was marred by a certain … mental slippage. It’s sort of hard to tell whether Trump is failing in that way since he was so awful when he started out.
Well, we’ve had plenty of presidents who seemed to go off the rails in the prime of life. And these days an average man of 77 has about a 10-year life expectancy. That goes up if he doesn’t smoke or drink. And I’ll bet it really skyrockets if he has the entire staff of Walter Reed hospital at his beck and call.
The first time age was a big issue in a presidential election was back in 1840. William Henry Harrison, the Whig candidate, was 67 and his opponents referred to him as “a living mass of ruined matter.”
Harrison promptly released a doctor’s report: “vivacity and almost youthfulness of feelings. … Bodily vigor as good as that of most men his age. Subject to no disease but periodic headache.” For its time, it was probably more thorough than the one we got from Bernie Sanders.
Then, of course, Harrison got elected, went to Washington, and died a month after the inauguration. The only lesson the nation should derive from that story is that it’s a bad idea to give an extremely long inaugural speech in inclement weather.
Trump, who revels in his ability to attach insulting adjectives to people’s names, calls Sanders “Crazy Bernie.” That’s a tad ironic coming from a man who has been driving the nation nuts for more than three years.
The president calls Biden “Sleepy Joe,” which is maybe an age-related insult. But from Biden’s point of view, it’s not bad at all. Right now there’s nothing the nation would welcome more than a president whose worst flaw is making everybody feel like taking a nap.
We could so use some downtime.

Postrel: The world is a giant cruise ship called COVID-19

Texto completo: I extended my hand to the woman with whom I’d been chatting for the past few minutes. “I’m Virginia,” I said.
To my surprise, she responded not with a handshake but with a closed fist. A white woman of a certain age, she was incongruously going for a fist bump. Her husband recommended it, she explained, to avoid spreading germs. We were, after all, on a cruise ship.
We were sailing from Los Angeles to Hawaii on the same line, Princess Cruises, that had a different ship quarantined in Yokohama, Japan, with an outbreak of the coronavirus known as COVID-19. As we set sail in mid-February, a ship was either one of the safest places, isolated from potential contagion, or the riskiest. But even without the threat of a potential pandemic, we had reason to be cautious.
Like college dormitories and military barracks, ships crowded with tourists are great incubators of disease, particularly the highly contagious norovirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhea. Come down with it, and your vacation is ruined. If enough people get sick, the whole cruise can come to an abrupt stop. Over the weekend, a norovirus outbreak forced a Princess cruise in the Caribbean to end a day early. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires ships to report sick passengers or crew. Last year, 10 cruises reported that more than 3% of their crew and passengers suffered gastrointestinal illnesses; eight were positively identified as norovirus.
On a cruise, you start paying attention to washing your hands properly. Signs in all the bathrooms, including your cabin’s, remind you to wash with soap for at least 20 seconds before rinsing thoroughly. Hand-washing stations and sanitizer dispensers greet you on entering the buffet.
With all those nudges, and the sight of other passengers conscientiously washing their hands, I developed better habits. Rather than a perfunctory soap and rinse, I really did count out 20 seconds, and made sure to get the backs of my hands and between my fingers. I washed my hands after blowing my nose and when I used the bathroom in the middle of the night. Never mind the coronavirus, I didn’t want to spend my vacation throwing up.
Why don’t we act this way all the time? Taking a half minute to wash your hands with soap is a trivial act that costs next to nothing, yet almost no one does it. We’d all be better off if it became a habit. “People who perform proper hand-washing have lower rates of diarrhea, viral infections (like the common cold) and foodborne illnesses,” notes the Cleveland Clinic. “The CDC says proper hand-washing also reduces kids’ absenteeism at school from gastrointestinal illnesses by at least 29%.” That was before COVID-19.
Pandemics can dramatically change everyday habits. AIDS certainly did. In the 1977 movie, “Looking for Mr. Goodbar,” Diane Keaton plays a woman who lives a double life teaching school by day and picking up men in bars by night. Her conventional would-be boyfriend proves himself a complete loser by wearing a condom, then regarded mostly as an old-fashioned form of birth control. She breaks into hysterical laughter. “Is this supposed to protect you or me?” she says, blowing it up like a balloon.
A decade later, attitudes had changed. In the 1987 comedy “Dragnet,” the cool young cop played by Tom Hanks wakes up with his girlfriend, finds his condom box empty and forgoes morning sex. “The first AIDS- influenced movie has reached the screen,” declared the New York Times. As “safe sex” entered the American vocabulary, real-life habits changed as well.
Washing your hands carefully is, by comparison, a minor shift in behavior. The coronavirus is a reminder that the world is a cruise ship, where we’re all trapped with each other. We need to start acting like it.

Texto completo: Philadelphia police have been quietly experimenting with Clearview AI, the controversial facial-recognition company that mines billions of images from social media and across the web, a department spokesperson said, confirming a recent BuzzFeed report.
The thousand or so searches the department ran last November were a test, according to the spokesperson, Staff Inspector Sekou Kinebrew. The department has not yet finished drafting a facial-recognition policy, he said, but one will be disseminated to staff in the near future.
But facial recognition is already a reality in Philadelphia, where police have access to a database called the Pennsylvania Justice Network (JNET) - and it could be an even bigger part of the future. The Streets Department currently has a request for proposals to upgrade the city's 100,000 streetlights to smart LED lights. In addition to numerous benign features - light sensors, temperature gauges and humidity readings - smart-light capabilities include license plate readers, microphones, and cameras with facial recognition.
Philadelphia has not ruled out including any of those features in its eventual "smart cities" investment, a city spokesperson said. And the Police Department has not yet decided whether it will pursue a contract with Clearview AI.
The investigative applications of facial recognition are numerous, Kinebrew said. But for civil-rights advocates, it's also a new frontier of concern - one with potential constitutional implications.
Clearview AI in particular has raised alarms. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal issued a blanket ban on its use in the state in January. That announcement followed a New York Times investigation that raised concerns about the security of the servers holding law-enforcement data. One expert warned, "The weaponization possibilities of this are endless." The paper also revealed that the company's investors and clients used it to spy on dates and at business gatherings.
Paul Hetznecker, a defense and civil-rights lawyer, said ubiquitous facial-recognition cameras could raise the same privacy concerns that the U.S. Supreme Court found unacceptable in Carpenter v. United States. The court in 2018 found that using cell-site records to track a person's movement over time was a privacy violation.
"With facial recognition, it's even more dangerous and more invasive," Hetznecker said. "We're moving toward a complete surveillance state. It means your movement through public space becomes not a free and unfettered movement through a free society. It becomes something easily tracked and documented."
A coalition of social-justice organizers called Philly Tech Justice is beginning to organize around digital surveillance, specifically facial recognition, said Devren Washington of the Media Mobilizing Project.
A resolution before City Council calls for enhanced video surveillance near schools as a response to gun violence. To Washington, the intentions are good, but the technology is vulnerable to abuse - it's like a high-tech answer to stop-and-frisk.
"They ended up using stop and frisk against a whole slew of people who are innocent of doing anything but looking suspicious," he said. "These investments in surveillance technologies are at the expense of investments into wraparound services" - for instance, job training and treatment programs - "which have been shown across the country to massively reduce crime."
Kinebrew said facial recognition software is viewed only as an investigative tool, to be used "in a discreet manner that limits the possibility of police action based on unverified results."
In addition, he said in an email, "Facial recognition software could be effective for identifying persons with Alzheimer's or dementia, as well as unidentified homicide victim cases."
JNET, the facial-recognition software in use by the department, can run comparisons with more than 35 million images, including PennDot's database of driver photographs, as well as photos from state and county probation, parole, and prison databases. A brochure quotes Philadelphia Police Sgt. Andrew Callaghan from 2018 after a series of heroin and fentanyl arrests.
"This would not have happened without the magic of JNET," he said.

CURRENTS: OUTDOORS PEOPLE AND THEIR INTERESTS

Texto completo: Today: Fred Haberman, chief executive and co-founder of his marketing and public relations agency, Haberman. A keen outdoor interest is hockey: He founded the popular U.S. Pond Hockey Championships, which just marked its 15th year on Lake Nokomis in Minneapolis.
Reading
I just finished Elton John's autobiography and am currently reading "Slowhand," a biography of Eric Clapton (shown). I love music and play guitar, so books about music and musicians are frequently on my to-read list. Actually, anyone who follows their passion inspires me, and I find the raw, authentic stories of their lives compelling and memorable.
Following
I tend to follow topics rather than people. This approach helps me uncover the stories we are telling ourselves. It also assists me in taking more of an objective, anthropological approach to understanding competing narratives -- which then hopefully helps me to identify new ways of solving old problems. I'm closely following the proposed sulfide-ore copper mines in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness watershed. I also follow climate science and what's happening at the poles, in particular how changes are affecting wildlife. I'm an avid reader of the New York Times and local newspapers, so at any given time I'm tracking a variety of topics.
Watching
In the wintertime, I watch the weather to see if my fellow pond hockey rink rats and I are going to have good conditions outdoors on the ice. In the summer, I keep an eye on the wind to know what to expect biking to work or around the lakes. And on the screen, I can't say enough about "Fleabag," an Amazon original. Pure creativity -- and hilarious. Also, I'm a "Jeopardy" addict. I record multiple shows and binge-watch to see if I can compete. Most often I can't.
Listening
My playlists include an enormous amount of blues, rock and Motown. I'll turn up Curtis Mayfield or the Grateful Dead or Phish, and play along on guitar. The Meters are a current obsession. And if it's not music, I'm probably listening to "The Moth" -- true stories told live -- which I think presents the most human, inspiring, well-developed storytelling you can find on the planet on a consistent basis.
Doing
I try to get outdoors as much as possible. Just recently, we had our annual outdoor hockey banquet. Meaning, hockey outdoors plus an outdoor banquet. We fired up the grill at 8:30 on a Saturday morning, and were wearing homemade, vintage USA Olympic jerseys and hats. We reminisced about where we were 40 years ago when the U.S. men's team skated away with the big win over the Soviet Union in the Olympics. Todd and Tony Smith brought their dad's 1980 USA Olympic Hockey coat. He was a trainer on that 1980 U.S. team. It was an incredible morning of outdoor hockey and camaraderie, all punctuated by an eagle flying multiple times over the creek next to the outdoor rink where we were playing! True Minnesota winter perfection.

Texto completo: Douglas Hodge, the former head of the global investment management firm PIMCO who was sentenced last month to nine months in prison for his role in the college admissions cheating scandal, plans to seek a new sentencing based on documents the government recently disclosed.
Attorneys for Hodge, 62, of tony Laguna Beach, Calif., signaled that the wealthy asset manager's intention in a motion filed Thursday in US District Court in Boston. PIMCO manages $1.91 trillion dollars, according to the company's website.
Hodge pleaded guilty in that courthouse in October to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services and wire fraud, as well as conspiracy to commit money laundering.
While stressing Thursday that Hodge takes responsibility for his actions and will surrender to authorities on March 20 to begin serving his sentence, his legal team also noted that late last month, “the government provided material to Mr. Hodge and other defendants that contained exculpatory information" that US Attorney Andrew Lelling's office knew about for over a year.
That information, according to legal filings, includes notes taken by the scheme's admitted ringleader, William “Rick" Singer, in which Singer indicated that in correspondence with parents, he characterized payments as legitimate donations to college athletic programs, rather than bribes. Prosecutors contend parents knew they were paying bribes.
In Thursday's motion, lawyers for Hodge, who was also fined $750,000 and ordered to perform 500 hours of community service, wrote that based on the newly provided Singer material, Hodge “anticipates filing a Motion to Vacate Judgment and for a New Sentencing Hearing, or, in the alternative, an Emergency Appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals to Vacate Judgment."
Hodge wants a 30-day extension of his current March 11 deadline to file a notice of appeal.
The feds had sought a two-year sentence for Hodge and alleged he conspired with Singer and others to pay bribes totaling $525,000 to get his younger daughter into the University of Southern California as a purported soccer recruit and his son admitted as a phony football prospect.
Hodge is one of more than 50 defendants charged in the breathtaking scheme, in which wealthy parents allegedly cut fat checks to Singer to get their children falsely classified as athletic recruits at fancy schools, effectively paving their way to admission, or to facilitate cheating on their children's SAT and ACT exams when the scores needed a little buffing.
Prosecutors say Singer, who has admitted to his starring role in the ruse and awaits sentencing, directed parents to mask the bribes as payments to his sham charity for underprivileged youth. He also directed funds to corrupt coaches and college officials in on the con, as well as to their athletic programs, prosecutors allege.
Hodge's lawyers wrote in Thursday's filing that “the government's intentional withholding of key exculpatory information prevented Mr. Hodge from supporting his crucial argument that he believed he was making donations to specific university programs."
Prosecutors have said they only recently turned over the Singer notes, which he initially sent to his attorney, after the attorney waived privilege.
In a separate development, US Magistrate Judge Page Kelley on Wednesday ordered USC to provide materials to another charged parent, Robert Zangrillo, without redaction so he can adequately prepare his defense.
Zangrillo is charged with multiple felonies for allegedly paying bribes totaling $250,000 to get his daughter into USC as a bogus crew recruit, among other actions. Zangrillo has pleaded not guilty to all counts.
Kelley wrote in Wednesday's order that USC previously provided the documents to Zangrillo in redacted form, but she has determined that “the redactions are impracticable."
That's the case, Kelley wrote, in part because Zangrillo's daughter wasn't presented to the Office of Admission at USC as a potential athlete, like other children of charged parents, but was instead “tagged" by the Athletics Department as a so-called “VIP."
Kelley cited an e-mail from Donna Heinel, a former USC athletics official charged in connection with the case, to Singer in which Heinel wrote that Zangrillo's daughter " 'was not presented as an athlete[,] we just advocated for her with Tim [Brunold, the dean of admission at USC] and Kirk [Brennan, director of undergraduate admission] as a transfer. She went over on our VIP list for transfers.' "
After Zangrillo's daughter was accepted, Kelley wrote, he paid Singer $200,000 and, at Singer's direction, gave a $50,000 donation to USC women's athletics. Prosecutors say the latter payment amounted to a bribe to Heinel, since one object of the alleged plot was to fund “designated university accounts over which the bribe recipients exercised discretion or that otherwise benefited them professionally," according to Kelley's ruling.
However, Kelley wrote, Heinel's e-mail to Singer opens the door for Zangrillo to argue that regardless of any fibs on his daughter's application, she was admitted “under a legitimate, accepted avenue of admission at USC: as a VIP."
Kelley cited a previously filed affidavit from Brunold, the USC admissions dean, in which he claimed his department doesn't track donations from an applicant's family. Brunold also asserted that family donor information isn't included in an applicant's file, and that if he “had known that a prospective student's family had donated $50,000 or $100,000 to USC, it would not have affected" the final admissions decision, records show.
Kelley called Brunold's bluff in Wednesday's order.
She wrote that Brunold's “statement is misleading, because while each carefully worded sentence may be true ... the unmistakable import of the statement is that donations are not important to the decision whether to admit students. That message is belied by many facts that have come to light in the course of this litigation."
In a statement Friday, USC pushed back on the suggestion that the school misled the court.
“We have always cooperated with the government and the courts and make every effort to provide information, including to the defendants," the university said. "Our redactions were intended to protect privacy, such as test scores, not to withhold any pertinent information. We provided unredacted documents to the government and the court."
The statement said USC is "reviewing the decision in detail and deciding next steps, including whether to appeal."

A Chinese Mystery and Covid-19's Economic Puzzle; Has Beijing 'contained' the virus? If so, was the cost worth the benefit, and would it be for the U.S.?

Texto completo: Words I never thought I'd read in the New York Times: "So Mr. Trump has a point."
This concession came in reference to this week's highly unrealistic death rate for Covid-19 announced by the World Health Organization, upping its guesstimate to 3.4%. Mr. Trump pooh-poohed the figure in an on-air phone call with Fox News's Sean Hannity and the Times could hardly jump on the latest outrage bandwagon having written itself one day earlier that the figure "came loaded with caveats." The biggest of these caveats, as you have read elsewhere, is the probable failure of governments in China and most countries to detect thousands of mild or symptomless cases. In the New England Journal of Medicine last week, U.S. experts predicted that the American fatality rate may prove closer to the flu's 0.1%.
To seek is to find with the new coronavirus infection. Until recently, the U.S. was doing the equivalent of looking for its lost keys under a streetlight by confining its testing to those with a demonstrable connection to an infected area or person. This was never a reason to take comfort that Covid-19 wasn't already here and spreading.
Containment means quickly tracing the contacts of sick people and encouraging them to quarantine themselves, as well as closing schools, workplaces and public events. In the U.S. and other countries, it probably will not involve the forcible imprisoning of healthy people in their homes as adopted in parts of China. Containment nonetheless is the strategy recommended by the World Health Organization.
In contrast, mitigation means accepting that the virus is running flu-like through society and focusing on the severely ill. As with the flu, the elderly and those in bad health are most in jeopardy. Hundreds of such people die a week from "acute respiratory distress" in the best of times (a whole research literature exists to examine which of these patients gain meaningful benefit from being kept alive with ventilators).
Now this question becomes societal. At what point should we stop working so hard to prevent transmission to people who most likely will have a mild flu- or cold-like experience in hopes of preventing a small percentage of severe cases that require costly medical intervention?
Containment, after all, has costs for people's well-being too: It deprives them of jobs and income as travel is curtailed, events are called off, and restaurants and other businesses empty out in ways that don't happen with the flu.
A debate in the British government and undoubtedly other governments was described in blunt terms by the Times of London this week: "Ministers and officials are considering the trade-off between allowing an acute outbreak, from which the economy would rebound more quickly, or trying to save more lives by imposing restrictions on mass gatherings and transport."
This remarkably important debate is now roiled by uncertainty out of China. Even as the government there may have changed tactics and started abetting Maoist-style rumors that the virus originated in the U.S., visiting experts have credited an astonishing turnaround. Cases in the epicenter of Wuhan have plummeted precipitously. The spread of the epidemic to other provinces seems to have been all but curtailed.
In a startling statement, the WHO's Michael Ryan claimed in a Monday briefing: "Here we have a disease for which we have no vaccine, no treatment, we don't fully understand transmission, we don't fully understand case mortality, but what we have been genuinely heartened by is that unlike influenza, where countries have fought back, where they've put in place strong measures, we've remarkably seen that the virus is suppressed."
Dr. Ryan here suggests the new coronavirus may be unflu-like in its susceptibility to containment but it's hard to know since nothing similar has ever been tried with the ordinary flu, which is believed to kill upward of 300,000 globally every year.
An unquantifiable factor (if this picture of Chinese success holds up) is how much is due to the strong-arming of the Chinese government and how much to the voluntary compliance of the Chinese people, who apparently have taken to heart instructions to stay home, wash their hands and cover their mouths when sneezing. Witness accounts describe neighbors pressing on travelers alcohol-soaked cotton balls to clean their hands and packs of tissues to be used when pushing elevator buttons. Chinese internet companies reportedly use cellphone and social-media data to alert users when and where they may have crossed paths with an infected person.
To repeat, nothing similar has been tried with respect to flu outbreaks that kill thousands a year because, until now, nobody thought it worth doing. Publics everywhere accepted flu risk (which Covid-19 may be no worse than) as a cost of going about their lives in the world.

Deval Patrick to endorse Biden, adding to front-runner's moderate coalition

Texto completo: Former governor Deval Patrick, who pitched himself in part as a moderate during his own short-lived presidential run, will back former vice president Joe Biden in what's transformed into a one-on-one race with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination.
Patrick is expected to appear with Biden and actress Vivica A. Fox on Sunday in Jackson, Miss., two days before voters there head to the polls in the primary.
Massachusetts' first Black governor, Patrick adds to the growing list of one-time candidates to endorse Biden, and offers him a prominent surrogate in Mississippi, where nearly 40 percent of residents are African-American. Sanders on Friday canceled his own rally in Jackson.
“At a time when our democracy is at risk, our economy is not working for many Americans, and our role in the world is unsteady, America needs a unifying and experienced leader, who can and wants to make life better for everyone everywhere. Joe Biden is that leader," Patrick said in a statement Friday, calling Biden a “champion for vulnerable and marginalized Americans."
“He sees the unseen and hears the unheard — and that sincere concern for others informs not just the kind of work he does but the kind of man he is," Patrick said.
Biden has quickly consolidated support among moderate Democrats amid his sudden return to front-runner status, drawing on high-profile endorsements from former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — two of his former rivals — ahead of his resurgent Super Tuesday showing.
Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg ended his campaign the next day, and threw his support behind Biden. And Senator Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the race on Thursday, though she did not indicate who she may endorse in the primary.
Biden has already leaned heavily on his support in the South to reemerge in the race, where Tuesday's slate of primaries include Missouri but also key votes in Michigan and Washington state.
Before ending his own presidential bid last month, Patrick envisioned a path to the nomination that relied, in part, on slicing into Biden's support among Black voters in early states like South Carolina.
In November, Patrick called himself a “big, big fan" of Biden's, but also questioned whether his pitch would connect with voters, saying Biden's campaign message of “'if we just get rid . . . of the incumbent, we can go back doing what we used to do,' misses the moment."
Patrick said at the time that part of the then-sprawling field had broken into “camps of nostalgia," a comment that also appeared aimed at the 77-year-old Biden, now on his third campaign for president.
But in bolstering him Friday, Patrick pulled from his own oft-used phrases on the campaign trail, where he emphasized the need to unify voters and pitched Biden as the one to do that.
“Joe knows that the times and challenges before us demand new ideas and bold actions," Patrick said in his statement. “But he also knows that change that lasts will require us to turn to each other rather than on each other, and that we will have to model a politics that says we don't have to agree on everything before we work together on anything."
The two have a long history, starting in the mid-1990′s when Biden chaired Patrick's confirmation hearing to head the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.
Patrick on Friday called Biden his “go-to contact on stimulus spending" when Patrick was governor, and when Patrick weighed his late-entry bid for the White House in November, Biden was among those he called.
He telegraphed last month that he would remain involved in the race, saying when he ended his campaign that “no one can stand on the sidelines at a time like this. I, for one, will not."

Hachette Cancels Woody Allen Memoir Following Staff Protests; Dozens of staffers on Thursday walked out in support of Mr. Allen's son, Ronan Farrow

Texto completo: Lagardère SCA's Hachette Book Group on Friday said it had canceled Woody Allen's memoir, one day after an estimated 75 to 100 Hachette employees walked out of their offices in protest of the coming title.
The book, "Apropos of Nothing," had been scheduled to publish on April 7.
"As a company, we are committed to offering a stimulating, supportive and open work environment for all our staff," New York-based Hachette said in a statement. "Over the past few days, HBG leadership had extensive conversations with our staff and others. After listening, we came to the conclusion that moving forward with publication would not be feasible for HBG."
Efforts to reach Mr. Allen for comment were unsuccessful.
Those protesting had expressed support for Mr. Allen's son, Ronan Farrow, who criticized Hachette earlier in the week for its decision to publish the book.
Mr. Allen's book was to have been published by Hachette's Grand Central Publishing imprint. In October, a sister imprint, Little, Brown & Co., published Mr. Farrow's nonfiction book "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators."
Mr. Farrow has consistently voiced support for his sister Dylan's account that Mr. Allen molested her as a young girl in 1992, and reiterated that support in "Catch and Kill."
Mr. Allen has continued to deny the accusation by Ms. Farrow and her mother, Mia Farrow, who was his longtime partner. Mr. Allen was investigated by the Connecticut State Attorney but wasn't charged.
In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Farrow said he could no longer work with Hachette. He said he was "disappointed" to learn that Hachette was publishing Mr. Allen's book, and added that Hachette's behavior showed "a lack of ethics and compassion for victims of sexual abuse, regardless of any personal connection or breach of trust here."
Mr. Allen's memoir was described on Amazon.com as "a comprehensive account" of Mr. Allen's personal and business life, including his "relationships with family, friends and the loves of his life." Late Friday afternoon the book ranked No. 259 on Amazon's bestseller list, reflecting early orders for the title.
Hachette said that it would return rights to the book to the author.

Sanders and the Soviets; Even while visiting a prisoner in Cuba, the senator still wouldn't acknowledge the horror of communist tyranny?

Texto completo: The New York Times has obtained 1980s Soviet documents showing how the communists planned to use then-Mayor Bernie Sanders' Burlington, Vermont for propaganda purposes. Meanwhile, an American who was held captive in a Cuban prison recounts a disturbing Sanders visit in 2014. How many times does a U.S. politician need to laud Marxist dictatorships before Democrats decide he's unfit for the presidency?
Anton Troianovski reports in the New York Times on the effort by Mr. Sanders to forge a sister-city relationship between Burlington and Yaroslavl in Russia. Mr. Troianovski writes of Mr. Sanders:
Unbeknown to him, his desire for friendship meshed with the efforts of Soviet officials in Moscow to "reveal American imperialism as the main source of the danger of war."
The Times account reveals a Soviet Foreign Ministry document given to Yaroslavl officials saying that one "of the most useful channels, in practice, for actively carrying out information-propaganda efforts has proved to be sister-city contact."
Mr. Troianovski reports the response from the current Sanders campaign on his 1980s activities:
"Mayor Sanders was proud to join dozens of American cities in seeking to end the Cold War through a Sister Cities program that was encouraged by President Reagan himself," a Sanders campaign spokesman, Mike Casca, said in a statement. "The exchange between Burlington and Yaroslavl, which continues to this day, confirmed Sanders's long held view: by meeting face to face, we can break down the barriers and stereotypes that exist between people and their governments."
Yes, Reagan favored cultural exchanges. But it's one thing to visit another country and share information about life in the United States. It's quite another to return home and promote a favorable portrait of a totalitarian regime. Mr. Troianovski reports on the aftermath of a 1988 Sanders visit to the Soviet Union:
"People there seemed reasonably happy and content," Mr. Sanders told reporters in Burlington about Yaroslavl, a city of about 600,000. "I didn't notice much deprivation."
Cultural exchanges also don't require that politicians suggest a moral equivalence between the United States, which was defending the free world, and the Soviet empire, which was attempting to enslave it. Mr. Troianovski continues:
Two days after returning to Vermont, Mr. Sanders wrote to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, asking for help in setting up the sister-city program.
"It is my strong belief that if our planet is going to survive, and if we are going to be able to convert the hundreds of billions of dollars that both the United States and the Soviet Union are now wasting on weapons of destruction into areas of productive human development, there is going to have to be a significant increase in citizen-to-citizen contact," Mr. Sanders wrote.
Then and now, Mr. Sanders keeps finding ways to laud Marxist tyrannies. On Wednesday Tim Mak of National Public Radio reported :
American Alan Gross, a prisoner in Cuba for five years during the Obama administration, is accusing Bernie Sanders of commending the communist country when the senator came to visit him behind bars.
Mr. Sanders was visiting Cuba as part of a congressional delegation in 2014, and he came along with Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) and then-Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.) to visit Mr. Gross.
Mr. Mak of NPR describes the condition of Mr. Gross in the communist prison:
He spent 1,841 days in detention, during which he lost five teeth and over 100 pounds. He also said his interrogators threatened to pull out his fingernails and to hang him.
"The first year of my captivity was akin to sensory deprivation because I saw about 20 minutes of sunlight during the first year," Gross said.
The Obama administration and Gross' advocates said he was wrongfully convicted. He was ultimately released by Cuba in exchange for the U.S. government releasing three Cubans convicted of spying.
One would think the horrific treatment of Mr. Gross and its brutal physical toll would make an impression on any visitor, but one senator did not react like the others. According to NPR:
Gross said Heitkamp and Tester brought him a big bag of peanut M&M's, a memory that Gross remains fond of today because of his undernourishment at the time. Sanders brought an issue of The Atlantic magazine... [Gross] said he had a pleasant conversation with Heitkamp and Tester, while Sanders remained mostly quiet for the duration of their one-hour meeting... But near the end, the Vermont senator offered a comment to the detained American, saying he didn't see what was so wrong with the country.
Gross, as a prisoner in that country, said he took offense to the remark.
"I just think, you know, it was a stupid thing for him to do," Gross told NPR. "First, how could he not have seen the incredible deterioration of what was once the grandeur of the pre-Castro era. And two, how could he be so insensitive to make that remark to a political hostage — me!"
NPR notes there is a caveat to this story:
Gross had alluded to this story before, in a podcast with Politico in 2016. But as he told the story he backtracked.
"I had the impression that Bernie didn't see that there was so much wrong with the country that he was visiting," Gross told Politico, before adding: "Oh, no, no, no. Not really. Not really. He didn't say so much as that."
Gross says now that he didn't want to cause a stir.
"I wanted to soften the blow at the time because I didn't really think it was all that relevant to what we were talking about for the podcast," he said.
The issue could not be more relevant now. Did Bernie Sanders really visit a starving prisoner in a communist dungeon and express sympathy for his captors?

Texto completo: So really, how do you stop touching your face? A lot of ideas have been floated in the media: * Use tissues to tend to itches or eyeglass adjustments.
* Become aware of your compulsive behavior. Even video yourself.
* Place notes around your desk not to touch your face. Or set periodic device reminders.
* Practice with a scarf on your face, to see how often you touch it.
* Or wear gloves or tape on your fingers (although a glove itself could also carry germs).
* Sit on your hands during meetings.
* Occupy your hands with stressballs or other objects.
* Or, simply don’t think about touching your face. Put another way, don’t worry about it so much. "My general advice would be that people should try to reduce their stress overall, as opposed to obsessively worrying about what they touch," Stew Shankman, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University, told The New York Times.

Texto completo: OLD SAYBROOK — Asked why she and fellow singer-songwriter Richard Shindell keep finding themselves singing together, Lucy Kaplansky had a simple answer.
“It’s the unique blend of our voices,” said the acclaimed songsmith, who returns with Shindell to The Kate Saturday.
The New York Times described Kaplansky’s harmony as “so sensitive that her voice often seems like an inflection of her partner’s.” As for Shindell, his voice evokes “a baritone infused with the dark glow of headlights on blacktop.”
It pretty much began in 1998, when the two, along with folk-pop luminary Dar Williams, released “Cry Cry Cry,” a single self-titled album in 1998. Critics swooned.
The Washington Post praised the “lush sweetness” of the trio’s voices. The New Yorker dubbed the release “a collection of lovely harmonizing and pure emotion.” The “‘songwriters’ songs” on the album, the New York Times wrote, “transform life’s chaos into tales that can be absorbed and lessons that can be passed on.”
During the national tour of sold-out concerts that followed, something evidently clicked for Kaplansky and Shindell.
In the years since “Cry Cry Cry,” the two kept harmonizing, at festivals, on the 2015 Americana album “Tomorrow You’re Going” produced by two-time Grammy Award winner Larry Campbell, and in a 2017 revival of their celebrated folk-pop collaboration with Williams.
It’s not only the rare blend of their voices that explains the staying power of their collaboration.
“We love a certain kind of country song, and we both believe in the power of song and the power in singing in harmony, plus we’re great friends, so it’s just a win-win-win,” said Kaplansky in a recent interview from her home in New York.
While both have carved reputations as sought-after songwriters, “there’s nothing like singing a great song,” said the Chicago native, who’s lent her voice to harmonies on the albums of Grammy winners Shawn Colvin, Nanci Griffith and Suzanne Vega, and who soon will record a new album of children’s songs she learned from her father.
“It doesn’t matter whether we wrote it or not, if you love a song by somebody else, then singing it is pretty much just the best thing in the world,” she said.
True to that philosophy, the two will cover songs from both “Cry Cry Cry” and the rollicking “Tomorrow You’re Going,” with selections that range from “Making Plans” from Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton to Texas troubadour’s Robert Earl Keen’s “Shades of Gray” to U2’s “Sweetest Thing.”
They’ll also showcase their harmonizing chops with songs including “Love Hurts” and “Cold Missouri Waters,” and will perform some of their own songs.
The show at The Kate will be noteworthy for yet another reason.
Shindell, who splits his time between Buenos Aires and New York’s Hudson Valley, “is taking a break from music, so this is the last time we’ll be singing together for I don’t know how long,” Kaplansky said. “It’ll be that much more special.”
Lucy Kaplansky & Richard Shindell will perform 8 p.m. Saturday at the Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center, 300 Main St., Old Saybrook. For tickets and information, visit www.katharinehepburntheater.org or call 800-503-1286.

Texto completo: Afghan women have been working to build peace for decades. We spent years fighting for basic rights and, over the past year, for a seat at the table in talks between the United States and the Taliban. We are not reassured by the agreement signed Saturday by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban's Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, or by the process that led up to it.
This is a critical moment for our country. The window of opportunity to ensure that all Afghans are protected in the next phase of the peace talks is narrow. Despite the significant progress made in women's political participation in Afghanistan, Afghan women still face huge obstacles.
For a start, Afghan women and representatives from civil society and other minority groups should have been at the table for the U.S.-Taliban talks that led to this agreement, but we were not. History has shown us that women and minorities stand to lose the most from any deal made behind closed doors and by a room full of men.
Saturday's agreement lays the groundwork for talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. We were not surprised to read recently that while Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani is tired of bloodshed and war, he opposes preconditions to these talks. Instead of guaranteeing to protect the provisions in the Afghan Constitution that grant women equality, he suggested in a New York Times op-ed that this issue can be resolved through "consensus among Afghans."
This is doublespeak for reopening peace negotiations on the hard-won legal rights that Afghanistan's women have secured through years of blood, sweat and tears. We have faced unimaginable odds and made enormous sacrifices in our battle for basic rights and freedoms.
More than 100,000 Afghans have been injured or killed in the past 10years since the United Nations began systematic documentation of civilian casualties, and there is not a single Afghan citizen whose life has not been affected by this war.
Afghan women are desperate for an end to the violence and a durable peace, but we fear that negotiators will trade away our rights for a deal. Just last week, in order to preserve its own negotiations with the Taliban, the United States signaled President Ashraf Ghani to delay his second-term inauguration, and he did.
How can we expect the Taliban and the warlords to treat us as equals when the lead negotiators have refused to give us a seat at the table?
Women and girls make up about half of the Afghan population, and 64% of the population is under the age of 25. A sustainable peace simply cannot be built without us.
Their demands are clear: Elected representatives must lead the negotiations, the constitution must be preserved and efforts must be made to reduce violence across the country.
The new U.S.-Taliban agreement and the ensuing intra-Afghan negotiations must address our rights in specific terms, not broad generalizations.
Afghan women are not asking anyone to grant us our rights. Our rights are clearly enshrined in our country's constitution, our national laws, international law and sharia law.
Our message to Mr. Haqqani and other Taliban negotiators is simple: Our rights are guaranteed, and we have a right to sit at any table you do.

Texto completo: Southwest Florida book lovers get to hear the stories behind the stories Saturday at the annual Southwest Florida Reading Festival.
Twenty two authors — most of them New York Times bestsellers — will visit the Fort Myers Regional Library in downtown Fort Myers, where they'll talk about their craft, sign books and meet fans.
The lineup includes popular writers Jennifer Chiaverini, Lincoln Child, Kate Messner, Michael Koryta, K.A. Holt and especially Erik Larson — who was such a hit in 2012 that fest organizers brought in a bigger tent this year to handle the expected crowds.
"He's a big name," says fest coordinator Melissa Baker. "We love Erik Larson. And whenever he has a chance to come, we know the crowds will follow."
In addition to the authors, the 21st annual festival features food trucks, free books for kids, storytelling programs, arts and crafts, contests and more. Here's what you need to know about the popular event:
WHEN AND WHERE The festival takes place 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at Fort Myers Regional Library, 2450 First St., downtown Fort Myers.
The event will happen rain or shine. All activities are either under tents or inside the library, Baker says.
ADMISSION Everything is free.
THE WRITERS This year's lineup includes historical nonfiction writer Erik Larson, best known for "The Devil in the White City," "Isaac's Storm" and "Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania." His new book, "The Splendid and the Vile," explores British prime minister Winston Churchill and London during the Blitz.
The News-Press interviewed Larson in 2012, the last time he visited the Reading Fest.
Larson said he spends years researching his nonfiction books about topics such as a deadly hurricane ("Isaac's Storm"), a serial killer stalking Chicago during the 1893 World's Fair ("The Devil in the White City") and life during Nazi-era Germany ("In the Garden of Beasts").
The Seattle author starts with week-long stints handling and photographing historical documents at the Library of Congress, and then he actually visits the places he's writing about. That's vital to creating a sense of place in nonfiction, he said.
With "In the Garden of Beasts," many of the Nazi-era buildings had been blown to bits by Allied bombs. But Larson was surprised to see many still standing, including the bullet-pocked Air Ministry Building and the Hotel Esplanada.
"Those details are what can bring a story to life, Larson said. "They give you the sense that all of this was real."
Other popular writers at this year's festival include horror and techno-thriller novelist Lincoln Child (the Jeremy Logan series and Agent Pendergast series), novelist Jennifer Chiaverini (the Elm Creek Quilts series), kids author Kate Messner ("Over and Under the Snow," "Breakout" ), bilingual kids author Monica Brown ("Frida Kahlo and Her Animalitos," "Waiting for the Biblioburro") and thriller novelist Michael Koryta ("If She Wakes," "How It Happened").
Koryta already has plenty of fans, Baker says, but he'll probably be even more famous after October. That's when the movie adaptation of his novel "Those Who Wish Me Dead" is scheduled to hit theaters with star Angelina Jolie.
"If people don't know about him yet," Baker says, "they will soon."
See the full list of authors below.
WHAT'S NEW A new readers zone debuts this year in the library's children's area for kids younger than kindergarten-age. Activities include carnival games, therapy dogs and a 3 p.m. storytime with Disney characters Ariel, Belle, Anna and Elsa.
"We wanted to offer something for the younger children, a little bit more so than usual," Baker says. "So we're really excited about that. ... All throughout the day, there will be something for the younger kids."
Another new thing: Raffle tickets for the chance to become a character in one of the authors' upcoming books. Seven authors are participating: Jack Carr, Sonali Dev, Mark Greaney, William Kent Krueger, Jenn McKinlay, Mary B. Morrison and Chris Pavone.
Tickets are $10 for one chance, $20 for three, $50 for 10 and $100 for 25.
Each character will be chosen at the discretion of the author — and so will what the author does with that character (such as killing them off). "What the author does with you, or your character, we have no control over it," Baker says.
FREE BOOKS All kids get to leave the fest with a free book — and there are hundreds to choose from.
"We're very proud of that," Baker says. "We're making sure every child and teen gets a free book."
The idea is to encourage literacy and turn Southwest Florida kids into life-long readers and learners. "We know that for some people who come to our festival, this may be the one book that they own," Baker says. "So we want to make sure that we always leave kids with a book in their hands."
The stacks of new books include popular titles for all ages, both in English and Spanish. "You're going to find a wide variety of titles, just like a book store," Baker says.
THE FOOD For the second year, First Street will be blocked off in front of Fort Myers Regional Library to make room for food trucks and food vendors. That way, people can grab something to eat and and then get back to the authors.
This year's food trucks and vendors are American Grilled Cheese Kitchen, Pelican's Snoballs, BurgerQue, Uncle Dan's Olde Fashioned Kettle Corn, Chocolatte's Coffee & Roasting and — as always — Jason's Deli.
You can read menus at readfest.org /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ Menus.pdf.
PARKING Parking is free on downtown streets during the weekend. You can also parking in the city's parking garages for a flat fee of $5.
THE MISSION The Lee County Library System started the reading festival in 1999 to encourage reading literacy, and to introduce people to the library and its various services and programs.
The festival attracts an estimated 10,000 people every year.
THE FULL LINEUP Here are all the authors appearing at the 21st annual festival: Kamilla Benko, Monica Brown, Jack Carr, Jennifer Chiaverini, Lincoln Child, Sonali Dev, Karina Yan Glaser, Mark Greaney, Sara Holland, K.A. Holt, Michael Koryta, William Kent Krueger, Erik Larson, Jenn McKinlay, Kate Messner, Alexandra Monir, Mary B. Morrison (aka HoneyB), Zachariah OHora, Chris Pavone, Lisa Unger, Sara Varon and Susan Beckham Zurenda.

Like poets and painters, photojournalists use images to tell stories. But would you call a photojournalist an "artist?"
That question is answered with a rousing "Da!" when referring to Russian photographer Leonid Bergoltsev. The 87-year-old Hillyard resident, whose career spanned four decades in his native Soviet Union, is the subject of a retrospective opening at Hamilton Studio near Kendall Yards today.
"Leo is an absolute treasure," said local vintage film photographer Kathy Kostelec of Cherry Street Studios. "It's important for Spokane to learn more about him and his work, and to experience the outstanding artistry of this renowned photojournalist."
More than 100 of Bergoltsev's black and white photos will be on display at Hamilton Studio in a show titled "People Among People: Other Times, Other Places." The pictures were plucked from the Russian émigré's photojournalism career, back when he lived in the former Soviet Union.
Bergoltsev's influence reached its highest levels while on staff from 1958 to 1972 at Soviet Union magazine, (Russia's glossy equivalent to America's Life magazine). A free-thinker with a sparkle in his eye and humor in his frame, Bergoltsev was the fly on the wall behind the Iron Curtain.
He took candid portraits of the Communist Party's Politburo, including Khruschev, Brezhnev and Kosygin. He photographed virtuoso Van Cliburn on stage the night he won the Tchaikovsky piano competition in Moscow. Rarely caught without a camera in hand, Bergoltsev captured in his lens author John Steinbeck, New York Times correspondent Harrison Salisbury, French actress Simone Signoret, and the Pope during their travels to the Eastern Bloc.
There wasn't a single photo exhibition in the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1991 in which Bergoltsev did not participate. His career took him all over the world: China, Russia, America, Germany, Taiwan, Japan, France and throughout the Soviet Union. He served as head of the photography section of the Moscow Committee of Graphic Artists, and helped organize the USSR Union of Photographers. He held 6 one-man shows in Russia and 7 abroad. He has shown his photographs in 300 exhibits across several countries, and has won more than 40 photography prizes, medals, and diplomas.
Yet Bergoltsev's reputation as one of Russia's pre-eminent photojournalists during the Soviet period is a well-kept secret in his adopted town of Spokane. After all, he had already retired by the time he emigrated to America in 1996. He made the move in order to join his daughter, who had married a man from Spokane. She first met the man when she and her father were being hosted for their initial visit to the states by Don and Lorna Hamilton of Hamilton Studio. Don Hamilton and Bergoltsev had met by chance more than 25 years ago while both were on shooting assignments in China.
"I remember being led into a suite of rooms at a hotel off Tiananmen Square, when it was quite hot, and finding Leo sitting in white tennis shorts with a white T-shirt, coolly smoking a cigarette," Hamilton chuckled. "Leo just looks at me, takes a drag and says slowly in his deep voice, 'We want to live in peace.' "
Bergoltsev's weighty and deserved retrospective at Hamilton Studio is made even more compelling by its curators: Kostelec and her husband, Bill Kostelec, who also is part of Cherry Street Studios. The couple, who are local experts on vintage film photography and darkroom processes, have brought their own artistry to bear on Bergoltsev's images.
"Ansel Adams once said, the negative is the score and the print is the performance," Hamilton said. "Bill Kostelec is a master printer who has achieved a masterful performance with Leo's negatives. The depth Bill has brought out, and what he has found inside these negatives, is beautiful."
One of Bergoltsev's printed photos is of a handful of birds hovering in flight. The picture hangs next to his photo of three Ukrainian folk dancers, also caught floating in midair. The side-by-side analogy is stunning.
"To capture these dancers at that exact moment, a photographer has to have a perfect focus and high enough shutter speed to freeze it when they are jumping like that," said Bill Kostelec. "It's nearly impossible."
"You can see the sharp, critical focus," Hamilton added. "He's twisting a lens. He's not just pushing a button on a digital camera that locks automatically."
"God knows I tried," said Bergoltsev suddenly in English. He was listening to the conversation about his work and speaking to this reporter through an interpreter. Even through a translator, Bergoltsev's humor and modesty come through.
"In this type of photography, you have to think fast because the content changes rapidly. You don't have the luxury of thinking," Bergoltsev said through his interpreter. "I am anticipating what will happen next, so I can react, get the shot, and take it to the office so they can publish it. It's not so difficult."
Among the 100 photos are ordinary people doing ordinary things. A contemporary and acquaintance of famed street photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, throughout his world travels, Bergoltsev photographed children, mothers, construction workers, pedestrians and bicyclists. But the framing, the context, and the artistry, make the pictures akin to visual poems.
There is one of a Russian police officer directing traffic in one direction while a citizen confronting the officer points in another direction. The political subtext of society disagreeing with the government meant the photo was rejected by Bergoltsev's superiors at the magazine.
Yet the image was published all over the world at the time. Bergoltsev gave it the philosophical title "The Origin of Truth."
Most important to Bergoltsev, was to take photos of real life. "I don't want to add my own ideas to the content," he said through an interpreter. "As soon as people see a camera, they think they should look nicer or express how good they are with fake smiles. But for me, I want to take actual life. History."

Texto completo: An unsubstantiated story told by former Vice President Joe Biden about getting arrested while trying to see Nelson Mandela inspired a wave of fact-checking, a pointed interview on Fox News about his inability to get the facts right, and a skit on Saturday Night Live.
Here’s what Biden said at a Feb. 11 rally in Columbia, S.C.:
“This day, 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid. I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robbens Island.” (It’s actually Robben Island.)
The New York Times recounted how Biden made similar statements two other times, but reporters could not find evidence to back up his claim that he was arrested. The Washington Post’s The Fact Checker then gave Biden Four Pinocchios. Snopes and Factcheck.org also fact-checked his statements.
In the language of PolitiFact, it was a Pants on Fire story. We contacted Biden’s campaign to ask about his initial claims that he was arrested, and the later accounts in which he said he was stopped, and did not get a reply.
Biden’s claims about being arrested
In February, Biden said that the incident in South Africa occurred in 1977, but Snopes found news reports that showed that it was December 1976 when 13 members of Congress traveled to Lesotho. (Lesotho is a small country within South Africa, so it would be possible to visit both countries.) The African-American Institute of New York sponsored the conference the politicians attended, UPI reported.
We searched articles by major newspapers for any accounts of Biden’s trip in 1977 and found no mention of any arrest. Over his career, Biden spoke out against apartheid in South Africa and criticized the South African government, but the accounts never stated he was arrested.
When Mandela died in 2013, Biden’s written statement recounted his visit to South Africa decades earlier. In that account, he made no mention of an arrest, but he did describe airport officials trying to separate him from his African American colleagues.
In Biden’s 2007 book “Promises to Keep,” he mentions traveling to South Africa in 1977 but makes no claim that he was arrested.
In his February telling, Biden said that he was arrested with our “U.N. ambassador.” Andrew Jackson Young Jr., a Georgia congressman, was on the trip in 1976, UPI reported. President Jimmy Carter appointed Young as ambassador to the United Nations in January 1977.
When we interviewed Young on March 4, he said neither one of them was arrested in South Africa.
“I wouldn’t say we were arrested,” he said.
Young, who said he visited South Africa multiple times in the 1970s, did recall traveling with Biden to South Africa. Young said that either South African police or the military would not allow the congressmen to get back to their plane at the airport and detained them briefly behind a chained fence before letting them through to their airplane. Young recalled U.S. Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York arguing with authorities.
Biden later changed his account and said he was stopped
By late February, Biden and his campaign had changed his story.
Following the South Carolina debate Feb. 25, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said Biden was “separated from his party at the airport.”
Days later, Biden himself walked back the arrest remark in an interview on CNN on Feb. 28 .
Biden said when he exited the plane with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, officials tried to separate him from the African American congressmen.
“When I said ‘arrested,’ I meant I was not able, I was not able to move, cops, Afrikaners would let me go with them, made me stay where I was,“ he said.”I guess I wasn’t arrested, I was stopped. I was not able to move where I wanted to go.”
One other part of Biden’s story doesn’t match up. He said that he was arrested on the streets of Soweto trying to see Mandela at Robben Island. Soweto is a neighborhood in Johannesburg. Robben Island is more than 700 miles away off the coast of Cape Town.
Our ruling
Biden said, “I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see (Nelson Mandela) on Robbens Island.”
This statement rates Pants on Fire.

Trump Campaign's Libel Claims Are Long Shots; The lawsuits against the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN open the president up to the potential of an under-oath deposition

Texto completo: A series of libel lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign against large media organizations are likely to run up against tough obstacles and depending on how far they progress, could subject the president to depositions, according to legal experts.
The Trump campaign's defamation claims against the New York Times on Feb. 26, the Post on Monday and CNN on Friday appear to be unprecedented, legal scholars said. Courts have heard defamation lawsuits from governors, an ex-president and a presidential candidate, but legal scholars said they couldn't recall the last time a sitting U.S. president or his campaign elevated grievances against the news media into civil legal action.
The Trump campaign's initial lawsuits concerned two Post opinion pieces published in June last year and one in the New York Times last March. Each contain passages implying Donald Trump sought or welcomed Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election or the 2020 race.
The Trump team's libel complaints continued Friday with a new lawsuit against CNN, alleging the campaign was defamed by a lengthy opinion article posted in June on CNN.com. The complaint focuses on a passage stating that the Trump campaign had "assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia's help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table."
The lawsuit called the passage "blatantly false." A representative for the network, a unit of WarnerMedia, declined to comment on Friday.
The lawsuits demand millions of dollars in damages. The suits were filed in federal court in Washington against the Post, in New York state court against the Times and in Atlanta federal court against CNN.
President Trump is entitled to the protections of libel law, but his campaign organization could have disadvantages as a plaintiff, say legal scholars.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Why do you think it is so rare for sitting presidents to sue the media, even though they often complain about coverage? Join the conversation below.
When it comes to defamation litigation, public figures like Mr. Trump must establish that not only was a statement false and defamatory, but also that it was published with "actual malice." That means showing evidence that the people who wrote and edited the statement knew it was false—or likely false but they didn't care to print the truth.
Each of the lawsuits emphasize that special counsel Robert Mueller's report on allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election found insufficient evidence that Mr. Trump and his campaign criminally conspired or coordinated with Russia. Suggestions to the contrary are damaging to the campaign's reputation and require expenditures to clear the record, the suits state.
Legal scholars said there is a crucial distinction between statements asserting facts and ones expressing opinions. Opinions are usually treated as protected speech, while an incorrect, defamatory fact isn't. Libel law tends to have gray areas and close judgment calls.
That is where the president's campaign—with its powerful platform—may be less likely to get the benefit of the doubt, said Rodney Smolla, a First Amendment scholar at Delaware Law School of Widener University.
He said a jury or judge would probably be "extremely skeptical of a suit brought by the president of the United States for libel given the powerful First Amendment principles that protect dissent."
The odds against the president are underscored by how few Americans in the last century have been accused and punished for libeling a president.
In 1969, a Connecticut judge convicted a 22-year-old student of criminal libel for publishing a cartoon depicting Richard Nixon as a phallic middle finger. An appellate court later overturned the guilty verdict.
More famously, Theodore Roosevelt directed his Justice Department to prosecute New York World publisher Joseph Pulitzer and other newspapermen for criminal libel over articles alleging the sale of the Panama Canal was tainted by corruption—indictments later quashed by the courts that held there was no crime of criminal libel in federal statute.
More recent past presidents looked at libel lawsuits as a political loser or beneath their dignity, says Prof. Eugene Volokh, a law professor and First Amendment scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
He said Mr. Trump may have spotted a chance to expose media bias and burnish his image as a politician who fights back. The president has long assailed the news media as "enemies of the people" and purveyors of biased "fake news."
But his lawsuits aren't without risk, said Mr. Volokh.
Mr. Trump and past presidents have avoided testifying as defendants in civil lawsuits by arguing that the proceedings would interfere with their public duties. It would be harder for Mr. Trump to dodge deposition when his campaign is the one doing the suing, said Mr. Volokh.
Should the lawsuits survive motions to dismiss, the Times and the Post would likely get an opportunity to examine and cross-examine Mr. Trump under oath about the articles in question and their assertions about his dealings with Russia, according to legal experts.
"It's hard to see how you could resist testifying about that," said Mr. Volokh.
The Trump campaign declined to comment. Both lawsuits accuse the Times and the Post of a "systematic pattern of bias against the campaign, designed to maliciously interfere with and damage its reputation and ultimately cause the organization to fail."
In a statement, Fred Ryan, publisher and chief executive of the Post, said the lawsuits were an affront to the principles of press freedom. He called the litigation "a shameful ploy designed to intimidate news organizations as they work to inform voters on the important issues at stake in this election."
A spokeswoman for the Times said the Trump campaign was using litigation to "try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable," referring to the column's author, former Times executive editor Max Frankel.

In praise of African Americans in the 2020 vote

Texto completo: The early days of the Democratic primaries looked like a race off the cliff as virtually all of the 2020 presidential candidates swung further and further left to satisfy the very vocal and liberal white base.
Since 2000, the subset of liberal white voters in the Democratic Party who describe themselves as "very liberal" has grown from 6% to 19%, according to Pew Research Center.
That brought Democratic candidates blowing their trumpets for the Green New Deal and Medicare for All with no thought to the impossible price tags. It brought the foolhardy exultations of Beto O'Rourke, who told Americans he's coming for their guns and that their "country was founded on white supremacy."
That last point is key, because today's white liberals see the country as deeply, irredeemably racist.
Their perspective has grown more intense in a short time, according to the research of Zach Goldberg, a Georgia State University doctoral student, who spoke to the New York Times.
Those liberals were experiencing white guilt enlarged by the right-wing populism of Donald Trump, he explained. The result is that white liberals want "to be the exact opposite of racist," he said. "They go adopt positions to prove they're different than the morally tainted collective."
In fact, some white liberals are so woke they're racist.
In 2018, researchers at Yale and Princeton reported that white liberals are talking down to minorities. "(They) may unwittingly draw on negative stereotypes, dumbing themselves down in a likely well-meaning, 'folksy,' but ultimately patronizing, attempt to connect with the outgroup," according to The Washington Post.
Conservative whites don't do that, the researchers noted. "If you're a white conservative, your diction won't depend on the presumed race of your interlocutor," The Post reports.
Democratic primary candidates were catering early to these very liberal white voters by serving up some very foolish promises. Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who represents the epicenter of far-left wackiness, warned, "What works in San Francisco does not necessarily work in Michigan."
The party establishment began to fear their 2020 candidates were about to hand four more years to Donald Trump.
It was time for an intervention.
That would come last Saturday when African American voters in South Carolina delivered a powerful statement and landslide victory to the most moderate Democratic candidate – Joe Biden.
You may not know it listening to some of the black commentators and columnists who embrace the world view of those very liberal whites, but they don't reflect the views of average African Americans, who make up one of the most moderate cohorts in the Democratic Party, according to Pew.
Those TV talking heads chant endlessly about "white privilege" and "white fragility," concepts created by white liberals to stoke the racial fires in this country.
The real African American Democrats, the rank and file, are the ballast, the levelheaded gravity that keeps the ship from capsizing. One reason for this may be this fact, reported in another Pew survey, that African Americans are among the most religious people in the country. They are more traditionalist in that way — more faith-based than whites and Latinos.
Surveyed widely on their views, black voters have been telling other Democrats that the point of this exercise known as the presidential primary is to defeat Donald Trump.
You're not going to do that by nominating crazy.
Their hammer blow came Saturday in South Carolina, when Joe Biden won that state's primary by 256,000 votes to Bernie Sander's 105,000. So decisive was the victory that Biden won all 46 counties in the state. He won more votes in South Carolina than Sanders had won collectively in Iowa, N. Hampshire and Nevada, CNN reported.
And leading the stampede were black voters, who favored Biden over Sanders by 61% to 17%, according to Washington Post exit polls.
Biden's 28-point victory over Sanders in South Carolina resurrected Biden's candidacy and set the table for his sweeping victories on Super Tuesday, with black voters across the South (Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina) following the lead of their sisters and brethren in South Carolina.
African American voters are a force to be reckoned with. They just put the fear of God in Bernie Sanders and all the Republican candidates for Congress and Senate who were beginning to believe that a socialist might lead the Democratic ballot in the fall.
Don't bet on it.

Texto completo: Under fire from President Donald Trump and Republican senators who accused him of threatening two conservative Supreme Court justices, Sen. Chuck Schumer said Thursday that he "should not have used the words" he did Wednesday in a fiery speech warning of the consequences of their rulings.
But Schumer, who chalked up his sharp tongue to his Brooklyn upbringing, refused to apologize for the spirit of his remarks, saying Republicans would pay a political price if the court struck down abortion rights.
"They didn't come out the way I intended," Schumer said of his remarks a day before that Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -- both installed by Trump -- would "pay the price" if a contentious Louisiana case the court was hearing ended up reducing access to abortion in the state and across the country.
"You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions," he warned Wednesday at a rally on the steps of the Supreme Court.
Schumer, D-N.Y. and the minority leader, said those remarks were not meant as a threat of bodily harm against the justices, but instead as a warning to Trump and the Republicans who supported his conservative nominees that they could suffer a political backlash for the decisions the justices made.
"And Republicans who are busy manufacturing outrage over these comments know that, too," Schumer added.
His clarification came after Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the majority leader, opened the Senate on Thursday with an extended denunciation of Schumer's speech.
McConnell said there was no other way to interpret Schumer's comments but as a threat, and argued his counterpart was leading a campaign by Democrats to undermine the independence of the federal courts.
"The Democratic leader traveled to the workplace of the two judges, and in front of a crowd of activists, he told those judges you will pay the price, right in front of the Supreme Court building," McConnell said.
"If any American had these words shouted at them from the sidewalk outside their office, they would hear those words as personal," McConnell said.
McConnell's scolding came the day after Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement in which he denounced Schumer's remarks as "inappropriate" and "dangerous."
Trump later joined the chorus of criticism, accusing Schumer on Twitter of making "a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court" and saying any Republican who made those remarks "would be arrested, or impeached."
McConnell, working hand in hand with the White House, has devoted substantial time and energy to installing scores of Trump-nominated judges over the past three years and portrays that as a main achievement of the Republican-led Senate.
Democratic officials said that while Schumer's remarks might have been inflammatory, they were not all that unhappy that the episode put new attention both on the Louisiana case at hand and the Republican push on the courts overall.

Texto completo: Stay home from work if you get sick. See a doctor. Use a separate bathroom from the people you live with. Prepare for schools to close and to work from home.
These are measures the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended to slow a coronavirus outbreak in the United States.
Yet, these are much easier to do for certain people -- in particular, high-earning professionals.
Service industry workers -- like those in restaurants, retail, child care and the gig economy -- are much less likely to have paid sick days, the ability to work remotely or employer-provided health insurance.
The disparity could make the new coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness known as COVID-19, harder to contain in the U.S. than in other rich countries that have universal benefits like health care and sick leave, experts say.
A large segment of workers are not able to stay home, and many of them work in jobs that include high contact with other people. It could also mean that low-income workers are hit harder by the virus.
"Very quickly, it's going to circulate a lot faster in the poorer communities than the wealthiest ones," said Dr. James Hadler, an epidemiologist who was Connecticut's public health director and now is a consultant to the state. His work has found that influenza infections tend to strike low-income neighborhoods more aggressively than affluent ones and that poor families are more likely to live in close quarters with others and share bathrooms.
Unequal access to precautionary measures cuts along the same lines that divide the U.S. in other ways: income, education and race.
"It's definitely an equity issue," said Alex Baptiste, policy counsel for workplace programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group. "You have not just an economic disparity but also a racial disparity between who has that access and can take care of themselves and their families."
The biggest disparity for workers is access to health care: In the U.S., some 27.5 million people lack any form of health insurance. That makes them less likely to seek medical care when they become ill or to have access to preventive health benefits that can help them stave off illness. The uninsured are disproportionately low income.
Workers also have unequal access to remote working. The government recommended that people work from home in a coronavirus outbreak, but just 29% of American workers can do so, according to Labor Department data. They are most likely to be highly educated and high earners.
On an average day, 35% of the highest earners and 8% of the lowest earners spend some time working from home. . Nearly half of workers with a graduate degree do some of their work from home, as do a third of those with a college degree. Just 12% of those who didn't attend college work from home.

Is Bloomberg buying silence?

Texto completo: Every year, hundreds of departing employees at Bloomberg LP are presented with a choice: Either leave the company empty-handed or accept a generous financial package and agree to never speak ill of the company. Many take the money.
The result is that some employees at Michael Bloomberg's company are barred from publicly describing misconduct and what they perceived as an entrenched culture of bullying, where women are often objectified and sometimes face discrimination, according to interviews with more than a dozen former employees, as well as lawsuits and internal corporate documents reviewed by The New York Times.
Bloomberg is not unique. In corporate America, in order to receive severance payments, fired or laid-off employees generally must sign agreements that require them to keep quiet about their experiences. Such agreements are deployed for a range of reasons, including to protect intellectual property, to prevent departing employees from publicly vilifying the company and to confidentially settle claims of discrimination or harassment.
But unlike every other company in the United States, Bloomberg's owner and founder was -- until very recently -- running for president.
Before he suspended his campaign Wednesday, the heavy use of nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements at Bloomberg's company went from being a standard business practice to being a political vulnerability.
Bloomberg's Democratic rivals accused him of using his multibillion-dollar fortune to silence victims of abuse and discrimination. In response to the criticism, Bloomberg released three women from nondisclosure agreements who he said had complained about comments he made. And he said that as long as he was running the company, it would stop using nondisclosure agreements with employees who have sexual harassment or misconduct claims.
But that change only affects a small fraction of the nondisclosure agreements that are put in place on a regular basis at Bloomberg. Most people who sign do not have specific claims of mistreatment; instead, the contracts are designed to prevent disgruntled ex-employees from bad-mouthing their former employer.
Natalie Harland, a Bloomberg spokeswoman, defended the company's culture and practices.
"Bullying and discrimination are not tolerated," she said, noting that Bloomberg consistently ranks at the top of employee satisfaction surveys and provides six months of paid parental leave.
Bloomberg's company makes the bulk of its money selling a proprietary financial data system to Wall Street firms and other major companies. Every new hire has to sign a confidentiality agreement that requires that they not share trade secrets.
Employees who are fired or resign in frustration are often pushed to sign contracts that prohibit them from in any way disparaging the company, several of the former employees said in interviews. Those pacts bar the employees from even acknowledging the existence of the agreements, according to contracts reviewed by The Times.
Bloomberg's contracts are in line with those used by other major companies, independent employment lawyers say. In some circumstances, The Times also requires employees to sign nondisclosure agreements in order to receive severance packages.

Texto completo: If you are looking for a bellwether county for Iowa, Johnson County isn't it. In fact, it's a county that prides itself on pushing against the status quo of the rest of the state.
Johnson County increased its local minimum wage. And then the Iowa Legislature took that power away. Iowa City was managing residential density with a percentage cap on rental permits. And then the Iowa Legislature took that power away. While other Iowa counties bemoaned the 2018 expansion of mental health services required by county government, Johnson County pushed the state to to let it spend more money on mental health care.
It should come as no surprise that when Iowa Democrats zigged for former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Iowa caucuses, Johnson County zagged for U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. But despite the county's support, Warren told staff she was dropping out of the race Thursday morning.
"I know that when we set out, this was not the call you ever wanted to hear," Warren said in a call quoted in the New York Times. "It is not the call I ever wanted to make."
On Super Tuesday, a smattering of precincts in her home state supported Warren, and one lonely precinct in Northfield, Maine put her ahead. Still, Johnson County remains the only county in the country where Warren got the most votes. And while it's important to note that delegates decide the caucus — not county vote totals — it was a difficult day for her supporters.
"I'm nothing short of heartbroken," said Mallory Hellman of Iowa City. "That can't be understated."
Hellman was an early adopter. In 2015, she said she was among a small contingency handing out "Run Warren Run!" cards. When Warren announced her 2020 candidacy in April 2019, Hellman got to work knocking doors and making phone calls. She even drove to Minneapolis to knock doors leading up to Super Tuesday.
"We had an incredible ground team here in Johnson County," Hellman said. "The group itself was diverse and committed. ... It was a warm and inclusive campaign."
Hellman was in San Antonio on Thursday morning when she heard Warren's announcement. She said the news had her sobbing at breakfast. But a few hours later Hellman was resilient; already talking about who would be her new candidate. While she wasn't a huge fan of the "Bernie Bro" contingency, she said she would be doing whatever she could to get Sanders elected.
"Senator Warren won't stop the fight," Hellman said. "She wants us to do the same."
Alyssa Jakowchuk said she remembered the exuberance of the Johnson County precinct captains meeting at Big Grove Brewery sharing ciders and realizing they pulled ahead in Johnson.
"It was a really intense number game, but I just remember everyone being so excited," Jakowchuk said. "I just remember how good it felt."
She said she was still processing the news. When she talked with the Press-Citizen she was heading out to meet another volunteer and to share a meal and commiserate.
"(Warren) is not going anywhere. She is still going to be fighting for things," Jakowchuk said. "She will be on the right side of history for a lot of things."
On caucus night, Brianna Wills decked in the Warren teal. While she hasn't adopted funeral black, she said Warren's loss and the emergent choice between two septuagenarian white men was devastating.
"We had black candidates and female candidates and we ended up with the two oldest white guys, both of whom lost in previous national elections," Wills said. "Don't talk to me about electability."
In each interview, Warren supporters when explaining the poor performance blame the conversation about electability: voters thinking a woman — namely a progressive woman — would not be electable. The argument is built on the misogynist notion that America wouldn't vote for a woman.
"But America did vote for a woman," Wills said. "Hillary Clinton won the popular vote," Wills said.
While unhappy about the outcome, Wills said she was proud of the boots Team Warren put on the ground.
"I think Johnson County liked to see a candidate embodying progressive policies, progressive in terms of inclusionary. Look at the work the (Iowa) City Council has done. I think people in Johnson County really took her message to heart," Wills said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Republicans are wielding the power of their Senate majority to intensify an election-year investigation of Hunter Biden's work for a Ukrainian energy firm, putting new scrutiny on the son of Joe Biden as the former vice president reemerges as President Donald Trump's chief rival for the presidency.
In elevating questions about the younger Biden's work in Ukraine, Senate Republicans are effectively picking up where Trump left off last year when he pressed the country's leaders to investigate the Bidens, an effort that led to his impeachment on charges he abused his power by seeking foreign help in the 2020 election. It is part of a broader attempt by his allies on Capitol Hill to breathe fresh life into politically charged inquiries into issues that have preoccupied Trump.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, plans to hold a vote next week despite Democratic objections to issue a rare Senate subpoena to Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian official who worked for Burisma, the energy firm. Johnson said Wednesday that he would release an interim report this spring summarizing what Republicans had learned from months of queries.
For now, Republicans insist Burisma is a matter of interest unrelated to Biden's presidential candidacy, and no evidence has emerged to suggest that either Biden acted improperly.
Some Republicans have privately voiced discomfort about the effort.
On Thursday, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a member of the Homeland Security Committee, told reporters there was "no question" that "looking into Burisma and Hunter appears political."
"People are tired of these kind of political investigations, and would hope that if there is something of significance that needs to be evaluated, it would be done by perhaps the FBI and some other agency that is not as political as a committee of our body," he said.
Those leading the inquiries insist their focus on Burisma is not politically driven, noting that it dates to 2017, before it was clear that Biden would be a presidential candidate.
"We are proceeding with the investigation whether Biden is in or out," said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Under fire from President Donald Trump and Republican senators who accused him of threatening two conservative Supreme Court justices, Sen. Chuck Schumer said Thursday that he "should not have used the words" he did Wednesday in a fiery speech warning of the consequences of their rulings.
But Schumer, who chalked up his sharp tongue to his Brooklyn upbringing, refused to apologize for the spirit of his remarks, saying Republicans would pay a political price if the court struck down abortion rights.
"They didn't come out the way I intended," Schumer said of his remarks a day before that Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh - both installed by Trump - would "pay the price" if a contentious Louisiana case the court was hearing ended up reducing access to abortion in the state and across the country.
"You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions," he warned Wednesday at a rally on the steps of the Supreme Court.

"And Republicans who are busy manufacturing outrage over these comments know that, too," Schumer added.
His clarification came after Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the majority leader, opened the Senate on Thursday with an extended denunciation of Schumer's speech.
McConnell said there was no other way to interpret Schumer's comments but as a threat, and argued his counterpart was leading a campaign by Democrats to undermine the independence of the federal courts.
"The Democratic leader traveled to the workplace of the two judges, and in front of a crowd of activists, he told those judges you will pay the price, right in front of the Supreme Court building," McConnell said.
"If any American had these words shouted at them from the sidewalk outside their office, they would hear those words as personal," McConnell said.
McConnell's scolding came the day after Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement in which he denounced Schumer's remarks as "inappropriate" and "dangerous."
Trump later joined the chorus of criticism, accusing Schumer on Twitter of making "a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court" and saying any Republican who made those remarks "would be arrested, or impeached."
The exchange illustrated the importance both parties are placing on the Supreme Court as the November election approaches, underscoring the stakes in both the battle for the White House and for control of the Senate. It was all the more striking because Trump has aggressively attacked the federal judiciary in public comments and on Twitter, drawing howls of protest from Democrats but little criticism from Republicans.
On Thursday, though, Republicans were indignant. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri dismissed what he called Schumer's "nonapology," and said the Democrat should be censured in a formal Senate vote of rebuke.
McConnell, working hand in hand with the White House, has devoted substantial time and energy to installing scores of Trump-nominated judges over the past three years and portrays that as a main achievement of the Republican-led Senate.
Democratic officials said that while Schumer's remarks might have been inflammatory, they were not all that unhappy that the episode put new attention both on the Louisiana case at hand and the Republican push on the courts overall.
"To the women of America, what we are talking about here, what I am fighting for here is your right to choose - an issue, of course, Leader McConnell completely ignored in his speech," Schumer said.
Schumer said the courts would most likely curtail abortion rights "because Senate Republicans have confirmed nominees they believe will strip away women's rights and fundamentally change this country, going so far as to deny a duly-elected president the right to pick a Supreme Court justice."
That comment was a reference to McConnell's decision in 2016 to refuse to act on President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, instead keeping the Supreme Court seat open until Trump won the election and took office. The blockade continues to infuriate Democrats.

Texto completo: Hank Azaria recently said goodbye to one of television's most beloved but also controversial animated characters. And he's finally explaining why.
Azaria, who is perhaps best known for bringing to life Apu in the long-running sitcom "The Simpsons," told The New York Times in a recent interview that he made his decision after many years of reflecting, processing and listening to the voices of people who explained why Apu was hurtful.
"Once I realized that that was the way this character was thought of, I just didn't want to participate in it anymore," Azaria said. "It just didn't feel right."
For three decades, the actor has voiced dozens of inhabitants of the fictional town of Springfield. But Apu is perhaps the most problematic, especially through a modern lens: He is an immigrant from India who owns the local Kwik-E-Mart convenience store and is known for his catchphrase, "Thank you! Come again!" His thick Indian accent and singsong voice depict him as simple-minded, and even his last name, Nahasapeemapetilon, has been thought to welcome ridicule.
Through the years, "The Simpsons" actor and the show faced increasing criticism from people who find the character an offensive, racial stereotype. Many of the critics are of Indian descent.
The show's executive producers told The New York Times in a statement that they "respect Hank's journey in regard to Apu. We have granted his wish to no longer voice the character."
But the fate of Apu remains unknown.
"Apu is beloved worldwide. We love him too. Stay tuned," the statement added.
Azaria first announced he was retiring the convenience store proprietor in January on the website /Film.
During an appearance on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" in 2018, Azaria addressed the mounting controversy and added that he was "perfectly willing and happy to step aside and transition (Apu) into something new ... it just feels like the right thing to do to me."
Azaria was initially unwilling to hear the arguments about why Apu's character was divisive, he told The New York Times. But he started listening and now believes his experience can spark more dialogue about representation in popular culture.
"What happened with this character is a window into an important issue," said Azaria. "It's a good way to start the conversation. I can be accountable and try to make up for it as best I can."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Under fire from President Donald Trump and Republican senators who accused him of threatening two conservative Supreme Court justices, Sen. Chuck Schumer said Thursday that he "should not have used the words" he did Wednesday in a fiery speech warning of the consequences of their rulings.
But Schumer, who chalked up his sharp tongue to his Brooklyn upbringing, refused to apologize for the spirit of his remarks, saying Republicans would pay a political price if the court struck down abortion rights.
"They didn't come out the way I intended," Schumer said of his remarks a day before that Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh - both installed by Trump - would "pay the price" if a contentious Louisiana case the court was hearing ended up reducing access to abortion in the state and across the country.
"You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions," he warned Wednesday at a rally on the steps of the Supreme Court.
Schumer, D-N.Y. and the minority leader, said those remarks were not meant as a threat of bodily harm against the justices, but instead as a warning to Trump and the Republicans who supported his conservative nominees that they could suffer a political backlash for the decisions the justices made.
"And Republicans who are busy manufacturing outrage over these comments know that, too," Schumer added.
His clarification came after Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the majority leader, opened the Senate on Thursday with an extended denunciation of Schumer's speech.
McConnell said there was no other way to interpret Schumer's comments but as a threat, and argued his counterpart was leading a campaign by Democrats to undermine the independence of the federal courts.

Demings may be in mix for Biden running mate

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Val Demings, of Orlando, has endorsed Joe Biden for president. Could Biden pick her as his running mate?
Florida, despite its electoral importance, has never produced a running mate for a major party presidential ticket.
But with razor-thin margins in seemingly every major statewide election, the temptation to swing the state with a homegrown favorite could prove hard to resist.
Demings, a former Orlando police chief, had been touted as a potential vice-presidential pick for Biden even before her profile-enhancing turn as a House impeachment manager in President Trump's Senate trial.
A New York Times story on Monday reported that Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was "focused on the idea of nominating an African-American woman for vice president, mulling names like Senator Kamala Harris, of California, Stacey Abrams, of Georgia, and Representative Val Demings, of Florida."
On Thursday, Demings said in an interview with CNN that she was "humbled" that her name has been raised.
And she did not rule out the possibility if Biden were to ask.
Aubrey Jewett, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida, said Demings "is a viable option" for Biden, who leads the Democratic primary race over U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders as California continues to count its votes.
"On the one hand, she doesn't have much political experience as some vice-presidential [possibilities]," Jewett said.
Harris, for one, has served as a U.S. senator and California attorney general before launching a run for president.
Abrams served as Democratic minority leader of the Georgia state House.
"But [Demings] has an excellent track record of accomplishments throughout her career," Jewett said. "She's a pathbreaker."
Demings, who turns 63 on March 12, has three decades of experience with the Orlando Police Department and served as its first female chief.
Since her election to Congress in 2016, Demings has served on the key Judiciary and Intelligence committees in addition to her selection as one of seven impeachment managers.
"Many times, vice presidents bring balance to a ticket," Jewett said. "Sometimes its racial or ethnic balance, sometimes its gender balance, sometimes it's ideological."
President Donald Trump, for example, selected Vice President Mike Pence to shore up his conservative bona fides. Biden brought decades of Washington experience to the more youthful Barack Obama's ticket, as did Dick Cheney for George W. Bush.
Yet, since Lyndon Johnson was credited with winning Texas for John F. Kennedy in 1960, running mates haven't helped that much. Either they were from states the candidate would have won anyway, like Biden's Delaware or Cheney's Wyoming, or they failed to win their swing states, like Texan Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 or North Carolina's John Edwards in 2004.
However, Florida U.S. Sen. Bob Graham was considered as a potential running mate for both Bill Clinton in 1992 and Al Gore in 2000 as a way of winning the state's electoral votes.
"If I were directing the Al Gore campaign, number one on my list would be Bob Graham," Washington pollster Bob Schroth said at the time.
"He would be a brilliant choice."
But Gore chose Joe Lieberman, of Connecticut, and Gore infamously lost Florida - and the election - by 537 votes.
Gov. Charlie Crist was mentioned as a potential vice president for Republican John McCain in 2008, Jewett said, "believe it or not."
Crist later left the party, ran for governor as a Democrat in 2014 and now serves in Congress as a Democrat.
This year, in addition to Demings, former Tallahassee mayor and gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum had been talked about as a potential running mate for Sanders, who campaigned for Gillum in Central Florida in 2018.
But on Thursday, Gillum told CNN's David Axelrod that Sanders' praise of Fidel Castro would spur a Biden "runaway" in the March 17 primary. "Those comments will live [on] for a lot of people."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Republicans are wielding the power of their Senate majority to intensify an election-year investigation of Hunter Biden's work for a Ukrainian energy firm, putting new scrutiny on the son of Joe Biden as the former vice president reemerges as President Donald Trump's chief rival for the presidency.
In elevating questions about the younger Biden's work in Ukraine, Senate Republicans are effectively picking up where Trump left off last year when he pressed the country's leaders to investigate the Bidens, an effort that led to his impeachment on charges he abused his power by seeking foreign help in the 2020 election. It is part of a broader attempt by his allies on Capitol Hill to breathe fresh life into politically charged inquiries into issues that have preoccupied Trump.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, plans to hold a vote next week despite Democratic objections to issue a rare Senate subpoena to Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian official who worked for Burisma, the energy firm. Johnson said Wednesday that he would release an interim report this spring summarizing what Republicans had learned from months of queries.
For now, Republicans insist Burisma is a matter of interest unrelated to Biden's presidential candidacy, and no evidence has emerged to suggest that either Biden acted improperly.
Some Republicans have privately voiced discomfort about the effort.
On Thursday, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a member of the Homeland Security Committee, told reporters there was "no question" that "looking into Burisma and Hunter appears political."
"People are tired of these kind of political investigations, and would hope that if there is something of significance that needs to be evaluated, it would be done by perhaps the FBI and some other agency that is not as political as a committee of our body," he said.
Those leading the inquiries insist their focus on Burisma is not politically driven, noting that it dates to 2017, before it was clear that Biden would be a presidential candidate.
"We are proceeding with the investigation whether Biden is in or out," said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Republicans are wielding the power of their Senate majority to intensify an election-year investigation of Hunter Biden's work for a Ukrainian energy firm, putting new scrutiny on the son of Joe Biden as the former vice president reemerges as President Donald Trump's chief rival for the presidency.
In elevating questions about the younger Biden's work in Ukraine, Senate Republicans are effectively picking up where Trump left off last year when he pressed the country's leaders to investigate the Bidens, an effort that led to his impeachment on charges he abused his power by seeking foreign help in the 2020 election. It is part of a broader attempt by his allies on Capitol Hill to breathe fresh life into politically charged inquiries into issues that have preoccupied Trump.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, plans to hold a vote next week despite Democratic objections to issue a rare Senate subpoena to Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian official who worked for Burisma, the energy firm. Johnson said Wednesday that he would release an interim report this spring summarizing what Republicans had learned from months of queries.
For now, Republicans insist Burisma is a matter of interest unrelated to Biden's presidential candidacy, and no evidence has emerged to suggest that either Biden acted improperly.
Some Republicans have privately voiced discomfort about the effort.
On Thursday, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a member of the Homeland Security Committee, told reporters there was "no question" that "looking into Burisma and Hunter appears political."
"People are tired of these kind of political investigations, and would hope that if there is something of significance that needs to be evaluated, it would be done by perhaps the FBI and some other agency that is not as political as a committee of our body," he said.
Those leading the inquiries insist their focus on Burisma is not politically driven, noting that it dates to 2017, before it was clear that Biden would be a presidential candidate.
"We are proceeding with the investigation whether Biden is in or out," said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.

Texto completo: Stay home from work if you get sick. See a doctor. Use a separate bathroom from the people you live with. Prepare for schools to close and to work from home.
These are measures the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended to slow a coronavirus outbreak in the United States.
Yet, these are much easier to do for certain people - in particular, high-earning professionals.
Service industry workers - like those in restaurants, retail, child care and the gig economy - are much less likely to have paid sick days, the ability to work remotely or employer-provided health insurance.
The disparity could make the new coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness known as COVID-19, harder to contain in the U.S. than in other rich countries that have universal benefits like health care and sick leave, experts say.
A large segment of workers are not able to stay home, and many of them work in jobs that include high contact with other people. It could also mean that low-income workers are hit harder by the virus.
"Very quickly, it's going to circulate a lot faster in the poorer communities than the wealthiest ones," said Dr. James Hadler, an epidemiologist who was Connecticut's public health director and now is a consultant to the state. His work has found that influenza infections tend to strike low-income neighborhoods more aggressively than affluent ones and that poor families are more likely to live in close quarters with others and share bathrooms.
Unequal access to precautionary measures cuts along the same lines that divide the U.S. in other ways: income, education and race.
"It's definitely an equity issue," said Alex Baptiste, policy counsel for workplace programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group. "You have not just an economic disparity but also a racial disparity between who has that access and can take care of themselves and their families."
Portia Green, 33, is a restaurant worker in New York. She has no paid sick leave or health insurance. If schools closed, as a single mother she'd have no child care.
A day off work means losing around $100 in pay, she said, and if she had to take more than a few days off, losing her job. The restaurants she has worked for are too understaffed to call in backup workers easily, she said, and the expectation is that you show up unless you're "green."
"They're going to push you to do it anyway," said Green, who is a member of Restaurant Opportunities Centers United in New York, an advocacy group. "You go to work, pop a vitamin C and if you can do it, you do it."
The biggest disparity for workers is access to health care: In the U.S., some 27.5 million people lack any form of health insurance. That makes them less likely to seek medical care when they become ill or to have access to preventive health benefits that can help them stave off illness. The uninsured are disproportionately low income.
Workers also have unequal access to remote working. The government recommended that people work from home in a coronavirus outbreak, but just 29% of American workers can do so, according to Labor Department data. They are most likely to be highly educated and high earners.
On an average day, 35% of the highest earners and 8% of the lowest earners spend some time working from home. Managers and professionals are most likely to do so, and service industry and construction workers least likely. Nearly half of workers with a graduate degree do some of their work from home, as do a third of those with a college degree. Just 12% of those who didn't attend college work from home.

Is Bloomberg buying silence? Some employees barred from publicly describing misconduct and bullying

Texto completo: Every year, hundreds of departing employees at Bloomberg LP are presented with a choice: Either leave the company empty-handed or accept a generous financial package and agree to never speak ill of the company. Many take the money.
The result is that some employees at Michael Bloomberg's company are barred from publicly describing misconduct and what they perceived as an entrenched culture of bullying, where women are often objectified and sometimes face discrimination, according to interviews with more than a dozen former employees, as well as lawsuits and internal corporate documents reviewed by The New York Times.
Bloomberg is not unique. In corporate America, in order to receive severance payments, fired or laid-off employees generally must sign agreements that require them to keep quiet about their experiences. Such agreements are deployed for a range of reasons, including to protect intellectual property, to prevent departing employees from publicly vilifying the company and to confidentially settle claims of discrimination or harassment.
But unlike every other company in the United States, Bloomberg's owner and founder was - until very recently - running for president.
Before he suspended his campaign Wednesday, the heavy use of nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements at Bloomberg's company went from being a standard business practice to being a political vulnerability.
Bloomberg's Democratic rivals accused him of using his multibillion-dollar fortune to silence victims of abuse and discrimination. In response to the criticism, Bloomberg released three women from nondisclosure agreements who he said had complained about comments he made. And he said that as long as he was running the company, it would stop using nondisclosure agreements with employees who have sexual harassment or misconduct claims.
But that change only affects a small fraction of the nondisclosure agreements that are put in place on a regular basis at Bloomberg. Most people who sign do not have specific claims of mistreatment; instead, the contracts are designed to prevent disgruntled ex-employees from bad-mouthing their former employer.
Natalie Harland, a Bloomberg spokeswoman, defended the company's culture and practices.
"Bullying and discrimination are not tolerated," she said, noting that Bloomberg consistently ranks at the top of employee satisfaction surveys and provides six months of paid parental leave.
Bloomberg's company makes the bulk of its money selling a proprietary financial data system to Wall Street firms and other major companies. Every new hire has to sign a confidentiality agreement that requires that they not share trade secrets.
Employees who are fired or resign in frustration are often pushed to sign contracts that prohibit them from in any way disparaging the company, several of the former employees said in interviews. Those pacts bar the employees from even acknowledging the existence of the agreements, according to contracts reviewed by The Times.
Bloomberg's contracts are in line with those used by other major companies, independent employment lawyers say. In some circumstances, The Times also requires employees to sign nondisclosure agreements in order to receive severance packages.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Under fire from President Donald Trump and Republican senators who accused him of threatening two conservative Supreme Court justices, Sen. Chuck Schumer said Thursday that he "should not have used the words" he did Wednesday in a fiery speech warning of the consequences of their rulings.
But Schumer, who chalked up his sharp tongue to his Brooklyn upbringing, refused to apologize for the spirit of his remarks, saying Republicans would pay a political price if the court struck down abortion rights.
"They didn't come out the way I intended," Schumer said of his remarks a day before that Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh - both installed by Trump - would "pay the price" if a contentious Louisiana case the court was hearing ended up reducing access to abortion in the state and across the country.
"You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions," he warned Wednesday at a rally on the steps of the Supreme Court.
Schumer, D-N.Y. and the minority leader, said those remarks were not meant as a threat of bodily harm against the justices, but instead as a warning to Trump and the Republicans who supported his conservative nominees that they could suffer a political backlash for the decisions the justices made.
"And Republicans who are busy manufacturing outrage over these comments know that, too," Schumer added.
His clarification came after Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the majority leader, opened the Senate on Thursday with an extended denunciation of Schumer's speech.
McConnell said there was no other way to interpret Schumer's comments but as a threat, and argued his counterpart was leading a campaign by Democrats to undermine the independence of the federal courts.
"The Democratic leader traveled to the workplace of the two judges, and in front of a crowd of activists, he told those judges you will pay the price, right in front of the Supreme Court building," McConnell said.
"If any American had these words shouted at them from the sidewalk outside their office, they would hear those words as personal," McConnell said.
McConnell's scolding came the day after Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement in which he denounced Schumer's remarks as "inappropriate" and "dangerous."
Trump later joined the chorus of criticism, accusing Schumer on Twitter of making "a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court" and saying any Republican who made those remarks "would be arrested, or impeached."
McConnell, working hand in hand with the White House, has devoted substantial time and energy to installing scores of Trump-nominated judges over the past three years and portrays that as a main achievement of the Republican-led Senate.
Democratic officials said that while Schumer's remarks might have been inflammatory, they were not all that unhappy that the episode put new attention both on the Louisiana case at hand and the Republican push on the courts overall.

Texto completo: Every year, hundreds of departing employees at Bloomberg LP are presented with a choice: Either leave the company empty-handed or accept a generous financial package and agree to never speak ill of the company. Many take the money.
The result is that some employees at Michael Bloomberg's company are barred from publicly describing misconduct and what they perceived as an entrenched culture of bullying, where women are often objectified and sometimes face discrimination, according to interviews with more than a dozen former employees, as well as lawsuits and internal corporate documents reviewed by The New York Times.
Bloomberg is not unique. In corporate America, in order to receive severance payments, fired or laid-off employees generally must sign agreements that require them to keep quiet about their experiences. Such agreements are deployed for a range of reasons, including to protect intellectual property, to prevent departing employees from publicly vilifying the company and to confidentially settle claims of discrimination or harassment.
But unlike every other company in the United States, Bloomberg's owner and founder was - until very recently - running for president.
Before he suspended his campaign Wednesday, the heavy use of nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements at Bloomberg's company went from being a standard business practice to being a political vulnerability.
Bloomberg's Democratic rivals accused him of using his multibillion-dollar fortune to silence victims of abuse and discrimination. In response to the criticism, Bloomberg released three women from nondisclosure agreements who he said had complained about comments he made. And he said that as long as he was running the company, it would stop using nondisclosure agreements with employees who have sexual harassment or misconduct claims.
But that change only affects a small fraction of the nondisclosure agreements that are put in place on a regular basis at Bloomberg. Most people who sign do not have specific claims of mistreatment; instead, the contracts are designed to prevent disgruntled ex-employees from bad-mouthing their former employer.
Natalie Harland, a Bloomberg spokeswoman, defended the company's culture and practices.
"Bullying and discrimination are not tolerated," she said, noting that Bloomberg consistently ranks at the top of employee satisfaction surveys and provides six months of paid parental leave.
Bloomberg's company makes the bulk of its money selling a proprietary financial data system to Wall Street firms and other major companies. Every new hire has to sign a confidentiality agreement that requires that they not share trade secrets.
Employees who are fired or resign in frustration are often pushed to sign contracts that prohibit them from in any way disparaging the company, several of the former employees said in interviews. Those pacts bar the employees from even acknowledging the existence of the agreements, according to contracts reviewed by The Times.
Bloomberg's contracts are in line with those used by other major companies, independent employment lawyers say. In some circumstances, The Times also requires employees to sign nondisclosure agreements in order to receive severance packages.

All-white kitchen rebellion Happy, comfortable colors are finding favor among more homeowners

Texto completo: Remember your grandmother's avocado-green kitchen? It could soon be yours. Or maybe it'll be pink, mauve, emerald green or buttercup. Anything but white, because the revolt against the white kitchen has begun.
Last November, the cover of Elle Decor featured a Steven Gambrel-designed kitchen awash in a shiny turquoise - even the ceiling gleamed like an iridescent underwater wonderland. On Pinterest between November 2018 and November 2019, searches for dark green cabinets jumped 367%, plum kitchens went up 107% and pink kitchen walls spiked 121%.
For decades now, cabinets have been relegated to white, brown or maybe black, and it's been even longer since appliances were allowed to be anything but stainless steel. But the Instagram kitchen - invariably a clean backdrop of basic Shaker cabinets, simple subway backsplashes and marble countertops - finally has some competition.
Jenny Dina Kirschner, an interior designer in New York, recently painted the cabinets pink for a client in Long Island, giving the room a decidedly '80s vibe somewhere between mauve and millennial pink. The color picked up the pinkish tones in the Calacatta Vagli marble countertop.
"We're starting to see more daring use of color," Kirschner said. "It's a rebellion against the white kitchen."
Breaking the mold is risky when 43% of homeowners choose white cabinets and a third choose white countertops, according to a 2019 Houzz report. Try something bolder than wood cabinets or black soapstone countertops and you might fail. Unlike an unfortunate coat of paint on the living room walls, the wrong choice of cabinetry could cost a homeowner tens of thousands of dollars. And money aside, it's not easy to rip out that chartreuse backsplash if you later regret it.
Yet cracks in the color-free facade are emerging. Between 2018 and 2019, BHG.com consumer insights found a 115% spike in interest in cabinet paint trends and a 10% increase in interest in colorful kitchen cabinetry. And from March 2018 to March 2019, interest in blue and green for paint and home decor rose 50%. Navy cabinets have become increasingly popular along with two-toned ones, with choices like blue for the lower ones and blond wood for the uppers. Greens of all shades have been nudging their way onto the stage, too, appearing as emerald cabinetry, avocado backsplashes and sage pendants.
In a throwback to the 1970s, the age of wacky colored appliances is also back. Want a retro fridge? Big Chill carries them in colors like beach blue, cherry red and pink lemonade. The appliance company BlueStar offers hundreds of color options, as well as custom colors for its products, letting customers personalize down to the color of the doors, trim and dials. Have a specific shade of purple in mind for your oven? Dacor can match a swatch you provide to the color of its appliances.
"Anything goes these days," said Gideon Mendelson, an interior designer in Manhattan. He is currently designing a yellow kitchen for a couple on the North Fork of Long Island, which he described as "a sophisticated buttercup. It's not going to be sweet and cutesy. It's not quite mustard. It's happier than that."
Who doesn't want a happy kitchen? With the world so dreary, a little yellow can go a long way. In these uncertain times, we're drawn to colors that don't need to be impeccable, that can hide the messiness of life. "There's a sense of energy and nourishment in bright colors," said Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of "Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness."
Alessandra Wood, vice president of style for Modsy, an online interior-design service, said that homeowners are looking for comfort and coziness in design choices, so why not our kitchens, too?
"In this really unstable world, we are looking for anything that makes us feel comfortable, and we are definitely turning to our homes to do that," she said.
Just look at the color Pantone chose for its color of the year: classic blue, because it "highlights our desire for a dependable and stable foundation." Paint companies Sherwin-Williams and PPG also ushered in the new decade with blue as their picks of the year in a collective nod to what might soon be our new neutral - call it bluetral.
We're also living in our homes differently. After decades of relentless moving, Americans are moving at the lowest rates since the U.S. census began tracking our mobility, with fewer than 10% of Americans moving between 2018 and 2019. Baby boomers are aging in place and millennials, facing rising housing costs and stagnating wages, are less likely to house hop. With no plans to stake a "for sale" sign in the front yard, why commit to the safe and listless colors of a staged house?
Greige, that dreary hue that is neither gray nor beige, but took over our homes for over a decade, is decidedly out. The relentlessly white kitchen may be next. It made a lot of sense in the era of house flipping. White looks clean and is unlikely to offend a potential buyer. Who hates white? And if your home is perpetually one renovation away from its next open house, white is a natural go-to color. It's a kitchen designed for future buyers, not the specific tastes of the current inhabitants.
But let's face it: White looks clean only when it is clean. The rest of the time, it is not the most practical color for a room that regularly gets splashed with marinara sauce. There is something to be said for a little color to hide the imperfections.
"We're living in our spaces longer, so there's an extra level of consideration that people are giving to them," Wood said. "We're thinking, 'How do I make this space into a space that I really feel comfortable in?' "
So if there is no buyer on the horizon, if the kitchen remodel is just for you, the view widens. Why not wash the whole room in turquoise? It doesn't really matter what some fictional buyer might think. You can be you and paint the cabinets pink.
Caption: The days of the all-white kitchen and plain stainless-steel appliances may be numbered.

Why Hank Azaria retired Apu on 'The Simpsons'

Texto completo: Hank Azaria recently said goodbye to one of television's most beloved but also controversial animated characters. And he's finally explaining why.
Azaria, who is perhaps best known for bringing to life Apu in the long-running sitcom "The Simpsons," told The New York Times in a recent interview that he made his decision after many years of reflecting, processing and listening to the voices of people who explained why Apu was hurtful.
"Once I realized that that was the way this character was thought of, I just didn't want to participate in it anymore," Azaria said. "It just didn't feel right."
For three decades, the actor has voiced dozens of inhabitants of the fictional town of Springfield. But Apu is perhaps the most problematic, especially through a modern lens: He is an immigrant from India who owns the local Kwik-E-Mart convenience store and is known for his catchphrase, "Thank you! Come again!" His thick Indian accent and singsong voice depict him as simple-minded, and even his last name, Nahasapeemapetilon, has been thought to welcome ridicule.
Through the years, "The Simpsons" actor and the show faced increasing criticism from people who find the character an offensive, racial stereotype. Many of the critics are of Indian descent.
The show's executive producers told The New York Times in a statement that they "respect Hank's journey in regard to Apu. We have granted his wish to no longer voice the character."
But the fate of Apu remains unknown.
"Apu is beloved worldwide. We love him too. Stay tuned," the statement added.
Azaria first announced he was retiring the convenience store proprietor in January on the website /Film.
During an appearance on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" in 2018, Azaria addressed the mounting controversy and added that he was "perfectly willing and happy to step aside and transition (Apu) into something new ... it just feels like the right thing to do to me."
Azaria was initially unwilling to hear the arguments about why Apu's character was divisive, he told The New York Times. But he started listening and now believes his experience can spark more dialogue about representation in popular culture.
"What happened with this character is a window into an important issue," said Azaria. "It's a good way to start the conversation. I can be accountable and try to make up for it as best I can."

Lamont asks CDC for more test kits Connecticut has tested 18 people, but no one has tested positive for virus yet CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK

Texto completo: As Connecticut continues to test more residents for the quickly spreading coronavirus, Gov. Ned Lamont Thursday evening called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to narrow the testing scope and send more testing kits to the state.
Connecticut has now tested 18 residents for the virus, which has been named COVID-19. As of Thursday evening, 13 of those tests had come back negative, with five more still pending. There have been no positive tests for the virus in the state.
Lamont's request follows the CDC's decision to loosen the testing criteria, increasing the number of people who qualify to be tested. In his letter, the governor said Connecticut lacks sufficient supplies to test everyone who has now been recommended for testing.
"I am concerned that the most recent guidelines issued by CDC cast too broad a net at this point in time and will not ensure that the right people are being tested," Lamont wrote. "Therefore, in order to maintain alignment with national messaging, I respectfully request the ability to access additional testing kits to support the heightened demand for COVID-19 testing in Connecticut."
"We are preparing very aggressively under the assumption that COVID-19 is coming to Connecticut, it's just a matter of time," said Josh Geballe, chief administrative officer for Gov. Ned Lamont. "We want to [as] prepared as possible for all the possible scenarios."
The state currently has only one testing kit - which can administer tests to about 500 people - and hopes to receive another from the CDC next week.
Geballe said the state is currently prioritizing tests for two groups of people:
* Those who have tested negative for influenza but are experiencing severe symptoms, including dramatic respiratory issues
* Those who have experienced symptoms, serious or otherwise, after returning from a country with a significant COVID-19 outbreak
Others with apparent symptoms have thus far been instructed to stay home and minimize all contact with other people.
CDC guidelines, which initially called for limited testing, now recommend testing for anyone recommended by a clinician. Lamont's office says it cannot meet that demand with its currently limited supplies.
The new guidelines "open it wide open," Geballe said. "The problem with that is the federal government hasn't provided sufficient testing kit capacity to be able to actually execute on that directive."
Geballe said Connecticut will likely test more patients in the coming days, in light of the broadened guidelines and the impending arrival of another testing kit.
Hospitals prepare for outbreak
Lamont has encouraged Connecticut residents to follow CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of coronavirus, which include frequent hand-washing and limited contact with sick people. Officials at the capitol have taken to bumping elbows in lieu of handshakes, to prevent the spread of germs.
COVID-19 prevention efforts across the state have continued to escalate as the virus has spread to neighboring states. Numerous universities, including UConn, have called students home from study abroad programs in affected countries and imposed self-quarantine. Department of Transportation spokesman Kevin Nursick said Metro North and CT Transit have increased cleaning, disinfection and sterilization of equipment and touch surfaces on buses and trains.
The state Department of Education continues to communicate with school districts about prevention guidelines. Until the state declares a public health emergency, the decision whether to close schools falls to individual districts.
Connecticut hospitals say they have increased their attention on coronavirus in recent days, as they prepare for a possible outbreak.
"There's a higher level of alert in terms of identifying [patients] early on, getting them into a protected space," said Dr. Kevin Dieckhaus, who leads UConn Health's division of infectious disease. "A lot of education is going out to our health-care providers on a daily basis, and it's changing rapidly, but we're keeping up and trying to let providers know what to expect, what the policies are and how they're changing."
Dieckhaus said he remains in regular contact with the state epidemiologist and the Department of Public Health and that guidelines are "literally changing by the moment."
As of Thursday morning, coronavirus continued to spread to states across the country, including New York, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Connecticut has tested eight patients for the virus but has not yet had a confirmed case. According to the New York Times, 18 states have residents who have tested positive.
An unknown number of state residents are on self-quarantine. Hundreds of people in neighboring states are under self-quarantine, according to media reports from New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
Patrick Turek, system director of emergency management at Hartford HealthCare, said staff there are in "constant communication with our federal, state and local partners." Turek said staff has participated in training drills and exercises regarding coronavirus, while incident management teams have met daily to prepare a response to the disease.
All patients at Hartford HealthCare facilities go through a coronavirus screening upon arrival, even if they show no symptoms, Turek said.
Virus has specific symptoms
Dr. Danyal Ibrahim, chief quality officer for Trinity Health of New England, said staff there has also spoken regularly with DPH. He said representatives from major hospitals will meet Friday with state officials and then separately with Hartford mayor Luke Bronin, as they prepare for worst-case scenarios.
"We have calls going back and forth," Ibrahim said. "We want to keep track of what is the size of this, how is this evolving and be ahead as far as our planning."
Dieckhaus said patients should seek treatment only if they have the specific symptoms of coronavirus, particularly fever and shortness of breath. Those who do experience those symptoms are asked to call their health care providers ahead of time, allowing the providers to take special measures ahead of their arrival.
When potential patients arrive at a hospital, providers give them masks and place them in a private room away from other patients. Doctors then evaluate the patients to determine whether the symptoms could be attributable to other viruses such as influenza. If not, an infectious disease specialist will examine the patient and possibly refer him to DPH, which will determine whether to administer a test.
Patients who require hospitalization will be placed in a "controlled airspace" Dieckhaus said, and treated by care-givers wearing a higher level of protective equipment, such as M95 masks.
As there is no cure for coronavirus, any patient who tests positive for the disease would receive supportive care in a segregated area, with special care taken to eliminate contact with other patients.
"We have been preparing for this for many years," Dieckhaus said, noting previous outbreaks such as the swine flue, SARS and MERS.
Ibrahim cautioned against panic but emphasized that patients asked to self-isolate must truly do so.
"It is critically important that the public knows that this is really critical advice and they need to follow it," he said. "Some people don't take that as seriously as it should be taken."

Texto completo: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is ramping up its enforcement efforts in 10 sanctuary cities, redeploying 500 investigators to increase surveillance and help arrest people living in the country illegally.
These agents, who typically work on complex long-term investigations, have been reassigned by ICE leadership to assist in the operation, set to run through the end of the year in cities that decline to assist in federal immigration enforcement, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, a law-enforcement agency within ICE, began to be pulled off active investigations at the Justice Department in the past week -- including those focusing on human trafficking, child pornography and cybercrime cases -- and redeployed to the initiative.
The redeployment was reported earlier by the New York Times.
The shift comes weeks after a separate decision to temporarily redeploy 100 officers and agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including several tactical border patrol units, to assist with the arrest operation.
Henry Lucero, who heads Enforcement and Removal Operations, the ICE arm that carries out deportations, said the need for increased personnel to arrest immigrants in sanctuary communities is a direct response to policies preventing local officials from notifying ICE when they plan to release unauthorized immigrants from law-enforcement custody.
ICE's arrest efforts have been stymied in recent years by uncooperative police agencies and by immigration advocates' efforts to inform people about their rights in such situations.
Sanctuary jurisdictions -- cities and states that restrain their law-enforcement officials' ability to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement -- argue the administration's focus on them is discriminatory and that greater coordination with ICE would discourage immigrants from working with local law-enforcement, making their communities less safe.
The dispute between these jurisdictions and the Trump administration has escalated in recent months.

Everyone Wanted to Touch the Orb. Then It Was Gone. --- Glowing globe was displayed for Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia

Texto completo: RIYADH -- President Trump produced one of the most memorable photos of his presidency when he placed his hands on a glowing Orb at the opening of a new center to combat Islamic extremism during a visit to Saudi Arabia nearly three years ago.
A flood of memes, jokes, tweets and photoshopped images followed. Some compared the moment to scenes from "The Lord of the Rings," "Star Wars," "Star Trek" and "The Wizard of Oz." The Church of Satan tweeted to let people know it wasn't a satanic ritual.
To this day, visitors from around the world come to Riyadh's Center for Combating Global Extremist Ideology in hopes of laying their hands on the glowing Orb.
"Everybody wants to see it," said Ilan Berman, vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council think tank, who toured the Saudi center in mid-February. "Everyone wants to touch it."
What people like Mr. Berman and most others didn't know is that the famous Orb isn't at the center. It is locked up, largely forgotten, in storage at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh.
The story of the Orb's journey from iconic photo to diplomatic obscurity is almost as surreal as its viral international debut. After the summit, the Orb was carted to the U.S. Embassy, where it was kept in a hallway before being quickly spirited away by diplomats who worried it could steal attention from the new American president on his first international trip, according to people familiar with the events.
U.S. officials have largely stayed mum about it ever since.
Saudi officials created the glass Orb in 2017, weeks before the summit, as a dramatic prop for President Trump's trip. They envisioned the mini-globe serving as a tangible symbol for a fight against extremism that must unite all nations.
Saudi officials charted out a plan for the U.S. president to inaugurate the new center by walking into the operations room with Saudi King Salman where the two men would put their hands on the Orb of the Earth to officially "activate" the center. A few American officials involved in planning the trip said they worried that having the president touch a glowing Orb in Riyadh might make for a potentially embarrassing moment.
The Orb itself wasn't much to look at. Some U.S. officials compared it to a prop in a high-school play. The bowling-ball size Orb had black silhouettes of the Earth's continents stuck on it.
Despite their reservations, officials agreed to the Orb-activation plan. Photographers snapped photos of Mr. Trump, King Salman and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi with their hands on the globe, an unearthly light illuminating their faces from below.
Mr. Sisi was never meant to be in the shot, U.S. officials say, but he kept close to Mr. Trump and King Salman as they walked into the center, and joined them in the photo. Mr. Sisi's office didn't respond to a request for comment.
When the event was over, U.S. officials said, an American embassy official asked if he could take it. The Saudis agreed.
Back at the embassy, the Orb was briefly placed on the first floor, close to an entrance.
Some people who knew the Orb was taken to the embassy joked among themselves, channeling the voice of Gollum from "The Lord of the Rings" coveting the Orb the way the movie character covets his "precious," magical ring: "We wants it! We needs it!"
Plenty of people wanted their pictures taken with the famous Orb. Yet senior U.S. officials worried that images would end up on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, that could be embarrassing. So, within a few hours, U.S. officials said, they ordered the Orb removed.
For a while, said people familiar with the events, it was stashed in the empty ambassador's office. (Mr. Trump didn't appoint an ambassador to Saudi Arabia until 18 months after the visit.)
Then the Orb was moved into a more permanent storage spot in the embassy -- exactly where U.S. officials won't say.
The State Department didn't respond to requests for comment.
The Orb's move has even earned a mention in a biography of the Saudi crown prince, by New York Times reporter Ben Hubbard, which comes out on Tuesday.
The Saudis actually created two Orbs for the 2017 event. The Orb upon which Mr. Trump, the Saudi King and the Egyptian president laid their hands on rested on one side of the room. Its twin was on the other.
Visitors to the Riyadh center can see the second Orb, which still sits in the operations room as a ceremonial prop.
Saudi officials at the center, known as Etidal, said they gave the Orb as a gift to the U.S. Embassy. The other remains at the center. "We are proud of it, and it is displayed to all visitors of Etidal," a written statement from the center said. While many visitors want to touch it, not everyone gets the chance.
Jonathan Schanzer, vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank, said he was excited to see the Orb when he took a tour last year and hoped to lay his hands on the glass. No touching the Orb, he said he was instructed by the center's staff. Mr. Schanzer was crestfallen.
"Alas," he said, "the life of a small fry . . ."

Coronavirus test kits dropped onto S. F. cruise ship
About 3,500 passengers are being asked to stay in their rooms on Princess Cruises' Grand Princess cruise ship off the San Francisco coast as they wait for coronavirus test results, regardless of whether they were one of the fewer than 100 passengers who were tested.
A Coast Guard helicopter lowered test kits onto the 951-foot Grand Princess by rope Thursday as the vessel lay at anchor off Northern California, and authorities said the results would be available on Friday.
Passengers on the ship may have been exposed to the coronavirus after sailing with 62 passengers company officials say had previously been on a voyage with a man who eventually died from the virus. The group of fewer than 100 identified for testing includes passengers who sailed the previous voyage and remain on board and passengers and crew who have coronavirus symptoms.
Riverside County leaders say the Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals set for April are still on.
Two Shasta County residents are being tested for coronavirus.
Calaveras residents self-isolate after possible exposure to coronavirus
Coronavirus fears lead to an N95 mask shortage in Siskiyou.
A Costco in Chino Hills becomes a wholesale mosh pit when water, paper towels and toilet paper are out of stock. And customers don't like it.
Speaking of, here's why we don't need to be panic buying and hoarding.
California's oil and gas legacy: 2,425 deserted and unplugged wells
Thick oil was once so abundant beneath Southern California that it bubbled to the surface, most famously at the La Brea Tar Pits.
But after more than a century of aggressive drilling by fossil fuel companies, most of Los Angeles’ profitable oil is gone. What remains is a costly legacy: nearly 1,000 wells across the city, in rich and poor neighborhoods, deserted by their owners and left to the state to clean, according to a first-of-its-kind analysis of state records by the Los Angeles Times and the Center for Public Integrity.
If not plugged and cleaned up, many of these orphaned wells will continue to expose people to toxic gases, complicate redevelopment and pose rare but serious threats of explosions. If the state were to tackle the cleanup, it would cost tens of millions of dollars.
Yet despite regulatory powers that in some ways are stronger than the state’s, Los Angeles has been slow and inconsistent in forcing the industry to take responsibility for its leaky legacy, the investigation found.
S. F. leaders condemn ICE arrest; police investigate noose + the high cost of living
Federal immigration agents arrested a man in front of San Francisco’s Hall of Justice this week, prompting outrage from the city’s public defender and district attorney, who claimed the arrest violated state law. The S. F. resident was on his way to a hearing when ICE agents took him into custody, the man's attorney said. They had no warrant.
Officials were investigating a video circulating of a noose hanging from a tree on a high school campus in Contra Costa County.
You've got $3,200 to spend on rent per month and you're moving to San Francisco. What do you get?
An island quintet celebrates the big 4-0
Sometimes called the "Galapagos Islands of North America," this set of islands is home to more than 2,000 plants and animal species, from rare seabirds and skunks to elephant seals and even island foxes, found here and nowhere else in the world.
On Thursday, the Channel Islands National Park, a collection of five islands off the Ventura coast, marked 40 years. They are Santa Barbara, Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel, which has one of the biggest pinniped rookeries in the world.
They offer kayaking, camping and so many miles of trails to explore if you can get there, but park officials have also tried to let people off-site scope out their wonders, broadcasting underwater dives and webcams showing life in a bald eagle nest or underwater kelp forest.
Find out more about past efforts, like how island foxes were brought back from near extinction, and what comes next as climate change challenges the islands' delicate ecosystems. Also:

Did you know: There is a sixth Channel Island, San Nicholas, but it's controlled by the Navy and not open to the public. A native Nicoleño woman lived alone on the island for many years in the 1800s. You may know her as Karana from the children's book, "Island of the Blue Dolphins. "
Golden State sights and sounds

In 80 square feet in San Jose, a chance to start over
San Jose's first tiny home community for homeless residents has opened. Its 40 homes offer 80 square feet, enough for a bed, desk, shelf and an air conditioning and heating system.
The site is owned by the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority and leased by the city, and the community is seen as a bridge to helping some of San Jose's 6,000 homeless residents find their way into permanent housing.
The cost of the entire project topped $2 million, or just over $50,000 per unit. That compares with a traditional affordable housing unit, which can cost anywhere from $400,000 to $750,000.

IMMIGRATION RIGHTS GROUPS RALLY AGAINST COLCOM

Texto completo: "Dime con quien andas y te dire quien eres ... Tell me who you associate with, and I'll tell you who you are."
In opening remarks, Guillermo Perez ended his statement by speaking in Spanish, then translating. It was a key point that would be stressed during a rally Thursday morning Downtown outside the office of the Colcom Foundation - a group known for its historic immigrant population-control campaigns and hefty funding of national immigration-reform groups.
Several members of local immigrant rights activist groups gathered near Stanwix Street and the Gateway T station and held signs critical of Colcom, asking that local civic and environmental nonprofit groups reject support from them. Members from the Pittsburgh Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, Thomas Merton Center, Veterans for Peace and Bend the Arc participated.
Moderated by Mr. Perez, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the LCLAA, additional members from each group also spoke and called for Pittsburgh to "drop Colcom" and reject support from the organization during the brief rally, which lasted less than an hour. The occasion marked the launching of a public campaign calling for thousands of groups in southwestern Pennsylvania to end their association with Colcom.
Founded in 1996 by Cordelia Scaife May, a philanthropic conservationist who served as chairman until her death in 2005, the Colcom Foundation has poured millions into a network of groups that have backed policies now pursued by President Donald Trump: militarizing the border, capping legal immigration, prioritizing skills over family ties for entry and reducing access to public benefits for migrants, according to The New York Times.
The foundation supports and helps fund many groups that have nothing to do with immigration reform or population control, however. The American Bird Conservancy, Tree Pittsburgh and the League of Women Voters of PA Citizen Education are a few examples.
"I cannot say that they've only done bad things," said Ben Gutschow, a junior at Winchester Thurston School and member of the youth-led environmental movement Fridays for the Future PGH. "Planting trees, providing crucial funds and promoting a positive quality of life I consider a good thing [by the Colcom Foundation]. But if we must compromise our values to allow discrimination, there should be no such place for this foundation here in Pittsburgh."
"I am tired and fed up with being told to go back to my country," said the student, who is from Guatemala.
In line with remarks made by Mr. Perez during the rally's opening, others called for local business entities to "cease legitimizing" the Colcom name, "until they divest from this mission of hatred and fear," said Dan Galvin of Veterans for Peace.
"Colcom's racist ideology shifts the blame toward the blameless and away from those who are most responsible for the environmental threats we face - namely those who poison our planet through fossil fuels."
At the end of Thursday's protest, participants handed out green pieces of paper listing a number for the foundation. "Call the Colcom Foundation and ask them to STOP funding white nationalist hate groups," the paper reads.
Several local civic and environmental groups are listed on the foundation's website as major grant recipients last year, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform and the Center for Immigration Studies. Nearly 70 Pittsburgh organizations received grants of $50,000 or more in the fiscal year ending in June 2019, according the foundation's website. The total amount of grants paid that fiscal year was $30,709,777.
Despite the criticism, the foundation's vice president, John Rohe, said Thursday the foundation is "pro-immigrant, and has zero-tolerance for the white nationalists." As the child of German immigrants himself, he said it's a misconception to think the organization is against immigrants.
"To be concerned about the level of immigrants due to overpopulation is not anti-immigrant," he said. "We hope to nurture the American dream for people who do come here."
The foundation's goal, according to Mr. Rohe, is to consider the long-term sustainable level of immigration. "How do we protect jobs and wages for underprivileged people in the U.S.?" he said. Protesters claimed Thursday that the foundation hides anti-immigrant sentiments in environmentalism. Yet, Mr. Rohe said he invites everyone, including the groups who protested Thursday, to an "informed conversation" in a "pro-immigrant, racially neutral manner."
"The long-term solution is to think of what level of immigration incentivizes employers to pay a living wage and to employ dignity upon labor," he said. "If you flood the labor pool, wages will be reduced, competition for jobs will reduce opportunities. We have 40 states that are confronting water issues in the foreseeable future."
"If we ignore these issues, it will be the underprivileged minorities who will be the first to pay the price."

Texto completo: Walking around an urban landscape is a different experience for Zach Sherwin than it is for most people. The comedian and rapper, who brings “The Crossword Show" to WBUR CitySpace Friday night for a sold-out show, has a special relationship with words.
“I do wordplay everything — any bit of text on a building or a billboard or wherever I see it, stuff happens compulsively," he says. “One of the kinds of wordplay that my mind does on autopilot is looking for rhymes in things."
His new stage show has given Sherwin an outlet for his compulsion. In it, he leads a group of guest solvers through a crossword puzzle with musical cues and comic clues. He gets to rap and spin connections between words into bits as his guests — on Friday they include comedians Kelly MacFarland, Nonye Brown-West, and WBUR reporter Jack Lepiarz — guess and ad-lib.
Each show revolves around one puzzle; four shows are in rotation on the current tour with a fifth edition on the way. Writing each show takes four to five months, Sherwin says. The more time he spends concentrating on writing raps and clues for the show, the less inclined his brain is to search out anagrams and puns the rest of the day. “Sometimes it would be almost oppressive, especially if I'd had a lot of coffee. It felt like, 'Ugh, turn it off, stop!' "
He comes by his love of words naturally. “I come from a bookish family," says Sherwin, a Brandeis graduate. “My grandmother did The New York Times crossword puzzle every day. My mom is a big reader. My uncles are big, big readers, English majors. People memorize poetry and perform it at Thanksgiving."
Before he took up comedy, Sherwin loved rap. “I think that's why I got into hip-hop, because it was so interesting verbally," he says. He started his career in Boston doing sketch comedy before establishing himself as a hip-hop comedian under the name MC Mr. Napkins. His lyrics were unusually erudite, expertly wrapping words like sphygmomanometers (a.k.a. blood pressure cuffs) around a beat and calling out “goose MCs" (in that rap he compares himself to hero pilot Captain “Sully" Sullenberger and proclaims other rappers as “goose MCs all up in my engines.")
He dropped the Napkins name when he moved to Los Angeles and started contributing to the Web series “Epic Rap Battles of History" and writing for Rachel Bloom's musical sitcom “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend." He has also released three albums of clever comic hip-hop.
“The Crossword Show" feels to Sherwin like a career-defining project. “It draws upon my experience with writing raps, doing comedy, being interested in wordplay and trivia," he says, “and also hosting, being like a friendly, almost camp counselor-y presence onstage, which is how I came to view myself. So this is the culmination, at least thus far, of all of the stuff that I've been working on all this time."
“The Crossword Show" arrived at a point when Sherwin had been feeling creatively stalled. He didn't have the appetite to write comedy raps anymore and never really considered himself a stand-up comedian, despite doing regular spots around Los Angeles without music. That's when he connected with crossword constructor Will Nediger through Twitter and began a collaboration that eventually spawned “Crossword." Now it's all he really wants to do.
“It is really, really clear that I have found my home, at least for now," he says.
The mechanics of the show are difficult to describe for those who haven't seen it. Sherwin says it's part game show, part variety show, part TED Talk, and part magic show. It starts with the across clues, which Sherwin introduces with a rap. The solvers then move on to the down clues, and another rap. For each word, Sherwin has written a series of riffs and digressions and worked with his producer on an accompanying slide presentation. As the game moves on, he attempts to tie the words together, which he describes as going down a “rabbit hole."
“By the end of the show," he says, “these strange, impossible to predict scenes and connections, like a web of links, begins to build between all the different words that the constructor built into their crossword puzzle. And it really just goes to cool places."
Those who aren't crossword aficionados needn't worry. Sherwin believes the format is unique, but it's built for a broad appeal. “Once you're in the room it all makes sense," he says. “It's so niche sounding, and yet, watching these audiences find the connection that I'm attempting to provide for them, it is the most meaningful thing as a performer that I've ever done. I just feel I'm putting everybody's brain in the room, plugging them into mine, and we all just float in that space for an hour and a half and everyone goes home. It's so great."

Texto completo: No cases of COVID-19 have yet been reported in Pennsylvania, but testing for the new coronavirus will be rolled out in Pittsburgh and across the country by Monday as private companies begin offering the service.
Burlington, N.C.-based LabCorp said its test for the new coronavirus would be available starting at 6 p.m. Thursday. The test will detect the presence of the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease.
"We have been intensely focused on making testing for COVID-19 available as soon as possible, working with the government and others to address this public health crisis," LabCorp President and CEO Adam H. Schechter said in a prepared statement.
Also Thursday, Secaucus, N.J.-based Quest Diagnostics Inc. said it would roll out a nationwide test for the new coronavirus starting Monday. Neither company will collect specimens for testing, which is usually done with a throat swab.
Instead, specimens will be collected by the patient's physician and forwarded to labs for analysis.
The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have also been doing testing for the coronavirus, but the entry of private companies into the market is expected to ramp up the number of tests that can be performed while cutting turnaround time.
LabCorp says its results will be available in three to four days. Quest officials were unavailable for comment.
Both lab companies have operations in Western Pennsylvania, with coverage of the tests by Medicare and most insurers, subject to the usual co-pays and deductibles of individual plans. Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield covers both the LabCorp and Quest tests; UPMC Health Plan only covers ones done by Quest.
Quest has had a joint venture with UPMC for lab services in the greater Pittsburgh area for 22 years. UPMC controls 49% of the venture, Quest 51%.
A doctor's order is needed before testing.
Other laboratories may also soon begin testing.
On Saturday, the Food&Drug Administration gave approval for 300 to 400 academic medical center laboratories nationwide to develop their own tests to identify the new coronavirus.
At a news conference Tuesday, UPMC said it was working to develop its own test, but officials were not available Thursday after announcements by the two private labs.
The new coronavirus, which spreads through contact with tiny droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze, was first identified in the Chinese province of Hubei in December.
At least 205 cases have been reported in 17 states, most in California and Washington state.

T scrubs vehicles, stations

Texto completo: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority has begun to aggressively clean and disinfect transit stations and vehicles in response to the global spread of the coronavirus, joining other transit agencies taking precautions to safeguard an area of daily life that is potentially among the most risky during an outbreak.
On Wednesday, the agency began a major push inside stations to disinfect anything people touch — such as handrails, elevator buttons, and fare equipment — as frequently as every four hours.
“It was important for us to take this next step," MBTA general manager Steve Poftak said at a news briefing. “We are stepping up our level of disinfection." Every T vehicle, Poftak said, will be disinfected on a daily basis starting this week.
The T is not alone in boosting its cleaning initiatives. New York transit officials on Monday said they would begin a major effort to regularly use industrial-grade disinfectant on all its equipment every 72 hours after a commuter was confirmed to have the virus, according to The New York Times. In Washington State, where the coronavirus has killed 10 people, officials said they would boost efforts to clean all surfaces bus riders come into contact with.
These cleaning initiatives are the most tangible response transit agencies can take to fight the spread of disease, said Polly Hanson, the senior director of security, risk, and emergency management for the American Public Transit Association.
“A transit agency might have done [cleaning] every week. Now they're doing it every day," Hanson said. “Those are localized decisions, but transit agencies are enhancing the cleaning of everything."
But Hanson noted that many of the same concerns about the coronavirus are true of other diseases that spread this time of year, such as the flu. She said transit riders should avoid touching surfaces as much as they can and wash their hands after each trip, while agencies should regularly remind workers about proper hygiene.
Public transit is a potentially risky location amid a viral outbreak because of the prospect of crowding and close contact with other riders, said Tom Russo, a doctor and expert in infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo.
“You've got a contained subway car, so if somebody is coughing and everybody is standing and holding on, you're pretty close to somebody," Russo said. “Let's say you're going to a Celtics game. It's probably not quite as bad. It's not quite as confined or close quarters."
That makes it all the more important that commuters who are sick stay home, and if they feel sick while in transit, they should take steps to protect other riders, such as coughing into their elbow.
Some industry watchers have posited that commuters will avoid public transit during the virus scare. For example, Doug Anmuth, an analyst with JP Morgan who follows ride-hailing companies, wrote in a research note that shares of Lyft could go up because “people would be more likely to use rideshare than a crowded bus or subway," though Lyft may also be hurt by a decrease in overall travel, especially to airports.
In Massachusetts, there has been one confirmed case of coronavirus, from a Boston resident, and two presumptive cases. Boston public health officials said the person with the confirmed case has not left his home since being diagnosed. The state's public health department also said that residents who are under self-quarantine — currently, more than 250 people — should call health authorities before traveling if they feel ill.
The T's initiative to clean station surfaces every four hours began Wednesday, MBTA spokeswoman Lisa Battiston said, up from once a day. She added that the work does not require more workers beyond existing in-station staff and cleaning crews, “though staffing needs will continue to be reviewed with increases to staff where necessary."
“This effort is not a deep-clean of the entirety of the station, but a targeted focus on high-contact areas including things like fare vending machines, push bars on doors, elevator buttons, and handrails of stairways and escalators," Battiston said.
Poftak cautioned that the cleaning schedule depends on getting enough commercial-grade disinfectant on hand. Right now, the agency has enough to clean every commuter rail car each day; he estimated that by the end of this week, the T will be able to disinfect subway cars, buses, and paratransit vehicles daily.
In addition to increased cleaning, the MBTA will be installing hand sanitizer dispensers in stations, and the agency will display information related to the coronavirus on messaging boards in stations and on trains, Poftak said.

With policy impact, a winner

Texto completo: She didn't win a single state, amassed only a handful of delegates, and placed a dismal third in her own state. But Senator Elizabeth Warren nonetheless had an outsize influence on the 2020 presidential race, one that will extend to the Democratic convention and beyond.
From modernizing retail politics with her joyful “selfie" lines to her meaty policy proposals to elevating many progressive ideas into the mainstream, she formed the contours of the contest.
“She not only shaped this race, but I think she is going to have a dramatic impact on future presidential races," said Representative Katherine Clark, a Melrose Democrat, who had endorsed Warren.
But history may most remember her candidacy, analysts said, for her political disembowelment on national TV of billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who many Democratic voters desperate to defeat Trump believed could be the best suited for the job. She effectively ended his campaign in about 40 seconds.
Her takedown of the eighth-richest man in the world not only made for exciting television, but it also instantly altered the political terrain and contributed to the rapid winnowing in the field's moderate lane in favor of former vice president Joe Biden.
“Taking on Bloomberg the way she did clearly had a massive impact on his candidacy. There's no two ways about that," said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist.
Warren's influence went further than proving even half a billion dollars can't buy you a presidential nomination, political strategists said. The Cambridge Democrat, whose catchphrase centered on having a plan for everything, drove many of the dominant policy conversations in the race, even as she paid a price for her specificity on issues such as Medicare for All.
Her juggernaut of a policy shop forced rivals to play catch-up and flesh out their own platforms.
“She pushed the field. She came with ideas," said Julie McClain Downey, who was director of state communications for Senator Cory Booker's presidential campaign and a veteran of Hillary Clinton's 2016 race.
Several strategists credited Warren's signature wealth tax — and the way she pitched it — as particularly consequential.
Brian Fallon, a former top campaign aide to Clinton, said there have been two key moments in the last several years that signaled the evolution of Democratic thinking and comfort levels on raising taxes on the wealthy.
The first was Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggesting in a “60 Minutes" interview that a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the richest Americans could pay for the Green New Deal climate change plan.
The other was Warren's proposed 2 percent wealth tax, he said. And not just the plan, but the way she broke down the substance into an easily understandable concept of mega-rich people paying two cents out of every dollar of their net worth over $50 million. So simple, her supporters turned it into a rallying cry at her events: “Two cents! Two cents!"
“I think that has totally shifted the window. It has created the political permission structure for Democrats to call for much higher taxes on the wealthy" and not spend a second worrying about the political fallout, which had hampered the party on the issue since the 1980s, Fallon said.
Warren, by contrast, appeared to relish the angst her proposal evoked from the ultra-wealthy, weaving in scorn of freaked-out billionaires into her stump speeches, selling mugs to hold all those “billionaire tears," and even cutting a TV ad calling on billionaires to share the wealth that slammed four of them by name and net worth.
The polling backed her strategy up, finding more than 60 percent of Americans supported the concept. Indeed, her case has been so convincing, even former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin — whose brand of Wall Street-friendly economic policy is exactly what Warren has focused her entire political career fighting against — said this week that moderate Democrats “must recognize the popular resonance of a wealth tax," even if they don't support it.
“A wealth tax is on the table," he wrote in a New York Times op-ed.
“She clearly furthered the progressive agenda," said pollster John Zogby. “For a while, she really owned those issues as far as people were talking about them. . . . [Senator Bernie Sanders has] been saying the same stuff. She mainstreamed it.“
Clark said Warren's candidacy was powerful because she elevated issues that resonate with women and everyday families, talking about her own experiences as a single mother and her parents' financial struggles and connecting those stories with her policy prescriptions.
“She's not only a model for girls with her pinkie swears around the country, but she really did set a standard for how to cede families the pain many of them are in and how to make that into bold policy" to address their struggles, said Clark.
And while Warren's departure means Americans yearning for a woman president must wait at least four more years, as she emotionally noted at her press conference Thursday, she disrupted the prevailing power dynamics surrounding the male dominance of presidential politics, said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, in an e-mail.
“She was willing to call out gender bias directly and, as is consistent with all she does, explain it as a means to combating it," Dittmar said. “For example, when she was called angry, she pushed back by noting that women are subject to this criticism 'over and over' again as a way to discredit them."
Warren not only wounded Bloomberg, calling out his alleged mistreatment of women and shaming him to release three women from nondisclosure agreements so they could freely speak about their experiences at his company, she also played a role in getting MSNBC host Chris Matthews off the air, when he seemed incredulous that she didn't believe Bloomberg's denials.
“She was willing to confront their sexism head on, even when some may have argued the political benefit was minimal and/or not going to [help] her," Dittmar said.
That fearlessness, predict those who know Warren well, will persist long after November.

JPMorgan Chief Has
Emergency Heart Surgery
Jamie Dimon, the longtime chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, had an emergency medical procedure on his heart on Thursday, according to a memo sent to bank employees.
Mr. Dimon, 63, underwent successful heart surgery for an "acute aortic dissection," and he is recovering, said the memo, which The New York Times reviewed.
While Mr. Dimon is out of work, the bank will be run by two senior executives, Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith, the memo said.
Mr. Dimon, who previously overcame a bout of cancer, is the longest-serving leader of a major American bank, having run the company since 2005.
"The good news is that it was caught early and the surgery was successful," the memo said.
Mr. Dimon has kept an iron grip on the job, weathering the 2008 financial crisis and a 2012 scandal in which a trader nicknamed the London Whale lost the bank more than $ 6 billion.

Hachette Staff Walk Out
Over Woody Allen Book
Dozens of Hachette Book Group employees left work Thursday afternoon, protesting the company's decision, which it announced earlier in the week, to publish an autobiography by Woody Allen.
The publisher said on Monday that Mr. Allen's book, titled "Apropos of Nothing," would come out under its Grand Central imprint on April 7. It described the book as "a comprehensive account of his life, both personal and professional," that would cover "his relationship with family, friends and the loves of his life."
But the announcement drew criticism because of the allegations that Mr. Allen molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow. He has denied the accusations and wasn't charged after two investigations decades ago.
A Hachette spokeswoman said in an email Thursday evening: "We respect and understand the perspective of our employees who have decided to express their concern over the publication of this book. We will engage our staff in a fuller discussion about this." JOHN WILLIAMS

Texto completo: Through the new group, Humanity Forward, Mr. Yang wants to advance the ideas he championed during his presidential campaign with voter outreach efforts, a podcast and more.
The entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who last month ended his long-shot presidential campaign in which he promoted a universal basic income, argued for data as a property right and called for a "humanity first" approach to capitalism, announced Thursday that he would create a nonprofit organization tasked with advancing those ideas.
The organization, called Humanity Forward, aims to bring Mr. Yang's ideas into the mainstream through conferences and a podcast, and to build pilot programs that might put his ideas into practice.
"We knew we wanted to keep the movement growing, the only question was what form that would take," Mr. Yang said in an interview on Wednesday. He framed the group as "a natural next step" of his campaign effort, given his previous work as the head of a nonprofit.
Humanity Forward, which will be based in New York, will focus first on a "data dividend" project and campaign that would fight on behalf of consumers who want the rights to their personal data, Mr. Yang said.
Separately, he said Thursday that the group had received pledges of $ 3 million for pilot programs that would provide people with a universal basic income payment each month.
The venture capitalist Albert Wenger and the entrepreneur Susan Danziger together pledged $ 500,000 for a trial in a town in New York State that will be selected later, and the professional poker player Daniel Negreanu pledged $ 100,000 for other test runs; the rest of the contributors are anonymous, Mr. Yang said.
Though he used his campaign to spread his ideas, Mr. Yang said he had been somewhat hamstrung by his run for president. Now, he said his new organization would allow him to try to actually implement some of the proposals he pitched to voters.
"I have to say I'm super excited about it," Mr. Yang said in the interview on Wednesday. "My hands were tied as a political candidate to some extent. And now I get to work."
The organization also plans to provide resources to political candidates who embrace the ideas of Mr. Yang's campaign. And it will work to draw into the political process disaffected voters, young people and others who were inspired by his 2020 run, Mr. Yang said.
The podcast -- its working title is "Let Yang Speak" -- will be part of that effort, he added.
Mr. Yang said he hoped his organization would grow quickly with help from grass-roots donors and celebrities who endorsed Mr. Yang, such as the comedians Dave Chappelle and Ken Jeong. He said the organization's small team primarily consisted of former campaign staff members.
Addressing voters in New Hampshire the night he exited the Democratic primary last month, Mr. Yang promised, "we'll be back soon," and Thursday's announcement provides clarity about some of Mr. Yang's post-campaign plans.
In the weeks since he dropped out, Mr. Yang joined CNN as a political commentator amid speculation about whether he would run for mayor of New York in 2021. Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that advisers to Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, had reached out to Mr. Yang after he withdrew from the presidential race to offer counsel about a possible mayoral campaign.
In the interview Wednesday, Mr. Yang said he was focused on getting Humanity Forward off the ground, but reiterated that he would not rule out a mayoral run.
"I'm just about solving problems," he said. "I would want to see who else is running and what the world looks like. I just want to put myself in the position to have the greatest possible impact."
"Certainly the mayor of New York City can do a lot of good," he added. "So that is something that I have to take a long look at."
As to whether he would endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary, he said that if a candidate were to come out in favor of universal basic income, it would sway his thinking considerably.
Before filing his paperwork to run for president in the fall of 2017, Mr. Yang ran the nonprofit organization Venture for America, whose mission involved training college graduates in entrepreneurship.

Weinstein Has Heart Procedure, Then Is Transferred to Protective Custody on Rikers

Texto completo: The producer had a stent installed to alleviate a blockage. He had been hospitalized last week after his rape conviction.
Harvey Weinstein underwent a heart procedure at a New York City hospital on Wednesday evening and the next day was transferred to a jail on Rikers Island for inmates needing special protection, his spokesman said.
Mr. Weinstein, the once powerful film producer, was convicted last week of rape and criminal sexual assault after a trial in Manhattan that many saw as a milestone in the #MeToo movement. A judge ordered him held in jail until his sentencing next week.
But hours after the verdict, Mr. Weinstein, 67, experienced extremely high blood pressure and heart palpitations, his lawyers said. He was taken directly from State Supreme Court in Manhattan to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was treated for 10 days in a ward for inmates.
Mr. Weinstein had angioplasty to alleviate a blockage, his spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, said. The procedure lasted at least two hours.
The city's Department of Correction did not respond to questions about Mr. Weinstein on Thursday.
Photographs were posted online last week of the producer sitting in a common room at Bellevue, watching television in an armchair with a wheelchair nearby. The images prompted questions about whether he was getting special treatment.
But correction officials denied Mr. Weinstein was being treated differently than other inmates.
On Thursday, Mr. Weinstein's representatives said correction officials had transferred Mr. Weinstein to Rikers Island a day after heart surgery to avoid the appearance of favoritism.
Mr. Weinstein was sent to the jail's North Infirmary Command under protective custody, according to the Department of Correction website and his spokesman.
The facility consists of two buildings, one of which was built in 1932 as a hospital for inmates. It once housed people with acute diseases including tuberculosis.
In recent years, the North Infirmary Command typically has been used to house inmates whose safety may be at risk if they are placed in the general population, including celebrities, rape victims or, in some cases, transgender people. There is also an area reserved specifically for police officers.
Martin Horn, a former Department of Correction commissioner, said the facility was not "luxurious," but not "draconian" either. It contains about 10 cells on each block, as opposed to the nearly 30 on a typical Rikers cell block, he said. Mr. Weinstein -- who, friends have said, is terrified of being behind bars -- faces up to 29 years in prison when he is sentenced on Wednesday. He has hired a prison consultant to help him navigate the journey from life on the outside to life in a cell.
Last week, a jury of seven men and five women found Mr. Weinstein guilty of raping an actress at a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and forcing oral sex on a production assistant in 2006. But the jury acquitted him of the two most serious charges against him, predatory sexual assault.
Six women had testified during the trial that Mr. Weinstein had sexually assaulted them, but he was not criminally charged in all of those cases. Some of the women were allowed to give their accounts to show a pattern of behavior.
As the jury read the verdict, Mr. Weinstein said several times to his lawyers, "But I'm innocent." A few hours later, he was hospitalized with chest pains.
One of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers, Arthur Aidala, said he visited the producer at Bellevue for two hours on Thursday. Shortly after he left, Mr. Aidala said, he learned that Mr. Weinstein was going to be transferred.
"I'm sure he was disturbed," the lawyer said. "I would have liked to have calmed him down and let him know that he would be safe."
He said Mr. Weinstein had asked him about the appeals process and what to expect at his sentencing.
They also discussed his case in Los Angeles, where prosecutors have charged Mr. Weinstein with rape and related offenses. Announced in January, the charges stem from the allegations of two women who allege that the producer attacked them at hotels in February 2013, when he was in the city for a film festival.
An arraignment has yet to be scheduled for the Los Angeles case, and it remains unclear when the authorities there would take him into custody and bring him to California to face charges. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Texto completo: A four-part documentary about Hillary Clinton debuts on Hulu. And an action-comedy with Mark Wahlberg hits Netflix.
What's Streaming
HILLARY Stream on Hulu. "We want to hear your story, unvarnished, beginning to end," the filmmaker Nanette Burstein tells Hillary Clinton at the start of this documentary. "Hillary" relays that story in four parts, beginning with her path from a childhood in the Chicago suburbs to becoming the first lady of Arkansas in the early 1980s. Subsequent installments cover her time as the first lady of the United States, as a United States senator and ultimately as a presidential candidate. The documentary places interviews with Bill Clinton and the journalist Joe Klein, among others, alongside archival footage, thought it's built largely around Burstein's interviews with Clinton herself. The first question: "Do you feel frustrated that you've been in public life for 30 years, yet people feel that they don't know who you are, that you seem inauthentic?" (It surely can't be a spoiler to reveal that Clinton's answer is yes.)
SPENSER CONFIDENTIAL (2020) Stream on Netflix. See Mark Wahlberg order burritos and dodge a machete (both in the same scene) in this tongue-in-cheek action movie, the latest collaboration between Wahlberg and the director Peter Berg ("Deepwater Horizon," "Lone Survivor"). Loosely based on a book by Ace Atkins, the movie casts Wahlberg as Spenser, a former cop who falls into a dangerous conspiracy. "The perfunctory plot matters less than the scenes depicting Spenser's relationships with his old buddy Henry (Alan Arkin); his new buddy Hawk (Winston Duke); his former girlfriend Cissy (the comedian Iliza Shlesinger); and his dog, Pearl," Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote in her review for The New York Times. "Those moments are Berg and Wahlberg at their loosely funny best, clearly enjoying making room for the supporting cast to strut their stuff -- Duke is especially winning as a laconic gentle giant working on his MMA moves."
ZEROZEROZERO Stream on Amazon. The filmmaker Stefano Sollima had success translating real-life crime into compelling onscreen drama as the showrunner of "Gomorrah," a popular Italian Mafia series based on nonfiction investigative work by Roberto Saviano. That series developed a reputation for vicious violence, and drew comparisons to "The Wire," "The Sopranos" and "The Godfather." Sollima has adapted another work by Saviano, his 2013 nonfiction book "'ZeroZeroZero," in this new show, which revolves around international cocaine trafficking. Don't expect an easy watch: In his review for The Times, Mark Bowden called the book "a kind of concordance of cruelty."
What's on TV
THE TRADE 9 p.m. on Showtime. In the first season of this series, the documentarian Matthew Heineman ("Cartel Land") spent time with subjects on many sides of the opioid crisis: Users and their families, police officers and criminals. He turns his attention to human trafficking and smuggling in the second season, which will debut Friday night. It focuses on migrants fleeing Central America, looking at those making the journey, law enforcement agents trying to stop them and shadow industries that have been built around them.

Costco Sets Limits on Its Sales of Sanitizer and Other Goods
As consumers stockpile products like disinfectants and canned goods, some Costco locations have started setting purchase limits on high-demand items.
Richard A. Galanti, chief financial officer of Costco, said the restrictions were being placed generally on a regional basis as the chain scrambled to keep pace with demand from its members.
"It's really dependent on supply availability in areas where there's been a run on those types of items, whether it's paper goods, water or hand sanitizers, soaps and the like," Mr. Galanti said in an interview on Thursday.
"The last week and a half would be a bit unusual," he said. "We're busy trying to get merchandise and continuing to keep things in stock and that's been a challenge."
ADVERTISING
Misleading Prevention Ads Spread on the Internet
Skittish consumers searching for details about the coronavirus are being targeted with ads spouting unsupported claims that face masks and other products can protect against the outbreak.
This week, the Advertising Standards Authority, a British regulator, called several face mask ads misleading. One set of ads, served up on news sites like The Scottish Sun and CNN, tried to drum up demand using "alarmist language."
Searching for "coronavirus" on Amazon pulls up more than 1,000 results, including vitamins, safety glasses, gloves and canine testing kits, but also generates a prompt at the top of the search page that links to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Facebook, Google and Twitter have said they are trying to block opportunistic ads from their platforms, while offering free ad space to health agencies like the World Health Organization.
Many companies are trying to keep their ads away from content related to the outbreak. YouTube demonetized videos that mention coronavirus.
EARNINGS
Starbucks Expects China Blow
After markets closed on Thursday, Starbucks warned that its quarterly "comparable store" sales in China, where it has a huge presence, would fall 50 percent compared with last year, resulting in a hit to its revenue forecast of $ 400 million to $ 430 million.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'ENDLINGS' at New York Theater Workshop (in previews; opens on March 9). On a Korean island, three elderly women -- the last of their kind, known as "haenyeos" -- dive for shellfish. A world away a Korean-Canadian playwright, now based in New York, wrestles with how to write about race and ethnicity. Sammi Cannold directs Celine Song's aquatic comedy-drama, with Jiehae Park.
212-460-5475, nytw.org
'FLYING OVER SUNSET' at the Vivian Beaumont Theater (previews start on March 12; opens on April 16). In this hallucinatory new musical, more or less based on real events, Cary Grant, Clare Boothe Luce and Aldous Huxley drop acid in Malibu, Calif. Tony Yazbeck, Carmen Cusack and Harry Hadden-Paton star, with music by Tom Kitt, lyrics by Michael Korie and a book by James Lapine, who also directs. What a long quaint trip it looks to be.
lct.org
'GNIT' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (previews start on March 7; opens on March 19). Henrik Ibsen's fairy tale of man's search for self -- plus trolls -- arrives in a new, modern-day adaptation from the existentially oriented playwright Will Eno. In this Theater for a New Audience production, Jordan Bellow, Joe Curnutte, Crystal Dickinson, Deborah Hedwall, Matthew Maher and Erin Wilhelmi star. Oliver Butler directs.
866-811-4111, tfana.org
'HELP' at the Shed (previews start on March 10; opens on March 21). The poet and essayist Claudia Rankine ("Citizen"), who years ago created a performance aboard a Bronx bus ("Provenance of Beauty"), makes a stop at the Shed. In this piece, directed by Taibi Magar and starring Roslyn Ruff, Rankine adapts her conversations with white men about white male privilege.
theshed.org
'THE LEHMAN TRILOGY' at the Nederlander Theater (previews start on March 7; opens on March 26). The financial services firm Lehman Brothers was not too big to fail. This theatrical version of its century-and-a-half-plus run, staged with just three actors, is not too small to succeed. Stefano Massini's play, directed by Sam Mendes, "unfolds a tale of extravagant wealth with an even more dazzling economy of means," Ben Brantley wrote of the Park Avenue Armory production last year.
877-250-2929, thelehmantrilogy.com
'MRS. DOUBTFIRE' at the Stephen Sondheim Theater (previews start on March 9; opens on April 5). A musical about an unusual approach to custody agreements, this adaptation of the Robin Williams movie bustles onto Broadway. Rob McClure stars as an actor in the midst of a divorce who puts on a dress -- for the kids! Karey Kirkpatrick co-wrote the music and lyrics with Wayne Kirkpatrick and the book with John O'Farrell. Jerry Zaks directs.
212-239-6200, mrsdoubtfirebroadway.com
'ORATORIO FOR LIVING THINGS' at Ars Nova at Greenwich House (previews start on March 10; opens on March 30). The singular singer-songwriter Heather Christian premieres a new music-theater piece for Ars Nova. Christian, who gracefully straddles a host of styles and genres, contemplates the mysteries of human existence with the help of an 18-member ensemble surrounding the audience. Lee Sunday Evans directs.
arsnovanyc.com
'72 MILES TO GO ...' at the Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater (in previews; opens on March 10). When Anita is deported -- from Tucson, Ariz., to Nogales, Mexico -- family life goes on with and without her. Hilary Bettis's border-crossing, decade-spanning drama stars Maria Elena Ramirez as Anita, with Triney Sandoval, Tyler Alvarez, Jacqueline Guillén and Bobby Moreno. Jo Bonney directs.
212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org
[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
'SIX' at the Brooks Atkinson Theater (in previews; opens on March 12). In a time before marriage counseling and no-fault divorce, the much-married Henry VIII racked up six wives. And in this rock musical by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, they come together to debate who had it worst. "'Six' delivers pure entertainment throughout its headlong 80 minutes," Jesse Green wrote of the Chicago production last summer.
877-250-2929, sixonbroadway.com
'UNKNOWN SOLDIER' at Playwrights Horizons (in previews; opens on March 9). A late work by the composer Michael Friedman, who died in 2017, and the book writer and lyricist Daniel Goldstein comes to New York. Spread across three time periods and nearly a century, it follows a Manhattan obstetrician's investigation of her family's past. Trip Cullman directs a cast that includes Kerstin Anderson, Estelle Parsons and Margo Seibert.
212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org
'WHISPER HOUSE' at 59E59 Theaters (previews start on March 12; opens on March 24). In this spooky musical from Kyle Jarrow and Duncan Sheik, directed by Steve Cosson, the living and the dead converge on a Maine lighthouse during World War II. When a young boy is sent to live with his aunt (Samantha Mathis), a pair of ghosts help him acclimate.
646-892-7999, 59e59.org
Last Chance
'ANATOMY OF A SUICIDE' at the Atlantic Theater Company at the Linda Gross Theater (closes on March 15). Alice Birch's play, dazzling in its form and devastating in its effect, ends its Off Broadway run. With dizzying simultaneity, the play follows three generations of women (Carla Gugino, Celeste Arias, Gabby Beans) in the throes of suicidal depression. Lileana Blain-Cruz directs.
866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org
'HAMLET' at St. Ann's Warehouse (closes on March 8). Ruth Negga's sweet prince bids his final good night as Yaël Farber's shadowed version of Shakespeare's tragedy closes. In an admiring review, Ben Brantley wrote that Negga "has created a portrait of the theater's most endlessly analyzed prince that is drawn in lines of lightning."
718-254-8779, stannswarehouse.org
'THE INHERITANCE' at the Ethel Barrymore Theater (closes on March 15). Matthew Lopez's diptych, a six-hour visit with gay men in contemporary New York and the long shadow of the AIDS crisis, leaves Broadway. Ben Brantley noted, "Ambition and achievement are not entirely commensurate" in Stephen Daldry's production. The play's breadth, he added, "doesn't always translate into depth."
212-239-6200, theinheritanceplay.com
'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' at the American Airlines Theater (closes on March 15). Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1981 drama, directed by Kenny Leon and starring Blair Underwood and David Alan Grier, reaches the end of its tour. Set on a Louisiana army base in 1944, the play is both a crime story and an exploration of immutable racism, a structure and theme that, as Jesse Green wrote, "can sometimes seem at odds."

Texto completo: The deadly disease has arrived in some offices, and employers are figuring out how to adapt.
SAN FRANCISCO -- At Facebook on Thursday, the questions from spooked employees came thick and fast.
The evening before, the social network had disclosed that the coronavirus had been diagnosed in a contractor in its Seattle office and had said all employees in that city should work from home until March 31.
Other Facebook employees, some of whom had recently traveled for work, soon began asking their managers and one another: Who was the contractor? Had that person been near them? And what did that mean for their work?
That same alarm has now spread through other companies around the world, despite escalating efforts by many of the firms to deal with disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak that started in China. Microsoft, Amazon, Ford Motor, CNN, Citigroup and Twitter have put employees through work-from-home drills, dusted off emergency-response plans and ordered increasingly stringent safety measures to protect their workers.
Even so, the coronavirus has moved faster than their preparations. Amazon said this week that two employees in Europe, who had been in Milan, were infected with the virus and that one employee at its Seattle headquarters had tested positive for it. HSBC said on Thursday that the coronavirus had been diagnosed in an employee at its global headquarters in London. And AT&T said a retail employee at one of its stores in San Diego had tested positive.
The challenges faced by workplaces have become a new front in the battle over the coronavirus, which has spawned more than 90,000 cases and caused more than 3,000 deaths around the world. While factories in China had already been closed by the outbreak and are now just ramping back up, global white-collar companies have rarely grappled with this scale of disruption -- or the level of fear that has gripped workers.
"No one has a playbook for this," said Dan Levin, who runs a small company outside Chicago, Cain Millwork, which makes furniture and wall paneling. He said he was planning to have some of his office employees work from home.
Many corporate memos, including those from HSBC and Facebook, now mention deep cleaning of office spaces and self-quarantining. Face-to-face job interviews have been all but banned by some firms, in favor of interviews conducted by teleconference.
At Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., near a cluster of coronavirus cases, employees swapped stories this week about the outbreak in internal chat rooms. In one online conversation on Wednesday, which The New York Times reviewed, a Microsoft employee wrote of a rumor that someone at headquarters had been infected.
"Could it be true?" he wrote. "FWIW," he noted, the corporate emails telling employees to work from home "don't mention that NO Microsoft employees had been infected."
Late Thursday, Microsoft said two employees in the Seattle area had been infected, the first known cases at the company. "The affected employees remain in quarantine, and we are supporting them as the recover," Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene said in an email to employees obtained by The Times.
Inside Amazon, while some workers emailed each other about whether masks provide effective protection, many were scrambling to deal with business problems caused by the virus, according to four employees, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Those included whether Amazon will have enough products to offer for Prime Day, its summer sale event, or have enough drivers to handle a surge in online grocery orders as the virus spreads.
The depth of employee anxiety has forced senior executives to take calming measures. Uber sent out a memo to staff on Wednesday saying it had formed an internal task force to handle its response to the virus, according to a copy viewed by The Times.
The ride-hailing company urged employees to have empathy for one another, to make decisions based on data and to restrict all nonessential travel until April. Uber added that it was working with an epidemiology consultant for further guidance.
"Much of this situation is new -- not only for Uber, but for the world," Andrew MacDonald, a senior vice president at Uber, wrote in the memo. "We won't get everything right from the start."
At its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., Google also increased the amount of hand sanitizer available to employees, putting it in conference rooms and kitchen areas.
Other companies have tightened their travel restrictions. Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have said senior managers must approve international business trips. Walmart said on Thursday that employees could travel internationally only for "business-critical trips" and that it was limiting their travel to conferences and trade shows in the United States. And at CNN, the chief executive officer has begun personally vetting all intercontinental travel.
How companies have altered their response to the coronavirus over time has been evident with Twitter. On Sunday, the San Francisco social media company said it was suspending all nonessential travel for employees. A day later, it encouraged all of its employees -- it has just over 5,000 -- to work from home if they were able to.
Then on Thursday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, appeared at a financial conference in San Francisco and said he was rethinking a plan he had formulated to work remotely from Africa for three to six months this year.
"Everything happening in the world, particularly with coronavirus, I have to reconsider what's going on and what that means for me and for our company," said Mr. Dorsey, who is also facing a challenge from activist investors.
The measures that companies are taking in response to the virus may shift workplace behavior over the long term. Telecommuting, which has been in and out of favor for decades, may become more ingrained. The use of digital tools for remote collaboration may also rise.
Yet in the near term, having workers stay home could be devastating for some smaller businesses. Robert Luft, who runs a company in Cincinnati that installs technology in health care facilities and distribution centers, said an outbreak that prevented his technicians from showing up to work would put his business in a precarious situation.
"If it's unsafe for people to have them on site, that definitely impacts my business," Mr. Luft said. "Unfortunately there isn't any type of contingency plan."
Because Microsoft's employees in the Seattle region are supposed to work from home for several weeks, the company does not need as many services from the vendors whose workers staff its cafes, drive its shuttles and support other on-site needs. On Thursday, the company said it would continue to pay the 4,500 hourly employees who work in its facilities, even if they are needed for fewer hours.
At Facebook, the company has been working on contingency plans for the impact of the coronavirus since January. Executives have tried to walk the line of hewing closely to advice from public health officials while trying not to cause a panic among employees, two Facebook employees said.
The social network quickly canceled its participation in a half-dozen events -- from its annual F8 developer conference to its presence at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas -- and has worked to use its products to help health experts study the spread of the virus. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in a post this week that the company was giving unlimited free Facebook ads to the World Health Organization to distribute information to users.
When one of its contractors was found to have the virus on Wednesday, Facebook shut down two of its four offices in the Seattle area -- in Bellevue and Redmond -- for a deep cleaning, according to two employees.
An Amazon employee who was later found to have the virus had also separately visited one of Facebook's Seattle offices last month, prompting fresh concerns among employees. Facebook said it had carried out "targeted deep cleaning and enhanced sanitation measures" at the office building that the Amazon employee visited.
The company has also tried to keep its 44,000 employees sticking to business as usual. On Wednesday, it held a training session for managers on how to supervise teams of remote workers, the two employees said. And the social network was staying on course with a weekly question-and-answer session led by Mr. Zuckerberg on Thursday, which would be live streamed from Facebook's Silicon Valley headquarters.
Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, David Yaffe-Bellany from New York, and Karen Weise from Seattle. Reporting was contributed by Kate Conger, Michael Grynbaum, Michael Corkery, Geneva Abdul and Iliana Magra.

Texto completo: With "Untamed," the Momastery founder unpacks the many changes in her life since her previous two books, including her divorce from her husband and her marriage to the soccer star Abby Wambach.
Glennon Doyle has written two best sellers, raised over $ 25 million for people in need through her nonprofit Together Rising, considers Oprah a teacher and friend, and has more than 700,000 Facebook followers. But sometimes even she is a disappointment.
"I'm terrible at friendship maintenance," she said over breakfast last month at Manhattan's Whitby Hotel. "If you have a crisis, there's nothing I wouldn't do. If your dad died, if you need to write a eulogy, I'll drop everything. But then I will never call you; I'll never check in. I've spent a lot of time in shame about this, but I feel like I'm doing a good job with the mom thing and the work thing and a freshly good job with the partnering thing."
Friendship is among the many topics -- including sisterhood, body image, cheetahs (just go with it) and her efforts to better understand racism as a white woman -- covered by Doyle in her third memoir, "Untamed," coming out from The Dial Press on Tuesday. You may be wondering: Why a third memoir, particularly when the second, "Love Warrior," came out in 2016?
Doyle, 43, answers the question in the first sentence of "Untamed": "Four years ago, married to the father of my three children, I fell in love with a woman."
She was in Chicago, promoting "Love Warrior," which explores how she and her then-husband, Craig Melton, had recommitted to their marriage after he confessed to cheating on her multiple times. Her fans, many of them avid readers of her Christian parenting blog, Momastery, were counting the days until the book went on sale. Flatiron, her publisher, had announced a first printing of 150,000 copies, an extensive tour was in the works and "Love Warrior" was about to be named an Oprah's Book Club pick. Inconveniently, that was when she met Abby Wambach -- World Cup champion, Olympic gold medalist, former captain of the U.S. women's soccer team -- who was promoting her own memoir, "Forward."
"We couldn't have been a worse fit for each other," Wambach said in an interview. "Glennon had a husband and three children and lived in Naples, Fla. I'd been sober for a month, my marriage was falling apart, I'd just left my soccer career of 30 years and I lived in Portland, Ore."
"My whole being says, There She Is," Doyle writes in "Untamed" about their first interaction. "I ask if I can hug her because what if this is my only chance? She smiles and opens her arms. Then -- the smell that will become home to me -- skin like powder and fabric softener blended with the wool of her coat and her cologne and something that smelled like air, like outdoors, like crisp sky, like a baby and a woman and a man and the whole world."
How they navigated from that night to their wedding a year later is the central thread of "Untamed." Spoiler alert: The story appears to have a happy ending, or beginning. Wambach and Craig Melton have even played together on the same adult-league soccer team.
Of Melton's support of her relationship with his and Doyle's children, Wambach says, "It's a gift I don't know if I can repay -- probably the most selfless act of grace or love I've ever experienced."
In an interview, Melton said: "I've seen a lot of people in similar situations where the two exes put their egos first and the kids suffer. I wanted to be the best role model I could, knowing there was some damage that was my fault in the relationship."
Doyle grew up in Burke, Va., in a family with a strong tradition of putting words on paper. That she became a writer didn't surprise her younger sister, Amanda Doyle. "Glennon is the one everyone always went to when they needed to write their wedding vows or something important," she said.
Starting when her children were toddlers, Glennon Doyle sent daily email musings about recovery, faith, parenting and marriage to a handful of close friends. She'd follow up a few hours later to get their thoughts; most of the time, they hadn't had a chance to read her dispatch. In 2009, after a friend sent Doyle a website-building tutorial, she took the hint, and Momastery was born.
"The only reason my writing ever got out into the world was because my friends didn't want to read it anymore," Doyle said. "The very first time I wrote something and people I didn't know were like, 'Whoa, that's honest,' I felt a prickle at the back of my neck. I felt this 'we-ness."'
Whitney Frick, editorial director at The Dial Press, remembers reading the proposal for Doyle's first memoir, "Carry On, Warrior," as it came out of the printer, page by page. "I wasn't religious, wasn't married, hadn't had a baby," said Frick, who worked with Doyle at another publisher at the time, "but I could still relate to what Glennon was saying. I thought, 'I want that voice in my head!"'
Others do, too. "Lessons From the Mental Hospital," a TEDx talk by Doyle in 2013, the year that "Carry On, Warrior" came out, has been viewed more than three million times. Frick remembers 400 people showing up that year for one of Doyle's readings in Connecticut, and another at Books-a-Million near Doyle's Virginia hometown, where readers arrived hours in advance. "There was no stage or microphone," Frick said. "She climbed on a ladder, opened her arms and yelled, 'Hello, everyone!"'
It was around that time that Doyle was learning about her husband's infidelities. Reflecting on it in her new book, she writes: "The revelation of my husband's betrayal did not leave me feeling the despair of a wife with a broken heart. I was feeling the rage of a writer with a broken plot."
Writing "Untamed" came with its own struggles. Elizabeth Gilbert, a friend and the author of "Eat, Pray, Love," lent an ear and some critical feedback when Doyle shared an early draft.
"I started reading to Liz, and I'm watching her, and she's literally sinking deeper and deeper into the couch," Doyle said. "She was like, 'You're writing a book about wildness and you're not writing it wild."'
Gilbert suggested that Doyle cut out all the "connective tissue" and tell one personal story after another. "That's where Glennon shines, and that's what we all want from her -- intimate, funny, moving stories that will reflect light back on our own existence," Gilbert said.
Doyle said she writes from her scars, not her wounds. She has learned to give the events of her life some breathing room before pouring them onto the page or the screen. When she announced her relationship with Wambach on Instagram, the responses were swift, supportive and, considering they came mostly from strangers, surprisingly familiar. One follower wrote: "You are so brave to put your soul on social media. Wishing you all the love we all deserve." Another sent best wishes and a caveat: "This picture would suggest that you're using your hair straightener again and that concerns me. You have amazing hair and it should remain in its natural state."
Doyle's biggest fans have long known that her journey hasn't been without its bumps, but she discloses even more of them in "Untamed," including the turmoil she and her family went through ("Good mothers don't break their children's hearts to follow their own") after she fell in love with Wambach.
Will another seismic event disrupt the release of "Untamed"? "I'm kind of scared because something big usually happens," Doyle said. "This book is what I've been wanting to say since I was born. I've finally gotten to the point where what I want for the future is more of what I have. Not something different."

Texto completo: The discovery came during a weeklong lockdown at the Manhattan jail, which has faced scrutiny since the disgraced financier's suicide.
Federal investigators on Thursday found a loaded gun that had been smuggled into the Manhattan jail where the financier Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself last summer while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, officials said.
The discovery of the gun at the jail, the Metropolitan Correctional Center, came amid a weeklong lockdown that began with a tip that a firearm might have been "introduced" into the building, according to a statement from the federal Bureau of Prisons.
The gun was found in one of the jail's housing units, the bureau said. The Associated Press first reported the discovery.
The Metropolitan Correctional Center and other federal prisons across the United States have been dealing with rising levels of violence and other safety problems, including an influx of contraband.
The problems have coincided with a push by the Trump administration, in its quest to shrink the federal government, to curtail prison hiring, according to a 2018 investigation by The New York Times.
In at least one prison, The Times found, people regularly walked up to the double security fence in broad daylight, and, with no guards in sight, tossed weapons, drugs, cellphones and other items to inmates.
But a gun is a rare and unique threat.
The lockdown and ensuing search were part of the continuing fallout stemming from the suicide of Mr. Epstein in August, which touched off several inquiries and raised questions about why he had not been monitored more closely. (Lawyers for Mr. Epstein have challenged the New York City medical examiner's finding that his death was a suicide.)
In November, two jail workers who were on duty the night that Mr. Epstein killed himself were charged in a federal indictment with making false records and conspiracy to defraud the United States.
Rather than checking on Mr. Epstein every half-hour as they were supposed to, prosecutors said, the jail workers shopped and checked sports news online and slept at a desk not far from the cell where Mr. Epstein was being held. Despite failing to make their required rounds, they filed paperwork saying that they had, according to the indictment.
The lockdown that led to the discovery of the gun began on Feb. 27, the bureau said, with investigators turning up "numerous contraband items," including cellphones, narcotics and homemade weapons in the course of scouring the building.
"All of these items pose a significant threat to the safety and security of the facility, as well as the public," the bureau said.
It was unclear how the gun and other contraband had gotten into the jail, which houses about 700 inmates, many of whom are awaiting trial. Visitors and inmates are searched before entering the jail, must pass through metal detectors and are supposed to leave any personal items behind.
Although a gun was found, the bureau said the jail would remain on "modified operations status to finalize searches in all areas of the facility."
A criminal investigation has been opened into the contraband at the Manhattan jail and it will encompass an inquiry of staff members, according to two people familiar with the matter.
David Patton, the executive director of the Federal Defenders of New York, said that there had never been such a lengthy lockdown of the jail during his 20 years with the organization.
Mr. Patton said that in addition to other restrictions that had been imposed -- fewer hot meals and showers, for instance -- inmates at the jail were being denied access to lawyers and relatives in violation of their constitutional rights.
He acknowledged that the potential presence of a loaded gun in the jail was "obviously a serious issue," but said that rooting out contraband did not justify the conditions that inmates were being subjected to.
"They have to balance safety and security with providing humane conditions and access to lawyers and loved ones," he said.

Top Executive At JPMorgan Has Emergency Heart Surgery

Texto completo: Mr. Dimon is in recovery, and the bank will be run by two of its senior executives.
Jamie Dimon, the longtime chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, had an emergency medical procedure on his heart on Thursday, according to a memo sent to bank employees.
Mr. Dimon, 63, underwent successful heart surgery for an "acute aortic dissection," and he is recovering, said the memo, which was reviewed by The New York Times. He checked himself into a hospital Thursday morning after experiencing chest pains, according to a person familiar with the matter.
An aortic dissection occurs when blood forces its way into a tear in the aorta, the biggest artery in the body, separating its layers or peeling them apart. About two-thirds of people who have an aortic dissection are male, according to the American Heart Association, and those with high blood pressure or high cholesterol may be at greater risk.
While Mr. Dimon is out, the bank will be run by two senior JPMorgan executives, Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith, the memo said.
Mr. Dimon, who previously overcame cancer, is the longest-serving leader of a major American bank, having run the company since 2005. He has kept an iron grip on the job, weathering the 2008 financial crisis and a 2012 scandal in which a trader nicknamed the London Whale lost the bank more than $ 6 billion.
Under Mr. Dimon, the bank has grown to be the largest in the United States, with $ 2.6 trillion in assets and a habit of dominating its competitors, both in consumer banking and on Wall Street. Its profits have set records. Its customers make up a sizable chunk of the American population.
The bank has also paid tens of billions of dollars in fines for transgressions like mortgage lending abuses and weak controls against money laundering. And its booming business lending to the fossil fuel industry has made it a prime target for climate activists.
This isn't Mr. Dimon's first bout of ill health. In the summer of 2014, he announced that he had a "curable" form of throat cancer. He underwent chemotherapy, and did not step away from his duties. At the end of that year, he disclosed that a checkup had found no trace of the cancer.
The memo sent to employees on Thursday said Mr. Dimon's surgery had been successful. "He is awake, alert and recovering well," it said.
The chances of getting back to work after this type of surgery are "50-50," said Dr. Michael Mack, a heart surgeon and the chairman of Baylor Scott & White The Heart Hospital-Plano Research Center in Texas. One in five people who have the surgery can die within a month, he said.
It's unclear how long Mr. Dimon's recovery will take. He made Mr. Pinto, 57, and Mr. Smith, 61, co-presidents in 2018 and designated them as his emergency successors -- meaning they would take over if something happened to him -- while announcing his intention to stay on at JPMorgan's helm for five more years.
That timeline appeared to have lengthened recently. In January, when Mr. Dimon was asked whether he would step down in 2023, he replied, somewhat testily: "It's still five years."
Mr. Pinto has spent his entire career, more than 35 years, at the bank. Most recently, he ran its Wall Street business. Mr. Smith, who joined JPMorgan from American Express in 2007, is his consumer banking counterpart.
Recently, Mr. Dimon has elevated two women who are seen by insiders as potential successors down the road: Marianne Lake, the chief executive of JPMorgan's consumer lending business, who served for years as the bank's chief financial officer, and Jennifer Piepszak, now the chief financial officer, who formerly ran the bank's credit card business.
JPMorgan officials are always quick to offer the reminder that succession isn't really up to Mr. Dimon -- rather, it's up to the bank's board. But Mr. Dimon is the board's chairman, and his fellow directors hold him, and his vision for the bank's future, in high regard.
David Enrich and Gina Kolata contributed reporting.

Boeing's Problems Are a Lot Bigger Than He Feared

Texto completo: FLORISSANT, Mo. -- In his eight weeks on the job, Boeing's chief executive, David L. Calhoun, has come to one overriding conclusion: Things inside the aerospace giant were even worse than he had thought.
In a wide-ranging interview this week, Mr. Calhoun criticized his predecessor in blunt terms and said he was focused on transforming the internal culture of a company mired in crisis after two crashes killed 346 people.
To get Boeing back on track, Mr. Calhoun said, he is working to mend relationships with angry airlines, win back the confidence of international regulators and appease an anxious President Trump -- all while moving as quickly as possible to get the grounded 737 Max back in the air.
"It's more than I imagined it would be, honestly," Mr. Calhoun said, describing the problems he is confronting. "And it speaks to the weaknesses of our leadership."
Boeing's previous chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, was fired in December after presiding over a series of embarrassing setbacks that culminated in the shutdown of the 737 factory this year.
Mr. Calhoun formally took over in January, but he has been involved in this mess from the beginning. A protégé of Jack Welch from his time at General Electric, Mr. Calhoun has been on Boeing's board since 2009, and was elevated to chairman late last year.
Before becoming the chief executive, he vigorously defended Mr. Muilenburg, saying in a CNBC appearance in November that Mr. Muilenburg "has done everything right" and should not resign. One month later, the board ousted Mr. Muilenburg and announced Mr. Calhoun as his replacement.
"Boards are invested in their C.E.O.s until they're not," Mr. Calhoun said, sitting in a dim conference room at the Boeing Leadership Center, a corporate campus outside St. Louis where Mr. Muilenburg's photo is still displayed prominently.
"We had a backup plan," he added. "I am the backup plan."
Now that he's in charge, Mr. Calhoun has become more willing to openly criticize Mr. Muilenburg. He said the former chief executive had turbocharged Boeing's production rates before the supply chain was ready, a move that sent Boeing shares to an all-time high but compromised quality.
"I'll never be able to judge what motivated Dennis, whether it was a stock price that was going to continue to go up and up, or whether it was just beating the other guy to the next rate increase," he said. He added later, "If anybody ran over the rainbow for the pot of gold on stock, it would have been him."
Mr. Muilenburg declined to comment.
Mr. Calhoun and the rest of Boeing's board never seriously questioned that strategy, in part because before the first Max crash off the coast of Indonesia in October 2018, the company was enjoying its best run in years. What's more, the board believed that Mr. Muilenburg, an engineer who had been at Boeing for his entire career, was so deeply informed about the business that he was a good judge of the risks involved in ramping up production.
"If we were complacent in any way, maybe, maybe not, I don't know," Mr. Calhoun said. "We supported a C.E.O. who was willing and whose history would suggest that he might be really good at taking a few more risks."
It was only after the Max was grounded last March following a crash in Ethiopia that Mr. Muilenburg's optimistic approach became viewed as a liability. Airlines grew livid after he repeatedly voiced overly optimistic timetables about when the Max would return to service. The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Stephen Dickson, was so frustrated that he reprimanded Mr. Muilenburg in a private meeting and publicly told F.A.A. employees to resist pressure from the company.
"They felt like they were being pushed into a timeline," Mr. Calhoun said of the F.A.A., adding that the "regulator was never there alongside of us, but apparently our team didn't quite come up to grips with that."
One of Mr. Calhoun's initial tasks as chief executive was to go on an apology tour, holding a series of what he called "greet-and-mend opportunities." The first stop was the White House.
At a private meeting with Mr. Trump on Mr. Calhoun's third day on the job, the president told him that he liked Mr. Muilenburg but believed a leadership change had been needed. The president said he hoped Boeing was investing all of its resources into getting the plane back in the air.
"He wants us to get back on our horse," Mr. Calhoun said. "He wants us to get the Max flying again, safely."
Mr. Calhoun said he had recently asked Boeing employees to "lay out in gory detail what needed to be done" to get the plane certified. "And then when they told me exactly what that was, I added a day or two to it," he said.
His conclusion was that the Max might be approved sometime this summer, pushing back again the likely return of the plane by six months.
"Restoring credibility with the F.A.A. was not as hard as people think," he said. "They just didn't want to be boxed in anymore. They were sick of it."
While he has been contrite about damaging internal messages released in January, Mr. Calhoun stopped short of saying the company has systemic cultural problems. He called the messages, in which Boeing employees ridiculed the F.A.A. and denigrated their own colleagues, "totally unacceptable," but said they were not representative of Boeing more broadly.
"I see a couple of people who wrote horrible emails," he said.
He also delicately maneuvered between accepting responsibility for the two crashes and pointing the finger elsewhere.
When designing the Max, the company made a "fatal mistake" by assuming pilots would immediately counteract a failure of new software on the plane that played a role in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents. But he implied that the pilots from Indonesia and Ethiopia, "where pilots don't have anywhere near the experience that they have here in the U.S.," were part of the problem, too.
Asked whether he believed American pilots would have been able to handle a malfunction of the software, Mr. Calhoun asked to speak off the record. The New York Times declined to do so.
"Forget it," Mr. Calhoun then said. "You can guess the answer."
He dismissed concerns about the board's decision to give him a $ 7 million bonus based in part on whether the Max returned to service. "The objective is to get the Max up safely," he said. "Period."
When asked why he didn't elect to forgo his salary altogether, he said, "'Cause I'm not sure I would have done it."
Pulling Boeing out of the hole it has dug will take years, Mr. Calhoun said. He said that he would focus on insulating engineers from business pressures and that he wasn't done shaking up the company's leadership. At a meeting with his senior leadership team on Tuesday, Mr. Calhoun introduced a new set of values intended to guide the company, which he hopes will inspire employees still working on getting the 737 Max back in service.
"You don't just win this one," he said. "You don't just go out and fight and win and now you're a hero. One airplane at a time."
In the meantime, Mr. Calhoun is focused on the basics: producing jets at a pace the factory can handle, instilling discipline up and down the company, and hunting for bad news and acting on it.
"If I don't accomplish all that," he said, "then you can throw me out."

Texto completo: Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
'THE CROSSWORD SHOW WITH ZACH SHERWIN' at Caveat (March 7, 4 p.m.). Watch as three entertainers attempt to solve crossword puzzles in front of a live audience. Sherwin, who has contributed rhymes for "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend" on the CW, as well as for the popular YouTube series "Epic Rap Battles of History," not only created the puzzles for this event, but also provides raps and slide shows that elucidate and connect the clues. Sherwin's guest contestants this time around are Aparna Nancherla, Mike Brown and Jo Firestone.

'DAD' at the Jane Hotel (March 9, 8:30 p.m.). This monthly stand-up showcase is hosted by Alex English, Devon Walker and Gary Richardson in the ballroom of a West Village landmark. Pay no mind to the name: It's not about paternal instincts or dad jokes, just lineups packed with talent you've seen on TV or will want to soon enough. This month's bill features Bowen Yang from "Saturday Night Live," Dulcé Sloan from "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah," Matteo Lane and the Lucas Brothers.

'FROM ESTHER, TO HAMAN: A ROAST OF CANCELLED MEN' at Housing Works Bookstore Cafe & Bar (March 9, 7 p.m.). For the second straight year, the 92nd Street Y is celebrating Purim by heading downtown to SoHo and inviting women (and one Ha-Man) to make fun of toxic masculinity. Among the comedians performing is Kelly Bachman, who called out Harvey Weinstein when she saw him in the audience watching her perform last year. At 6 p.m., a Megillah reading precedes the show, while a Purim party follows it.

BERT KREISCHER at Beacon Theater (March 7, 7 and 9:30 p.m.). This comedian's exploits as a college student helped inspire the farcical movie "National Lampoon's Van Wilder." Now married with children, Kreischer has hosted multiple Travel Channel series, but with his preference to perform shirtless, he might seem like he's not all grown-up just yet. See for yourself on his Netflix special (he has a new one coming out later this month). A limited number of tickets remain for the New York City shows on his "Berty Boy" tour.

Texto completo: Legislation announced on Thursday aimed at curbing the spread of online child sexual abuse imagery would take the extraordinary step of removing legal protections for tech companies that fail to police the illegal content. A separate, international initiative that was also announced takes a softer approach, getting the industry to voluntarily embrace standards for combating the material.
The two measures come as tech companies continue to detect an explosion of abusive content on their platforms, and amid complaints that neither Congress nor the companies have been aggressive enough in stopping its spread. An investigation last year by The New York Times found that many companies knew about the problem but failed to quash it, despite having the tools to do so, and that the federal government had not been adequately enforcing a previous law meant to stem the abuse.
Multiple U.S. agencies, together with the governments of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, released a set of voluntary guidelines on how platforms can stop the spread of online child sexual abuse material, commonly referred to as child pornography. Those recommendations were developed in conjunction with a half-dozen tech companies: Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Roblox, Snap and Twitter.
The bipartisan legislation likewise calls for industry standards, and creates a strong incentive for companies to adopt them. The bill's sponsors, Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said it was spurred on by The Times investigation.
Despite some strong support, the bill faces opposition not only from the tech industry, which considers the reforms too broad, and a threat to its offering services like encryption, but also from some victim advocates who view it as too narrow an approach to combating harms online.
Last year, tech companies reported nearly 70 million images and videos related to online child exploitation. They are obligated to report the material when they become aware of it on their platforms, but they are not required to go looking for it. Companies are generally not responsible for content uploaded by their users, because of a 1990s-era provision in the law known as Section 230.
The new bill, called the EARN IT Act, would carve out an exception to that rule. Companies that don't follow the recommended standards would lose civil liability protections for that type of content. The legislation would also lower the bar for suing those tech firms.
The bill would create a 19-member commission -- including members representing law enforcement, the tech industry and child advocates -- to recommend a set of strategies: for instance, how to spot illegal material, categorize it in standardized ways and verify users' ages. These practices would be subject to approval by the Justice Department and other agencies, as well as Congress and the president.
In an interview, Mr. Blumenthal said the bill reflected the ideas that tech was no longer the fragile sector it was in the 1990s, and that the public would benefit from reasonable rules of the road.
"The industry received this sweetheart deal when they were in their infancy struggling to stay alive, and now they are these behemoths that have incredible impact on the lives of ordinary people," he said. "They have an obligation to the most vulnerable among us, mostly children who are criminally and cruelly abused, to take some action."
Mr. Graham said in a statement that it was vital to "put some guardrails on tech companies," while recognizing the benefits the industry had brought.
"Our goal," Mr. Graham said, "is to do this in a balanced way that doesn't overly inhibit innovation, but forcibly deals with child exploitation."
In November, as they were drafting the bill, a group of senators including Mr. Graham and Mr. Blumenthal asked 36 tech companies to provide details on their efforts to combat child exploitation. Mr. Blumenthal said he was surprised to learn that some of the most well-resourced companies, including Amazon, had not adopted even basic countermeasures.
Yiota Souras, general counsel of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the federally designated clearinghouse for child sexual abuse reports, which supports the bill, said the recommendations would raise the bar for tech companies.
"We, among everyone else, have witnessed the deficiencies that inconsistent practices in detecting, reporting and removing this material cause," Ms. Souras said.
The broad application of Section 230 is widely credited with allowing the modern internet to flourish. But some experts say that the law's effectiveness stems from its simplicity, and that carving out exceptions for certain types of content, as the bill does, will cause concerns.
"This won't be an easy bill to pass," said Paul Gallant, a technology policy analyst at Cowen, a financial services firm in Washington. "Everyone in Congress supports reducing child exploitation, but there's a broad recognition that these platforms and the American economy have benefited tremendously from lack of liability over user content."
Yet the bill's bipartisan support from two prominent senators does make it stand out, he said. "With Graham and Blumenthal leading the charge, it's as well positioned as I could imagine."
Elizabeth Banker, deputy general counsel at the Internet Association, a lobbying group whose members include Amazon, Facebook and Google, said Section 230 had benefited the industry by heading off litigation costs that could have hampered tech companies' ability to host and moderate user content.
The group currently opposes the bill.
"We have very strong concerns," said Michael Bloom, a senior vice president of the group, "that the EARN IT Act as introduced may impede existing industry efforts" to combat abuses online.
Some feel that a narrow exemption for child exploitation doesn't go far enough, and leaves out an array of other harmful online behavior, including terrorist content, defamation and the nonconsensual sharing of nude images, or "revenge porn."
"It's essentially saying there are some harms that we actually do take seriously and others that we don't," said Mary Anne Franks, professor at the University of Miami School of Law and president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit group dedicated to combating online abuse.
Previous leaked drafts of the bill prompted concern within the tech industry and among some privacy experts that the commission's recommendations could prevent companies from offering encrypted services.
The American Civil Liberties Union and the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity jointly opposed the bill on Thursday, cautioning that it could be used to outlaw encryption.
Encryption would greatly reduce a company's ability to detect the illegal activity, and has become a flash point in light of Facebook's decision to soon encrypt its Messenger app, which is responsible for millions of reports a year.
Mr. Blumenthal said that the commission was specifically designed to include voices from the tech industry with experience in cryptography and information security.
"We have leaned over backward to make sure they are represented," he said.
The two measures are the latest in a series of initiatives aimed at combating online child exploitation, including a more-stringent reporting process for tech companies, calls for increased law enforcement funding and a review of the federal government's response to the problem.
The voluntary guidelines announced on Thursday were described by Attorney General William P. Barr as a "historic event" in the fight against "one of the most horrendous crimes impacting some of the most vulnerable members of society." They have been in development since last July, when representatives from the five countries met with the six tech companies.
The guidelines aim to tackle not only illegal images but also more complex threats such as live-streaming and grooming. The WeProtect Global Alliance, a child protection organization with ties to the British government, will work with the six tech companies involved in the initiative to encourage adoption of the guidelines throughout the industry.
"We must ensure these 'voluntary principles' don't remain just that," said WeProtect's founder, Baroness Joanna Shield.
In Washington, The EARN IT Act's sponsors are hopeful that they can bring quick action on the bill; a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled for next week.
"I don't want to look around 14 years from now and say, 'We could have stopped the abject destruction of the lives of children,"' Mr. Blumenthal said. "If we're going to come together on anything, it ought to be protecting our most vulnerable against these heinously brutal criminal practices."

Texto completo: Stay home from work if you get sick. See a doctor. Use a separate bathroom from the people you live with. Prepare for schools to close and to work from home.
These are measures the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended to slow a coronavirus outbreak in the United States.
Yet, these are much easier to do for certain people - in particular, high-earning professionals.
Service industry workers - like those in restaurants, retail, child care and the gig economy - are much less likely to have paid sick days, the ability to work remotely or employer-provided health insurance.
The disparity could make the new coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness known as COVID-19, harder to contain in the U.S. than in other rich countries that have universal benefits like health care and sick leave, experts say.
A large segment of workers are not able to stay home, and many of them work in jobs that include high contact with other people. It could also mean that low-income workers are hit harder by the virus.
"Very quickly, it's going to circulate a lot faster in the poorer communities than the wealthiest ones," said Dr. James Hadler, an epidemiologist who was Connecticut's public health director and now is a consultant to the state. His work has found that influenza infections tend to strike low-income neighborhoods more aggressively than affluent ones and that poor families are more likely to live in close quarters with others and share bathrooms.
Unequal access to precautionary measures cuts along the same lines that divide the U.S. in other ways: income, education and race.
"It's definitely an equity issue," said Alex Baptiste, policy counsel for workplace programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group. "You have not just an economic disparity but also a racial disparity between who has that access and can take care of themselves and their families."
Portia Green, 33, is a restaurant worker in New York. She has no paid sick leave or health insurance. If schools closed, as a single mother she'd have no child care.
A day off work means losing around $100 in pay, she said, and if she had to take more than a few days off, losing her job. The restaurants she has worked for are too understaffed to call in backup workers easily, she said, and the expectation is that you show up unless you're "green."
"They're going to push you to do it anyway," said Green, who is a member of Restaurant Opportunities Centers United in New York, an advocacy group. "You go to work, pop a vitamin C and if you can do it, you do it."
The biggest disparity for workers is access to health care: In the U.S., some 27.5 million people lack any form of health insurance. That makes them less likely to seek medical care when they become ill or to have access to preventive health benefits that can help them stave off illness. The uninsured are disproportionately low income.
Workers also have unequal access to remote working. The government recommended that people work from home in a coronavirus outbreak, but just 29% of American workers can do so, according to Labor Department data. They are most likely to be highly educated and high earners.
On an average day, 35% of the highest earners and 8% of the lowest earners spend some time working from home. Managers and professionals are most likely to do so, and service industry and construction workers least likely. Nearly half of workers with a graduate degree do some of their work from home, as do a third of those with a college degree. Just 12% of those who didn't attend college work from home.

Developed surgical method to feed those who can't eat, saving millions of lives

Texto completo: Stanley J. Dudrick, whose research into hospital nutrition transformed modern surgery, helping save millions of malnourished and critically ill patients who relied on his intravenous feeding technique to eat, died Jan. 18 at his home in Eaton, N.H. He was 84.
The cause was complications from kidney failure and other health problems, said his son Stanley Dudrick.
Dr. Dudrick was among the United States' most accomplished surgeons, known for almost single-handedly pioneering a way to nurse starving infants back to health, feed adults who are unable to eat normally and nourish patients after major surgeries.
Over a half-century career in medicine, he also taught tens of thousands of medical students and chaired surgery departments at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston, the University of Pennsylvania and two Yale-affiliated hospitals.
But he was best known for developing the feeding method known as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), a once-unthinkable breakthrough in which patients obtain all the nutrients they need - including proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals and vitamins - through a vein near the heart.
The technique, also known as intravenous hyperalimentation, bypasses the gut and has proved indispensable to newborns and adults suffering from severe burns or struggling with chronic bowel disorders. "I think it was one of the most dramatic advances in medicine ever," said Walter Longo, chief of colon and rectal surgery at Yale School of Medicine. "I'm very surprised he didn't win the Nobel Prize."
Echoing those comments, retired physician and University of Illinois College of Medicine professor Barry A. Mizock ranked TPN alongside more "glamorous" achievements such as open-heart surgery. "There are people with short bowel syndrome, who have lost a large portion of their small intestine, who would otherwise die," he said.
Dr. Dudrick's invention was all the more remarkable given that it came at the outset of his career. Raised in a Pennsylvania coal-mining family, he had turned toward medicine at age 7, after a doctor cured his mother's life-threatening fever, and graduated from Penn's medical school with top marks, remaining there for his surgical residency.
During one trying weekend in 1961, he lost three patients and came close to abandoning surgery altogether. "When they died, a piece of me died," he told a Misericordia University interviewer in 2012. "In addition to my feeling inadequate personally, I got to thinking that there's something deficient in the way we take care of seriously ill or injured patients surgically. You could do great operations, but many of the patients still died."
His mentor, Jonathan E. Rhoads, had been obsessed with the issue of surgical nutrition and encouraged Dr. Dudrick to pursue a comprehensive intravenous feeding technique, then considered little more than a pipe dream. "Even if it were possible, it would be impractical; and even if it were practical, it would be unaffordable," Dr. Dudrick once said, recalling the skepticism of his peers.
Among other problems, a high concentration of nutrients could cause a vein to collapse or become infected, and the dosage could lead to blood sugar problems, according to Longo. But after five years of work, Dr. Dudrick found a way to feed beagle puppies entirely by vein, resulting in six grown dogs - including a beloved pup known as Stinky - that were comparable in size to those fed normally.
That success was followed by a 1968 article in which Dr. Dudrick and his team reported that they had used TPN to support a human baby with a fatal bowel deformity, after testing the procedure on adult patients. Hospitals began adopting the method, albeit slowly at first, with heavy skepticism from some physicians who objected to its use in ailing infants who risked spending their lives in a sickbed.
A 1983 report in the New York Times described one baby receiving TPN as "a hostage to medicine," and quoted a Columbia University pediatrician who called the procedure "a horrible experiment."
"We're dealing with an evolving medical science," Dr. Dudrick said in response to the criticism. "As we go along, we modify things and learn. But to deny TPN to a child unless there is absolutely no hope is simply unethical. It is letting a child starve to death."
In time, the flood gates opened. According to a 2015 article in the American Surgeon, a monthly medical journal, the mortality rate in post-surgical cases dropped to nearly 5 percent - from 40 to 60 percent - as a result of TPN. A 2015 newsletter from the American College of Surgeons credited the technique with having "saved well over ten million patients from succumbing to their disease."
Like Jonas Salk with the polio vaccine, Dr. Dudrick never patented his technique or sought to make money from it. Instead, he told People magazine, he wanted simply "to leave something better behind when I go, rather than just practice medicine the way it has always been done."
The first of four children, Stanley John Dudrick was born in Nanticoke, Pa., on April 9, 1935. His grandfather was a Polish immigrant who found mining work only after agreeing to an exacting condition: that all of his sons, including Dr. Dudrick's father, "work at the mines for free until age 18," according to the American College of Surgeons.
Dr. Dudrick's father later worked as an insurance agent, in addition to assembling B-29 bomber wings during World War II and enlisting his eldest son's help in building houses and repairing cars - technical work that may have contributed to Dr. Dudrick's decision to become a surgeon.
He received a bachelor's degree in biology from Franklin & Marshall College in 1957 and graduated from medical school at the University of Pennsylvania in 1961, later joining the faculty at what is now the Perelman School of Medicine.
Dr. Dudrick spent most of the 1970s in Houston, at what is now McGovern Medical School, and went on to teach at Yale University, the Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine in Pennsylvania and Misericordia, a Catholic university in Dallas, Pa., where he served as founding medical director of a physician assistant program. He also co-founded the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) in 1975 and was its first president.
Survivors include his wife of 61 years, the former Theresa Keen; six children; a brother and sister; 16 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.
Dr. Dudrick stepped away from daily surgery in recent years but remained involved in medicine as a teacher, mentor and researcher, to the surprise of some colleagues.
"I get frustrated at times by the attitude among many of my fellow human beings who question why I am still pushing," he said in the 2012 Misericordia interview. " 'What you did was great. Wasn't that enough?' They have a hard time understanding that I am not happy enough with the way things are.
"I would like to see health care and education continue to progress and advance," he continued. "What drives me is the philosophy of Benjamin Franklin, which is to work every day to discover and produce new, useful knowledge. I'm addicted to the basic concept of producing new knowledge overall, but especially if we can make it useful and relevant to maximally improve the human condition."

Texto completo: Call me a gender traitor, but I think that maybe the reason Elizabeth Warren didn't win the Democratic nomination is simply that Democratic voters had good reason to prefer someone else.
There were good reasons to prefer her, too. I was not a fan of Warren's, but I felt my eyes getting a little misty when I read her remarks as she ended her campaign Thursday morning. "You know, I used to hate goodbyes," she said. "Whenever I taught my last class or when we moved to a new city, those final goodbyes used to wrench my heart. But then I realized that there is no goodbye for much of what we do."
"When I left one place," she continued, "I took everything I'd learned before and all the good ideas that were tucked into my brain and all the good friends that were tucked in my heart, and I brought it all forward with me - and it became part of what I did next."
This is Elizabeth Warren at her best. She has a way with words and indeed was by far the best debater, or public speaker, in the Democratic field. When she talks, it sounds as though she's streaming direct from her heart, even when she's discussing some abstract financial rule. Add to this her formidable academic credentials, and you can see why many people were inspired by her candidacy - particularly those who have such credentials themselves.
Maybe it's not surprising, either, that so many of those people believed in her so hard that they can't believe anyone else wouldn't, unless there was something deeply wrong with them.
As Warren's campaign grew steadily less plausible, my social media feeds exploded with women lamenting that we're still second-class citizens, denied the top jobs in favor of less-qualified men. Warren herself leaned into this contention, talking of "all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years" to see a woman in the Oval Office.
I am on record saying that sexism toward women in prominent positions is real, and toxic. But before we indict the patriarchy for the demise of Warren's campaign, let's consider the other reasons voters might have preferred someone else. Such as the fact that, for all her protestations of being "capitalist to my bones," she was well to the left of most of the voters who opted for Joe Biden. She was promising massive wealth taxes, restructuring corporations to give the workers more control and a Medicare-for-all system that would have gotten rid of private insurance and cost the federal government tens of trillions of dollars over the next decade. She was also leaning more heavily into broad-spectrum identity politics than any other candidate.
Now maybe, in their heart of hearts, many of the people who found her too extreme actually wanted their president to upend the whole capitalist system rather than reupholster it. Maybe they were just too afraid to take a risk on a more radical agenda with President Trump on the other party's ticket. But plenty of voters I've spoken to were making that calculation about Bernie Sanders, too.
Other voters found Warren insufficiently progressive. They sensed, correctly, that her commitment to Medicare-for-all had been strategic, rather than a longtime obsession, and that she would not be very energetic about pursuing it once in office. They viewed her, also correctly, as a creature of the elite professional class and feared she would never be willing to take on that powerful group that has been so very successful in erecting a lot of barriers to income mobility for others. At campaign rallies, the phrase I heard most often from these people was "flip-flop."
Which is not to say I haven't heard potentially gendered language that people complained about when they heard it applied to Hillary Clinton - "shrill," "unlikable" or any of the rest of it. But I didn't hear it on the campaign trail, even at Sanders rallies. What I did hear, a lot was, "It's time we had a woman as president."
Which should remind us that though women undoubtedly suffer discrimination for their gender, they also get some benefits, particularly in a Democratic primary. This is, after all, the party that nominated Clinton last time around. I met a lot of women, and not just a few men, who were choosing between Warren and Amy Klobuchar, full stop. The New York Times endorsed them both, and obviously not only because of their policy positions, which were about as far apart as it was possible to be while still running for the Democratic nomination.
Ending sexism should mean that a less qualified man doesn't beat a more qualified woman - but "qualifications" is a term that encompasses a lot of values. Only one person can be president, which means you can have many fine qualities and still not be quite what the majority of voters are looking for. Those voters are not obligated to pick the woman anyway just to prove a point.

Texto completo: After death of her father, skier could be back on slopes as early as next week
Mikaela Shiffrin long has been open about the mental hurdles and psychological barriers she has had to navigate en route to becoming the best skier on the planet. As she prepares to return to competition next week following the death of her father, she knows grief will accompany her on every race.
"A lot of people have asked how we are doing and where we are in the grieving process," Shiffrin said in a video shared on social media Thursday. "The truth is we haven't really even started. . . . Accepting this new reality is going to take a long time."
In the 6 1/2 -minute video, the 24-year-old skier is seated under a photo of her father and reading a prepared statement, thanking fans for their support. She announced that she is headed back to Europe and hasn't ruled out returning to racing this season. Her agent, Kilian Albrecht, told The Washington Post she intends to compete at a World Cup event that begins next week in Sweden.
"There is no doubt that we are broken, and it will take a long time to pick the pieces up and put them together," Shiffrin said in the video. "They won't fit together as they did before, but, maybe like a piece of Kintsugi art, we will still be able to find beauty in our lives."
Jeff Shiffrin died Feb. 2 from a head injury suffered in an accident at the family's home. Shiffrin was halfway across the world when she received the news and immediately returned to Colorado. She hasn't raced since Jan. 26.
"As far as racing goes, I am flying to Scandinavia today," she said in the video. "I have no promises if I'll actually be able to race. I don't really even have goals. Anytime the topic of winning would come up in the conversation with my dad, he would always say, 'But did you make any good turns?' That's sort of the basis of our family's entire philosophy. So I guess that would be my goal: I just want to make a few good turns. I think that would make him happy."
Though Shiffrin was noncommittal on her return in the video, the New York Times first reported that she plans to compete in Are, Sweden, on March 12-14. Her mother, Eileen, is accompanying her on the trip. The World Cup finals are scheduled for one week later in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, though organizers there are still considering their options in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
Shiffrin, winner of the past three World Cup overall titles, was in the midst of another dominant season when she left the race circuit last month. She was leading the World Cup standings by 370 points, though she now trails Italy's Federica Brignone by 153.
Shiffrin said she has done some training in recent weeks but called it a "slow process."
"I have struggled with being able to maintain my focus as long as I normally can. But it's been therapeutic to be on the mountain, maybe even healing," Shiffrin said. "I've found training to be a place where I can feel closer to my dad, yet it provides enough of a distraction so that feeling of closeness can be separated from the pain."

Trump Administration to Send 500 ICE Agents to Aid Sanctuary City Arrests; Move follows deployment of 100 Customs and Border Protection personnel to support operation targeting illegal immigrants

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is ramping up its enforcement efforts in 10 sanctuary cities, redeploying 500 investigators to increase surveillance and help arrest people living in the country illegally.
These highly trained agents, who typically work on complex long-term investigations, have been reassigned by ICE leadership to assist in the operation, set to run through the end of the year in cities that decline to assist in federal immigration enforcement, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, a law-enforcement agency within ICE, began to be pulled off active investigations at the Justice Department in the past week—including those focusing on human-trafficking, child pornography and cybercrime cases—and redeployed to the initiative.
The redeployment was first reported by the New York Times.
The shift comes just weeks after a separate decision to temporarily redeploy 100 officers and agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including several tactical border patrol units, to assist with the arrest operation.
Henry Lucero, who heads Enforcement and Removal Operations, the ICE arm that carries out deportations, said the need for increased personnel to arrest immigrants in sanctuary communities is a direct response to policies preventing local officials from notifying ICE when they plan to release unauthorized immigrants from law-enforcement custody.
"We've asked for resources in some areas because there's a significant backlog of criminal aliens that we're not able to address," Mr. Lucero said. "If we had local cooperation in those areas, we wouldn't need resources there. We would just be assuming custody of those aliens when they're released from jail or prison."
ICE's arrest efforts have been stymied in recent years by uncooperative police agencies and by immigration advocates' efforts to inform people about their rights in such situations. Because ICE officers can't enter a home without a warrant, the agency has adopted other tactics, such as surveilling homes until people they targets exit and can be arrested on the street.
Mr. Lucero, who declined to discuss details of the operation, said communities should expect more round-the-clock surveillance as a result of stepped-up enforcement.
"It's fair to say there's more surveillance when there's more resources," he said.
President Trump has long criticized sanctuary jurisdictions, saying they protect criminals who endanger Americans and should be deported. His position on the issue is popular with his supporters, and he cites it frequently on the campaign trail.
Sanctuary jurisdictions—cities and states that restrain their law-enforcement officials' ability to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement—argue that the administration's focus on them is discriminatory and that greater coordination with ICE would discourage immigrants from working with local law-enforcement, making their communities less safe.
The dispute between these jurisdictions and the Trump administration has escalated in recent months. ICE has issued subpoenas against local law-enforcement agencies refusing to turn over information about unauthorized immigrants in their custody. The agency has also sued several states for policies impeding its efforts, such as a California law banning for-profit ICE detention centers from operating in that state.
Last month, the Department of Homeland Security took the unusual step of banning New Yorkers from enrolling in expedited travel programs including Global Entry in response to the state's "green-light" law, which shields state driver's-license records from federal immigration authorities. State officials decried the move as a politically punitive measure by the Republican White House targeting an overwhelmingly Democratic state, a characterization DHS officials rejected.
The renewed focus on sanctuary cities comes as border crossings—which became the Trump administration's singular focus last year—have remained low since the fall, freeing up officials to pursue tougher enforcement elsewhere.
On Thursday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced that unauthorized border crossings rose slightly in February from the prior month to 30,068, ending eight straight months of declines. The monthly number is still far lower than where it stood a year ago, when monthly numbers were on pace to hit a 12-year high.
As the number of people crossing the border illegally has dropped dramatically since a peak last spring, the makeup of the groups crossing has also changed, with single adults now comprising the majority. That group is also the easiest for the government to manage, from detention to deportation.

Texto completo: The Palm Beach Book Festival usually makes news for the distinguished writers it brings to town for readings and literary conversations. This year, it’s making news for the authors who aren’t coming.
Two controversial novelists — “American Dirt” author Jeanine Cummins and “My Dark Vanessa” author Kate Elizabeth Russell — will not appear at the festival scheduled for March 21 at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton.
Festival founder and creative director Lois Cahall decided to pull Cummins from the event last week after consulting with publisher Flatiron Books, a division of Macmillan. The move follows the publisher’s cancellation in January of Cummins’ book tour, which included an appearance at the Palm Beach Book Store, citing safety concerns.
Cummins’ best-selling novel, for which she reportedly received a seven-figure advance, tells the story of a Mexican mother and her young son fleeing to the United States after a drug-related massacre.
But the Oprah Book Club pick has been attacked by Latinx activists, who cite it as an example of the publishing industry’s bias toward white writers. They have faulted it for stereotypical portrayals and inaccuracies
A letter signed by 142 writers asking Oprah Winfrey to withdraw the pick was published in January on Literary Hub. Winfrey taped an episode devoted to a discussion of the book this month that’s set to air in March as part of her new Apple TV+ series “Oprah’s Book Club.”
The publisher “decided to hold out with us for as long as we could,” Cahall wrote via e-mail. “Despite our support of her beautifully written prose, circumstances have not improved for Jeanine. As a result we’ve decided it’s in the best interest of our patrons’ safety, the author’s safety and the university’s reputation to cancel her scheduled appearance.”
“My Dark Vanessa” author Russell, also said to have received a seven-figure advance for her novel, bowed out after Latinx writer Wendy Ortiz implied in a tweet that Russell had plagiarized Ortiz’s memoir “Excavation,” even though Ortiz hadn’t yet read the book.
Even with those cancellations, the festival is rolling out an impressive slate of name writers, publishing industry figures and celebrity panelists.
Among them will be Mark Thompson, president and chief executive officer of
The New York Times Co.; MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid; humorist Patricia Marx, a former writer for Saturday Night Live and a contributor to The New Yorker; and Larry Loftis, author of nonfiction spy thrillers such as “Code Name: Lise - The True Story of the Woman Who Became WWII’s Most Highly Decorated Spy.”
Added to the lineup is Kiley Reid. Her debut novel, “Such a Fun Age,” was greeted with much fanfare.
The novel is a contemporary social satire about race relations in the United States. In the book, Alix, an affluent white woman who makes her living as an online influencer, takes up the cause of Emira, a young black woman who babysits Alix’s daughters, after Emira is wrongly accused of kidnapping the children by an upscale grocery store security guard.
The book’s many kudos include being picked as a best book in January by The New York Times, Kirkus Reviews and O, The Oprah Magazine.
Without Cummins and Russell, The Oprah Magazine Book panel will go forward with writers Liz Moore, author of the novel “Long Bright River,” and Reid, a political analyst at MSNC and host of AM Joy. The panel is moderated by Leigh Haber, who curates the magazine’s book picks and chose the panelists.
Also on the festival schedule:
Twisted History (Spies, Lies and Lovers): Loftis will join historical thriller writer Louis Bayard.
You Don’t Have to be Jewish (To Love this Panel): A conversation between Marx and Cathleen Schine, whose books include “The Love Letter” and “They May Not Mean To, But They Do.”
Protest and Power: US, UK and #Real fake news, too: Thompson will moderate a discussion with authors Reid and David Kogan, a writer and broadcaster on British and international politics.
Reid’s latest book is “The Man Who Sold America: Trump and the Unraveling of the American Story.” Kogan is the author of “Protest and Power: The Battle for the Labour Party.”
The festival will be held at the University Theatre at Florida Atlantic University, 777 Glades Road, Boca Raton. For information call 561-297-2595 or visit palmbeachbookfestival.com.

Texto completo: Be prepared, not panicked.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham repeated that phrase like a mantra when describing how she and health officials are doing all they can to ensure the state is ready to tackle a coronavirus outbreak and minimize its spread.
"We are working diligently to prevent having cases here," Lujan Grisham told reporters Wednesday as she was signing health care-related bills into law. "We also want to be realistic. When you have an infectious disease of this nature - this virus - in the neighboring states, the likelihood is that all states in the country will be affected in some way."
Both Texas and Arizona have confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus. An outbreak on the West Coast led the state epidemiologist to say the virus was likely to spread to New Mexico.
As of Wednesday, the U.S. had more than 150 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 16 states affected, according to the New York Times. Ten people have died in Washington state and one in California.
New Mexico still has zero reported cases and only two tests have been conducted for the virus, Lujan Grisham said. One patient tested negative and the other is awaiting results.
The state Department of Health created a lab in Albuquerque to conduct coronavirus tests so it could have more control setting criteria for the testing, State Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Landen said earlier this week. Before that, hospitals and the state health agency had to follow strict guidelines set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because of limited test kits.
Lujan Grisham said she spoke this week with Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the U.S. coronavirus task force.
She learned the federal government will reimburse states for screening and testing patients and, upon request, will supply respirators and other equipment for infectious disease control.
"We are working diligently with the feds to make sure if we need more [equipment], we have access to more," Lujan Grisham said. "That's part of being prepared. To say today, that under the worst possible circumstances, we would have everything at our fingertips that we need."
All states are required to have an infectious disease plan, Lujan Grisham said. That includes supplying medical providers with the proper guidelines and working with hospitals to ensure they have enough beds to accommodate a serious outbreak, she said.
Health officials run through tabletop drills to practice responding to various outbreak scenarios, she said.
New Mexico began preparing for the coronavirus sooner than many states, Lujan Grisham said. New Mexico also has the advantage of a centralized health authority to offer guidance on screening, testing and prevention, unlike larger states such as New York, where protocols can vary in each county, causing complications, she said.
It's important to disseminate public health messages, including on the state website, and handle the threat with a science-based response, Lujan Grisham said. Basic safeguards such as washing your hands regularly and staying home if sick should be emphasized, she said.
"All we can do is plan for it," Lujan Grisham said. "You provide good meaningful information and hope that we don't have continued, widespread transmission of this virus."

Will we always be this way?

Texto completo: "The people do not want war!"
These were the words that did it, that knocked the composure out of me. I was standing at what felt like the heart of Chicago on a January afternoon, corner of Wabash and Wacker, next to the river and beneath the tower known as Trump. The crowd had swelled by this time to nearly a thousand.
I kept looking up at the letters. They were two stories high: TRUMP. Smugly in command of God knows what - the whole world? As their presence became ever more unbearable, the speaker's words suddenly pulled me back into the present moment. They put the matter as simply as possible. They were what brought us all down here, clustered together in the bitter wind: THE PEOPLE DO NOT WANT WAR.
There was no "unless" attached to this statement. The raw simplicity tore me open. I burst into tears as the wind cut through me.
This was Jan. 4. It was one of 70 protests across the country the day after Trump ordered a drone strike that "took out" (as the media love to put it) Iranian Major Gen. Qassim Soleimani as he was leaving the Baghdad airport in a two-car convoy. Some dozen people were killed in total. It was, as the world grasped in stunned disbelief, an act of war.
And the mainstream analysis that has spun into motion since the drone strike has mostly been a strategic rolling of the eyeballs. Soleimani was a bad guy, but what did the president think he was accomplishing? A New York Times editorial, for instance, quoted Trump's bellicose post-strike tweet, in which he warned Iran not to retaliate or the U.S. would start bombing the country's revered cultural icons, then asked:
Why was Mr. Trump's threat on Twitter even necessary? Wasn't the death of General Soleimani supposed to have stopped the threats the president now claims America still faces? . . . Killing General Soleimani seems to have deterred and de-escalated nothing. Otherwise, why would the State Department have needed to advise all Americans to leave Iraq?
War is a complex game of strategy and tactics, politics and "interests," but here's what the analysts and commentators usually forget to acknowledge: War begins with a moral compromise of incalculable proportions. It requires participants to dehumanize a designated enemy and commit mayhem and murder. It requires them to set their conscience - their soul - aside and do what they're told, in the name of strategy, tactics and victory. And war always creates consequences well beyond the imaginations of its planners.
It is, ahem . . . hell. This is not a metaphor.
For instance, Kathy Kelly of Voices for Creative Nonviolence, my friend and peace activist extraordinaire, who was one of the speakers at the rally, spoke of a boy she learned about when she was in Iraq in 2003, during the U.S. shock-and-awe bombing campaign. The boy not only lost the rest of his family in one of the bombing raids, he was so badly injured that a surgeon had to remove both of the boy's arms at his shoulders. When the boy awoke from the surgery, so Kathy was later told, he was so bewildered he asked, "Will I always be this way?"
Kathy then threw the question out to the world, asking: "Will we always be this way?"
This puts the question of war in its appropriate context: the context of manmade hell. Whether it is justified or unjustified, necessary or unnecessary, war from the perspective of its victims is hell. And an indispensable part of the global war machine is public relations, glorifying and justifying the violence committed by one side and relegating evil only to the actions of the enemy.
Thus, even as the Times editorial board questioned the credibility and perhaps the sanity of the Trump administration's act of war (and impeachment diversion tactic), it remembered to describe Soleimani as "one of the region's most powerful and, yes, bloodsoaked military commanders." No doubt. But for some reason the Times forgot to acknowledge the blood on the hands of the country Trump represents: the millions of people it has killed, maimed and displaced, the eco-devastation it has unleashed, over the last two and a half centuries (or simply the last two decades).
So I leave that to Brett Wilkins, who points out that "the U.S. has exponentially more blood on its hands than Iran," noting that it has attacked or invaded no fewer than 22 countries since World War II. He writes:
"Perhaps this sanguinary legacy is why, in survey after international survey, the United States is perennially voted the world's greatest threat to peace in most of the world's nations. After Soleimani's assassination, Trump boasted that 'his bloody rampage is forever gone.' If only the same were true of Trump. . . ."
And then there's the racism of American militarism, so discreetly unnoticed by the mainstream media, which the late George Carlin blew open three decades ago, in the wake of the first Gulf War, in a standup routine on HBO called "Rockets and Penises in the Persian Gulf." Rep. Ilhan Omar shared a clip on Twitter a few days ago.
Carlin laments the country's vanishing jobs and increasing ineptness: "Can't build a decent car . . . can't educate our young people, can't get health care to our old people, but we can bomb the shit out of your country all right! Huh? Especially if your country is full of brown people - oh we like that don't we? That's our hobby! That's our new job in the world: bombing brown people. Iraq, Panama, Grenada, Libya, you got some brown people in your country, tell them to watch the fuck out or we'll goddamn bomb them!"
And now, before I can even finish this column, the war has escalated. What will happen next is unknown. I cling to the essence of my revelation, that people do not want war. That is to say, they don't want the moral compromise - the moral disconnect - of murdered or armless children present in their consciences. They don't believe that victory is worth the price of hell.
At the rally, I felt a possible future emerging. Then the moment passed. I wiped the tears from my eyes. The people do not want war, but right now we have almost no say in the matter. A future without war will not be an easy birth. We must continue learning how to become a democracy.

Texto completo: Gov. Steve Bullock is poised to run for the Senate, the New York Times reported Wednesday, which would pit him up against incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines as Monday's filing deadline approaches.
The Times cited three anonymous Democratic officials, who said such a decision would provide a coveted recruit who could help reclaim a Democratic majority in the Senate.
Bullock has repeatedly said he would not run for the Senate, however, he has been prodded by former President Barack Obama and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to change his mind.
He cannot seek re-election to governor due to term limits. He ran for president last year.
The New York Times said a Daines-Bullock battle would be one of the "marquee Senate races of 2020."
Bullock, 53, declined to tell Times' reporter Jonathan Martin whether he would run. The Democratic officials spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Bullock was in Southern California on Wednesday, at an event titled "Shoot with the Stars Under the Big Sky," where he and the Montana Ambassadors were to meet with film industry representatives to pitch Montana as a good location for filming movies, television and commercials. The ambassadors are a volunteer, not-for-profit group made up of people advocating doing business in Montana.
The online news website, Politico, reported Wednesday that Democrats are "increasingly optimistic" Bullock will run for the Senate seat.
Trump tweeted his support Wednesday for Daines, who met with the president last week at the White House.
"The great people of Montana can have no better VOICE than Senator @SteveDaines," the president tweeted. The Associated Press noted he warned: "Whoever the Democrat nominee may be, please understand that I will be working hard with Steve all the way."
Don Kaltschmidt, chair of the Montana Republican Party, said Bullock "stands with the radical left in support of a complete government takeover of health care, sanctuary cities, gun bans, and removing President Trump from office." He said Republicans were "proud that Sen. Daines stands with the people of Montana" and works with Trump.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee issued a statement as well:
"Succumbing to overtures from national Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama, Steve Bullock is giving a foolish senate run another look," NRSC spokesman Nathan Brand said via email. "Whether it's his support for removing President Trump from office, banning guns, or allowing a top staffer to prey on women, Bullock lacks the character and values Montanans expect from a senator."
In the U.S. Senate race, Democrats Wilmot Collins of Helena, Mike Knoles of Bozeman, John Mues of Loma and Cora Neumann of Bozeman have filed with the secretary of state's office as well as Republican Daniel R. Larson of Stevensville. Daines filed for re-election Friday.
The primary is June 2 and the general election is Nov. 3.

This is not what democracy looks like

Texto completo: Hervis Rogers waited. And waited. And waited.
As light melted into darkness, he stood in line at Texas Southern University, a historically black college in Houston, for more than six hours to exercise his constitutional right to vote.
By the time he cast his Super Tuesday ballot, it was Wednesday morning.
“I figured I it was my duty to vote. I wanted to get my vote in to voice my opinion. And I wasn't going to let nothing stop me. So I waited it out," Rogers told CNN. Asked why he stayed when others left, he said, “It's, like, the way it was going, [it] was set up for me to walk away."
This is not what democracy looks like.
Rogers is right. Those oppressive wait times and labyrinthine lines along sidewalks, through courtyards, in hallways, and on stairways are not an accident or bureaucratic snafu. They're meant to deter voters. Every person who walked away — because they had to work, tend to family, or were just plain tired — was a victim of voter suppression, courtesy of the Supreme Court.
By a 5-4 vote in 2013, the high court decided that racism was over and neutered the Voting Rights Act. Absent the federal oversight once mandated in states with deep histories of discriminatory voting tactics, Texas has shut down hundreds of voting sites. Most of them are in predominantly Democratic cities, including Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio, and in areas with large Black and Latinx populations.
No area has been more severely crippled than Harris County, where Rogers and many others waited hours to vote. At Texas Southern, there were only six poll workers. Its10 voting machines were all 20 years old, and half stopped working for parts of the long day. By the time Rogers became the last person to finally cast his ballot at 1 a.m. Wednesday, former Vice President Joe Biden had already been declared the winner of Texas's Democratic primary.
Shuttering polling places or making those sites barely operable isjust aseffective in lowering voting rates in communities of color as poll taxes or so-called “literacy tests" were decades ago. (For some people, beingforced to miss a day of work to vote amounts toa poll tax.) Yet there are those like Rogers and all the people who stood in line with him, leaning on walls and shifting their weight from one foot to the other, refusing to be denied.
This is why I scoffed when Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent forthe New York Times, recently revealed that he does not vote. “As reporters," he said, "our job is to observe, not participate." From time to time, this is a tiresome conversation that journalists feel compelled to have, and in my experience, it is usually white men who believe voting somehow violates their journalistic purity.
When they speak of objectivity, I hear privilege. It's easy to self-suppress when those who look like them have never had to fight for this foundational right of democracy. They will never have that right threatened or denied by voter purges or ever-changing voter ID laws. When Republicans gerrymander districts with “surgical precision," they won't feel that weight because this nation, created for them, has never lined up against them. Not voting is a luxury they can afford because even if they shun the ballot, their voices will always be heard, their lives will always matter.
What Texas — and to be clear, it's neither just Texas nor one region of the country — wants is to keep silence those historically ignored. Yet while Republican officials tried to thwart democracy, Rogers and all who waited to vote strengthened it. They are this country's soul. If America ever lives up to its values, these are our shepherds. And they know this battle, waged for more than 150 years, won't end after the last primary.
Of those long lines to vote, Rogers said, "If it happens again, I would do the same thing all over again."
In this nation's damaged democracy, he, and likely millions more, may have no other choice.

With Mainers hunkering down to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, we're answering questions from Bangor Daily News readers about the virus and how it spreads. If you have questions, ask them here.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Jane, Robbinston: "What is the best way to sterilize a cloth mask?"
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the best way to clean and sterilize a cloth mask is by simply running it through a wash cycle in your washing machine.
Mary, Orient: "I don't understand the 'Unknown' category in the list of confirmed cases by county. How can you not know what county the person is from?"
According to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the "unknown" category represents people who have tested positive for whom current residence information is not yet confirmed. In most cases, these are individuals for whom a positive result arrived within an hour or two of the time that Maine CDC posts its confirmed case count update. Epidemiologists get in touch with all people who test positive to collect that information as part of standard contact tracing and investigation. Cases in the "unknown" category are typically assigned to a county the next day.
Jacob, Bangor: "What happens when the curve 'flattens?' It seems obvious that as soon as restrictions are lifted, infection rates will begin to grow. Are they going to have the state locked down until a vaccine is developed?"
On April 28, Gov. Janet Mills announced a multi-step plan for re-opening the state by incrementally relaxing social distancing measures and allowing some businesses to reopen over the course of the next few months. Maine is working with its neighbors Vermont and New Hampshire to coordinate reopening of their intertwined economies in a way that does not lead to another outbreak.
Indeed, relaxing social distancing measures does seem to be an appropriate next step. Countries such as South Korea, Singapore and China have relaxed lockdown measures as the virus has come increasingly under control (albeit, the latter with some controversial smartphone surveillance software involved). If reopening is done haphazardly, however, the virus could experience a resurgence, much like the oft-discussed 1918 influenza pandemic.
When it comes to the vaccine, scientists estimate that it could take up to two years to develop one, but they are also waiting to see if the coronavirus, like the flu, will recede in the summer and resurge in the fall. Experts have suggested a number of timelines for reopening, including a rollback of social distancing measures in the summer followed by a renewed period of social distancing in the fall when the virus returns, until a vaccine is developed. How this applies to Maine is, as of yet, not known.
Mel, Bath: "What about testing for antibodies? Thousands of us have missed the boat for testing if we had a mild case. I talked to my doctor and self quarantined for 2 weeks. It would be helpful to know now, did I have it or not? Can I go back to work, be the one in the household to go in the store, care for others?"
The U.S. CDC has developed an antibody test for the COVID-19 virus, but to date is only providing the test to states designated as "hot spots." Maine is not considered a hot spot and according to the state CDC, does not expect to receive any of those tests in the near future.
At this time there are no specific CDC recommendations for those who self isolated based on possible COVID-19 symptoms but who were not tested beyond what is recommended for the entire population: maintain six-feet of physical distance from another person, wear a face mask in public and wash your hands frequently.
Nancy, Presque Isle: "What about driver's licenses? Renewals? Maybe they can be renewed online?"
Mills' state of emergency order issued March 15 waives all drivers license renewals that expired or will expire during the timeframe of her executive order. Online drivers license renewals remain an option and during the state of emergency all vision tests required as part of the renewal process are waived.
Jane, Bangor: "Are we required to wear masks to grocery stores now?"
Mills announced on April 28 that, starting May 1, all Mainers will be required to wear cloth face coverings in public settings where physical distancing measures are difficult to maintain, and continue strict requirements for long-term care facilities. Given that a person could be carrying the COVID-19 virus and not show any symptoms and the fact it can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, the CDC says wearing a face mask is added protection against otherwise healthy looking individuals spreading the virus.
Kelly, Brunswick: "I live in Maine, have not left Maine, and have been practicing social distancing. I would like to travel about an hour to my camp (located in Maine) for recreation and hiking. I would not have to come in contact with any other persons going to or while there. Is this permissible?"
Yes, in issuing her executive state of emergency, Mills listed outdoor activities like running, bicycling, hiking, fishing and walking as essential. However, it is crucial to maintain the six-feet of physical distancing from individuals not in your immediate household at all times, even when you are outside. Traveling by car to your camp or to a trailhead is permitted under the executive order but you may not have any passengers in your car other than members of your immediate household.
Jennifer, Brewer: "I'm wondering what happens when someone who's tested positive recovers....Are they immune? Do doctors usually declare that they can return to the life they had before with no restrictions? Do they have to isolate or quarantine still?"
According to the CDC, the immune system's response to the COVID-19 virus is not yet understood so it is not known if someone who has tested positive and recovered is or is not immune to the virus. Once a person has clinically recovered, CDC guidelines recommend two weeks of self quarantine before returning to normal out of the home activities. After that, they are urged to follow all CDC recommendations with regards to social distancing, frequent washing of hands and covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.
Robert, Belfast: "Sounds kinda grim but, these are grim times. Question came up in a discussion. Can a corpse carry/infect a live person caring for them?"
According to the CDC, COVID-19 is primarily spread from close contact with an infected living person by way of respiratory droplets in sneezes, coughs or even through talking. The CDC has issued interim guidance specifically dealing with human remains and says the respiratory route of transmission from those remains is not a concern. However, it may be possible to get COVID-19 by touch transfer if an infected person transfers the virus through respiration or by touching the corpse and then a second person touches the corpse soon after and then touches their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes. The CDC will update this interim guidance if and when new information is learned.
Ray, Brewer: "Once a person recovers from the COVID-19, can they get it again or are they immune?"
The short answer is that, unfortunately, we don't know yet. We're still in the early stages of understanding this novel virus, and this is one of the many questions that is as of yet unanswered.
However, there are some hints from past coronaviruses (remember, "coronaviruses" are a large family of viruses that cause cold and flu-like symptoms with varying degrees of severity).
The good news is that antibodies that patients produce during infection give them immunity to the specific virus for months or even years, even though researchers are still figuring out if and how that works with the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. A Taiwanese study published in 2007 found that survivors of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2003 (a reminder: this coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2) had antibodies that lasted for up to three years, which suggested immunity. Survivors of the coronavirus known as Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, were found by a study published in 2016 to have antibodies up to two years later -- and the sicker the patient was when they were infected, the longer-lasting the immune response was.
Here's the rub, according to NPR: for the four seasonal coronaviruses that cause between a tenth and a third of common colds, reinfection is an issue. After all, people get colds again and again, even if they have been exposed to these viruses since childhood. The antibodies are present after infection, but the levels slowly decline until the person becomes susceptible again (even though coronaviruses don't seem to mutate in a way that requires year-to-year vigilance, like with the flu).
Regardless, none of these results can be translated directly to COVID-19, so only time (and research) will tell. Experts told Time that they estimate COVID-19 antibodies could remain in a patient's system for two to three years based on clues from past coronaviruses, but it is too early to say for sure.
Debra, Auburn: "How are inmates getting COVID-19 and spreading it when they haven't been outside jail?"
The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 primarily spreads from person to person through close contact, according to the CDC. Therefore, if the virus were to infect an inmate, it's believed it would be transmitted to the inmate from a person traveling outside the jail, such as a prison worker or visitor. Because many people take days to develop symptoms of the disease, a person could unintentionally pass the virus to an inmate.
Due to the layout of most prisons (communal dining areas, shared rooms), social distancing is difficult. So if an inmate were to become infected, the virus might easily spread through the population. For this reason, a number of inmates have been recently released from Knox County Prison and Cumberland County Jail in an effort to lower the population within those facilities to reduce the number of people at risk in those facilities and make social distancing easier.
No one in either Maine facility is suspected of having the virus at this time, but as COVID-19 spreads across Maine, the state's jails and prisons are trying to prevent the virus from spreading within correctional settings.
In late March, an employee assigned to the Bolduc Correctional Facility in Warren tested positive for the new coronavirus. The employee had not been on-site at the minimum security facility since March 20 and had been self-quarantining pending the results of the test.
As of April 7, 241 federal inmates and 73 Federal Bureau of Prisons staff members had tested positive for COVID-19 nationwide. There had been 8 federal inmate deaths and no staff member deaths attributed to the disease.
Carolyn, Rockland: "Should I wear a mask when I'm outside exercising (walking) if I am keeping a 6-foot distance?"
On April 28, Mills announced starting May 1, all Mainers will be required to wear cloth face coverings in public settings where physical distancing measures are difficult to maintain. The order will also continue strict requirements for long-term care facilities. The CDC guidelines and recommendations advise that the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used.
The CDC emphasised it is critical to maintain six-feet social distancing to slow the spread of the virus.
Jane, Bangor: "I just saw info on the news about disinfecting all the products we bring home from the grocery store, etc. Should we throw out the plastic bags that carried them?"
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is a respiratory illness, which means it typically spreads via airborne droplets. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets carrying viral particles can land on someone else's nose or mouth or get inhaled. But a person can sometimes get the coronavirus if they touch a surface or object that has viral particles on it and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes.
The study showed COVID-19 virus can live for up to three days on plastics, including plastics used as grocery bags. Bags can be disinfected using household items like bleach and then stored in a disinfected area. However, the study also emphasized the importance of washing your hands after coming in contact with a surface like a plastic shopping bag and not touching your face as the two best ways to minimize the chance of picking up COVID-19 from surfaces.
JP, Belfast: "What about vehicle registration and the May 1st winter tire law? How do we navigate dealing with town office closures and the stay at home mandates?"
According to the Maine Department of Transportation, as of April 6, there are no plans to extend the May 1 deadline for removing studded tires. The reasoning behind this is twofold: Auto repair shops and garages have been declared essential businesses under Mills' executive stay-at-home order. In addition, running studded tires on Maine roadways is very damaging to the surface and the longer the studded tires remain in use, the more damage they cause.
As part of the current state of emergency in Maine, the state Legislature has waived enforcement against all motor vehicle and trailer registrations and inspections that expire during the state of emergency. Registration and inspection deadlines are extended up to 30 days after the state of emergency is called off.
According to the Maine Municipal Association, each municipality in the state should review its programs and staff and determine which are essential under the current state of emergency or required under specific laws and ordinances. Municipalities should continue to offer these services while taking all social distancing measures possible, including allowing staff to work remotely. Generally, the municipalities have the discretion to determine if it needs to have minimal staff in the office or whether necessary services can be delivered remotely by staff working off-site. To determine what your municipality has decided to do, you should call your town office.
No name or town given: "I live out of state and own a home in Maine for which I pay property taxes. Will I be prevented from [traveling] to my Maine house? If not, are there requirements I must undertake?"
You will not be prevented from traveling to your house in Maine; however, you should check the regulations of any states you have to travel through to get here. Once you arrive, you will be required to stay at home for two weeks. On April 4 Mills ordered anyone -- resident or non-resident -- traveling into Maine to self-quarantine for 14 days to help deter the spread of COVID-19. In addition, while in Maine, you are subject to all the requirements stipulated in the executive stay-at-home order.
Norm, Baldwin: "Gov. Mills ordered that persons 'entering Maine' must quarantine for 14 days. In her order I see no exception for people who go grocery shopping in NH and come right back the same day, nor for people who work in NH and come home at night. What's the rule on that?"
According to the Maine Center for Disease and Prevention, there are no quarantine orders for people who make short trips back and forth across the border for work. But cross border travel should be limited to short, essential trips.
Nicole (no town given): "I am wondering if, under the stay-at-home order, it is OK to drive separately and meet a friend at an outdoor recreation area while observing social distancing of keeping 6 feet apart while walking?"
Technically speaking, yes. As long as you drive separately to the trailhead and remain six feet apart for the duration of your time together, you are within the rules of the stay-at-home order. However, it's important to note that some experts say that doing this isn't actually true social distancing, which is needed to flatten the curve.
In issuing the stay-at-home order Mills specifically noted the importance of Mainers getting outside for what she called "abbreviated exercise" by hiking, fishing, bicycling, running or taking a walk. She listed these activities as essential for Maine residents, but cautioned they must be undertaken in accordance with the transportation and social distancing guidelines in her order. So when you are on your hike, give other people plenty of space, at least six feet, at all times. If you're passing someone on a narrow trail, find a good spot to step off the trail and let them pass.
Janice (no town given): "I read your article this morning about 'essential' outdoor activity. My question is about an essential inside activity which I haven't seen covered, and thought perhaps you have an answer or can find one. Many of us older folks rely on housekeepers, some more often than others, for what we are unable to do on our own any longer. If we are careful to distance from one another and they are gloved, while they are here, does this pose a problem, and can our building owners restrict them from entering the property? Any advice you can give is appreciated."
Under Mills' stay-at-home order, individuals who work and assist Maine's elderly citizens in their residence are considered essential workers. Contract workers like housekeepers are considered part of that workforce and may come into your home to perform necessary services. It is crucial that both the worker and resident adhere to practical six-foot physical distancing from each other, ideally never being in the same room at the same time and staying as far apart as possible at all times.
Bill, Fletchers Landing: "Can mosquitos or other biting insects transmit COVID-19?"
According to the World Health Organization, to date there is no indication COVID-19 is transmitted through mosquito bites. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. So while mosquito bites will continue to be annoying, they present no known risk of COVID-19.
Cindy, Newport: "It would be beneficial for people to know the towns in each county that have residents who have tested positive for coronavirus. This information could alleviate anxiety if the towns with cases are not close by and let people know if the town in which they live has the potential of community spread."
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will not provide the names of towns or cities in which individuals reside who have tested positive for COVID-19. Rather, Maine CDC Director Nirav Shah recommends all people in Maine should be practicing COVID-19 preventative measures as if the virus was already in their town.
Heidi, Wiscasset: "The city of Portland has a 'stay-in-home' order. May residents still take walks around their neighborhoods?"
As of 12:01 a.m. on April 2, Mills' emergency stay-at-home order is in effect. It mandates Mainers not leave home except for essential jobs or purchases, though they can exercise outdoors while keeping at least 6 feet from people outside their household. Those caught breaking the stay at home orders are subject to a fine up to $1,000. Under Mills' orders, if a municipality has stricter regulations in place, than those will take precedence.
The statewide measures echo emergency stay-at-home orders but carry higher fines than those issued in Portland on March 24 and two days later in South Portland. The Portland and South Portland orders included language stating outdoor exercise and/or dog walking are specifically permitted, but people must not gather in groups over 10 and must practice 6-feet physical distancing at all times with people with whom they do not share a household. In Portland the fine for breaking the order is $500.
Monica, Bangor: "Is the coronavirus more dangerous if a woman is in the first trimester of her pregnancy? And what are some important facts to know about COVID-19 and a woman that's early in pregnancy?"
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it does not have information on adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. But it does indicate that high fevers during the first trimester of pregnancy can increase the risk of certain birth defects. In addition, the CDC said pregnancy loss, including miscarriage and stillbirth, has been observed in cases of infection with other related coronaviruses [SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)] during pregnancy.
The CDC says it is not yet known if pregnant women, in any trimester, are more susceptible to COVID-19 or if they are more likely to develop severe symptoms if they contract the disease. But ProPublica reports that, according to the U.S. CDC, it has been shown that pregnant women who catch similar viruses such as influenza or SARS are more vulnerable to severe respiratory problems than other women in the same (i.e., childbearing years) age group.
The CDC adds that, though the number of test cases is fairly small, there is no evidence that a mother with COVID-19 can pass the disease to her fetus or baby. In such cases, the coronavirus has not been found in either the mother's amniotic fluid or breast milk.
Bob, Liberty: "What income support is there (or is proposed) for self-employed persons whose livelihood requires close contact? My daughter teaches ballroom dance, which clearly is not compatible with social distancing, nor would be considered an essential activity."
On March 27, President Donald Trump signed into law HR 748, The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act . This act includes language that expands eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits to self-employed workers under the following conditions: They are available for work and they are unable to work as a direct result of COVID-19. Weekly benefits for self-employed workers are calculated the same way they are for other workers , including the $600 enhancement. Benefits are available for up to 39 weeks. The eligibility expansion is retroactive to January 27, 2020, meaning self-employed workers can request benefits for weeks of unemployment back to January 27, 2020. The expansion expires at the end of 2020.
Dave, Bangor: "Is the Maine [Center for Disease Control and Prevention] doing contact tracing? How can we have cases from 'unknown' counties?"
Maine CDC has a team of investigators who contact patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and ask them questions, such as where they may have traveled recently and with whom they have had recent close contact. Among the questions the investigators ask is where that person's primary residence is located. The "unknown" category that appears on the list of counties on the Maine CDC website (which indicates the counties where confirmed COVID-19 patients live) represents Mainers whose cases have been reported by Maine health care providers to state officials, but whom have yet to be contacted directly by Maine CDC investigators.
Nan (no town given): "I want to know exactly how many ventilators they each have and how many people at each hospital are trained in their use."
According to Shah, as of Thursday, April 2, there were 334 ventilators in Maine with 266 available in addition to 186 available alternative ventilators that have been approved for use by the FDA and 127 respiratory therapists available in Maine. Shah said he has requested an additional 400 ventilators from the national stockpile. He's also called for retired, not currently working or recently unlicensed respiratory therapists to volunteer to be deployed around the state if needed to operate the ventilators. As of April 2, there were a total of 285 intensive care unit beds with 122 available.
Ellen (no town given): "Is there any test to show that a person has already had the virus and has recovered? Since many people with the virus have mild or no symptoms at all, how can we tell if we have had it? If we did have it and have antibodies to the virus, are we protected for the time being from getting it again?"
There is some evidence, according to the Journal of American Medical Association, that people who get sick from COVID-19 and then recover may still carry some of the genetic material from the virus for up to five to 13 days after their symptoms decrease, which could result in the patients still testing positive. There also have been reports of people recovering from the disease after having been hospitalized, but then having symptoms return and having to resume treatment. There is a lot about COVID-19 that is unknown, because it is so new, but some medical professionals say that it is likely patients who recover from the disease will develop some degree of resistance to catching it again.
Nathan (no town given): "Knowing the county breakdown of those people would be very helpful to readers who are trying to put together a picture of relative risk in different parts of the state. Given the paucity of testing, knowing the county where potential exposures have happened would be a useful additional data point as individuals attempt to assess relative risk."
State officials in Maine have said -- repeatedly -- that Mainers should not try to assess the risk in their communities of contracting COVID-19 based upon the number of confirmed cases publicly released by the Maine CDC. Cases are reported based upon where a patient's official residence is located, not necessarily on where that patient is physically located, and because of the current limitations on testing, there most certainly are more people in Maine who have COVID-19 than the public testing results indicate.
The statistics posted on the Maine CDC website "could provide folks with a false sense of security," Shah has said. "No one should be waiting until they see cases in their county. The assumption for everyone in the state right now should be" that COVID-19 is in their local community.
June, Bangor: "Many of us have never filed an unemployment claim. When are we eligible to file a claim? Do we file the first day our office closes or do we wait until the following week?"
On March 17, emergency bipartisan legislation passed in Maine to support workers and businesses affected by Covid-19. The Maine Department of Labor has temporarily revised eligibility to include situations not typically covered, including:
--An employer temporarily ceases operation due to coronavirus.
--An individual is quarantined with the expectation of returning to work once their quarantine is over.
People filing for unemployment that fall under this emergency legislation should file immediately.
The typical one-week waiting period for unemployment claims has been waived for instances relating to COVID-19.
To file for benefits or see a list of FAQs for employees and employers, please visit the Maine Department of Labor website.
Les, Jonesboro: "Is full-strength vinegar an option for wiping down surfaces that may be contaminated with coronavirus?"
According to Dr. David Evans, a professor in the department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology at the University of Alberta, the answer is no. Global News Edmonton asked Dr. Evans this very question. Here's his response: "Although acids will inactivate viruses (vinegar is acetic acid), it's quite dilute and the pH isn't likely low enough."
If you can't find disinfectant wipes, Dr. Evans suggests that hot soapy water on a cloth would be a great substitute. The U.S. CDC also recommends soap and water. They also suggest disinfecting with a diluted bleach solution. To make: mix " cup of bleach with a gallon of water.
"Once diagnosed with coronavirus, what is the treatment, step by step?"
As of March 22, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. And since it's a viral infection, antibiotics are ineffective.
If you are sick, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests staying in contact with your doctor and remaining at home. People who have a mild case can recover at home. Call your doctor or local emergency room if you start to feel worse.
Since there is no medicine to take, if you are sick you should isolate yourself in your house. Keep away from other family members and use a different bathroom if possible. The U.S. CDC recommends staying in a "sick room" and asking someone else to care for your pets.
You should even refrain from sharing personal household items, such as dishes, glasses and towels. Clean and disinfect high-touch surface areas in your isolation room and bathroom daily. The Environmental Protection Agency has a list of approved disinfectants for use against COVID-19.
"How do we know, after getting sick, that we are now safe to stop isolation?"
If you have tested positive for COVID-19, and you have been in quarantine for the recommended 14 days, you may come out of quarantine if you have had two tests come back negative for the virus, officials say. The U.S. CDC says that if your health care provider will not be giving you a test to determine if you are still contagious, you may come out of quarantine after these following three things have happened:
-- You have been fever free for 72 hours without taking medicine to reduce your fever.
-- Other symptoms have improved. For example, you are having a much easier time breathing.
-- At least 7 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared.
If you will be tested to see if you are still contagious, you must have two negative tests in a row, 24 hours apart, in order to leave quarantine.
Reza, Tehran: "I want to know if fruit can transmit the coronavirus."
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently unaware of any reports of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging.
United Fresh Produce Association has issued a statement:
"There are no clinically confirmed cases of COVID-19 linked to the consumption of fresh produce or food sold through traditional retail outlets. As consumers select their produce, adhering to food safety guidance is critical. We encourage consumers to wash their hands, and wash and prepare their produce following FDA recommendations."
Keeping your hands clean and away from your face is the best way to lower your risk in contracting COVID-19. Wash everything with soap and water. This includes your hands, fruits, vegetables, and nonporous containers.
"How can I tell the difference between the coronavirus and common cold or flu?"
COVID-19, common cold or flu? Here's a story outlining the differences between them.
Some of the symptoms overlap. Here is a list of the most common symptoms with each:
-- COVID-19 symptoms: fever, dry cough, shortness of breath.
-- Flu symptoms: fever, fatigue, cough, aches and pains, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea.
-- Cold symptoms: runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, aches and pains, sore throat.
The CDC is advising people who think they have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop symptoms such as a cough or difficulty breathing, to call their health care provider for medical advice.
"How long can you carry the virus before you get sick?"
The CDC reports that the incubation period for COVID-19 -- the time between when you contact a virus and when symptoms start -- is somewhere between 2 to 14 days. Symptoms include fever, a dry cough and shortness of breath.
According to a study by the American College of Physicians, 97.5 percent of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, call your doctor or local emergency room before leaving your home.
"Why haven't child care providers closed their doors?"
As of 10 a.m. on March 17, the state has not recommended closing childcare programs. If you are a private business owner, the choice to stay open is yours.
According to the CDC, children don't appear to be at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than adults. While the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults, children with confirmed COVID-19 generally present with milder symptoms.
Child and Family Services also recommends the following for childcare providers:
-- Wash hands and disinfect surfaces often.
-- Require staff and children to stay home if they feel ill.
-- Edit your drop off / pick up time to meet your programs needs.
Heidi, Old Town: "If schools are closed should I send my kids to daycare?"
Across Maine, schools have closed and adults have been urged to work from home. The biggest concern is the spread of COVID-19 happening faster than hospitals can safely accommodate. By social distancing, we're "flattening the curve" of infections to make sure our healthcare system can adequately treat the masses.
[As schools close, daycares remain open to 'stand with America's essential employees']
While the CDC reports that children have the same level of risk as adults in contracting COVID-19, their symptoms are milder. But kids share germs easily, and bring those germs home to their other family members -- including those who are high risk: older adults, people with chronic medical conditions and those who are immunocompromised.
If you can keep your children at home, it's the best way to practice social distancing. However, knowing not everyone can work from home, be sure your child is not exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 (such as a fever and coughing) when you send them to daycare. The CDC suggests any child or staff member should stay home if they feel sick.
"Can dogs get and transmit the virus to/from humans?"
Your four-legged friends are likely safe. According to The World Health Organization, "While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks."
[What you need to know about your pets and spreading coronavirus]
The American Veterinary Medical Association says while two dogs (Hong Kong) and one cat (Belgium) have been reported to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes COVID-19 -- infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets spread COVID-19 to other animals, including people.
According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, transmission primarily occurs when there is contact with an infected person's bodily secretions, such as saliva or mucus droplets in a cough or sneeze. Transmission via touching a contaminated surface or object (i.e., a fomite) and then touching the mouth, nose, or possibly eyes is also possible, but appears to be a secondary route. Smooth (non-porous) surfaces (e.g., countertops, door knobs) transmit viruses better than porous materials (e.g., pet fur) because porous, especially fibrous, materials absorb and trap the pathogen (virus), making it harder to contract through simple touch.
Judy, Orono: "I'm wondering specifically about whether the virus can survive on money (both bills and coins) and, if so, for how long and what precautions we should take? And what about mail, or any paper or cardboard surface?"
There is currently no definitive scientific evidence that coronavirus can spread through paper money or coins. According to the CDC, COVID-19 primarily spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze.
However, the World Health Organization suggests practicing good hygiene after handling money by washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Coins, which are more smooth and nonporous, can transmit disease easier than bills, but you shouldn't be too concerned. "Basic rule of thumb should be to consider money dirty anyway, because it is. It goes through too many hands not to be," Rachel Graham, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, told Business Insider. Credit and debit cards are less risky, because they can be wiped clean. However, card readers are high-touch surfaces, so be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after using one.
The WHO has also stated that, based on what it knows from other coronaviruses, objects like letters and packages are not good environments for transmitting the virus.
According to a study conducted by the Virus Ecology Section of Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a facility in Hamilton, Mont. that is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Covid-19 can be viable on cardboard surfaces for up to 24 hours.
Myrna, Belfast: "If one person in a household tests positive with mild symptoms and self-quarantines at home, what precautions do the other family members need to take?"
Individuals who are under a self-quarantine in their home should stay in a specific room, away from other people in the home, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control website. They should also use a separate bathroom if possible. Any shared spaces in the home should have good airflow. When the infected person is around others in the home they should wear a facemask. If they are unable to wear a facemask because it makes breathing difficult, the other person should wear a facemask.
People should not share household items, such as dishes, drinkware or bedding with an infected person. All items used by the symptomatic person should be thoroughly washed after use. Items or surfaces in the home that are touched frequently, such as phones, doorknobs and counters, should be cleaned everyday. Any bedding used by an infected person that has bodily fluids on it should be washed immediately. Gloves should be worn during this process.
In caring for an infected person, a caretaker should wear a disposable facemask and gloves when they touch or have contact with the patient's blood, stool or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit or urine. Do not reuse the face mask or gloves. Caretakers should then thoroughly wash their hands. Caregivers should also closely monitor their own health and call their healthcare provider right away if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath)
Doug, Dexter, and Donna, Old Town: "What is the reason for hoarding toilet paper? Seeing carts full of toilet paper, with nothing on the shelf for the elderly that just need it."
Basically, if you're at the grocery store, and you see there's no toilet paper, you're probably going to feel like you need to stock up because it's in short supply.
"Scarcity is a really powerful driver of consumption," Adam Alter, who teaches marketing and psychology at the New York University Stern School of Business, told Marketwatch.org.
Empty shelves lead to panic. And buying in bulk. If you can't find it, you feel you should stock up. Toilet paper is a basic hygiene product that you don't want to think about doing without.
Paul Marsden, a consumer psychologist at the University of the Arts London tells CNBC that it's also a way for consumers to take back control in a world where they are not in control.
Christina, Bangor: "How long does [COVID-19] live on different surfaces?"
According to online information provided by Harvard Medical School at Harvard Health Publishing, while there is still a great deal that is not known how variables like exposure to sunlight, heat or cold affect survival times, a recent study found that the COVID-19 coronavirus can survive up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers also found that this virus can hang out as droplets in the air for up to three hours before they fall. But most often they will fall more quickly.
As research continues, it's important to follow the CDC's recommendations for cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects every day. These include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables.
If surfaces are dirty, first clean them using a detergent and water, then disinfect them. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.
In addition, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water after bringing in packages, or after trips to the grocery store or other places where you may have come into contact with infected surfaces.
Sandy, Auburn: "Is COVID-19 able to withstand and survive on frozen food?"
Food, whether frozen, fresh or from a can, is not a major risk factor for the transmission of the new coronavirus. While it might not be advisable to eat food that someone else has clearly sneezed on, the virus typically starts with the respiratory system, not the digestive tract, Daniel Kuritzkes, an infectious disease expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told NPR. That means the infection is more likely to occur if you get the virus on your hands and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth, while transmission via food is not a significant risk. The USDA says it is not aware of any reports that would suggest the transmission of coronavirus via food or food packaging.
The greater concern with food safety would be the spread over shared utensils that are touched by many people at a buffet, for example. Regardless of where you are eating, washing your hands thoroughly is the best way to protect yourself.
Holly, Vassalboro: "Cell phones and laptops are the most commonly hand-touched devices that I use. What is a safe way to 'wipe down' a cell phone? Does alcohol hurt the screens or keyboards?"
Apple updated its "How to Clean Apple Products" section recently to say that using Clorox Disinfectant Wipes or any other wipes with 70 percent isopropyl alcohol is fine to use on hard, exterior surfaces. However, do not spray your device with any aerosol cleaners directly. Do not use bleach, dish soap or window cleaners to clean phones. If your phone is water resistant, wiping it with a soft, damp microfiber cloth can work. Do not use paper towels, towels or abrasive cloths to wipe phones as it might damage screens.
As for frequently touched surfaces like door handles, ATMs and railings, how often they are cleaned varies greatly. The coronavirus has been known to stay on a surface for several days. Use paper towels or sleeves to touch surfaces that you are concerned about.
Ed, Auburn: What makes this COVID-19 any different than the swine flu, or other severe flu types?
COVID-19 and the flu are both respiratory illnesses with similar symptoms -- cough, fever, shortness of breath. However, coronavirus seems to spread more easily than the flu and the mortality rate, though not exact, is around 1 percent, whereas the flu's mortality rate is 0.1 percent.
The new coronavirus has spread more than more severe illnesses like the bird flu or ebola, which are deadlier, according to a comparison chart by the New York Times.
Lloyd, Calais: "How many people have recovered from the coronavirus without further complications?"
As the number of infections rises across the world, so does the number of recoveries. According to a live dashboard maintained by Johns Hopkins University, more than 202,935 people, most of them in China, have recovered from the virus. However, the global pandemic continues to spread, with more than 962,977 infections and 49,180 deaths worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University site.
And according to a research study by the Journal of American Medical Association, four patients who met criteria for hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine in China tested positive for the virus again, 5 to 13 days later.
Ben, Waterville (but currently in the United Kingdom): "Will I be able to travel to Maine?"
As of Thursday, April 2, all of Maine is under a 30-day stay-at-home order issued by Mills. All nonessential travel is strongly discouraged during this time. The advice from authorities and public health experts to people wondering about travel is to stay put if possible.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports most foreign nationals who have been in United Kingdom during the previous 14 days will not be permitted entry into the United States
Kathy, Bangor: "Has Maine made any plans to set up information hotlines and/or drive by screening sites, to avoid some infected patients going to crowded clinics, ERs or doctors offices?"
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has a hotline available to Mainers with questions about COVID-19, the disease caused by the infection. The hotline is available by calling 211 or 1-866-811-5695. It can also be reached by texting your zipcode to 898-211 or emailing info@211maine.org.
The Maine CDC advises people who exhibit symptoms or who think they were exposed to COVID-19 to call a medical provider before going to a healthcare facility -- or, if they do not have a primary care physician, to call an urgent care center -- so the provider can determine if testing is advisable prior to the person showing up at a hospital or doctor's office, where other people could be exposed.
On April 2, Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said his agency was working with other state agencies, including the Maine Emergency Management Agency, in preparing external sites for medical staff to evaluate and triage individuals with suspected COVID-19 symptoms. This is ready to be deployed when and if needed.
Nan, Belfast: "What are our local hospitals doing to prepare for the coming of the virus? Do they have sufficient supplies? How will they deal with a shortage of nurses, doctors and other workers once they start having to be quarantined?"
In Bangor, Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center is preparing for the possibility that there could be an influx of patients with COVID-19 by closely monitoring its inventory of supplies and identifying areas in the hospital where groups of patients with the same respiratory infection could be isolated, according to Dr. James Jarvis, EMMC's senior vice president and senior physician executive. The hospital also has an incident command team that's monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and identifying what steps it could take to handle a possible surge. In the event a surge strains the hospital's resources, Jarvis said, it will work with its parent organization to move staff where they're needed.
Dee, Hampden: "What policies/protocols are being followed by Northern Light associates and St. Joe associates for testing requests?"
Under state guidelines, Northern Light Health hospitals are currently evaluating patients by where they have traveled, their symptoms and their medical condition to determine whether a COVID-19 test is appropriate, according to spokeswoman Suzanne Spruce. At the moment, "wide scale testing is not recommended" so that the hospitals can avoid being overwhelmed, Spruce said. A St. Joseph Healthcare representative wasn't immediately available to comment.
Dianna, Brewer: "How will medical facilities provide medical attention for those who don't have insurance or MaineCare coverage? Will that population be able to get treatment at walk-in care or emergency rooms if they have no money to pay out of pocket?"
According to the Maine Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a Maine-based health care advocacy group, you may be eligible for free or low-cost insurance through MaineCare or the Marketplace. You may also be eligible f or other programs that can help with the costs of COVID-19 testing and other medical care you may need. The Maine Department for Health and Human Services has issued emergency rules and taken additional steps to ensure people with MaineCare can access the services they need. You can apply for MaineCare any day of the year. DHHS has made some changes in response to COVID-19 to help make the process of applying and getting MaineCare as quick as possible.
Dr. James Jarvis, of EMMC in Bangor, said that the hospital urges any patients to seek medical care when it's needed. He said that the hospital has a policy for working with uninsured patients to determine the price of their care and whether they are eligible for charity care.
George, Augusta: "I find no information on whether it is a good idea to enter a hospital for an [elective surgery] during the pandemic."
According to a written statement issued by Northern Light Health, elective surgeries, office visits, diagnostic tests, endoscopies and other procedures that can be considered nonessential are being assessed for postponement until a later date. Each case will be evaluated by the patient's healthcare provider to determine if it should be postponed. Patients will be contacted by their healthcare provider's office if their procedure, visit, or test can be rescheduled. These steps are in compliance with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Surgeons recommendations.
Linda, Blue Hill: "I would like to know how many people in Maine have been tested."

Other frequently asked questions
What is COVID-19?
COVID-19, the official name for the 2019 novel coronavirus, is a new strain within the same coronavirus family that has caused past global outbreaks.
Coronaviruses can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe infections. They are found in many different species of animals. Some evolve and infect humans, and have infected large numbers of people before, including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) -- which infected 8,000 people and killed 800 in 2003 -- and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), according to the U.S. CDC.
People who have COVID-19 have shown flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of breath.
How does the novel coronavirus spread?
It has spread primarily through person-to-person contact, which means people can catch COVID-19 from others who have been infected.
The virus can be transmitted the same way the common cold and influenza spread -- through small droplets from the nose or mouth that spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales, according to the World Health Organization.
These droplets land on objects and surfaces, and if other people touch these surfaces and then touch their face, they can then catch COVID-19. People also can catch the respiratory illness from breathing those droplets in.
The infection might also spread before people show symptoms, according to the U.S. CDC, although this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
COVID-19 does not spread through mosquito bites or through goods shipped from China or any other country that has confirmed infections, according to the WHO.
Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes are at greater risk of developing serious illness than others.
There is no evidence that you can catch COVID-19 from pets such as cats and dogs.
What can I do to avoid catching COVID-19?
Since COVID-19 can spread from being in close contact with someone who is infected, maintaining a safe distance (about 6 feet) from a patient reduces the risk of catching the infection.
Regularly and thoroughly washing your hands, ideally with soap and water, or using
alcohol-based hand sanitizer kills viruses that may be on your hands.
(Alcohol that you drink -- such as Tito's vodka -- cannot be used as a hand sanitizer.)
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, because hands touch many surfaces, can pick up viruses and can transfer them to your eyes, nose or mouth.
Given that COVID-19 spreads through inhaling small droplets, the WHO advises covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze to limit the spread of those droplets. Dispose of that used tissue immediately.
Health agencies also recommend staying home if you feel unwell to protect yourself and prevent the spread of viruses.
What should I do if I experience coronavirus-like symptoms?
If you have symptoms of the coronavirus -- shortness of breath, cough, fever, chest pain-- it is important that you call your healthcare provider's office before you seek treatment, according to the Maine CDC.
"What we don't want happening, is for coronavirus to go from being travel associated, which it largely is right now, to being hospital associated. And that can happen when folks go to the emergency room," Shah said.
Where you go to get tested depends on where you have health care access. "For a lot of folks, the easiest thing to do is to go to their primary health care physician for other folks, urgent care may be the best option. Tests are available from health care providers across the state," Shah said.
Currently, tests are available at primary care offices, urgent cares and emergency rooms, according to the Maine CDC. Clinicians are able to administer testing which can be a nasal swab, a throat swab or both.
If a doctor feels that a patient warrants testing, the doctor can then contact the Maine CDC to be sure that the patient should be tested, or the doctor can take a sample and send it to the CDC office in Augusta, with an acquisition form, for testing.
It typically takes around 48 hours to receive results.
Is COVID-19 more dangerous than the flu?
There have been a lot of comparisons between the flu and the new respiratory illness. While the flu remains much more common than COVID-19, coronavirus seems to spread more quickly and make people sicker than the flu, according to The New York Times.
There's no approved vaccine or medication available for COVID-19 yet, and health organizations continue to research the virus.
Antibiotics cannot treat the virus, mainly because COVID-19 is a virus and antibiotics are used for bacterial infections.
The lack of information is one factor that makes COVID-19 more dangerous than the more common and more familiar flu.
Should I buy a mask?
Healthy people should only use a mask if they're taking care of a COVID-19 patient. There is a worldwide shortage of masks, according to the WHO, that can be exacerbated when people who don't need them buy them.
If you are not sick with symptoms of COVID-19 or looking after someone who has COVID-19, you are wasting a mask. The same goes for gloves.
"Surging global demand -- driven not only by the number of COVID-19 cases but also by misinformation, panic buying and stockpiling -- will result in further shortages of personal protective equipment globally," the WHO website says.
Should I cancel my travel plans?
The CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some health care systems are overwhelmed, and there may be limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas. Many countries are implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice. Airlines have cancelled many international flights and in-country travel may be unpredictable. If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be disrupted, and you may have to remain outside the United States for an indefinite length of time.
The CDC has an online map showing the geographic risk assessment by country. The data includes known cases of COVID-19 in a specific country and travel advisories for each country.
In Maine, Mills' stay-at-home order, effective April 2, bans all nonessential travel in the state. Essential travel does include going to areas in Maine open for hiking, bicycling, fishing, walking, running and other outdoor exercising activities. In issuing the order, Mills stressed for the 30-days of the order, people should consider "abbreviated outdoor exercise" and are required to adhere to the 6-foot physical distancing rule from other individuals and not gather in groups of more than 10. People may drive to trailheads, cycling paths, open beaches or other areas in private vehicles, but passengers are limited to members of their immediate household, unless they are transporting someone out of medical necessity. Public transportation in Maine may only be used for travel associated with essential work that can't be done from home, or for other essential needs as outlined in Mills' order.
The CDC recommends reconsidering cruise ship travel worldwide.
Within the U.S., know which states have confirmed coronavirus cases. Here is an interactive map to see which states have confirmed cases. President Donald Trump declared a national state of emergency on March 13 and Mills declared a state of emergency in Maine on March 15. Mills' emergency order allows the governor to assume more power over the outbreak, including suspending the enforcement of laws, establishing emergency reserves of certain products and entering into mutual aid agreements with other states or countries. Practice respiratory hygiene and avoid traveling if sick. On March 31, Mills issued a statewide stay at home order which went into effect April 2.
Reliable sources for information include your local health agency, the Maine CDC, the U.S. CDC and the WHO.

Texto completo: From the beginning, Americans have been almost unique among nations in the way we care for each other.
Perhaps such uniqueness was and continues to be related to the influence of religion, which provides us with rules to live by, including personal responsibility and caring for each other. Perhaps the uniqueness also resulted from the need to work together to create communities and to utilize and enjoy the fruits of each person’s labor and tame the natural resources of this beautiful and productive land.
Whatever the influences, Alexis de Tocqueville, in the 1830s, observed these influences and the resulting creation of “voluntary associations” to meet individual and community needs. The associations were primarily funded by contributions of money, products and voluntary personal labor provided by local citizens. The societal balance of government and associations was clearly a strength in American society.
Yes, America was and still is unique among the nations of the world.
Karl Zinsmeister, author of “The Almanac of American Philanthropy,” estimates that U.S. charitable giving will have reached $430 billion in 2019, once all reports are in. This number will be reached in spite of tax deduction changes that negatively affect a substantial number of taxpayers.
In addition, the value of individuals’ time donated for charitable causes is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. And, on top of this, Americans are quick to respond to monetary needs of other countries faced with major disasters. We are a generous people. Philanthropy is imbued in our national psyche.
It is easy to understand why charitable organizations have value. Most important, many, if not most, of them are local. They understand local needs and are far more attuned to potentially successful ways of delivering services to those individuals in need. Local programs can more effectively coordinate the effort of multiple organizations. And, perhaps most important, local programs that are not sufficiently successful can be ended easily compared to national programs that seem to have life ever after.
But, believe it or not, there are people who do not like the concept of charitable giving and would prefer to see a larger role for government in serving the needs of our citizenry.
In a Jan. 8 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Zinsmeister stated, “Quietly effective philanthropies get little visibility, though, and scant credit from journalists, academics and politicians. Instead, progressive editorialists and political candidates openly call for deep cuts in the charitable deduction, an end to tax protections for churches and other charities, the taxing down of personal fortune, and new regimes in which government becomes the sole ministrant of societal needs.”
The political platforms of Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would further exacerbate this attack on charities. By promoting schemes such as the Green New Deal, “Medicare for All,” and free tuition for higher education, incredibly higher tax rates for all taxpayers — including the middle class — will be the outcome. Even with former Vice President Joe Biden's more modest proposals, the government’s share of our national income and expenses will increase dramatically, leaving far less in the pockets of all taxpaying citizens.
Philanthropy would be a major casualty of Democratic progressivism. The character of our nation will change, and not for the better.
Yes, even charity becomes a major political issue. In America, research has demonstrated that there are significant differences between liberals/Democrats and conservatives/Republicans. Landmark research conducted by Arthur C. Brooks, a Syracuse University professor, led to the publication of his book “Who Really Cares” in 2006. In the foreword, James Q. Wilson writes, “ ‘Who Really Cares’ is not just about how we contribute time and money, it is also about how our culture may affect our politics and our economy. It is the best study of charity that I have ever read.”
In a 2008 op-ed reviewing the book, Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times wrote, “We liberals are personally stingy” and later adds that the book “cites data that households headed by conservatives give 30% more to charity than households headed by liberals.”
Yes, charity has been and is still a significant source of political differences in America. And the differences are not simply related to the fact that conservatives are more likely to be church members and therefore donate more time and money to churches than liberals. These research conclusions stand up even after removing religious contributions from the calculations.
So, here we go again! This is one more significant way in which the conservatives and liberals look at major national issues. Some Democrats seem willing to sabotage more than 200 years of a proven and rewarding personal sacrifice of time and money to assist those in need.
Churches promoting life-changing underpinnings for individuals and families. Communities giving to support educational institutions from preschool through college. Neighbors giving to feed and house the needy. In all this, we already have a national culture and a societal balance of philanthropy and government that must be preserved.
It is critical to understand the danger of reducing or potentially destroying American successes built upon charity. Government, in any form, cannot replicate the individual and community benefits driven by a charitable culture.
Lancaster County proves this, and Alexis de Tocqueville was right!

Texto completo: A video that went viral on Wednesday shows an aggressive police arrest of a young black man who was allegedly smoking marijuana at a park in New York City.
Video of the incident, taken by a bystander, shows the man pleading with a plainclothes officer at the 100% Playground on Glenwood Road in Brooklyn on Wednesday night. The man repeatedly asked why he is being detained as the office held him against a wall, telling the man not to move, and pulling out what appeared to be a taser.
"I didn't commit any crime. What crime did I commit? Tell me!" the man asked the officer, who appeared to ignore his questions. "You're about to hurt me. What did I do?"
The woman who recorded the video can be heard reassuring the young man that she is filming the arrest. Moments later, police officers can be seen sprinting toward the scene and slamming the young man to the ground.
"You about to shoot me with a taser?" asked the man as witnesses asked the officers to stop. "Get off me! What is he doing? Help me! Help me!"
New York Police violently tackle unarmed black man over alleged marijuana joint
"I was walking home and, at first, I thought I saw two random guys, and it looked kind of aggressive," said "Velvet," who posted the video to Twitter. "I thought to myself, 'The one guy had his hand up. Maybe he doesn't want to fight, and I should help.' So, I just turned around, and I saw the officer's gun, and I thought, 'That's an undercover cop.' Then, I heard the kid say, 'Who are you? Can you identify yourself?' and the cop ignored him, so that's when I pulled out my phone."
Detective Denise Moroney, a spokeswoman with the New York City Police Department, told Gothamist the incident began when officers saw "two males inside the park smoking a lit marijuana cigarette, and, as the officers approached, the individuals, they fled the location."
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said the two men, age 18 and 20, were initially approached about a shooting in the area. During a news conference on Thursday, Shea admitted the video featured "disturbing points" but said the young man should not have run from the police. He also confirmed the man suffered abrasions and an ankle injury due to officers stamping on his foot.
"I would like to see approach, discussion, and no running," Shea said. "No physical resistance at all. The problem is, you can’t go back in time."
Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams called for an investigation into the situation and for the officers involved to be placed on modified duty.
The arrest comes after Mayor Bill de Blasio told New York City police officers not to arrest people for smoking marijuana in 2018. Criminal defense attorney Rebecca Kavanagh decried the use of force for simple marijuana possession as unnecessary.
"As much as watching the video is shocking, it's not extraordinary," Kavanagh told the Washington Examiner. "This is what people I represent describe to me as how they are arrested. It's not an unusual circumstance."
In New York state, marijuana is decriminalized, although a person can still be stopped, ticketed, or arrested for possession or smoking the drug after the state passed new laws regarding the substance in August. Possession of less than two ounces of marijuana is treated as a violation, and possession of amounts above two ounces is categorized as a misdemeanor.
Kavanagh confirmed that police have the authority to arrest a suspect if they believe a threat is imminent or if the person has a past criminal record. However, she admonished the officers in the video for the level of force they used to subdue the unarmed man.
"The police, although they have the right to arrest you, their use of force has to be proportionate," Kavanagh added. "Police don't have the right to do whatever they want. Although we see so much brutality in the way people are arrested, and I think people become almost conditioned to think that's what a normal arrest looks like, now, that's not legal. That isn't what an arrest is supposed to be. That's definitely excessive force."
In New York, as in other urban sites that have decriminalized the substance, smoking marijuana in public is commonplace. In New York, however, black and brown people are overwhelmingly targeted for stops by the police. A New York Times report on minorities arrested for marijuana violations found that marijuana arrests in the Brooklyn area were four times as high as those in predominantly white areas such as Greenpoint.

Texto completo: Rosalind “Roz” Walter, the inspiration for the “Rosie the Riveter” persona, died Wednesday at the age of 95.
Walter grew up in a wealthy home on Long Island, New York, but when World War II broke out, she decided to join millions of other women and work in a factory to help support the American war effort, according to the New York Times. She was a riveter who worked the night shift at a plant in Connecticut.
A newspaper column detailed her work driving rivets into metal fighter planes, a job that was typically done by men. That column was the inspiration for the patriotic 1942 song "Rosie the Riveter."
“All the day long, whether rain or shine, she’s a part of the assembly line. She’s making history, working for victory — Rosie, brrrrr, the Riveter,” the lyrics for iconic the song read.
Despite being the inspiration for Rosie the Riveter, other models posed for posters and magazine covers depicting the iconic figure, including the "We Can Do It!" poster.
Later in life, Walter became a philanthropist who backed public television and programs on PBS. She was also the largest single contributor to WNET in New York, financing 67 shows since 1978.
“She cared deeply about the public being informed and felt that public television and media is the best way to accomplish this,” said Allison Fox, WNET’s senior director for major gifts.
She is survived by her son, Henry Thompson; two grandchildren; four step-grandchildren; and many step-great-grandchildren.

Mass immigration is now about 'racial justice,' not America's best interests

Texto completo: The social justice maniacs know nothing outside of grievance and oppression. It is a hopeless task to convince them that their perpetual victimhood is repulsive to normal people.
Case in point: New York Times reporter Jason DeParle went on a fool's errand and tried to convince a bunch of immigration activists that their cause might see greater success if they made sound, logical arguments about the alleged benefits of allowing hundreds of thousands of foreigners into the United States.
Naturally, it didn’t take. As I exhaustively explain in Privileged Victims: How America’s Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People, there is no reasoning with the social justice mob.
It’s not interested in arguments or appeals to reason. It’s only interested in demanding that the “privileged” (heterosexuals, whites, men) make amends for the “oppressed” (ethnic minorities, women, gays, transgender people).
DeParle wrote in his piece that Democrats and pro-immigrant activists could try selling their proposal for the mass importation of foreigners by explaining its economic benefits.
Their response: No thanks! And really, what did you expect — they don't believe in economics anyway.
“If you want me to give you some top-level GDP number, that’s just not my voice,” activist Lorella Praeli, an immigrant herself, told DeParle. “I would just go to the story of self.”
Cristina Jiménez, the co-founder of one pro-immigration group, said, “We grounded the organization in a much deeper analysis of racial justice. We do not separate our experience as immigrants from the experiences of brown and black people in this country.”
You know that trite “nation of immigrants” catchphrase Democrats are so fond of? The social justice crew finds it ... problematic.
“We’re also a nation of native people who were victims of genocide and African-American people who were brought here in slavery,” Jiménez told DeParle. “There’s something about the system that’s going after us for the color of our skin.”
See? Hopeless.
As delusional as it is, the social justice people sincerely believe that immigration should not be a matter of bringing in the best people for America's sake. It’s a matter of righting the wrongs involve in America’s inherent immorality.
“Rather than celebrate immigrant achievement, some activists call the ‘good immigrant’ narrative a pernicious story line that requires newcomers to prove their worth,” wrote DeParle. “When the California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, praised Dreamers last year for becoming doctors and nurses, critics said he reinforced a harmful trope.”
Ah, I get it now. The social justice crowd supports unfettered, unregulated immigration so that more people can come to the U.S. and fail ... and if they can attend social justice protests year-round, that's good, too.
It’s hopeless.

Democratic voters are not just racist but also sexist

Texto completo: When Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris dropped out the 2020 Democratic primary, members of the press blamed the failures of their campaigns on the racism of the American people.

Now, on March 5, following Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s announcement that she, too, is dropping out of the race, members of the press are blaming her failure on the sexism of the American people.

Those poor Democratic primary voters. You think members of the press would have a higher opinion of them by now, considering these are the same voters who placed President Obama in the White House and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Guess not!

“America Punished Elizabeth Warren for Her Competence,” declared a headline published this week by the Atlantic.
The op-ed adds, “The country still doesn’t know what to make of a woman—in politics, and beyond—who refuses to qualify her success."

“Elizabeth Warren Could Never Escape The Baggage Of Being A ‘Female Candidate,’” mourned HuffPost. “She was qualified. She persisted. But sexism still mattered.”

The requiem adds, “Warren couldn’t just run for president. At every step of the campaign, she was reminded that people still saw her as a female candidate, with all the baggage that comes with that designation ― questions about her toughness, likability and relatability.”

Elsewhere, at MSNBC, reporter Ali Vitali disagreed with HuffPost's thesis, arguing instead that it was Warren herself who made her supposed “baggage” a chief selling point of her candidacy.

"This campaign was unabashedly feminist every single day that we were out here on the campaign trail,” said Vitali. “We obviously know now that we have two septuagenarian white men now left for Democratic voters to choose from."

Said CBS News’ Caitlin Huey-Burns, “We cannot talk about Warren's fall without talking about the sexism still so prevalent in American politics.”

Yes, we can!

CNN contributor Wajahat Ali added with his own special brand of commentary, “It's a shame that this country hasn't elected a woman president yet. The double standard and misogyny still runs deep.”

“One of Warren's greatest obstacles: Democratic voters overlearning from 2016 that no woman could win, when there were so many other factors in Hillary's defeat (Comey, trust issues, Russia) in addition to the sexism & misogyny. It's yet another costly legacy of Hillary's loss,” said Pro-Publica’s Alec MacGillis, rattling off a well-worn list of excuses for why the corporate swamp monster the Democrats nominated in 2016 lost to a former game show host.

It goes on like this for quite a while, so I will spare you the bulk of the complaints. Before we go, though, there is one particularly amusing complaint about the demise of the Warren 2020 campaign, and it comes from feminist commentator Jessica Valenti.

“It Will Be Hard to Get Over What Happened to Elizabeth Warren,” reads the headline to her post-mortem on the senator’s campaign. “I’ve had to come to terms with America’s sexism again and again.”

She adds, "[W]e had the candidate of a lifetime — someone with the energy, vision, and follow-through to lead the country out of our nightmarish era — and that the media and voters basically outright erased and ignored her."

This is such a load of nonsense.
Warren got the most speaking time of any candidate in the July 30 debate, the October 15 debate, the January 14 debate, and the Feb. 19 debate. The senator also won endorsements from the New York Times, the Des Moines Register, and the Boston Globe ahead of key state primaries and caucuses.

When the news media were not explicitly endorsing Warren, they were implicitly endorsing her with praise and approving coverage. In terms of enjoying positive, friendly news coverage and commentary, no one had it better in the 2020 primary than Elizabeth Warren. Other than all of that, yeah, Valenti makes a great point about the media’s alleged erasure of the Massachusetts’s senator.
Could sexism have played a role in Warren's failure? Maybe, to some degree. But to say it was the chief thing that destroyed her candidacy is not only lazy and cheap commentary but it is also an insult to all the Democratic primary voters who have shown already that they do not have that big of a hang-up handing a woman their party's nomination.
Maybe – just maybe! – Warren was a bad candidate.

Texto completo: Former 2020 candidate Andrew Yang is launching a nonprofit group to advocate for policies he championed during his failed presidential campaign.
Yang announced his new venture, called Humanity Forward, on Thursday. The group will push for policies such as recognizing personal data as property and establishing a universal basic income, according to the New York Times.
"We knew we wanted to keep the movement growing. The only question was what form that would take," Yang said. "I have to say, I’m super excited about it … My hands were tied as a political candidate, to some extent, and now I get to work."
Humanity First will push for Yang’s politics in conferences and through a podcast with the former Democratic presidential candidate tentatively titled Let Yang Speak.
Yang has already gathered several large financiers to donate to his nonprofit group, such as venture capitalist Albert Wenger and entrepreneur Susan Danziger, who together pledged $500,000 to the group.
Yang dropped out of the presidential race on Feb. 11 after a disappointing showing in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. Yang’s long-shot bid never gained much momentum, but the relatively unknown tech entrepreneur outlasted governors, senators, and other experienced politicians.
Yang has since joined CNN as a contributor to comment on the 2020 election cycle. He has also been in discussions with the campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden to potentially join Biden as a running mate in the general election. Yang has also weighed leveraging his political gains from his presidential campaign into a run for mayor of New York City.

Texto completo: Talk about a head-spinner. Just a few days ago, Joe Biden’s candidacy was being prepped for burial, while Bernie Sanders’ revolution was considered unstoppable. But after the Biden blowout in South Carolina, Super Tuesday voters decided to shake things up.
As the results came rolling in, from east to west, political anchors delivered a breathless play-by-play of how Biden and Sanders were divvying up the map and turning this into a two-man race. Their remaining major rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bloomberg, registered as little more than afterthoughts.
Warren came in third in her home state of Massachusetts, behind both Biden and Sanders. Bloomberg dropped out and threw his support to Biden.
And so, after all the tumult, the Democratic race has come down to this: Two straight white septuagenarian men fighting over the soul of the party — whatever that turns out to be.
Biden and Sanders have many fine qualities. Either would make a better president than the unstable man-child currently degrading the office. That said, for the party of progress, youth and diversity, a final face-off between two lifelong politicians born during World War II leaves much to be desired. And it says something depressing about the challenges female candidates still confront in their quest to shatter the presidential glass ceiling.
In the early days of this race, voters had a range of women to consider, some more conventionally qualified than others. There were four senators, a congresswoman and a self-help guru who varied in age, race, personal background and professional experience. They hailed from different regions, had different political styles and visions and espoused different policies.
One by one, these candidates fizzled and fell away: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who had pitched herself as a champion of women’s issues; Sen. Kamala Harris of California, the tough-talking former prosecutor; Marianne Williamson, with her premonitions of dark psychic forces; and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the Midwestern moderate who hit her high point with a third-place finish in New Hampshire. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is hanging on but has never been more than a curiosity (though she did come in second to Bloomberg in the caucuses in American Samoa on Tuesday).
For a while last fall, Warren was the candidate with the mojo. But she came under heavy fire from her rivals, seemed to flip-flop on Medicare for all, stumbled and never recovered. Faring poorly in the early contests, she all but vanished from the discussion. Even before Tuesday, her campaign acknowledged that a path to the nomination would require her to somehow triumph at a brokered convention.
Put more simply: She’s done.
It’s impossible to know the degree to which gender factors into a candidate’s political appeal, or lack thereof, especially at the presidential level. Man or woman, winning the presidency is not merely — or even largely — a question of merit. Americans are forever seeking that indefinable spark — a secret blend of strength and likability, authority and relatability, a talent for inspiring and connecting with voters.
Warren is thought to have struggled in part because she was too professorial — too schoolmarmish, if you will — to connect with anyone beyond white college-educated women like herself. But had she focused on her up-by-the-bootstraps biography, who’s to say she wouldn’t have been slammed as inauthentic or as trying too hard? As for complaints that she was too strident or shrill or hectoring or inflexible, have any of these critics seen Bernie Sanders? Come on.
This is one of the vexing realities that plague highly accomplished female candidates like Warren or Hillary Clinton, women whose résumés outstrip those of many of their male rivals. They have been told their whole lives that they have to outwork and outperform the men in order to be taken seriously — only to discover that it’s not enough. It was one thing when Clinton lost the 2008 primary to Barack Obama. Despite his relative inexperience, he was a rare political talent with the added appeal of making history as America’s first black president. But to lose in 2016 to Donald Trump ? Winning the popular vote is cold comfort in a race that should never have been close.
Or consider Klobuchar’s conspicuous irritation with Pete Buttigieg’s precocity. On multiple occasions she noted that a woman with his résumé — a 38-year-old former mayor of the fourth-largest city in Indiana — would never be taken seriously. “Women are held to a higher standard,” she said at the November debate. “Otherwise we could play a game called ‘Name Your Favorite Woman President,’ which we can’t do because it has all been men, including all vice presidents being men.”
Whatever your feelings about Mayor Pete, Klobuchar was not wrong.
It’s hard for any candidate to get the formula right. For women, it is harder because of a host of unconscious biases.
As often noted, there have been reams of research on this topic, most of it discouraging. The problem goes beyond voters who hold traditional views of gender roles or admit that they wouldn’t be comfortable with a Madam President. More subtly, ambitious women are viewed more negatively than men, while women leaders are often considered less legitimate than men, in the United States, at least.
Studies also show that, whatever their particular pros and cons, women candidates are regarded as inherently less electable. You see this in polls where a high percentage of respondents claim that they are ready to elect a female president, but far fewer believe that their neighbors are.
That perception has had particular resonance in a cycle where a candidate’s ability to beat Trump has been the overriding concern for most Democrats. And with the sting of Clinton’s defeat still painful, many in the party were hesitant to take a chance on another woman.
Last summer, a poll on perceived electability by Avalanche Strategies found that gender appeared to be a bigger issue than “age, race, ideology, or sexual orientation.” When voters were asked whom they’d pick if the primaries were held today, Biden came out ahead. When asked whom they would make president with the wave of a magic wand, without the candidate needing to win an election, voters went with Warren. Women were more likely than men to cite gender as a concern.
Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight lamented that such anxiety can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. “So there are a lot of women who might not vote for a woman because they’re worried that other voters won’t vote for her. But if everyone just voted for who they actually wanted to be president, the woman would win!”
Early on, there was speculation that this time the dynamic would be different. With multiple women in the running, perhaps the discussion could move past the tired trope that says: Of course, I’d support a woman for president, just not that woman.
It’s something to think about over the next few months as we’re watching two old guys fight for the privilege of taking on another old guy in November.

Resumen: In a crazy, crowded primary election, Democrats show their ultimate goal with high turnout across the country.

Texto completo: The best news for Democrats in the Super Tuesday results may not be the surge of Joe Biden, or Bernie Sanders hanging on, or even Mike Bloomberg dropping out (although I am personally extra thrilled about that). No, the best news is the record and near record turnout of Democratic voters all across the country. Whoever the eventual nominee is, it’s clear that Democrats are fired up and ready to vote to defeat Donald Trump.
In Virginia, Democratic primary turnout was the highest on record, surpassing the previous record set in 2008. In fact, 23% of registered Virginians cast ballots on Super Tuesday, which almost doubled primary turnout from 2016.
Utah saw a turnout in Tuesday’s Democratic primary that eclipsed previous turnout for any primary held in the state, among Democrats or Republicans.
In North Carolina, voter turnout was also up over 2016 numbers. And early voting had a strong surge — with almost twice as many Democrats in the state casting early ballots compared with Republicans.
Record-breaking voter turnouts
Numbers are still being crunched, but U. S. News and World Report detailed high turnout across the country. Early evidence suggests that Texas saw an increase of nearly a half-million primary ballots cast over 2016 numbers. In Maine, turnout was so high that many polling stations ran out of Democratic primary ballots.
And that’s all on top of record turnout in both South Carolina and New Hampshire.
Plus, according to the Human Rights Campaign, LGBTQ voters doubled their representation in Super Tuesday turnout, over previous primary elections.
Other outcomes from the Super Tuesday primaries are still being analyzed, but The New York Times has reported on how Latino voters are expected to provide a decisive surge in California, Texas and beyond.
In other words, if you’re looking for your silver lining, Democrats, I got it right here. In a crazy, crowded primary election in which the only thing Democrats consistently seem able to agree on is that they want to defeat Trump, in the primary elections Democrats are indeed enthusiastically showing up.
Mastio and Lawrence: Joe Biden won because money couldn't buy Bloomberg Super Tuesday love
Let’s be honest, there are and have been some amazing Democratic presidential candidates in this election, but no single candidate has yet galvanized a strong and enduring majority of support. That could certainly change any day, but it’s notable to see record turnout in primaries when there’s not excitement around some single candidate driving that turnout — as we saw, for instance, with Barack Obama in 2008. You’ve got Democrats turning up in record numbers in Utah to nominate Sanders and Democrats turning up in record numbers in South Carolina to nominate Biden.
The through line doesn’t appear to be any one candidate but, rather, Democratic enthusiasm and energy. We’re just chomping at the bit to vote for anyone but Trump.
Trump and GOP can't stop us
To be clear, there are some clouds in this silver lining. Young voters aren’t turning out at the levels that helped put Obama in the White House and that would certainly help put Democrats over the top this fall. In Texas, for instance, NBC News’ exit polls show that the share of Democratic primary voters over the age of 65 was almost twice as high as in 2008, and still overrepresented compared with the state’s growing younger population.
There are also concerns about suppression. Part of the record lines reported at polling stations across our nation might have had to do with record turnout, but they also stemmed from Republicans shuttering polling locations and imposing new ID requirements, making voters work even harder and wait even longer to cast their ballots.
For instance, when CNN’s Ed Lavandera tweeted about a man at Texas Southern University who spent nearly seven hours waiting to be able to cast his vote, commentator and advocate Keith Boykin noted, “Texas has closed 750 polling places since 2012, many in black and brown communities, causing long lines and waits. ”
It's math: Warren has the chance to unite the left by endorsing Sanders
What is extraordinarily and unfortunately clear is that Trump and Republicans don’t want an election that includes every voter and treats them equally, just like they don’t want our nation to include all of us and treat all of us equally.
And while it is not yet clear who Democrats will nominate as our standard-bearer to face Trump and the GOP in this existential, epoch-defining electoral battle in November, it is increasingly clear that Democrats are fired up for that fight — and in spite of all the obstacles, going to damn well make sure our voices are heard. While we don’t yet know who is the ultimate winner of this raucous, energetic Democratic primary, Trump is the loser.

Kristof: Is this coronavirus ‘the Big One’?

Texto completo: Alice Wolowitz, a student nurse, began her shift at a hospital one morning in Philadelphia. She fell sick during the shift, rapidly declined and was dead that night.
That was 1918, and people were collapsing and dying everywhere from a Spanish flu pandemic. Philadelphia’s 31 hospitals were full and turning away patients, who offered huge bribes to get in. Police officers with surgical masks were sent to pick up bodies from homes, but 33 police officers died within weeks.
“In virtually every home, someone was ill,” John Barry wrote in his book about that pandemic, “The Great Influenza.” “People were already avoiding each other, turning their heads away if they had to talk, isolating themselves. The telephone company increased the isolation: With 1,800 telephone company operators out, the phone company allowed only emergency calls.”
Sports events were canceled. Theaters closed. Shaking hands was made illegal in Prescott, Arizona. Philadelphia hurriedly set up six more morgues. Families put crepe paper on doorways to signal a death inside — and crepe was everywhere.
That Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, which killed at least 50 million people worldwide, has been the benchmark for pandemics ever since. For decades public health experts have called for preparations for another “big one” — yet adequate preparations were never made.
Nobody knows if the coronavirus will be a “big one,” for it may still fizzle. As of this writing, only one person is known to have died from it in the United States, while thousands routinely die annually from the seasonal flu. But increasingly, experts are saying that we should get ready just in case.
“Are we seeing a replay of 1918?” asked the New England Journal of Medicine, a publication not associated with alarmism. Bill Gates, who for years has been warning presciently about the danger of pandemics, bluntly cautions that this virus could be a “once-in-a-century pandemic.”
“I hope it’s not that bad, but we should assume that it will be until we know otherwise,” Gates said, and that seems prudent.
While figures are uncertain, the coronavirus may kill 2% of those infected; if correct, that would be similar to the lethality of the 1918 flu (it’s also possible that many more people are infected without significant symptoms, which would make the death rate quite a bit lower). Another similarity with 1918 is that the United States and the world are unready for a pandemic.
“We’re amazingly unprepared,” Dr. Irwin Redlener, a Columbia University professor and director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness, told me.
President Donald Trump exaggerates threats from caravans of migrants or from a hobbled Iran, and he has diverted billions of dollars from the military to build a border wall that smugglers hack apart with $100 saws. But he has not been attuned to pandemic threats: In 2018 the White House removed the position on the National Security Council to fight pandemics, while seeking to scale back anti-pandemic work to about 10 countries from 49. Experts warned at the time that this was dangerously shortsighted.
At a time when we need wise, scientifically informed leadership, we find ourselves with a president with little credibility and an antagonistic relationship with scientists. It doesn’t help that during the Ebola crisis of 2014, Trump was one of the most fiery critics of evidence-driven policies that actually succeeded in ending the outbreak.
The United States is also vulnerable because of long-standing deficiencies in our health care system. We are the only major rich country without universal health insurance and paid sick leave, and we have fewer doctors per capita than peer countries.
Consider a Florida man, Osmel Martinez Azcue, who returned from China and found himself becoming sick. As the Miami Herald reported, he might normally have gone to a drugstore and bought over-the-counter flu medicine. But because of the risk of coronavirus he did the responsible thing and sought medical attention: He went to a hospital for testing. In the end, it turned out not to be coronavirus — but he was billed $3,270.
We must ensure that no one is deterred from seeking help by the costs. The White House and Congress should immediately establish a system to ensure that patients need not pay for coronavirus testing and treatment. We should also ensure paid sick leave. Do we really want to go to a restaurant where a coughing, sneezing food preparer still goes to work out of financial need?
William Haseltine, the president of a think tank called Access Health International, told me that a vaccine might take at least six to eight months to develop and test — some other estimates are longer — and this should involve an immediate federal investment through Project BioShield. We also need better diagnostics and treatment as well as more ventilators to keep people alive.
Dr. Peter Jay Hotez, an expert on global health at Baylor University, emphasized to me the need to support front-line health workers and keep them from becoming infected.
“If we see a situation in the U.S. like we saw in Wuhan — more than 1,000 cases among hospital workers and five or six deaths — it’s game over,” he said. “Health workers lose confidence, and things start to fall apart.”
Hotez said that one crucial step is simply ensuring that all health workers have enough personal protective equipment.
We may also have to think about reducing occasions when people are crowded together; that may mean more people working from home to avoid offices, buses and subways. It may mean avoiding sports events, school assemblies, parties and even unnecessary visits to crowded doctor’s offices; this is a time to develop telemedicine.
I have two family graduations this spring, and who knows if they will take place? Experts can’t answer the questions that we all have, but they say that we will get through better if we make preparations while relying on science and evidence rather than on muddled political leaders trying to talk up markets or score political points.
The legendary Joshua Lederberg, a geneticist and Nobel Prize laureate, once said that in the struggle against new diseases, “It’s our wits versus their genes.” If we want our wits to triumph, we will need to think clearly, prepare for the worst — and do better.

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams. In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to re-frame my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape. "
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out Friday, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie-rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and her U. S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much. " It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again. "
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us", having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this. " But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works. " So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer.
Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road. )
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in the New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Texto completo: The Tuesday Morning Book Club at Cole Library will have its next meeting March 24 from 9:30 - 11a.m. in the third floor conference room. All are welcome to join. If you have any questions, please contact Sherene Player at 319-535-1105.
At the March meeting, the group will be reading and discussing the book An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System: A Tale in Four Lives by Matt Richtel. Kathy Ormond will lead the discussion.
Though it was chosen in October, the selection is particularly timely, given the concerns of Coronavirus.
From the publisher comes this summary of the book:
"A grand tour of the human immune system and the secrets of health, by the Pulitzer Prize–winning New York Times journalist.
"A terminal cancer patient rises from the grave. A medical marvel defies HIV. Two women with autoimmunity discover their own bodies have turned against them. Matt Richtel's An Elegant Defense uniquely entwines these intimate stories with science's centuries-long quest to unlock the mysteries of sickness and health, and illuminates the immune system as never before.
"The immune system is our body's essential defense network, a guardian vigilantly fighting illness, healing wounds, maintaining order and balance, and keeping us alive. Its legion of microscopic foot soldiers - from T cells to 'natural killers' - patrols our body, linked by a nearly instantaneous communications grid. It has been honed by evolution over millennia to face an almost infinite array of threats.
"For all its astonishing complexity, however, the immune system can be easily compromised by fatigue, stress, toxins, advanced age, and poor nutrition - hallmarks of modern life - and even by excessive hygiene. Paradoxically, it is a fragile wonder weapon that can turn on our own bodies with startling results, leading today to epidemic levels of autoimmune disorders.
"Richtel effortlessly guides readers on a scientific detective tale winding from the Black Plague to 20th-century breakthroughs in vaccination and antibiotics, to the cutting-edge laboratories that are revolutionizing immunology - perhaps the most extraordinary and consequential medical story of our time.
"Drawing on his groundbreaking reporting for the New York Times and based on extensive new interviews with dozens of world-renowned scientists, Matt Richtel has produced a landmark book, equally an investigation into the deepest riddles of survival and a profoundly human tale that is movingly brought to life through the eyes of his four main characters, each of whom illuminates an essential facet of our 'elegant defense.'"

Warren's campaign had an outsize impact on Democratic politics

Texto completo: She didn't win a single state, amassed only a handful of delegates, and placed a dismal third in her own state. But Senator Elizabeth Warren nonetheless had an outsize influence on the 2020 presidential race, one that will extend to the Democratic convention and beyond.
From modernizing retail politics with her joyful “selfie" lines to her meaty policy proposals to elevating many progressive ideas into the mainstream, she formed the contours of the contest.
“She not only shaped this race, but I think she is going to have a dramatic impact on future presidential races," said Representative Katherine Clark, a Melrose Democrat, who had endorsed Warren.
But history may most remember her candidacy, analysts said, for her political disembowelment on national TV of billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who many Democratic voters desperate to defeat Trump believed could be the best suited for the job. She effectively ended his campaign in about 40 seconds.
Her takedown of the eighth-richest man in the world not only made for exciting television, but it also instantly altered the political terrain and contributed to the rapid winnowing in the field's moderate lane in favor of former vice president Joe Biden.
“Taking on Bloomberg the way she did clearly had a massive impact on his candidacy. There's no two ways about that," said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist who managed Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign.
Warren's influence went further than proving even half a billion dollars can't buy you a presidential nomination, political strategists said. The Cambridge Democrat, whose catchphrase centered on having a plan for everything, drove many of the dominant policy conversations in the race, even as she paid a price for her specificity on issues such as Medicare for All.
Her juggernaut of a policy shop forced rivals to play catch-up and flesh out their own platforms.
“She pushed the field. She came with ideas," said Julie McClain Downey, who was director of state communications for Senator Cory Booker's presidential campaign and a veteran of Hillary Clinton's 2016 race.
Several strategists credited Warren's signature wealth tax — and the way she pitched it to voters — as particularly consequential.
Brian Fallon, a former top campaign aide to Clinton, said there have been two key moments in the last several years that signaled the evolution of Democratic thinking and comfort levels on raising taxes on the wealthy. The first was Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggesting in a “60 Minutes" interview that a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the richest Americans could pay for the Green New Deal climate change plan.
The other was Warren's proposed 2 percent wealth tax, he said. And not just the plan, but the way she broke down the substance into an easily understandable concept of mega-rich people paying two cents out of every dollar of their net worth over $50 million. So simple, her supporters turned it into a rallying cry at her events: “Two cents! Two cents!"
“I think that has totally shifted the window. It has created the political permission structure for Democrats to call for much higher taxes on the wealthy" and not spend a second worrying about the political fallout, which had hampered the party on the issue since the 1980s, Fallon said.
Warren, by contrast, appeared to relish the angst her proposal evoked from the ultra-wealthy, weaving in good-natured scorn of freaked-out billionaires into her stump speeches, selling mugs to hold all those “billionaire tears," and even cutting a TV ad calling on billionaires to share the wealth that slammed four of them by name and net worth.
The polling backed her strategy up, finding more than 60 percent of Americans supported the concept. Indeed, her case has been so convincing, even former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin — whose brand of Wall Street-friendly economic policy is exactly what Warren has focused her entire political career fighting against — said this week that moderate Democrats “must recognize the popular resonance of a wealth tax," even if they don't support it.
“A wealth tax is on the table," he wrote in a New York Times op-ed.
“She clearly furthered the progressive agenda," said pollster John Zogby. “For a while, she really owned those issues as far as people were talking about them. . . . [Senator Bernie Sanders has] been saying the same stuff. She mainstreamed it.“
Warren furthered the work Clinton started in her ground-breaking runs for president.
Clark said Warren's candidacy was powerful because she elevated issues that resonate with women and everyday families, talking about her own experiences as a single mother and her parents' financial struggles and connecting those stories with her policy prescriptions.
“She's not only a model for girls with her pinkie swears around the country, but she really did set a standard for how to cede families the pain many of them are in and how to make that into bold policy" to address their struggles, said Clark.
And while Warren's departure means Americans yearning for a woman president must wait at least four more years, as she emotionally noted at her press conference Thursday, she disrupted the prevailing power dynamics surrounding the male dominance of presidential politics, said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, in an e-mail.
“She was willing to call out gender bias directly and, as is consistent with all she does, explain it as a means to combating it," Dittmar said. “For example, when she was called angry, she pushed back by noting that women are subject to this criticism 'over and over' again as a way to discredit them."
Warren not only wounded Bloomberg, calling out his alleged mistreatment of women and shaming him to release three women from nondisclosure agreements so they could freely speak about their experiences at his company, she also played a role in getting MSNBC host Chris Matthews off the air, when he seemed incredulous that she didn't believe Bloomberg's denials.
“She was willing to confront their sexism head on, even when some may have argued the political benefit was minimal and/or not going to [help] her," Dittmar said.
That fearlessness, predict those who know Warren well, will persist long after November.

To defend against coronavirus, MBTA steps up cleaning of crowded trains and stations

Texto completo: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority has begun to aggressively clean and disinfect transit stations and vehicles in response to the global spread of the coronavirus, joining other transit agencies taking precautions to safeguard an area of daily life that is potentially among the most risky during an outbreak.
On Wednesday, the agency began a major push inside stations to disinfect anything people touch — such as hand rails, elevator buttons, and fare equipment — as frequently as every four hours.
“It was important for us to take this next step," MBTA general manager Steve Poftak said at a news briefing. “We are stepping up our level of disinfection." Every T vehicle, Poftak said, will be disinfected on a daily basis starting later this week.
The T is not alone in boosting its cleaning initiatives. New York transit officials on Monday said they would begin a major effort to regularly use industrial-grade disinfectant on all its equipment every 72 hours after a commuter was confirmed to have the virus, according to The New York Times. In Washington State, where the coronavirus has killed ten people, officials said they would boost efforts to clean all surfaces bus riders come into contact with.
These cleaning initiatives are the most tangible response transit agencies can take to fight the spread of disease, said Polly Hanson, the senior director of security, risk, and emergency management for the American Public Transit Association.
“A transit agency might have done [cleaning] every week. Now they're doing it every day," Hanson said. “Those are localized decisions, but transit agencies are enhancing the cleaning of everything."
But Hanson noted that many of the same concerns about the coronavirus are true of other diseases that spread this time of year, such as the flu. She said transit riders should avoid touching surfaces as much as they can and wash their hands after each trip, while agencies should regularly remind workers about proper hygiene.
Public transit is a potentially risky location amid a viral outbreak because of the prospect of crowding and close contact with other riders, said Tom Russo, a doctor and expert in infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo.
“You've got a contained subway car, so if somebody is coughing and everybody is standing and holding on, you're pretty close to somebody," Russo said. "Let's say you're going to a Celtics game. It's probably not quite as bad. It's not quite as confined or close quarters."
That makes it all the more important that commuters who are sick stay home, and if they feel sick while in transit, they should take steps to protect other riders, such as coughing into their elbow.
Some industry watchers have posited that commuters will avoid public transit during the virus scare. For example, Doug Anmuth, an analyst with JP Morgan who follows ride-hailing companies, wrote in a research note that shares of Lyft could go up because “people would be more likely to use rideshare than a crowded bus or subway," though Lyft may also be hurt by a decrease in overall travel, especially to airports.
In Massachusetts, there has been one confirmed case of coronavirus, from a Boston resident, and one presumptive case. Boston public health officials said the person with the confirmed case has not left his home since being diagnosed. The state's public health department also said that residents who are under self-quarantine — currently, more than 250 people — should call health authorities before traveling if they feel ill.
The T's initiative to clean station surfaces every four hours began Wednesday, MBTA spokeswoman Lisa Battiston said, up from once a day. She added that the work does not require more workers beyond existing in-station staff and cleaning crews, “though staffing needs will continue to be reviewed with increases to staff where necessary."
“This effort is not a deep-clean of the entirety of the station, but a targeted focus on high-contact areas including things like fare vending machines, push bars on doors, elevator buttons, and hand rails of stairways and escalators," Battiston said.
Poftak cautioned that the cleaning schedule depends on getting enough commercial-grade disinfectant on hand. Right now, the agency has enough to clean every commuter rail car each day; he estimated that by the end of this week, the T will be able to disinfect subway cars, buses, and paratransit vehicles daily.
In addition to increased cleaning, the MBTA will be installing hand sanitizer dispensers in stations, and the agency will display information related to the coronavirus on messaging boards in stations and on trains, Poftak said.
Officials with the Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates Logan Airport, said at the news conference that they are also focusing on regular cleaning of traveler areas.

Texto completo: TAMPA  Florida now meets federal standards for air pollutants for the first time in a decade, and improvements in Hillsborough and Polk counties played an important role in that success, state environmental officials said Wednesday.

The state has been certified by the federal government as meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which track six pollutants dangerous to public health: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide.

Florida had fallen out of compliance in four areas between 2008 and 2010, three having to do with sulfur dioxide and one with lead, said Jeff Koerner, the states director of the Division of Air Resource Management.

To get back into compliance, Florida Department of Environmental Protection officials worked with local industries and communities around the state. Particular improvements were made in Hillsborough, Polk and Nassau counties to reduce emissions in lead and sulfur dioxide, he said.

In Hillsborough and Polk counties, fertilizer companies and a lead acid battery plant reduced emissions. In Nassau County, near Jacksonville, a paper mill cut down on pollutants, Koerner said.

Noah Valenstein, the environmental agencys secretary, praised the collaborative efforts of industry and the state.

Clean air is something we take seriously. Its a big accomplishment. Its important, Valenstein said.

Pollution is still a problem locally. Last fall, a New York Times data analysis showed vehicle emissions had climbed 55 percent since 1990 in the Tampa Bay area. And a national analysis by the Associated Press showed air pollution had increased nationwide in the past few years, partially due to widespread wildfires in the West.

Florida, with a population of more than 21 million people, is the most populous state to meet all six federal air-quality standards.

Why is the Sunshine State an outlier?

I hope were an outlier in the sense that Floridians take the environment very seriously. The governor takes the environment very seriously. Just as were working hard on water quality and preserving lands in Florida, Valenstein said.

In Hillsborough County, local environmental officials touted the accomplishment as an indication of how Tampa Bay has balanced growth and the environment in recent years.

This designation by EPA is significant. Despite our regions considerable growth, we have been able achieve good air quality for our residents, which makes Tampa Bay a great place to live and work, Janet Dougherty, executive director of the Hillsborough Environmental Protection Commission, said in a news release. I am proud of the work by DEP, EPA and the regulated community that have resulted in Hillsborough County meeting all the federal health-based air pollution standards.

Although the federal Environmental Protection Agency has just formally announced total compliance, the process took the better part of seven years, including three years of data collection and extensive modeling by the federal environmental agency.

It just doesnt mean that the work has just happened, Valenstein said.

Maya Burke, science policy coordinator for the Tampa Bay Estuary Program, said she was encouraged by the states announcement, although she hadnt seen the data yet.

It sounds like good news. We know that clean air equals healthy water, she said.

The nitrogen dioxide is the pollutant most dangerous to water quality and marine life in Tampa Bay and one of the six covered in the federal standard. But the nearest monitor for that pollutant is located in Sarasota County, she said.

Burke said getting nitrogen dioxide monitors that can gauge levels of that pollutant in Tampa Bay is a priority for her group.

Texto completo: RIYADH—President Trump produced one of the most memorable photos of his presidency when he placed his hands on a glowing Orb at the opening of a new center to combat Islamic extremism during a visit to Saudi Arabia nearly three years ago.
A flood of memes, jokes, tweets and photoshopped images followed. Some compared the moment to scenes from "The Lord of the Rings," "Star Wars," "Star Trek" and "The Wizard of Oz." The Church of Satan tweeted to let people know it wasn't a satanic ritual.

To this day, visitors from around the world come to Riyadh's Center for Combating Global Extremist Ideology in hopes of laying their hands on the glowing Orb.
"Everybody wants to see it," said Ilan Berman, vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council think tank, who toured the Saudi center in mid-February. "Everyone wants to touch it."
What people like Mr. Berman and most others didn't know is that the famous Orb isn't at the center. It is locked up, largely forgotten, in storage at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh.
The story of the Orb's journey from iconic photo to diplomatic obscurity is almost as surreal as its viral international debut. After the summit, the Orb was carted to the U.S. Embassy, where it was kept in a hallway before being quickly spirited away by diplomats who worried it could steal attention from the new American president on his first international trip, according to people familiar with the events.
U.S. officials have largely stayed mum about it ever since.
Saudi officials created the glass Orb in 2017, weeks before the summit, as a dramatic prop for President Trump's trip. They envisioned the mini-globe serving as a tangible symbol for a fight against extremism that must unite all nations.
Saudi officials charted out a plan for the U.S. president to inaugurate the new center by walking into the operations room with Saudi King Salman where the two men would put their hands on the Orb of the Earth to officially "activate" the center.
A few American officials involved in planning the trip said they worried that having the president touch a glowing Orb in Riyadh might make for a potentially embarrassing moment.
The Orb itself wasn't much to look at. Some U.S. officials compared it to a prop in a high-school play. The bowling-ball size Orb had black silhouettes of the Earth's continents stuck on it.
Share Your Thoughts
What else do you think the government has in storage? Join the conversation below.
Despite their reservations, officials agreed to the Orb-activation plan. Photographers snapped photos of Mr. Trump, King Salman and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi with their hands on the globe, an unearthly light illuminating their faces from below.
Mr. Sisi was never meant to be in the shot, U.S. officials say, but he kept close to Mr. Trump and King Salman as they walked into the center, and joined them in the photo. Mr. Sisi's office didn't respond to a request for comment.
When the event was over, U.S. officials said, an American embassy official asked if he could take it. The Saudis agreed.
Back at the embassy, the Orb was briefly placed on the first floor, close to an entrance.
Some people who knew the Orb was taken to the embassy joked among themselves, channeling the voice of Gollum from "The Lord of the Rings" coveting the Orb the way the movie character covets his "precious," magical ring: "We wants it! We needs it!"
Plenty of people wanted their pictures taken with the famous Orb. Yet senior U.S. officials worried that images would end up on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, that could be embarrassing. So, within a few hours, U.S. officials said, they ordered the Orb removed.
For a while, said people familiar with the events, it was stashed in the empty ambassador's office. (Mr. Trump didn't appoint an ambassador to Saudi Arabia until 18 months after the visit.)
Then the Orb was moved into a more permanent storage spot in the embassy—exactly where U.S. officials won't say.
The State Department didn't respond to requests for comment.
The Orb's move has even earned a mention in a biography of the Saudi crown prince, by New York Times reporter Ben Hubbard, which comes out on Tuesday.
The Saudis actually created two Orbs for the 2017 event. The Orb upon which Mr. Trump, the Saudi King and the Egyptian president laid their hands on rested on one side of the room. Its twin was on the other.
Visitors to the Riyadh center can see the second Orb, which still sits in the operations room as a ceremonial prop.
Saudi officials at the center, known as Etidal, said they gave the Orb as a gift to the U.S. Embassy. The other remains at the center.
"We are proud of it, and it is displayed to all visitors of Etidal," a written statement from the center said. While many visitors want to touch it, not everyone gets the chance.
Jonathan Schanzer, vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank, said he was excited to see the Orb when he took a tour last year and hoped to lay his hands on the glass. No touching the Orb, he said he was instructed by the center's staff. Mr. Schanzer was crestfallen.
"Alas," he said, "the life of a small fry..."

joe mahoney/Richmond Times-Dispatch
An employee at Consolidated Laboratories' Virginia Public Health Laboratory tests a sample for the coronavirus Wednesday in Richmond,
Initial kits were flawed, sometimes gave results that were faulty
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday the U.S. is supposed to see increased testing for COVID-19 this week, but only after the federal government received criticism for its initial outbreak reaction, which hurt the response efforts of local health jurisdictions in Washington and the U.S.
The first test kits sent out last month for the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, had flaws and sometimes gave faulty results.
Those flawed kits meant that states had to ship their tests to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia, which could mean waiting five days for test results, according to The Seattle Times. It wasn't until late last week that Washington, and other states, got the ability to test for COVID-19 at its state laboratory in Shoreline.
“It dramatically slowed down testing until now,” said Chunhuei Chi, the director of the Center for Global Health at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Ore.
COVID-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family and is a close cousin to the SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past.
There have been at least 80 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, according to the CDC, and the disease has killed 11 people in the U.S. At least 39 cases are in Washington, where 10 deaths have occurred, with the majority from a long-term care facility in Kirkland. Clark County is awaiting results on eight tests for COVID-19, and the results should return this week.
Clark County Public Health Officer Dr. Alan Melnick told The Columbian on Tuesday that he wouldn't be surprised if all eight tests return negative, since there are lots of respiratory illnesses circulating now. Cowlitz County has had three negative tests, according to The Daily News.
Since there were testing problems initially, fewer carriers of the virus were identified, which hurts containment efforts, said Paul Drain, an assistant professor in the Departments of Global Health, Medicine (Infectious Diseases), and Epidemiology at the University of Washington.
Melnick told The Columbian Tuesday “it would have been great if there were more testing early on.”
Danielle Koenig, a spokeswoman with the Washington Department of Health, told The Columbian in an email that the state had tested 99 samples from 56 people as of March 1. Their testing capacity is about 200 specimens per day now, Koenig said, and the state is working with commercial labs to increase testing capacity.
“We are keeping up with the requests,” Koenig said.
Another problem area for testing has been the federal guidelines that allow a person to get tested. Initially, tests were only given to people who had contact with a case or had traveled to an area with exposures. To get a test without meeting either of those thresholds, a person had to have a subjective or confirmed fever with a severe acute lower respiratory infection, such as pneumonia, requiring hospitalization and no other explained diagnosis, such as influenza, according to the CDC.
Restrictions lifted
On Wednesday, Pence lifted all restrictions on testing, and made it so patients would only need a doctor's request. He also said that about 2,500 test kits for more than 1 million individual tests might be available this week, according to the New York Times. Another million tests could be manufactured weekly after that, although some legislators expressed skepticism about the government meeting those numbers.
Drain said the country's initial response highlights larger problems in the American health care model. He referenced a SARS outbreak in the early 2000s, and a MERS outbreak in 2012 as opportunities to learn how the U.S. could have better prepared for COVID-19.
“What's been lacking in all of this is not necessarily that we've done a poor job in the last four months, but that we've done a poor job in the last 10 years,” Drain said.
Drain also said hospitals in the American health care system need to do a better job of working together. He said health care has become too fragmented. This, in part, stems from the fact that American medicine puts treatment before prevention, setting its model up around that, Drain said. For example, he said, you'll make more money as a surgeon treating cervical cancer, than as a physician administering HPV vaccines, which can prevent cervical cancer.
“It's the structure we've established in this county,” Drain said. “It's quite backward compared to most other countries in the world.”
Chi said the U.S. has made strides since its struggles with early testing, but stressed that “we are way past advanced planning because we are in it.” He said the influx of confirmed cases recently isn't necessarily because the disease is spreading rapidly, but because testing capacity is increasing.
“If we are not testing, we don't have confirmed cases,” Chi said. “We will be seeing many more cases. They were there before, but we didn't know.”

Goshen - Patrick Joseph Glynn, resident of Goshen, NY, and a parishioner St. John the Evangelist Church in Goshen, NY, died peacefully in his home on Wednesday, March 4, 2020 at the age of 96.
Pat was born in Kilkerrin, County Galway, Ireland, to Michael Glynn and Bridget (Grady) Glynn. In the 1950s, he and all of his siblings left Ireland in pursuit of a better life in the United States. A talented and driven craftsman, Pat was soon hired by James E. Mitchell & Sons, Inc. in New York City as a Construction Superintendent. He remained with the firm for 30 years. Upon retirement, Pat forged a second career as a real estate entrepreneur with a variety of notable investment properties in New York and Florida. In 1998, the New York Times published "A Mill That's Grist for His Passion," a half-page feature on Pat and the 150-year-old grist mill estate he was restoring in Washingtonville, NY.
Pat married Evelyn (McGauley) Glynn in 1992 and had 25 years of wonderful marriage, often splitting time between New York and Florida to be closer to family. During this time, Pat continued to enjoy his craftsman projects and expanded his hobbies to include concrete sculpture, music, and collecting antique engines. Throughout his life, Pat quietly provided generous help to many loved ones so that they could achieve their dreams.
Pat is survived by his sons Daniel Glynn, Patrick J Glynn Jr. and wife Katie Glynn, grandchildren Patrick J Glynn III and Ava Diane Glynn; brothers Michael Glynn, Thomas Glynn, Lawrence Glynn; sisters Kathleen (Glynn) Koonjy, and Mary (Glynn) Kavanaugh. Patrick was predeceased by his wife Evelyn Glynn, sister Theresa (Glynn) Kipp, first wife Monica (O'Driscoll) Glynn, second wife Diane (Popko) Glynn, and stepson Andre Barral.
The family would like to express its deepest gratitude to Maureen Dyer for her faithful and loving care of Pat and Evelyn over the past 6 years. The family would also like to thank Orange County Hospice for their outstanding assistance.
A Mass of Christian burial will be held 10:00 am on Saturday, March 7, 2020 at St. John the Evangelist R.C. Church, 71 Murray Ave, Goshen, NY.
Burial will be in Christ The King Cemetery, Franklin Lakes, NJ on Saturday at 1:30 pm.

Texto completo: While no cases of coronavirus have yet been confirmed in Maine, officials and organizations across the state are nevertheless preparing for the strong possibility that the infection could arrive here after a few cases were already detected in other New England states including New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
The state is in the process of testing about a dozen new individuals for the COVID-19 virus, while hospitals have been isolating patients who show flu-like symptoms associated with the infection. Schools have been taking extra precautions such as cleaning buses after every use, and health officials have been urging people to thoroughly wash their hands and cover their mouths when they cough.
Although federal health officials have cautioned that soap-and-water work better than alcohol-based sanitizers and that healthy individuals do not need to wear face masks, some Mainers have also been rushing to the store to stock up on masks and sanitizer. At least two Greater Bangor supermarkets had run out of them earlier this week.
Based on a briefing from Maine health officials earlier this week, there is "every reason to believe" COVID-19 will spread to Maine, said Jeff Doran, vice president of clinical services for Northern Light Health, a group of 10 Maine hospitals headquartered in Brewer.
After the state Legislature approved the use of $58,000 to purchase a machine to test patients for coronavirus, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has received the equipment and expects to begin conducting the tests in the next several days, agency spokesman Robert Long said on Thursday. The distribution of kits to state testing labs was previously held up by a problem at the U.S. CDC, NPR has reported.
"The number of requests for testing will increase as the COVID-19 situation continues to rapidly evolve globally and in the United States," Long said. "Moving forward, tests will be conducted at both Maine CDC and U.S. CDC to facilitate prompt results."
In the meantime, Maine CDC has decided to test another 12 or so people for coronavirus after one person was tested last month and came back negative. It has sent those tests to the U.S. CDC and is waiting on the results.
Earlier this week, federal health officials announced that they had expanded the criteria under which patients could be tested for coronavirus, so that any patients with fevers, coughing or shortness of breath may be tested with their doctors' approval, according to the New York Times.
"This is a challenging illness," said Dr. James Clarke, senior physician executive at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor. "It seems to be changing and spreading, so there are constant upgrades of the news and we don't know a lot about it yet."
Like the nine other Maine hospitals in the Northern Light Health network, EMMC has a team of staff from various departments whose job is to monitor and prepare for large-scale incidents such as coronavirus.
That work includes checking whether the hospital has adequate supplies and making sure staff are aware of the need to identify patients with symptoms such as a severe cough or fever, whether the patients have arrived at the emergency room, a walk-in clinic or somewhere else, according to Clarke. When patients show those symptoms, the hospital also informs Maine CDC, which is responsible for determining whether they have COVID-19.
"The majority of those patients do not have a severe illness. They may have a typical flu bug or a respiratory infection of another sort," Clarke said. "But until we're confident, we may put them in isolation in a negative pressure room or a private room. We may ask staff to wear protective garments. The idea is to reduce the likelihood of transmission."
The Bangor School Department has also been taking measures to prepare for the possibility that coronavirus could arrive here.
In an email to families, Superintendent Betsy Webb said that custodians "have been instructed to continue to take extra care with cleaning surfaces and bathrooms" and that the department's school bus service is cleaning vehicles after every run.
Faculty and staff are putting together packets that could be sent home in case schools have to be closed, while the system has started tracking absences of students who report flu-like symptoms, Webb said.
A total of 100 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the U.S. across 13 states, according to the federal government. In New England, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire have each had two confirmed cases, according to the Washington Post.
In Maine, Gov. Janet Mills recently formed a team of state officials to coordinate the response to coronavirus.

Texto completo: The campaign signs were removed from the first-floor window of the Michael Bloomberg office in downtown Spokane on Wednesday morning, hours after the largely self-funded candidate became the latest to drop out of the Democratic presidential field.
Bloomberg's exit from the race was perhaps the most noticeable for Spokane residents who've checked their mailboxes or turned on their TV sets over the past several weeks and been deluged with ads for the former New York City mayor.
Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders emerged as front-runners as the Super Tuesday results poured in and Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren had notably poor outcomes, but the contest is far from decided.
Also unclear to many Spokane County voters who may have already cast their ballots for Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar in Washington's upcoming presidential primary is what will happen to their votes. The answer: They will still have their vote tallied for that candidate when they're first counted on Tuesday.
That's a concept that has proved confusing for some Democratic voters, said Ed Wood, chairman of the Spokane County Democrats. He said Wednesday his office has fielded "hundreds of phone calls" from voters who didn't fully understand the primary system that's in its first year as the sole method of helping to determine which Democrat will compete in the November election.
President Donald Trump was the only Republican on the primary ballot.
"We had calls from people who voted for Pete Buttigieg, asking if they could vote again," Wood said.
The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, had a strong showing in early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, but announced over the weekend he'd be suspending his campaign after poor showings in Nevada and South Carolina.
Laurie Rusch, a local Buttigieg supporter, said she'd initially cast her ballot for him but would be supporting Biden moving forward. Buttigieg endorsed Biden shortly after leaving the race, as did Klobuchar and Bloomberg.
"He asked us as his supporters to support Joe which most of us are doing," Rusch wrote in a message. "I had already submitted my ballot for Pete, but plan on supporting Joe going forward."
Many Democratic campaigns in Washington urged their supporters to wait until near the end of the three-week voting period to cast their ballots, as the field winnowed. There are 13 Democrats on the primary ballot in Washington this year, but only four - Biden, Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard - are still actively campaigning.
Warren's campaign released a statement through its manager on Wednesday indicating the senator was "disappointed with the results" of Tuesday and weighing her options. Before Tuesday's results were reported, Warren's campaign had indicated she'd speak Saturday night at a fundraising and organizing dinner for the Idaho Democratic Party in Boise.
Wood said it is unclear whether local voters were following the advice of the campaigns. The party, at both the local and state levels, has vowed not to publicly support a candidate until after the Tuesday primary.
"Our direction was to vote your ballot like you normally would," Wood said.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Spokane County voters had returned 87,501 ballots, said Mike McLaughlin, the county's elections manager. That's good for a total turnout already of 26.1%; it includes ballots returned by people who have declared support for both parties. McLaughlin said Wednesday he did not have breakdowns of ballot returns by political preference.
For the nonbinding presidential primary in 2016, turnout was 37.4%.
McLaughlin said of the ballots returned, 3,305 had been rejected due to an error in marking party affiliation on the outside of the envelope. To vote in the presidential primary, the voter must declare a party preference, along with a signature. If voters do not, they will receive a letter asking them to do so for their ballot to be counted, he said.
Should those ballots be cast for candidates who have suspended their campaign, they'll still be tallied and used to apportion delegates if that candidate reaches a 15% threshold either at the Congressional district or state level, party officials said. Those delegates would be required during the first round of voting at the national convention in Milwaukee in July to back the candidate according to the primary results.
Things get interesting if any one candidate does not get the 1,991 delegates necessary to secure a majority at the convention, and thus the party's nomination. Rules stipulate that a second ballot would take place, with additional votes from Democratic members of Congress, senators and governors. On that ballot, delegates could vote for whomever they want, and subsequent ballots would be held until one candidate emerged with a majority. That means even candidates who've suspended their campaigns could become viable once again.
In recent election cycles, the so-called "brokered convention" outlined above has been hinted at multiple times in early primary contests, including in the 2016 Republican race. GOP caucus-goers in Spokane that April talked about a potential brokered convention, as both Trump and Ted Cruz appeared to be splitting the vote and incapable of reaching the majority.
But by the end of May, Trump had locked up the delegates necessary for the nomination. Neither party has seen an uncertain nomination going into their national convention for decades. The last nominees to be selected by a brokered convention were Democrat Adlai Stevenson and Republican Dwight Eisenhower, both in 1952.
The New York Times on Wednesday gave Biden an edge in pledged delegates over Sanders, 433-388. But both will likely see Washington state's 107 delegates as a major prize on Tuesday, said Wood.
"I think you're going to see both candidates spending some time in Washington state," Wood said.
Bloomberg's departure could provide local support to other candidates, as campaign officials for the former New York City mayor said in January they'd continue to work against Trump even if Bloomberg wasn't the Democratic nominee. Bloomberg tweeted a cryptic response to a tweet from Trump attacking his candidacy early Wednesday, a video of the famous light saber battle between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader in "Star Wars: A New Hope" with the message, "See you soon, Donald."
The Bloomberg campaign had been the most visible presidential effort in Spokane ahead of the Tuesday primary.
In addition to mailed advertisements, the campaign had spent close to a half-million dollars on advertisements airing on local broadcast stations, according to public records filed with the Federal Communications Commission.

Texto completo: The Glenbard Parent Series: (GPS) Navigating Healthy Families will present a young adult author event with award-winning novelist Nicola Yoon at 7 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, at Glenbard North High School, 990 N. Kuhn Road in Carol Stream.
Yoon's books "Everything, Everything" and "The Sun Is Also a Star" skyrocketed to the top of the New York Times bestseller list and were National Book finalists for Young People's Literature. "Everything, Everything" is about the thrill and heartbreak that happens when someone breaks out of their shell to do crazy, sometimes death-defying things, for love. "The Sun Is Also a Star" is a hopeful examination of self-determination, family and identity.
Yoon was born in Jamaica and graduated from Cornell University with a degree in engineering. She became a writer because she wanted her daughter, and other young multiracial youth, to see themselves in the pages of popular books. Yoon is associated with the We Need Diverse Books organization and promotes the representation of diversity in literature. She is also a recipient of the John Steptoe Award for New Talent.
Students are encouraged to attend the March 18 event. Glenbard North students will hear Yoon speak during the day.
Continuing professional development units are available.

Texto completo: White House Roundup
WASHINGTON - His front-runner status slipping, Bernie Sanders refocused his Democratic presidential campaign on surging rival Joe Biden on Wednesday as the Vermont senator's allies grappled with the fallout from a Super Tuesday stumble that raised internal concerns about the direction of his White House bid.
Sanders targeted Biden's record on trade, Social Security and fundraising just hours after billionaire Mike Bloomberg suspended his campaign and Elizabeth Warren confirmed she was privately reassessing her future in the race. The dramatic shifts signaled that the Democrats' once-crowded nomination fight had effectively come down to a two-man race for the right to face President Donald Trump in November.
Sanders declared himself "neck and neck" with Biden as he faced reporters in his home state, Vermont, one of just four states he captured on the most consequential day of voting in the party's 2020 primary season. Biden won 10 states, assembling victories that transcended geography, race and class.
"What this campaign, I think, is increasingly about is, 'Which side are you on?'" Sanders said.
The progressive candidate lobbed familiar attacks against the former vice president's record but ignored supporters' calls to be more aggressive and insisted his campaign would avoid any "Trump-type effort."
"I like Joe. I think he's a decent human being," Sanders said. "Joe and I have a very different vision for the future of this country."
Biden told reporters he would unify the country and, without naming him, knocked Sanders' frequent contention that he is beholden to an elite party establishment.
"The establishment are all those hard-working people" who voted on Tuesday, Biden told reporters in West Hollywood, California.
Elected officials and leading donors rallied around Biden after his Super Tuesday romp. Top Democrats have long been skeptical of the 77-year-old lifelong politician's political strength but raced to unite behind him to blunt Sanders' rise.
After suspending his campaign, Bloomberg became the fourth failed Democratic presidential contender this week to endorse Biden. Like the growing chorus of Democratic officials, Bloomberg called Biden the best chance to defeat Trump.
Warren's future was uncertain. Sanders confirmed he spoke to his progressive ally earlier in the day, though it was unclear whether she would endorse him should she leave the race. Warren didn't win a single state on Super Tuesday and finished in third place in her home state of Massachusetts.
The Sanders campaign announced it would begin airing new campaign ads across states holding the next series of primary contests on Tuesday and March 17: Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Washington state.
One ad features archived footage of former President Barack Obama praising Sanders. It's a not-so-subtle attempt by the senator to undercut Biden's spotlighting his closeness to Obama.
"The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders, AGAIN!" Trump tweeted. He also called Warren "selfish" for staying in the race because it "hurts Bernie badly."
Sources: Montana Gov. Bullock considers running for Senate
WASHINGTON - Democrat Steve Bullock, the Montana governor who has insisted he won't run for the Senate, is poised to do just that, according to two people familiar with his plans.
Bullock has long been a Democratic favorite and has been heavily wooed to take on Republican Sen. Steve Daines. Democrats are straining to win back the Senate and they see a Bullock matchup with Daines as key to that strategy. Daines is increasingly allied with President Donald Trump and got a shout-out from the president Wednesday.
Bullock, who made an unsuccessful run in the crowded Democratic presidential primary, has until Monday's filing deadline to formally announce his bid.
Bullock is in close discussions with his family as he makes the decision, according to one person close to the governor. Two people confirmed the planning, as first reported by the New York Times, but were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Bullock met with former President Barack Obama during a trip to D.C., and the Senate's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, made a visit to the West last month for more talks, the people said.
But Bullock also is a dad with school-age children and had emphatically said in the past he would not be relocating to Washington, D.C. for the Senate.
Five Democrats are already running to take on Daines, but four are first-time candidates and the fifth is the mayor of Helena. None has the statewide name recognition or track record of Bullock.

Staff issues won’t go away

Resumen: [...]Trump blows through staffers as if they’re Kleenex. After ousting personnel deemed insufficiently loyal in the wake of his impeachment and acquittal, Trump replaced the director of the Presidential Personnel Office, Sean Doocey, with John McEntee, 29, a former Trump bodyman and campaign aide fired by Trump’s second chief of staff, John Kelly — reportedly after he had trouble obtaining a security clearance because of gambling issues. [...]chances are a good thing, but it’s hard to believe McEntee is the best person for a job that requires a seasoned hand who can gauge not only loyalty but also ability.

Texto completo: In 2010, when Gen. Stanley McChrystal and his aides were quoted in a Rolling Stone piece belittling top officials in President Barack Obama’s administration, including Vice President Joe Biden, The New York Times went into high dudgeon.
A Grey Lady editorial asked if Obama could trust McChrystal, his top Afghanistan commander, after his "hugely undisciplined comments" and argued that Obama should fire the revered general — or, at the very least, dress him down before sending him back to a combat zone. Beltway-think was largely united that a president shouldn’t have to put up with a general not firmly in his camp. But when President Donald Trump fires staffers who buck his agenda, they call it a "purge." Oddly, a town stacked with institutionalists seems to have forgotten some basics — that a president has a right to insist on staff members who are on board with his agenda.
And when people outside the White House urge Trump to get rid of staffers who undermine his agenda, it’s news. I talked to one such individual on background who told me that if Trump had been better at picking staff on Day One, "he would not have been impeached." A shrewd chief of staff would have acted to end the two-and-a-half-year Russian probe that found no coordination between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, an outcome that was clear early on, this individual argued. And a savvy personnel chief could have transferred the whistleblower who went overboard in complaining about Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which the president — wrongly, but not an impeachable offense to my mind — asked Zelenskiy to dig up dirt on Biden.
I see two reasons for the double standard. First, Washington doesn’t give Trump the benefit of the doubt. Second, Trump blows through staffers as if they’re Kleenex.
McChrystal was an aberration. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the national security adviser who testified in Trump’s impeachment trial and was escorted out of the White House for his testimony, is one soldier among many. As a candidate, Trump boasted that he would hire "the best people." But if he had hired the best, he wouldn’t have fired so many high-level officials — and he wouldn’t bad-mouth them as he shows them the door. Kathryn Dunn Tenpas has chronicled Trump’s record turnover for the Brookings Institution. She found that 82% of his "A-team slots" have turned over — more than a third of them have had two or more occupants.
So the next question might be: Has Trump learned from his bad hiring choices? The answer to that would be yes. But he didn’t learn the most important lesson: that he needs to be more careful about his staffing decisions. After ousting personnel deemed insufficiently loyal in the wake of his impeachment and acquittal, Trump replaced the director of the Presidential Personnel Office, Sean Doocey, with John McEntee, 29, a former Trump bodyman and campaign aide fired by Trump’s second chief of staff, John Kelly — reportedly after he had trouble obtaining a security clearance because of gambling issues. McEntee’s apparent mandate: chief loyalty officer.
Second chances are a good thing, but it’s hard to believe McEntee is the best person for a job that requires a seasoned hand who can gauge not only loyalty but also ability. You get the feeling Trump doesn’t think it matters who he hires as long as he is in charge. It is an approach that unfailingly bites back.

Texto completo: In 2010, when Gen. Stanley McChrystal and his aides were quoted in a Rolling Stone piece belittling top officials in President Barack Obama’s administration, including Vice President Joe Biden, The New York Times went into high dudgeon.
A Grey Lady editorial asked if Obama could trust McChrystal, his top Afghanistan commander, after his "hugely undisciplined comments" and argued that Obama should fire the revered general — or, at the very least, dress him down before sending him back to a combat zone. Beltway-think was largely united that a president shouldn’t have to put up with a general not firmly in his camp. But when President Donald Trump fires staffers who buck his agenda, they call it a "purge." Oddly, a town stacked with institutionalists seems to have forgotten some basics — that a president has a right to insist on staff members who are on board with his agenda.
And when people outside the White House urge Trump to get rid of staffers who undermine his agenda, it’s news. I talked to one such individual on background who told me that if Trump had been better at picking staff on Day One, "he would not have been impeached." A shrewd chief of staff would have acted to end the two-and-a-half-year Russian probe that found no coordination between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, an outcome that was clear early on, this individual argued. And a savvy personnel chief could have transferred the whistleblower who went overboard in complaining about Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which the president — wrongly, but not an impeachable offense to my mind — asked Zelenskiy to dig up dirt on Biden.
I see two reasons for the double standard. First, Washington doesn’t give Trump the benefit of the doubt. Second, Trump blows through staffers as if they’re Kleenex.
McChrystal was an aberration. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the national security adviser who testified in Trump’s impeachment trial and was escorted out of the White House for his testimony, is one soldier among many. As a candidate, Trump boasted that he would hire "the best people." But if he had hired the best, he wouldn’t have fired so many high-level officials — and he wouldn’t bad-mouth them as he shows them the door. Kathryn Dunn Tenpas has chronicled Trump’s record turnover for the Brookings Institution. She found that 82% of his "A-team slots" have turned over — more than a third of them have had two or more occupants.
So the next question might be: Has Trump learned from his bad hiring choices? The answer to that would be yes. But he didn’t learn the most important lesson: that he needs to be more careful about his staffing decisions. After ousting personnel deemed insufficiently loyal in the wake of his impeachment and acquittal, Trump replaced the director of the Presidential Personnel Office, Sean Doocey, with John McEntee, 29, a former Trump bodyman and campaign aide fired by Trump’s second chief of staff, John Kelly — reportedly after he had trouble obtaining a security clearance because of gambling issues.

Texto completo: M. Sigmund "Sig" Shapiro, a philanthropist who was active in the Port of Baltimore, died of Alzheimer's disease complications Tuesday at his North Roland Park home. He was 92.
Born Moritz Sigmund Shapiro in Baltimore and raised in Reservoir Hill's Lake Drive, he was the son of Samuel Shapiro, who owned a foreign freight forwarding business and his wife, Hilda Levy, a homemaker.
He was a 1945 graduate of Baltimore City College. He attended Johns Hopkins University but left classes to help his father run the family business, which was involved with the recovery of European ports after World War II. The U.S. government also made Mr. Shapiro and his father responsible for shipping grain to parts of the world where agriculture had been disrupted by the conflict.
The firm, Samuel Shapiro & Co., was founded in 1915 in a one-room office with a $5 roll-top desk.
The son advised clients on transporting goods around the world. He worked with changes in shipping, including containerization, during his career and was a consultant to President Jimmy Carter on the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties regarding the Panama Canal.
A 2001 Sun story said the firm, now operated by his daughter, Marjorie "Margie" Shapiro, was one of Maryland's oldest and most influential companies associated with the Port of Baltimore.
Mr. Shapiro's father had lobbied the state legislature to create the Maryland Port Authority.
A Sun story said that in his early years working with his father, the pair clashed constantly.
"Samuel Shapiro resisted modernizing the facility, so his son would make changes and convince his father they were his idea," a 2001 Sun story said. "Sigmund finally became head of the company at age 40. But while they differed on management styles, the two Shapiros were insistent on keeping the business in the family."
Mr. Shapiro was a close observer of the workings and fortunes of the port.
In a 1997 letter to The Sun, he said, "The proposed acquisition of Conrail by Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads may not be on everyone's list of earth-shaking events, but the general public has more at stake in this issue than many realize.
"This is especially true in Maryland, where the merger promises to help us regain some of the edge our rail freight shipping system has lost in recent years - an edge vital to keeping Baltimore and Maryland competitive and our state economy strong," he wrote.
He was a proponent of port and rail modernization and had long backed plans that would move freight through the city more efficiently.
Baltimore's port was served "by the best railroad freight system in America," he said in the 1997 letter.
"The current tunnel heights make accommodating double-stacked loads extremely difficult, giving a competitive advantage to those states that can handle taller loads," he wrote.
He met his wife, the former Barbara Kloze, at the Lyric Theatre. He and his firm were in charge of transporting the sets and costumes for the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo from Europe to Baltimore for the dance ensemble.
Mr. Shapiro was a self-taught jazz pianist who admired Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington and Count Basie. He sat in with sessions alongside Bucky Pizzarelli, Joe Wilder and Wynton Marsalis.
"He was a nonprofessional who was allowed to play and perform at The Prime Rib," his wife said of the Mount Vernon restaurant.
He and his wife endowed a scholarship for jazz students at the Peabody Conservatory of Music. He also gave scholarships to Johns Hopkins' School of Arts and Sciences and at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. He also supported a jazz program at the Baltimore School for the Arts.
He also created a mitzvah fund at the Baltimore Community Foundation.
Mr. Shapiro regularly entertained at the piano with friends on Thursday nights.
"I don't think he could read music and if you could tell him about, or hum, a tune you heard 10 years ago, he could play it and improvise on it, too. He was amazing," said Shale Stiller, an attorney and regular guest at the musical evenings.
"He could also do The New York Times crossword puzzle in no time," Mr. Stiller said. "If he got stumped, he'd call [a friend] Walter Sondheim.
"He had a brilliant mind. He knew more custom law than 99% of the customs law lawyers in the country," Mr. Stiller said.
Mr. Shapiro also played poker for years with a group of friends. He was a voracious reader of history and he loved to talk politics. He played bridge and loved puns, occasionally writing a parody of a popular song.
He was a past vice president of the National Customs House Brokers and Forwarders Association of America. He was also a past president of the Baltimore division of the organization.
Services will be held at 2:30 p.m. Thursday at Sol Levinson and Brothers.
In addition to his wife of 63 years, a retired Baltimore City Schools elementary teacher, and his daughter, survivors include a son, Robert Shapiro of Bethesda; another daughter, Rosellen Bloomberg of Baltimore; and four grandchildren.

Texto completo: Lawyers for a renowned author who accuses President Trump of raping her in the 1990s told a Manhattan judge Wednesday that if Trump can file defamation lawsuits as president, he also must respond to them as a defendant.
Trump's lawyers have argued that while he's in the Oval Office, he is immune from personal litigation or criminal charges of any kind - even if his alleged transgressions predate his time in office.
However, on Feb. 26, Trump's reelection campaign sued The New York Times for "intentionally publishing false statements against President Trump's campaign" and Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
Lawyers for author E. Jean Carroll say if Trump can sue the Times, Carroll should be allowed to pursue her case in Manhattan Supreme Court.
"The president shouldn't be able to pick and choose which he cases he wants to do while president, which cases he doesn't want to do," Roberta Kaplan, Carroll's lawyer, told reporters after the court hearing.
"We understand why he doesn't want to do this case, but that's not a reasonable legal argument," Kaplan said.
Carroll, 75, came forward with rape accusations against Trump last June. She sued Trump in November after he publicly accused her of lying.
She accuses Trump of raping her in late 1995 or early 1996 inside a dressing room at the upscale Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan. Carroll claimed the then-real estate magnate knocked her head against a wall, pulled down her tights and briefly penetrated her before Carroll managed to push him off and make a run for it.
Stating that Carroll was "not my type," Trump said the longtime Elle magazine columnist fabricated the assault to boost sales of her book, "What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal."
Outside the courthouse Wednesday, Carroll said she filed the lawsuit for "not just for myself, but for every woman in America who's been grabbed, groped, harassed, sexually assaulted and has spoken out about it and still has been disgraced, shamed or fired."

Ohio grows in value after Super Tuesday

Texto completo: With Joe Biden's startling turnaround and more Democrats leaving the race, Ohio could wind up as a key showdown state for the vice president and Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Biden won nine states, including delegate-rich Texas, on Super Tuesday. Sanders won three, although his margin in the nation's top delegate prize of California is still being determined.
Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, after spending hundreds of millions and winning only American Samoa on Tuesday, dropped out Wednesday and endorsed Biden.
The remaining major Democrat still standing, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is "talking to her team to assess the path forward," an aide said. She finished an embarrassing third in her home state.
"Obviously Biden's performance was extremely impressive," said Ohio native Kyle Kondik, now with the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.
While his victories across the south were not unexpected, "some of the margins were particularly eye-popping," Kondik said.
But even more impressive were Biden's victories in northern states such as Massachusetts and Minnesota, and at least holding his own in Maine.
"He showed that his surge of the last few days is not limited to the South," Kondik said.
Next on the Democratic calendar is the Michigan Primary on Tuesday – former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm just endorsed Biden – followed by St. Patrick's Day contests in Ohio, Florida, Illinois and Arizona.
Sanders, who lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Ohio Primary, faces a steep challenge to prevail in the Buckeye State.
"Sanders hasn't really grown his coalition much since 2016," said Nancy Miller, political science professor at the University of Dayton.
"There have been modest gains with African American voters and better gains with Latina/Latino/Latinx voters, but his base is still largely the 18-29 young voter block and exit polling showed that their turnout in the primaries was not any larger than normal for the most part. This is counter to the Sanders campaign narrative that his coalition is expanding."
Sanders did best in Ohio college towns such as Athens, Bowling Green and Oxford four years ago.
Resurrecting from a campaign many deemed dead less than a week ago, "Biden right now has 'Joe-mentum,'" Miller said. "The free media and endorsements Biden earned with his South Carolina dunk on the rest of the field was invaluable and likely a big part of his strong Super Tuesday performance."
"I'm here to report we are very much alive," Biden proclaimed Tuesday night during a rally in Los Angeles. His campaign proclaimed Wednesday that his fundraising had increased dramatically as well.
The current delegate count is 409 for Biden, 345 for Sanders, according to the New York Times.
Super Tuesday was so designated because 1,344 delegates were awarded from 14 states and one territory, or about 34% of all pledged delegates. In all, Democrats will choose 3,979 pledged delegates from all states and territories, meaning a candidate needs 1,991 to win in the first round at the Democratic National Convention this summer.
Exit polls Tuesday continued to show Democrats' No. 1 priority this year is beating President Donald Trump. And most Democratic voters preferred a return to President Barack Obama's policies vs. a more liberal agenda like the one espoused by Sanders.
"After last night, it's clear Ohio will play a major role in determining our nominee," said state Democratic Chairman David Pepper.
"But because of Donald Trump's failed policies and broken promises, Ohio is also very much up for grabs in November. Over the next few weeks, we expect to see all of the remaining candidates come to Ohio to make their case for why they can turn the Buckeye State blue in 2020."
In endorsing Biden, Bloomberg cited "his decency, his honesty, and his commitment to the issues that are so important to our country – including gun safety, health care, climate change, and good jobs."

Crossroads Church uses donations to wipe out $46.5M in medical debt

Texto completo: Crossroads Church senior pastor Brian Tome mentioned the campaign nearly in passing.
He spent about three minutes describing the burden of medical debt during his Nov. 23 sermon, entitled "The Marks of Multiplication." Tome said members of the congregation could text "MULTIPLY" to 313131 to help "free others from medical debt," but insisted the campaign was not a challenge.
Just an awareness.
It was also a great metaphor for his lesson on multiplicity.
"When we are in debt, a sin debt to God, we can't get our way out of the sin debt to God," he said during the sermon. "Jesus comes and gives himself so we can pay off our sin debt, so we never have to worry about God hurting us for our sin."
Crossroads could give to free others' debt, too, he said. And for every dollar they raised, Crossroad's partner RIP Medical Debt would leverage that dollar to abolish $100 in medical debt, therefore multiplying the church's impact.
Within a week and a half, members of the Crossroads community donated enough to abolish over $46.5 million in medical debt nationwide.
Over $42 million of those funds came back to Ohio families.
"Most of it probably that weekend," said Crossroads director of marketing Brennan Hill. "Cuz I think most people, if I had to guess, were doing it in real time. You know, if they were literally getting their phones out and texting in."
Church officials announced the impact of their campaign on Feb. 23.
Most of the funds came back to Ohio families since the church is based out of the Cincinnati region. But the sermons are streamed online, which means anyone in the nation can tune in and participate.
RIP Medical Debt is able to track the donations back to their original ZIP codes to give back. So, if you donated from Indiana, your donation was multiplied and given back to your community in Indiana.
In Ohio, church officials say, they have abolished $42.8 million in debts across 41,233 households in 103 ZIP codes.
They also abolished $1.9 million in debt across 2,974 Kentucky households, $1.5 million across 503 Tennessee households and $200,000 across 136 Indiana households.
What is RIP Medical Debt? An article posted by USA Today last year explains that RIP Medical Debt is a nonprofit organization based out of Rye, New York, that arranges debt payoffs.
The article said medical debt contributes to two-thirds of bankruptcies, according to the American Journal of Public Health. And a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll showed that of the 26 percent of people who reported problems paying medical bills, 59 percent reported a major life impact, such as taking an extra job, cutting other household spending or using up savings.
"How sad that probably the only debt that you don't choose to get – cuz you don't choose to get sick – and it's the one that's affecting most people," said Victor Martinez, spiritual growth site leader for the Oakley location.
When a person can't pay a bill, that debt is often packaged with other people's debt and sold to bill collectors for some fraction of the total amount of the bill. RIP Medical Debt buys debt portfolios on this secondary market for pennies on the dollar with money from its donors.
But instead of collecting the debt, RIP forgives it.
To be eligible for repayment from RIP, the debtor must be earning less than twice the federal poverty level (about $25,000 a year for an individual and $52,000 for a family of four), have debts that are 5% or more of their annual income and have more debt than assets.
Because hospitals and doctors are eager to get those hard-to-collect debts off their books, they sell them cheap.
Working this way puts a high-dollar project within reach of even small churches. Revolution Annapolis, a nondenominational Maryland church with Sunday attendance of around 200 and without a permanent building, wiped out $1.9 million in debt for 900 families in March. Total amount raised: $15,000.
A debt that never goes away... even if you don't know about it According to the Federal Trade Commission, debt collectors have a certain number of years they can sue you and win to collect a debt. This rule is called the statute of limitations, and is six years in Ohio.
This means that for any type of debt, a creditor cannot sue a debtor for debt collection purposes after six years, according to America's Debt Help Organization. That timeframe begins when someone fails to make a payment on a debt. The clock will start again if you make a payment or provide written acknowledgment of your debt after the first six years are up.
Martinez says that because of this law, many people who got a letter explaining that their debt had been abolished thanks to Crossroads didn't even know they had medical debt. If it was after those six years, hospitals and debt collectors had stopped calling.
"If those six years pass, then nobody can give you a call asking for that money," Martinez said. "But you still owe that money, technically. And the only way that you can really get rid of it is if you file bankruptcy, or if you pay for it."
Medical debt never goes away. It will stay on your record if you don't pay it. The law just states that if you don't pay it within that six year window, people will stop asking you to pay – not that you are off the hook.
Martinez said that now that he understands how the law works, he's afraid to call and ask if he owes anything. Because, what if he owes a lot of money? He'll be accountable to pay it, he said.
"That is very scary," he said. "Because what if I have medical debt that I don't know about?"
'A great analogy to what Jesus did for us.' Crossroads officials did not want this story to be about them.
"We kept it off social media," Hill said. "We really want it to be about people in our community, like I said, who are currently giving."
Crossroads members don't know who specifically they have impacted. They could not choose whose debt to pay off. In a letter to each debtor, Crossroads explained the campaign and said that they hope to provide more resources for those in need, whether that is through prayer or connecting them with healthcare professionals in their community.
"We don't want this to be the last interaction that we have with them, but there are no strings attached," Hill said."We just hope that they understand who Crossroads is, what our heart is for the community, maybe set foot in one of our sites."
This whole experience has been a great analogy to what Jesus did for us, Martinez said.
"Jesus, before we knew who he was, he died for us, to forgive our debt," Martinez said. "And here, we don't know who these people are, and we are putting this money for their debt to be forgiven."
According to RIP Medical Debt, Crossroads' campaign is its largest amount of medical debt that's ever been retired. The nonprofit's site claims that its partnerships have erased almost $1.4 billion in medical debt to date.
Crossroads Church senior pastor Brian Tome mentioned the campaign nearly in passing during his Nov. 23 sermon, yet within a week and a half, members of the Crossroads community donated enough to abolish over $46.5 million in medical debt nationwide.

Texto completo: The sunlight peeks into Kim Ssang-seok's home for just half an hour a day. When he opens his only window and looks up, he sees the wheels of passing cars. Kim dries his clothes and shoes in the sunless inside because of thieves outside. He wages a constant battle against cockroaches and the sewer smell emanating from the low-ceilinged, musty space that is his toilet and laundry room.
This 320-square-foot abode, built partially underground, has been Kim's home for 20 years. His late mother smiles from a portrait on the wall.
"You end up in places like this when you have nowhere else to go," said Kim, 63, a taxi driver.
But Kim, a widower, said he was still "grateful that I have a roof over my head and a warm floor to rest on." He fears the city will clear out his neighborhood in a few years to make room for more of the apartment towers that increasingly dominate Seoul's skylines.
If that happens, Kim said, he has "no plan" on where to go -- just like the desperate family in "Parasite," which became the first foreign-language movie to win the Academy Award for Best Film last month.
Overseas, South Korea may be best associated with its Samsung smartphones, Hyundai cars and K-pop stars like BTS.
But "Parasite" has mesmerized viewers around the world by exposing a much grimmer side of South Korea's economic growth: urban poverty, and the humiliation and class strife it has spawned.
The movie does so through the tale of a family in Seoul who lives in a "banjiha," or a semi-basement home like Kim's, and whose initially hilarious subterfuge to latch onto a wealthy family unravels tragically.
The fictionalized story reflects the lives of Seoul's so-called dirt spoons, the urban poor, many of whom live in semi-basements in the congested city, where living high and dry -- in apartment towers and away from the honking, yelling and odoriferous squalor of down below -- symbolizes the wealth and status of the gold-spoon class.
In Seoul, where housing prices have been rising fast, many students and young couples start out renting in a banjiha, with the hope that enough striving and toil will eventually lead to homeownership in an apartment tower.
"It's clearly a basement but people living there want to believe they belong to the above-the-ground world," the director of "Parasite," Bong Joon-ho, said last year at a news conference with South Korean Media after his film was invited to the Cannes Film Festival. "They live with constant fear that if things get any worse, they will be completely swallowed underground."
While younger banjiha occupants may dream of escape, many others are elderly or unemployed people who have all but abandoned hope for social mobility. They live hand-to-mouth, one step away from becoming homeless.
Hundreds of thousands of people live semi-underground in Seoul, scattered around the city, according to government statistics. They remain largely invisible unless you explore back alleys at night and see their lit windows below street level.
Even before "Parasite" won the Oscar, local movie fans and foreign tourists had begun visiting the locations where some of the film was shot, to sample the sights and smells of the real-life Seoul that inspired the story.
They visit Ahyeon-dong, a hillside shantytown covered with identical two- or three-story tenements. The cheapest rooms are available in semi-basements there for $250 to $420 a month.
A warren of narrow alleyways stretch uphill around the "Piggy Super," a grocery store that appeared in the movie under a different name, many ending in steep stairs.
This is the neighborhood of Kim, the taxi driver. Just outside his door on a recent night, under a streetlight, a neighbor sorted piles of empty paper boxes and other trash she collects for a living.
When Kim climbs out of his den, he sees a view of tall, sleek, brightly lit apartment blocks looming in the distance like a mirage.
"They keep going higher and higher, so they won't have to smell the smell down below," Kim said of the tower dwellers. "Those living up there must look down on people like me like pigs."
Many of the richest of the rich in Seongbuk, like the family in "Parasite," live in luxurious, multimillion dollar, single-family homes with large backyards, shaded by graceful pine trees. These islands of affluence are secluded behind imposing walls topped with spikes and security cameras.
Many of the homes also have underground spaces, originally built as air-raid shelters where the owners stocked emergency food in case North Korea invaded. Now, these hideaways, one of which plays a central role in the movie's plot, are used mainly as underground gyms and home theaters.
Fear of war with the North is also one of the reasons there are so many basement homes in Seoul's poor districts.
During the Cold War, the government encouraged the building of underground shelters. But as the city's population exploded to 10 million in 1990, from 1.5 million in 1955, authorities allowed landlords to rent out the underground space to rural South Koreans like Kim, who migrated to Seoul en masse when the economy started galloping five decades ago.
But as the economy slowed and income inequality deepened in later decades, the city's down-and-out remained stuck underground.
Kim lives in a four-story tenement building owned by a rich absentee landlord. Six families live in the upper three floors.
Kim sounded proud when he said that as meager as his home might be, he was better off than the other three families squeezed into the cheapest semi-basement floor. While the other three are renters, Kim owns his place in the building, bought for $30,000 after he sold his house in a better neighborhood 20 years ago to help pay for his late wife's cancer bills.
Still, Kim said that when he goes to his high school reunions, he doesn't reveal where he lives for fear his friends might pity him.
His worst fear is that he'll be asked to move out and have to join a growing number of people who live in "gosiwon" or "jjokbang" -- flop houses where occupants pay daily or weekly rents for windowless rooms barely enough to squeeze in a bed. There, they often wait for lonely death.
For now, Kim said he tries not to think about the future because doing so doesn't solve anything.
"You will get sick if you get constantly envious of what you can't have," he said.

Texto completo: Every morning before school in northwest suburban Woodstock, Laura Caldwell and her three younger siblings were told by their dad, "Take a big breath. Fill in your lungs with air." She took those words to heart, making for herself a life that was as full and fruitful as one could wish.
Her hair a fiery red and her passions and energies seemingly without limits or boundaries, Caldwell was a talented trial attorney, revered legal professor, author of 15 books and an ardent advocate for the lives of former prisoners through the Life After Innocence project she founded.
Caldwell, 52, died Sunday in River Forest, where she had been living in hospice care at the home of her friend, attorney Elizabeth Kaveny. The cause was breast cancer, which she had been battling for some years.
"She told me during these last weeks, when she knew the end was inevitable, that she had no regrets," said Kaveny. "She said, 'My life has exceeded my wildest dreams.'
"Very near the end, her sister Christie and I would talk to her, and we told her that she was one of those rare people who would be leaving the world a better place than she found it."
The death was jolting to many of her friends and admirers, most believing that she had won her first bout with the disease.
"Laura was pretty straightforward about her illness, so much so that I assumed it was more or less under control," said her friend, attorney and bestselling author Scott Turow. "Her death is a shock to me, especially since she was such a spirited fighter of the things that deserve to be fought that I took it for granted that she'd hold cancer at bay too."
Caldwell was born Oct. 27, 1967, in Woodstock, the eldest of the four children of William I. and Margaret Caldwell. The law was in her blood: Her father, grandfather William I. Caldwell Sr., and her uncle Michael T. Caldwell, all practiced law at the family firm Caldwell, Berner & Caldwell, which was in continual practice for more than a century before closing last summer. One of Laura's proudest moments was when the firm affixed her name in gold stencil to the door, which faced Woodstock's historic town square.
She attended Marian Central Catholic High School and graduated with a bachelor's degree in communications from the University of Iowa, where she also was a cheerleader for the football team. After earning her law degree from Loyola University Chicago's School of Law, she practiced in the fields of insurance, medical malpractice and entertainment at a number of Chicago-area firms, eventually making partner.
She also wrote articles for such publications as the Illinois Bar Journal and began, tentatively, to write fiction. A voracious reader as a child, she was the first to admit that she had never had an interest in writing before. But she kept at it for more than seven years, taking a leave of absence from courtrooms to join the faculty of Loyola University's law school in 2001. Her first novel was published the next year, and "Burning the Map" became a New York Times bestseller and gathered much praise, with Barnes & Noble naming it one on the best books of the year.
It certainly empowered Caldwell, who followed that book with a stream of nearly annual novels with such titles as "The Year of Living Famously," and "The Night I Got Lucky." Those and her other books fell neatly under the umbrella of what's known as "chick lit."
She then switched gears, releasing a trilogy of mysteries ("Red Hot Lies," "Red Blooded Murder" and "Red White & Dead") in 2009, all featuring a Chicago-based attorney/private investigator named Izzy McNeil, who would appear in three subsequent books.
Many writers were in awe of her productivity.
The seeds of Life After Innocence were planted when Caldwell's friend Cathy O'Daniel, a criminal defense attorney, told her of being cornered by inmates as she tried to make her way out of Cook County Jail.
To O'Daniel's rescue came Jovan Mosley, a detainee, who gently led her out of harm's way. O'Daniel, understandably grateful, asked Mosley why he was in jail and was shocked that he had been held without trial for more than five years. He also told her he was innocent of the first-degree murder charge he was facing.
O'Daniel and Caldwell began to fight for Mosley, at first with Caldwell doing research and writing motions. In time she became co-counsel. The case ended in a courtroom in late 2005 with a not-guilty verdict, and only then did Caldwell think there was a book in their story, which also included Caldwell's being "best man" at Mosley's wedding.
"Long Way Home: A Young Man Lost in the System and the Two Women Who Found Him" is a remarkable and moving book, published in 2010. In seeing the struggles Mosley faced after his release, Caldwell was inspired to found Life After Innocence in 2009 at Loyola. Its aim was to help the wrongfully convicted mend their lives and reclaim their rights as citizens. The nonprofit runs on private donations and doubles as an experiential clinic at Loyola, with law school students getting course credit for consulting one-on-one with exonerees, pursuing legislation, litigation and fundraising.
Maury Possley, a former Tribune reporter and prominent legal affairs journalist, said: "The world inhabited by the wrongfully convicted, whose lives were stolen often for decades, is less bright with the loss of Laura. She gave so much to so many upon their release from prison, guiding them through an often strange and mystifying world that left them behind while they were behind bars. Her devotion to the wrongfully convicted was singular."
Turow adds, "She was brilliant, determined -- and always a hell of a lot of fun. Our paths crossed in the legal and mystery worlds. I had sky-high respect for her in both universes, and her commitment to the wrongfully convicted was boundless. They had no more effective advocate."
Caldwell, who was divorced, most recently lived on the Near North Side, in an apartment filled with books, sunlight and a playful mini goldendoodle named Shafer, an inspiration for her 14th and final novel, "The Dog Park," published in 2014.
Caldwell's cancer returned aggressively late in 2019, and she fought it with experimental drugs. In a cruel twist of fate, in January she lost her father when attorney William "Bill" Caldwell died at 77.
Some years ago, Caldwell was asked by a reporter what, if she were able to go back in time, she might tell her younger self.
"I would have told her to experience everything possible," she said. "There's so much to do and see in this world ... and so little time."
Caldwell is survived by her mother; sisters Kathleen Caldwell Kuhn and Christine Caldwell Smith; and a brother Matthew.
A memorial service is planned for April 4 at Loyola University.

Secret passage dating to 1660 found inside UK Parliament

Texto completo: A 360-year-old passageway once used by British monarchs has been rediscovered inside Parliament, revealing a piece of history that was thought to have been permanently covered up after World War II.
For decades, it was thought that the only remnant of the passageway, built in 1660, was a brass plaque inside Westminster Hall, the oldest of Parliament's buildings, marking where the entrance would have been.
Instead, access to the passage had remained hidden in plain sight for about 70 years.
"To say we were surprised is an understatement," Mark Collins, historian of the Parliament's estates, said in a statement last week.
The passage, created for a procession to the 17th-century coronation banquet of Charles II, was then used for about 150 years for other coronations and by lawmakers to gain access from the hall through to the original House of Commons chamber. The luminaries likely to have used the route include, historians believe, Robert Walpole, who is generally regarded as Britain's first prime minister.
Benjamin Franklin would also have passed through it on visits to the House of Commons during his time living in London. Others who walked the flagstones as they made their way to the chamber were the diarist Samuel Pepys; Charles James Fox, Britain's first foreign secretary; and William Pitt the Younger, who in 1783 became the country's youngest prime minister, at 24.
The passage leading through to Westminster Hall was blocked up in the mid-19th century as part of renovation works after a fire in Parliament. The route lay untouched for close to a century until it was found by workers carrying out repairs after the building was bombed in World War II.
In an attempt to preserve that restored access, workers carved a small wooden door into the paneling in the adjacent hallway -- but the result turned out to be too discreet. With the passing of time, the door was forgotten and historians thought that the 1950s repair job had blocked access entirely.
The panel, with a small keyhole, went unquestioned until it was rediscovered last year by a team looking through archival documents while working on the nearly $5 billion restoration plan underway in Parliament.
After a key was made to fit the keyhole, the team discovered that it led to a small room, inside which they found the original hinges for two wooden doors -- 11 feet tall and 6 feet wide -- that would have opened into Westminster Hall.
"The speakers of the House of Commons would have come this way -- many many MPs over the centuries," Liz Hallam Smith, the historical consultant for Parliament's architecture and heritage team, told the BBC, referring to members of Parliament.
The discovery was not the only surprise for historians: They also found graffiti dating to 1851.
When the door was blocked up in the 19th century, the Victorian laborers who laid the bricks left behind a personal mark. Scribbled on the wall was a note, part of which read, "This room was enclosed by Tom Porter who was very fond of Ould Ale."

Texto completo: Mayor should support cops
I found it very ironic that a story on Page 3 of Monday's Tribune ("Charges dropped against man who was shot by cop") quotes Mayor Lori Lightfoot finding the video of two Chicago police officers trying to subdue (and then shooting) a man at a Red Line station "extremely disturbing," while a story on Page 1 ("Accused cop killer readies unusual self-defense claim") recounts a similar incident (from 2018), which resulted in the death of decorated Chicago police Cmdr. Paul Bauer.
Both occurrences are similar insofar as they involve police officers working to ensure public safety and maintain order while people suspected of breaking the law willfully resist. This would have been an ideal time for Lightfoot to support the Chicago Police Department and admonish those individuals who do not comply with police officers and wantonly disregard officer directives.
Repeated calls to the Red Line suspect to "stop resisting" are heard on the audio well before any shots ring out. Chicago police are there to serve and protect, and especially with the increased crime on the CTA, I applaud officers for their professionalism. Police officers are human beings who put their lives on the line for the public's good. What I find most disturbing is that the mayor does not recognize that it was the reckless, unruly behavior of the suspect that led to the shooting.
-- Dr. Gregory T. Bales, CTA rider, resident of Munster, Indiana

Making the CTA safe, desirable
Can someone tell me how the CTA can increase ridership on the "L" when we are told of the shootings, thefts and mechanical breakdowns that occur daily? Now add the coronavirus to the mix, and to me, the future looks even more dim. What is it going to take for the transit authority, the city and its police to ever get it right?
-- Howard Kirschner, Morton Grove

Buttigieg's appeal vs. merits
After reading writing such as Frank Bruni's New York Times column ("Mayor Pete flew sky high") in the March 3 Tribune, I'm left with a sense of wonder and frustration surrounding Pete Buttigieg's suspension of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Buttigeig combines a photogenic appearance with attractive public speaking capability, along with intelligence and youth, which gained him swooning attention from the news media and younger segments of the population, as did his status as an openly gay candidate.
However, when it comes to the more important issue of what his qualifications for the presidency are, as indicated by his public record of accomplishment, there's a yawning gap. His major claim to fame is serving as mayor of a midsize Midwestern city, reflecting an at-best mixed record of achievement. On this slim basis, a large segment of the U.S. population made a leap of faith that he merited election to the nation's chief executive office.
This reinforces the many assessments made over the years that the criteria for many Americans, in terms of choosing whom to support for the country's highest elected position, are largely based on shallow, fickle, wishful thinking and an inability to employ rational analysis in weighing candidates' prior records. Surely, the process of choosing deserves much more serious thought and study than many of our fellow citizens are able or otherwise inclined to undertake. This does not bode well for the upcoming election. Indeed, it promises to be a race to the bottom on both sides, with the ultimate winner in all probability being chosen largely based on frivolous grounds.
The nation -- and indeed the world, given the enormous responsibilities of our president -- deserves much better than this.
-- W.T. Rowan, Park Ridge

All part of the human family
Regarding Neil Spun's recent letter ("Why I voted for Donald Trump," March 1): He refers to a person who was fired from a job for stating that scientifically there are only two biological sexes. I don't know the details of this case, but I believe the person should investigate and possibly become more educated about human biology.
For over 35 years, I was a registered nurse in a neonatal unit. During that time, I saw many combinations of male and female gonads and genitalia. One infant had both testicular tissue and ovaries. What sex, Mr. Spun, is that child?
We are one human family, and that is what is important.
-- Eugenia Zambos, Wheaton

A jazz-hands novel from Colum McCann

Texto completo: 'Apeirogon'
By Colum McCann, 463 pages, Random House, $28
Colum McCann's new novel, "Apeirogon," is based on an uplifting true story. It's about two fathers -- Rami Elhanan, an Israeli, and Bassam Aramin, a Palestinian -- who each lost a young daughter to senseless violence. They have become friends and work together, through an organization called Combatants for Peace, to bring the opposing sides together.
McCann takes their story and drops it to the ground, where it shatters. To read "Apeirogon" is to watch him pick up the shards. As befits a writer who ruminates about the nature of storytelling, there are 1,001 of these shards, each numbered, in an homage to "One Thousand and One Nights," the collection of Middle Eastern folk tales.
This is an early warning sign. It is possible to admire "One Thousand and One Nights" while having learned through hard experience that a writer who derives too much inspiration from it is generally one to avoid, unless what's desired is a self-inflicted intellectual glitter-bombing. Time magazine film critic Stephanie Zacharek, writing on Twitter, recently called "storytelling" a "jazz-hands word." "Apeirogon" is a jazz-hands novel.
In many of McCann's 1,001 shards, we follow Rami and Bassam in something like real time. They attend meetings, give lectures, worry about crossing border checkpoints. In others, we flash back to earlier points in their lives. From multiple angles, we witness the events that led to their daughters being killed. Rami and Bassam no longer want to silo their suffering. They want for their grandchildren what the narrator of Israeli writer David Grossman's novel "See Under: Love" wanted, "to live in this world from birth to death and know nothing of war." You sense you would like Rami and Bassam if you got to know them.
But we are not allowed to settle into the texture and nuance of their experience. We're evicted from the narrative on almost every page so that McCann can tweezer in arty and only vaguely relevant facts.
He's going for a collage effect. He'd like to chime with Shirley MacLaine in "The Apartment," who looks into a broken mirror and says to Jack Lemmon: "I like it that way. Makes me look the way I feel."
McCann's shards are set apart from one another on the page by a thumb's-width of white space. This trending method of organizing a novel (for example, Jenny Offill) is not yet insufferable but has a trap door: It exaggerates a writer's weaknesses.
Offill's weakness is that, despite her comic tone, her wit can fizzle. McCann's is that, even in his best novels, such as the National Book Award-winning "Let the Great World Spin," his work can be humorless and self-important.
"Apeirogon" -- the title refers to a shape with a limitless number of sides -- is so solemn, so certain of its own goodness and moral value, that it tips almost instantly over into camp, into corn. It's as if the author were gunning for the Paulo Coelho Chair in Maudlin Schlock.
In an author's note at the front of this novel, McCann writes: "We live our lives, suggested Rilke, in widening circles that reach out across the entire expanse." McCann has a gift for quoting others at their most flatulent: "The only interesting thing is to live, said Mitterand"; "Hertzl wrote: If you divide death by life, you will find a circle."
For added effect, McCann repeats lines he likes, such as the Mitterand quote, again and again.
McCann's numbered shards -- they ascend from 1 to 500, then turn and begin to descend -- offer structure in place of content. "Apeirogon" is not a meal but a table littered with ingredients: a paw of garlic, a frozen lamb shank, two potatoes, a big knob of celeriac, three peas.
When you insist on a lot of white space between paragraphs and sometimes between single sentences, and if your work is humid, the effect can unintentionally verge on the amusing. Each sentence has an apricot-colored scarf tied around its neck. And it's as if the reader has been given 10 seconds and a bong hit between each one; time to squint and nod and say, "So true."
As with Bob Geldof speaking of Ethiopian famine at the time of Live Aid, McCann's ardor is unmistakable. But his analysis of the predicaments that face the Middle East is not raw or original or sophisticated. His message is optimistic -- we need to talk more, and understand each other's humanity -- and banal.
Great writing, Walt Whitman wrote, is composed of words that are "whirled like chain-shot rocks." Enough rocks have been whirled in the Middle East. And this novel is only tossing around pillows.

Texto completo: The Chicago Tribune's Critic's Choice Food & Dining Awards honor the chefs who made 2019 so deliciously memorable. The lineup of excellence begins with our Chef of the Year, Erick Williams, and continues with impressive newcomers, ambitious veterans and at least two separate comeback stories.

Chef of the Year

Erick Williams, Virtue
It's no exaggeration to say that Erick Williams owned 2019. His Hyde Park restaurant, Virtue, won a three-star review from this critic, was named one of the country's best new restaurants by Eater in July, and one of the Best New Restaurants in America by Esquire magazine in November. In between, he was included in a New York Times story on "16 Black Chefs Changing Food in America," and received the Tribune's annual Game Changer award. Last week, he was named a semifinalist for the James Beard Foundation's Best Chef: Great Lakes award. All this while keeping his restaurant humming along, and maintaining grace and humility in the face of relentless praise.

Pastry Chef of the Year

Craig Harzewski, Brindille
Whether I've dined at Naha (for all of its 18 years) or Brindille (seven years and counting), one delightful constant has been the superior work by Craig Harzewski. Harzewski fashions complex, art-gallery-worthy desserts that never lose sight of the sheer joy of eating them, whether he's creating feather-soft clafoutis, chocolate cremeux with hazelnut spongecake, or a custardy blancmange with star-anise sorbet. All this while overseeing a terrific savory bread program. (I'm not the only voice praising Harzewski's work; earlier this year, the Jean Banchet Awards named Harzewski its Pastry Chef of the Year.) One of the many reasons to look forward to Carrie and Michael Nahabedian's Naha 2.0, or whatever it will be named, is that Harzewski will have yet another outlet for his artistry.

Rookie of the Year

Mariya Russell, Kumiko, Kikko
You can't help cheering for a chef who's put in charge of a kitchen for the very first time and proceeds to turn the opportunity into a Michelin star, and just last week, became a semifinalist for Best Chef: Great Lakes by the James Beard Foundation. Mariya Russell worked with Noah Sandoval at the late Senza and four-star Oriole before being named chef de cuisine at Kumiko and, four months later at Kikko, the intimate omakase bar built in Kumiko's basement. Diners have two ways of enjoying Russell's food -- either the a la carte bites menu upstairs (matched to Julia Momose's cocktail wizardry) or the 12-course menu downstairs, where you can watch the chef in action. There's no wrong choice.

Comeback of the Year

Carlos Gaytan, Tzuco
The talented Carlos Gaytan abruptly lost his 10-year-old Mexique restaurant in 2018, a reversal of fortune that sent the chef back to Mexico, where he created Ha, a highly regarded restaurant in Playa del Carmen. But Gaytan appeared periodically in town, at events such as Chicago Gourmet, in the interim, and by September he was back for good with Tzuco, a restaurant named after Gaytan's hometown of Huitzuco, and proceeded to take the Chicago dining scene by storm (Tzuco was just named a semifinalist for Best New Restaurant by the JBF). Here was Gaytan at his finest, cooking with a stronger sense of place than the fusion dishes that characterized Mexique, and demonstrating that, despite many setbacks, that talent will out.

Raising the Sushi Bar

B.K. Park, Mako
Since 1999, B.K. Park has been synonymous with sushi excellence in Chicago, thanks to his work at Mirai, Arami and Juno restaurants, but he exceeded even his own standards with the opening of Mako, an intimate, 22-seat temple where Park's near-silent ministrations can be viewed up close. At $175, Park's 16-course omakase menus are beyond the reach of many, but watching Park working in front of a black-and-gold background is like viewing a stage performance, and a brilliant one at that.

Keeping the Fire Burning

Carmen Lemons and Lynn Walker Harvey, Lem's Bar-B-Q
The history of Lem's Bar-B-Q and the legendary Lemons brothers goes back for decades (indeed, the business celebrated its 65th year last summer), but when the last brother, the great pitmaster James Lemons, died in 2015, his daughters were there to keep the torch aloft. Owner Carmen Lemons and sister, Lynn Walker Harvey, who began working at Lem's at 20 years old, not only have maintained the restaurant's sky-high standards, they've also worked to improve the place, completing a five-month renovation (remarkably, without shutting down) featuring new cabinetry, quartz tiles and doors. Eventually, the duo hopes to bring Lem's famed sauce, seasoning and hot links to retail markets. So many iconic Chicago operations vanish once the founder steps down or passes on. It's rare for someone to step up and keep the flame burning, and more rare to see it done this well.

The Engaging Sushi Chef

Otto Phan, Kyoten
Sushi dining can be as solemn as a religious rite, silent but for the occasional brief explanation of what the chef just handed you. Otto Phan shattered that mold when he moved here from Austin, Texas, in search of a bigger stage and -- he's not shy about saying so -- Michelin recognition. To dine at Phan's Kyoten is to enter a culinary conversation with a chef who cracks jokes, solicits on-the-fly feedback and happily explains the thinking behind his fish sourcing and rice selection. "I want every bite to be a home run," Phan says. Usually, it is. Phan didn't land a Michelin star his first year out, but just you wait.

Perfect Timing

Gene Kato, Momotaro
When opening chef Mark Hellyar resigned from Momotaro for family reasons, owners Kevin Boehm and Rob Katz wasted little time reaching out to Gene Kato, who had returned east after the closing of his Sumi Robata Bar. "The whole time I was in Charlotte (North Carolina), I was trying to get back," Kato said, and he quickly repacked his bags. In what has proved to be an ideal pairing, Momotaro was able to maintain its reputation as Chicago's finest Japanese restaurant, while Kato got the high-profile gig he has long deserved. Not to mention the backing for a new project, the Japanese-Italian Momotaro Italia, opening later this year (fingers crossed), and a Best Chef: Great Lakes nod (semifinalist) by the James Beard Foundation.<

Deadlocked in 3 elections, Israel seeks ways to avert 4th

Texto completo: With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's supporters for another term outnumbered by lawmakers who want him gone, Israel's political system -- having cranked through the motions of a third election in less than a year only to produce another stalemate -- began grappling Wednesday with what to do next.
A nearly complete vote count showed Netanyahu's coalition of right-wing and religious parties with 58 seats in the 120-seat Parliament, three short of a governing majority.
That leaves Israel more or less back at square one -- except that Netanyahu's trial on felony corruption charges starts March 17, his opponents appear exhausted by a campaign in which he outclassed them to achieve a solid plurality and no one in the country appears willing to contemplate a fourth ballot.
Netanyahu's Likud party sought to maximize its leverage as the largest faction to emerge from Monday's election, floating the possibility of its recruiting right-leaning lawmakers from the mostly left-leaning Labor-Gesher-Meretz alliance or from the centrist Blue and White party, headed by the former army chief Benny Gantz, who was Netanyahu's leading challenger.
But just one defector -- whose political career could be ended, analysts said, by such a betrayal of the voters who elected him or her -- would be a lot to ask. Three would seem a miracle, even for Netanyahu.
And the likeliest candidates to be wooed by Netanyahu all insisted they were holding fast to their promises to see him into retirement and could not be bought off, no matter the inducement.
The anti-Netanyahu forces, for their part, showed some new fight Wednesday.
Lawmakers from all three center-left parties said they would propose or support legislation to bar Israel's president from asking a lawmaker under indictment to form a government.
Ofer Shelah, of Blue and White, said the party would pursue measures in Parliament to block Netanyahu from serving as prime minister.
He noted that Israeli law now prohibits someone under indictment from serving as an ordinary government minister but does not specifically address the prime minister's position.
"We believe such a law is worthy," Shelah said.
Nitzan Horowitz, leader of the left-wing Meretz party, encouraged Blue and White to "go for it," saying, "It reflects the will of the public, and it's the moral thing to do."
Ahmed Tibi, of the predominantly Arab Joint List, which won a record 15 seats in Parliament on surprisingly strong turnout among Palestinian citizens of Israel, said it, too, would support such a law.
It was not clear whether Avigdor Liberman's ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party, whose support would also be needed, would join in such an effort. His party emerged with seven seats, according to the unfinished tally.
Still, the idea of such a law drew howls from Netanyahu's supporters on the right, who said it would be retroactive and would not survive a court challenge.
Ayelet Shaked, a former justice minister from the right-wing Yamina party, accused the left, "which exalts democracy," of trying to use legislation to "cancel election results," and "with the aid of terror supporters" at that.
The term "terror supporters" referred to the Joint List, some members of which are accused by critics of having expressed sympathy for terrorists. Tibi is widely reviled among many Israeli Jews for, among other things, having been an adviser to Yasser Arafat, the longtime Palestinian leader.
Analysts said it was unlikely that the legislation barring an indicted lawmaker from serving as prime minister would be approved, in part because of the political storm it could kick up. But several suggested that the anti-Netanyahu parties were making a point as the jockeying over coalition talks begins.

Texto completo: 'The Top 10 as We Hit Bottom'
By Jim Parry, illustrated by Ron Barrett, Skyhorse Publishing, 272 pages, $17.99
Since Ron Barrett illustrated the classic children's picture book "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs" in 1978, the forecast for our world has become considerably more dire.
Fast-forward 42 years to "The Top 10 as We Hit Bottom," a darkly satirical but real collection of top 10 lists that highlight the predicament global warming and other impending catastrophes have put us into. The book has been researched and written by Jim Parry and illustrated by Barrett.
Although some might call this book a collection of "fake news," the lists are compiled and culled from respected authorities like NASA, the United Nations and the Union of Concerned Scientists. The creators think the heartwarming illustrations, to temper the harsh messages of the text, will have readers laughing their way all the way down in the race to the bottom.
The book's cover, reminiscent of the box for Screaming Yellow Zonkers (are you with me?), says the lists have been compiled by The Center for Impending Doom, for which Parry, voted Class Cynic of his high school graduating class, claims to be the founder.
The Top 10 may not solve any of these earthly issues, but can go a long way to increase awareness among the population. Among the topics of note: global warming, nuclear war, cyberwar, biowar, pandemics, earthquakes, tsunamis, supervolcanoes, blizzards, hurricanes and tornadoes.
Pumped yet? OK: avalanches, landslides, wildfires, floods, droughts, famines, asteroids, alien attacks, solar storms, doomsdays past and future. There, feel better?
So here's 10 of the many Top 10 lists to whet your appetite for Earth's impending doom:
"Top 10 species we'll lose to climate change"
"Top 10 avalanches mostly caused by global warming"
"Top 10 climate change doubters"
"Top 10 times we almost had a nuclear war"
"Top 10 things that will happen when the Yellowstone Supervolcano erupts"
"Top 10 ways to try to stop an asteroid"
"Top 10 signs that the earth is about to be swallowed by a black hole"
"Top 10 ways a particle accelerator mishap could destroy the world"
"Top 10 end-of-world cults you can join now"
"Top 10 ways aliens could kill us all"
So why did Barrett, a legendary children's book illustrator, take on this project? "It's not a very long journey," he said. "The New York Times recently recommended 'Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs' as one of the best books to teach children about climate change. It is, after all, a book about the weather gone awry. Unfortunately we have no toast boats to escape from becoming toast ourselves."
"I feel very strongly that the earth will become uninhabitable unless we do something to eliminate all carbon emissions by tomorrow morning. Yet Parry's meticulously researched book is about more than warming -- it's all the ways forces in and out of our control threaten our existence."
The lists are more than just lists. Listen to Parry's introduction of the top species we'll lose to climate change: "The polar bear is the poster-creature of climate change victims, but these ten (on the list) are actually closer to extinction. One of them -- a mosaic-tailed rat -- is already gone. Oh, we don't care about losing a rat? Hey, just as rats leaving a sinking ship is a warning, maybe we should be warned."
The titles of some of the lists are enough to arouse curiosity, or at least make you read them a second time: "The Top 10 Steps by Which the Biggest Opportunity to Combat Global Warming Was Lost, 1979-1989." Let me see, where was I in 1979?
Or: "The Top 10 Ways the Universe Could -- Tomorrow or 2,000 Billion Years From Now -- End."
Among the Top 10 Quotes About the End of the World, here's one from Mark Twain: "When the end of the world comes, I want to be in Kentucky, because everything there happens 20 years after it happens anywhere else."
Wasn't life so much simpler when your only worry was whether it would be raining meatballs later in the afternoon?

Biden's super comeback adds to Trump's bad week

Texto completo: With eight months until Election Day, President Donald Trump is having a bad week.
Despite Trump's concerted efforts to paint Joe Biden as corrupt -- an attempt that led directly to his own impeachment -- the former vice president pulled off one of the most remarkable political comebacks in recent history Tuesday, reemerging as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and Trump's opponent in November.
The stock markets tumbled again Tuesday amid fears about the ongoing spread of the coronavirus around the world, and by midmorning Wednesday, yet another case of the virus was confirmed in New York.
But futures markets bounced up Wednesday with the news of Biden's victories, after he won states across the South and Midwest by large margins and dealt a serious blow to the prospects of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
For Trump, whose belief in his own ability to shape external events is a source of comfort, it means now confronting a moment when almost nothing is in his control.
He has dealt with the coronavirus, the first external crisis of his administration, by repeating a string of falsehoods rather than delivering reassurance. And his insistence that his administration deserves an "A+++" for its response has done little to calm the rattled markets or an anxious electorate.
Biden even won the primary in Texas, a state that several Trump advisers saw as a bellwether given the makeup of its electorate.
Trump's aides said they are now preparing for a scorched-earth campaign against Biden in the coming months, even as voters Tuesday appeared to favor a candidate who projected calm stability over upheaval and uncertainty.
A sign of Trump's frustration was evident in one of his morning tweets Wednesday -- a screed against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was forced into a runoff Tuesday night for his old Senate seat in Alabama, and whom Trump still blames for the two-year probe into possible conspiracy between the president's 2016 campaign and Russian officials.
"This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn't have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!" Trump posted on Twitter, after Sessions fell short of securing a majority in the Republican primary in the Senate race.
For months, Trump has told aides he believes he can shape the Democratic race to his own advantage by focusing on specific candidates. And he has been more overt than any incumbent in trying to influence the nominating contest of another party, training his Twitter feed on his potential rivals and trying to deepen authentic divisions in the Democratic Party by stoking fears that the establishment was trying to rob Sanders of the nomination.
He floated the idea in January that the Senate impeachment trial was designed to keep Sanders grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Iowa ahead of the caucuses there.
That month, Trump aides also began to see Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and sought to elevate his profile.
Another target was Michael Bloomberg, a longtime rival from New York who had no compunction contrasting his wealth with Trump's.
Bloomberg's withdrawal from the race Wednesday may provide Trump with a small measure of comfort. But it also presents a challenge for his campaign, as Bloomberg has promised to spend $1 billion to help the Democratic nominee and threw his support to Biden.
But Bloomberg was not the main concern of Trump and his advisers. For months, they fanned the flames about Biden's younger son, Hunter, and his work for Burisma, an energy company in Ukraine. That effort was central to the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump tried to pressure Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens in exchange for releasing military aid.
The damage to Trump was obvious, but the former vice president's candidacy also suffered in the process.
But the revival of Biden -- who was buoyed by black voters, a core Democratic Party constituency, in several states -- illustrates the limits of Trump's influence.
"I think Democratic primary voters are numbing to Trump's buffoonery -- black voters in particular," said Addisu Demissie, who managed Sen. Cory Booker's presidential campaign. "They are the ones who have breathed life back into Biden's campaign and, if anything, they may relish seeing Biden take him down."

Texto completo: Crossroads Church senior pastor Brian Tome mentioned the campaign nearly in passing.
He spent about three minutes describing the burden of medical debt during his Nov. 23 sermon, entitled "The Marks of Multiplication." Tome said members of the congregation could text "MULTIPLY" to 313131 to help "free others from medical debt," but insisted the campaign was not a challenge.
Just an awareness.
It was also a great metaphor for his lesson on multiplicity.
"When we are in debt, a sin debt to God, we can't get our way out of the sin debt to God," he said during the sermon. "Jesus comes and gives himself so we can pay off our sin debt, so we never have to worry about God hurting us for our sin."
Crossroads could give to free others' debt, too, he said. And for every dollar they raised, Crossroad's partner RIP Medical Debt would leverage that dollar to abolish $100 in medical debt, therefore multiplying the church's impact.
Within a week and a half, members of the Crossroads community donated enough to abolish over $46.5 million in medical debt nationwide.
Over $42 million of those funds came back to Ohio families.
"Most of it probably that weekend," said Crossroads director of marketing Brennan Hill. "Cuz I think most people, if I had to guess, were doing it in real time. You know, if they were literally getting their phones out and texting in."
Church officials announced the impact of their campaign on Feb. 23.
Most of the funds came back to Ohio families since the church is based out of the Cincinnati region. But the sermons are streamed online, which means anyone in the nation can tune in and participate.
RIP Medical Debt is able to track the donations back to their original ZIP codes to give back. So, if you donated from Indiana, your donation was multiplied and given back to your community in Indiana.
In Ohio, church officials say, they have abolished $42.8 million in debts across 41,233 households in 103 ZIP codes.
They also abolished $1.9 million in debt across 2,974 Kentucky households, $1.5 million across 503 Tennessee households and $200,000 across 136 Indiana households.
What is RIP Medical Debt? An article posted by USA Today last year explains that RIP Medical Debt is a nonprofit organization based out of Rye, New York, that arranges debt payoffs.
The article said medical debt contributes to two-thirds of bankruptcies, according to the American Journal of Public Health. And a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll showed that of the 26 percent of people who reported problems paying medical bills, 59 percent reported a major life impact, such as taking an extra job, cutting other household spending or using up savings.
"How sad that probably the only debt that you don't choose to get – cuz you don't choose to get sick – and it's the one that's affecting most people," said Victor Martinez, spiritual growth site leader for the Oakley location.
When a person can't pay a bill, that debt is often packaged with other people's debt and sold to bill collectors for some fraction of the total amount of the bill. RIP Medical Debt buys debt portfolios on this secondary market for pennies on the dollar with money from its donors.
But instead of collecting the debt, RIP forgives it.
To be eligible for repayment from RIP, the debtor must be earning less than twice the federal poverty level (about $25,000 a year for an individual and $52,000 for a family of four), have debts that are 5% or more of their annual income and have more debt than assets.
Because hospitals and doctors are eager to get those hard-to-collect debts off their books, they sell them cheap.
Working this way puts a high-dollar project within reach of even small churches. Revolution Annapolis, a nondenominational Maryland church with Sunday attendance of around 200 and without a permanent building, wiped out $1.9 million in debt for 900 families in March. Total amount raised: $15,000.
A debt that never goes away... even if you don't know about it According to the Federal Trade Commission, debt collectors have a certain number of years they can sue you and win to collect a debt. This rule is called the statute of limitations, and is six years in Ohio.
This means that for any type of debt, a creditor cannot sue a debtor for debt collection purposes after six years, according to America's Debt Help Organization. That timeframe begins when someone fails to make a payment on a debt. The clock will start again if you make a payment or provide written acknowledgment of your debt after the first six years are up.
Martinez says that because of this law, many people who got a letter explaining that their debt had been abolished thanks to Crossroads didn't even know they had medical debt. If it was after those six years, hospitals and debt collectors had stopped calling.
"If those six years pass, then nobody can give you a call asking for that money," Martinez said. "But you still owe that money, technically. And the only way that you can really get rid of it is if you file bankruptcy, or if you pay for it."
Medical debt never goes away. It will stay on your record if you don't pay it. The law just states that if you don't pay it within that six year window, people will stop asking you to pay – not that you are off the hook.
Martinez said that now that he understands how the law works, he's afraid to call and ask if he owes anything. Because, what if he owes a lot of money? He'll be accountable to pay it, he said.
"That is very scary," he said. "Because what if I have medical debt that I don't know about?"
'A great analogy to what Jesus did for us.' Crossroads officials did not want this story to be about them.
"We kept it off social media," Hill said. "We really want it to be about people in our community, like I said, who are currently giving."
Crossroads members don't know who specifically they have impacted. They could not choose whose debt to pay off. In a letter to each debtor, Crossroads explained the campaign and said that they hope to provide more resources for those in need, whether that is through prayer or connecting them with healthcare professionals in their community.
"We don't want this to be the last interaction that we have with them, but there are no strings attached," Hill said."We just hope that they understand who Crossroads is, what our heart is for the community, maybe set foot in one of our sites."
This whole experience has been a great analogy to what Jesus did for us, Martinez said.
"Jesus, before we knew who he was, he died for us, to forgive our debt," Martinez said. "And here, we don't know who these people are, and we are putting this money for their debt to be forgiven."
According to RIP Medical Debt, Crossroads' campaign is its largest amount of medical debt that's ever been retired. The nonprofit's site claims that its partnerships have erased almost $1.4 billion in medical debt to date.

Buttigieg has a bright future in politics and government

Texto completo: I was sorry to see the Hoosier candidate, Pete Buttigieg, did not get further in his quest for the presidency. But he is a young man with a bright future in politics and government.
Hopefully a new president will appoint him to a position where Buttigieg can put to use his talent in speaking several languages, along with his military experience and the foreign policy knowledge he displayed in several debates – such as secretary of state or secretary of defense or a high position in either important department. Once he pads his resume he can run again for a higher office like the U.S. Senate, or even once again for the presidency armed with greater name recognition and even more experience. His issues were the issues of the future: abolishing the Electoral College, automatic voter registration and abolishing Senate filibuster.

Keep Indy's mature trees standing in neighborhoods We have lived in our neighborhood since we moved here 30 years ago. It is a nice family-friendly neighborhood. During the summer you see kids playing outside, families walking their dogs, and neighbors interacting with each other. It is a beautiful neighborhood with beautiful mature trees that provide shade for the neighborhood.
Recently, the City-County Council decided that we needed a walking path along the main street in our neighborhood. So last month they had all the big, beautiful trees along our main street chopped down, and I am sure that it was not cheap to do that. My understanding is that the next step is to tear up the sidewalk and add a blacktopped walking path, which I am sure is not going to be cheap either.
In speaking with my neighbors, a number of them had stated that they did not want this done, but would have liked to had not only the sidewalk repaired, but also have the pavement on the main street redone. This street has patches on top of patches and is very bumpy to drive over. My question to the City-County Council is, why are you spending money on taking down big, beautiful mature trees and something that really didn't need to be replace, when there are major items items that needed attention first?

Religious people can pray for others – and take action It saddens me that people mock the term "thoughts and prayers." I want to bring awareness to people that just because someone is praying for something, does not mean that they aren't taking action. It doesn't mean they are also not voting, or writing to their members of Congress, or fundraising or whatever needs to be done to create change.
Furthermore, to some, prayer is the most powerful act they can do. To those who believe, prayer is speaking to God, the one who can do and undo all things. Why would you mock someone who has the intention to speak to God on the behalf of someone else to help them? There are countries in which both work and school are not in session because the people need to go to prayer. That is the extent of how important it is to some. It saddens me that we take away the dignity of religious people by assuming they don't care instead of being grateful for them praying on behalf of us or others.

Indiana should remain on one time zone We all have flipped our calendars and have noticed that on Sunday, Americans are forced to abide by taking an hour away from their sleep to support daylight saving time. Isn't it time to end this nonsense? There may have been a time when daylight saving time was useful, but we don't need it now. I ask, why do we have to do this?
Messing with our body time clock is dangerous healthwise and can cause many vehicular accidents the next morning after we change our clock. I remember the bus driver and one child who died the day after the hour change in Indianapolis a few years ago.
Americans need to demand this nonsense of jumping forward each spring be stopped. Indiana needs to stay on one time zone and remain there as well as the entire nation.

Treat substance abuse as a health issue, not a criminal one I once believed in a post-racial society. I was taught the realities of racism were in days past, and that those who were had been shunned, eradicated even. According to Bryan Stevenson of the New York Times, more black and brown people are incarcerated than there ever were slaves at the peak of slavery. The United States of America accounts for 5% of the world's population, yet 25% of the world's prison population. Policies that support this incarceration are locking up nonviolent individuals over narcotics possession, and treating them like they hurt someone, when they were just trying to cope with their situation. Substance use disorder is a disease, yet is treated criminally, resulting in citizens feeling isolated and having high rearrest levels. Incentive in law enforcement to arrest more people for financing is problematic; it's perpetuating a cycle of class suppression via felony labeling.
State legalization of cannabis coupled with expunging of felony records associated to the substance, as well as reforming incentives for arrests in law enforcement, and funding more appropriate substance use disorder treatment centers is needed. This could help pave the way for a future where substance abuse is treated as a health issue as opposed to a criminal one. In a state where our religious and legislative freedom has become one in the same, I ask us to take purely a humanistic approach.

Lack of oversight of Indiana's charter schools is 'appalling' Wake up, voters. Pay attention to what Republican state legislators are doing to fund charter schools and vouchers. Do you really want your tax dollars going to charter schools? To private schools? To schools with a religious agenda? Considering Rep. Jeff Thompson was a public school teacher, I am shocked to see his support of charter schools in his sponsoring of House Bill 1065 where public school boards may share tax referendum funds with charter schools. This is just a short step to shall and should not be permitted.
This bill is just one of several where the state legislators have funneled money to non-public schools. The lack of oversight of charter schools is appalling, yet legislators continue to skim public funds for these pseudo-public schools. They are not really public schools. In rural areas, the public schools are often the center of community activities, yet legislators from rural areas go along with subsidies for charter and private schools. Oppose not just this proposal to permit the use of public money but to all of the legislative gyrations taking your tax dollars away from public schools. Wake up.

Voters must take a close look at Sanders Bernie Sanders used to rail against millionaires and billionaires. Has anyone noticed that since his book deal made him a millionaire, he now rails against only billionaires.
Which leads me to ask some questions: If Sanders has his way, will we all be millionaires, or will he give away his books for free to reduce his net worth to non-millionaire level? Will we all have three homes, or will he give his extra two to a couple of deserving homeless families? Will we all fly by private jet, or will he join the working class in coach?
What if his heart doctor tells him "I can't maintain my practice at Medicare reimbursement levels" – will he seek a less skilled physician to care for his heart, or will he pay extra for treatment, then join his doctor in jail for providing the service outside the government system?
Sanders and his fans ought to take another good look at the law of unintended consequences.

Texto completo: Looking for a new pizza place, coffee shop or cozy cocktail lounge?
How about a sub shop, smoothie bowl stop or healthy food spot?
All of these and more – including the return of a long-shuttered Asbury Park restaurant – have opened recently or are soon will at the Shore; take a look.
Round Pie Pizza Company, Matawan Brothers Kash and Bek Miftari are New York pizza royalty: Their father and uncles own Pronto Pizza, with five locations on Staten Island.
Pronto is known for its pan pizza, but when the younger Miftaris branched out on their own two years ago and opened Round Pie on the island, they went thin crust. They added a location in Old Bridge last summer, and a Matawan restaurant is opening soon. The brothers are hoping for mid-March.
Round Pie's signature pizza has mozzarella, plum tomato sauce, Parmigiana, extra-virgin olive oil and fresh basil. Omit all but the mozzarella and tomato sauce for their classic cheese pie, and fresh mozzarella makes a Margherita. Add garlic puree to the signature for a grandma-style pie.
And while pizza is the go-to here, we have our eye on the beef and pea-stuffed rice balls, served Parmigiana style.
Go: 1124 Route 34; 732-582-0000, roundpie.com. Also at 2323 Route 516 in Old Bridge, 732-475-0000, and 1957 Victory Blvd. in Staten Island; 718-524-0000.
Shore Fresh Meal Prep + Kitchen, Toms River Three years ago, Dan Carroll had open-heart surgery. A quintuple bypass.
He was 30 years old.
The experience kick-started a journey to a healthier lifestyle.
Carroll has a culinary background, and opened a business that offers healthy food for people on the go.
"We're geared toward everyone, not just toward body-builders," Carroll said a few days prior to the March 1 opening of Shore Fresh Meal Prep + Kitchen. (The store, ironically, is opening in the Hooper Avenue space previously occupied by Dozenz Donuts.) "We're custom meal prep. It's all about being able to grab it and go."
Carroll, who is 34 years old and lives in the Bayville section of Berkeley Township, attended culinary school in Maine and worked the kitchens of Spring Lake Bath & Tennis Club and Manasquan River Golf Club. He owns Shore Fresh with Frank Guzman, 45, of the Forked River section of Lacey.
Each meal, priced between $8 and $12, comes with a protein, starch and vegetable. Carroll said he will offer around 15 meal options a day, including sweet Asian meatballs or Buffalo chicken meatballs with rice and asparagus, Teriyaki Hangar Steak with sweet potatoes and green beans, and Balsamic-Glazed Bell & Evans chicken with red bliss potatoes and broccoli. Diners can heat their food and eat at the restaurant, or take it to go.
Go: 1846 Hooper Ave.; 732-272-2029, shorefreshmealprep.org.
Una Pizza Napoletana, Atlantic Highlands From New Jersey to New York City and back again, Anthony Mangieri's highly anticipated new restaurant opened Feb. 28.
Why all the fuss? In a review last year, The New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells said that at Una Pizza Napoletana in lower Manhattan, "Mr. Mangieri makes what is unmistakably the finest sit-down pizza in the five boroughs."
But before becoming one of the city's premier pizzaioli, he was perfecting his pillowy, slightly charred pizzas at Una Pizza Napoletana in Point Pleasant Beach in the late 1990s. He is known for selling only whole pies — no slices, and just recently began allowing diners to customize their toppings.
"My plan was always to end up back in New Jersey and do what I love in the place that I love," Mangieri told The Asbury Park Press last year.
The 30-seat restaurant, which is co-owned by Garry Borealo, 58, of Roselle Park, will be open Fridays through Sundays at first, as Mangieri, who lives in New York City, divides his time between his two restaurants. The doors open at 5 p.m. and close when they run out of dough.
Go: 91A First Ave.; unapizza.com. Also at 175 Orchard St. in New York City; 646-692-3475.
Other restaurant news: Antoinetta's Waterfront Restaurant, West Creek: Closed. The restaurant owners, who had leased the waterfront space on Cedar Run Dock Road, report the property owners have listed the building for sale.
Beans N' Cream, Howell: The coffee shop, which also serves crepes, Belgian waffles and baked goods, opened Feb 23. 4224 Route 9.
Brooklyn Bistro, Toms River: The Italian restaurant closed its downtown Toms River location in early January and reopened in February in the Silverton section of the township. Brooklyn Bistro opened in the space previously occupied by Jules Italian Restaurant. 1861 Hooper Ave.; 732-244-2122; brooklynbistronj.com.
Franny's Pizzeria & Restaurant, Atlantic Highlands: After purchasing Francesco's Italian Restaurant in May 2019, Mya Anitai and Matt Marcus renovated the space and reopened as Franny's Pizzeria in January. Anitai also owns the restaurant Dinamo in Richmond, Virginia, and Marcus is the owner of three bars in New York. 279 Bay Ave.; 732-872-0080, frannyshighlands.com.
Lentil Tree, Asbury Park: The cafe, which closed more than a year ago, announced Feb. 26 via social media that it would reopen in mid-March: "Lentil Tree is coming back to life. Reintroducing a cultural blend of mouthwatering Turkish, Egyptian and Mediterranean cuisine. With both indoor and outdoor dining areas you can come, relax and allow our chefs to do the cooking for you." 808 5th Ave.; lentiltree.com.
Little Mia's Pizza, Toms River: The pizzeria and Italian restaurant, which is under construction, joins Bada Bean Cawfee and Jersey Shore Brewing Co. in The Shoppes at Hooper Avenue.
Long Branch Distillery, Long Branch: The 5,000-square-foot distillery, tasting room and lounge had a soft opening Feb. 20 and is open Thursdays through Sundays. Vodka and gin are currently being produced, along with craft cocktails. 199 Westwood Ave. 732-759-8321, lbdistillery.com.
Mystic Meat & Seafood Market, Stafford: Phil Tretola opened his Tuckerton deli, butcher shop and meat market in 2018, then added a Ship Bottom location this February. Next up, a franchise location in Manahawkin: Mystic Subs, owned by franchisee Jay Zimmerman of Tuckerton, will be located in the Manahawkin Mart Shoppes space previously occupied by Shore Fire Grille. As of press time, the anticipated opening date was April 1. 657 E Bay Ave.; mysticmeatandseafood.com.
Playa Bowls, Stafford: The acai berry bowl restaurant chain, which has more than 80 locations across the country, will open March 15 in the Main Street space previously occupied by cupcake shop Smallcakes. 399 N. Main St.; playabowls.com.
Umberto's Pizzeria, Fair Haven: The Italian restaurant and pizzeria on River Road announced March 2 that it would close March 28 after more than 30 years in business.
Ye Olde Pie Shoppe, Little Silver: The longtime bakery closed at the end of January.
"With bittersweet emotions, we announce our retirement after more than 35 years of rolling in the dough at Ye Olde Pie Shoppe," owners Eileen and Tom Caruso announced via social media. "Our journey began by taking a 'whisk' back in 1984 and purchasing a pie shop inside Andy's Market in Middletown from two local ladies. After a couple of years, we ran out of room and moved to our sugar-coated kitchen in Little Silver Shops.
"We are ready to take the apron off, put away the rolling pin and shut down the ovens. We're looking forward to sharing some new adventures and life experiences."

Biden's super comeback adds to Trump's bad week analysis

Texto completo: NEW YORK - With eight months until Election Day, President Donald Trump is having a bad week.
Despite Trump's concerted efforts to paint Joe Biden as corrupt - an attempt that led directly to his own impeachment - the former vice president pulled off one of the most remarkable political comebacks in recent history Tuesday, reemerging as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and Trump's opponent in November.
The stock markets tumbled again Tuesday amid fears about the ongoing spread of the coronavirus around the world, and by midmorning Wednesday, yet another case of the virus was confirmed in New York.
But futures markets bounced up Wednesday with the news of Biden's victories, after he won states across the South and Midwest by large margins and dealt a serious blow to the prospects of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
For Trump, whose belief in his own ability to shape external events is a source of comfort, it means now confronting a moment when almost nothing is in his control.
He has dealt with the coronavirus, the first external crisis of his administration, by repeating a string of falsehoods rather than delivering reassurance. And his insistence that his administration deserves an "A+++" for its response has done little to calm the rattled markets or an anxious electorate.
Biden even won the primary in Texas, a state that several Trump advisers saw as a bellwether given the makeup of its electorate.
Trump's aides said they are now preparing for a scorched-earth campaign against Biden in the coming months, even as voters Tuesday appeared to favor a candidate who projected calm stability over upheaval and uncertainty.
A sign of Trump's frustration was evident in one of his morning tweets Wednesday - a screed against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was forced into a runoff Tuesday night for his old Senate seat in Alabama, and whom Trump still blames for the two-year probe into possible conspiracy between the president's 2016 campaign and Russian officials.
"This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn't have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!" Trump posted on Twitter, after Sessions fell short of securing a majority in the Republican primary in the Senate race.
For months, Trump has told aides he believes he can shape the Democratic race to his own advantage by focusing on specific candidates. And he has been more overt than any incumbent in trying to influence the nominating contest of another party, training his Twitter feed on his potential rivals and trying to deepen authentic divisions in the Democratic Party by stoking fears that the establishment was trying to rob Sanders of the nomination.
He floated the idea in January that the Senate impeachment trial was designed to keep Sanders grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Iowa ahead of the caucuses there.
That month, Trump aides also began to see Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and sought to elevate his profile.
Another target was Michael Bloomberg, a longtime rival from New York who had no compunction contrasting his wealth with Trump's.
Bloomberg's withdrawal from the race Wednesday may provide Trump with a small measure of comfort. But it also presents a challenge for his campaign, as Bloomberg has promised to spend $1 billion to help the Democratic nominee and threw his support to Biden.
But Bloomberg was not the main concern of Trump and his advisers. For months, they fanned the flames about Biden's younger son, Hunter, and his work for Burisma, an energy company in Ukraine. That effort was central to the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump tried to pressure Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens in exchange for releasing military aid.
The damage to Trump was obvious, but the former vice president's candidacy also suffered in the process.
But the revival of Biden - who was buoyed by black voters, a core Democratic Party constituency, in several states - illustrates the limits of Trump's influence.
"I think Democratic primary voters are numbing to Trump's buffoonery - black voters in particular," said Addisu Demissie, who managed Sen. Cory Booker's presidential campaign. "They are the ones who have breathed life back into Biden's campaign and, if anything, they may relish seeing Biden take him down."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - With eight months until Election Day, President Donald Trump is having a bad week.
Despite Trump's concerted efforts to paint Joe Biden as corrupt - an attempt that led directly to his own impeachment - the former vice president pulled off one of the most remarkable political comebacks in recent history Tuesday, reemerging as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and Trump's opponent in November.
The stock markets tumbled again Tuesday amid fears about the ongoing spread of the coronavirus around the world, and by midmorning Wednesday, yet another case of the virus was confirmed in New York.
But futures markets bounced up Wednesday with the news of Biden's victories, after he won states across the South and Midwest by large margins and dealt a serious blow to the prospects of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
For Trump, whose belief in his own ability to shape external events is a source of comfort, it means now confronting a moment when almost nothing is in his control.
He has dealt with the coronavirus, the first external crisis of his administration, by repeating a string of falsehoods rather than delivering reassurance. And his insistence that his administration deserves an "A+++" for its response has done little to calm the rattled markets or an anxious electorate.
Biden even won the primary in Texas, a state that several Trump advisers saw as a bellwether given the makeup of its electorate.
Trump's aides said they are now preparing for a scorched-earth campaign against Biden in the coming months, even as voters Tuesday appeared to favor a candidate who projected calm stability over upheaval and uncertainty.
A sign of Trump's frustration was evident in one of his morning tweets Wednesday - a screed against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was forced into a runoff Tuesday night for his old Senate seat in Alabama, and whom Trump still blames for the two-year probe into possible conspiracy between the president's 2016 campaign and Russian officials.
"This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn't have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!" Trump posted on Twitter, after Sessions fell short of securing a majority in the Republican primary in the Senate race.
For months, Trump has told aides he believes he can shape the Democratic race to his own advantage by focusing on specific candidates. And he has been more overt than any incumbent in trying to influence the nominating contest of another party, training his Twitter feed on his potential rivals and trying to deepen authentic divisions in the Democratic Party by stoking fears that the establishment was trying to rob Sanders of the nomination.
He floated the idea in January that the Senate impeachment trial was designed to keep Sanders grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Iowa ahead of the caucuses there.
That month, Trump aides also began to see Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and sought to elevate his profile.
Another target was Michael Bloomberg, a longtime rival from New York who had no compunction contrasting his wealth with Trump's.
Bloomberg's withdrawal from the race Wednesday may provide Trump with a small measure of comfort. But it also presents a challenge for his campaign, as Bloomberg has promised to spend $1 billion to help the Democratic nominee and threw his support to Biden.
But Bloomberg was not the main concern of Trump and his advisers. For months, they fanned the flames about Biden's younger son, Hunter, and his work for Burisma, an energy company in Ukraine. That effort was central to the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump tried to pressure Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens in exchange for releasing military aid.
The damage to Trump was obvious, but the former vice president's candidacy also suffered in the process.
But the revival of Biden - who was buoyed by black voters, a core Democratic Party constituency, in several states - illustrates the limits of Trump's influence.
"I think Democratic primary voters are numbing to Trump's buffoonery - black voters in particular," said Addisu Demissie, who managed Sen. Cory Booker's presidential campaign.

Early votes can be wasted on candidates who drop out

Texto completo: Holy moly, we're chock full o' news today. With the presidential primary in full swing, the coronavirus threatening and Florida's legislative session heading for overtime, we've got more bits of tid than a cat has lives ... or at least than Democrats have left running for president.
Let's start with some numbers.
16. That's how many candidates local Democrats will see on their presidential primary ballots March 17.
4. That's how many of those 16 are still actually running campaigns, according to Orange County Elections Supervisor Bill Cowles. (Who emphatically qualified that statement by stressing: "That's as of 12:06 PM on Wednesday, March 4.")
More than 300,000. That's how many Florida Democrats mailed in ballots before last weekend - more than two weeks before the election and, more important, before four of the big names in the race dropped out.
More than 400,000. That's how many Californians cast votes for candidates who had dropped out of the race before the Election Day polls even opened out there.
Listen, I understand the eagerness to cast a ballot. I don't quite get the eagerness to do so before you even know who's officially running or if your ballot will count.
1. That's the number of candidates who dropped out of the race while I was writing a column about candidates dropping out of the race.
On to other news ...
Coronavirus tip, Cajun-style. This comes courtesy of ABCNews reporter Kaylee Hartung, a Louisiana native: "Wash your hands like you just finished eating crawfish and you need to take your contacts out!"
Nestle wants water. Perhaps you've seen the feel-good TV ads that feature a worker at one of Nestle's bottled-water plants talking about how her company pumps millions of dollars into Florida's economy. Several suspicious readers have asked if there's a reason they're seeing that ad. You bet your aquifer there is. Nestle wants a permit to drain up to 1.1 million gallons of water a day. So is this a good idea for a state with water issues? Well, the Gainesville Sun reports that the Suwannee River Water Management District's own experts have recommended against the idea. And eco-advocates have raised also raised objections. But in Florida, rarely are either of those things considered deal-breakers. So we'll see.
Sad this is even needed. You may have seen that legislators filed a bill to stop cops in Florida from handcuffing and arresting 6-year-old children. How very Florida that such a bill is even needed. However, what's even more Florida is that it now looks like the bill may not pass. Be careful out there, first-graders.
Sad this is even needed, part 2. Another bill would prevent judges from imprisoning citizens who oversleep on jury-duty day. This one was filed after a South Florida judge made national news for imprisoning a man who (you guessed it) overslept on jury-duty day. In other words, you live in a state where potential jurors sometimes get tougher sentences than the criminals whose cases they decide. This one might pass.
Pander. Cave in. Repeat. You've probably seen the movie "Groundhog Day" where Bill Murray wakes up every day to the exact same scenario. It's similar to GOP legislators who claim every year they're going to defund Visit Florida. Each year, chest-thumping politicians claim they're going to take on Big Tourism and fight corporate welfare. And then every year, those same politicians follow Big Tourism's marching orders to give them your tax dollars for that welfare. Guys, we know how this movie ends. At least "Groundhog Day" was entertaining.
UCF Prez: Experience needed? Speaking of Visit Florida, one of the odder applicants for UCF president is Ken Lawson, a former Visit Florida CEO and legislator who now runs Gov. Ron DeSantis' economic-development division. At first glance, Lawson would seem to be wildly unqualified for this higher-ed post ... since his resume suggests he has no actual experience working in higher-ed. But what Lawson lacks in experience, he makes up for in political connections. So don't rule him out.
Let's end with a few more politics-by-numbers
1. That's how many of Central Florida's congressional reps keep getting mentioned as possible running mate. We're talking about Val Demings. The New York Times was among the latest to mention Demings, who just finished up a stint as a House manager for the impeachment effort.
2. The number of presidential candidates Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer endorsed in less than 24 hours.
530,000. That's how many Republicans have already mailed in their ballots. How big of a number is that? Well, that's more mail-in votes from Republicans - with nearly two weeks left - than Democrats mailed during all of 2016. And keep in mind: Republicans don't even really have a primary race this year. (Yes, President Trump has opponents named on the ballot. But those challengers have as much a chance of winning the GOP nomination as I do.) That means Florida Republicans who are flooding elections offices with ballots aren't really making a decision as much as they are making a statement. And that statement seems to be they are revved and ready.

Deadlocked in three elections, Israel seeks ways to avert 4th

Texto completo: JERUSALEM - With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's supporters for another term outnumbered by lawmakers who want him gone, Israel's political system - having cranked through the motions of a third election in less than a year only to produce another stalemate - began grappling Wednesday with what to do next.
A nearly complete vote count showed Netanyahu's coalition of right-wing and religious parties with 58 seats in the 120-seat Parliament, three short of a governing majority.
That leaves Israel more or less back at square one - except that Netanyahu's trial on felony corruption charges starts March 17, his opponents appear exhausted by a campaign in which he outclassed them to achieve a solid plurality and no one in the country appears willing to contemplate a fourth ballot.
Netanyahu's Likud party sought to maximize its leverage as the largest faction to emerge from Monday's election, floating the possibility of its recruiting right-leaning lawmakers from the mostly left-leaning Labor-Gesher-Meretz alliance or from the centrist Blue and White party, headed by the former army chief Benny Gantz, who was Netanyahu's leading challenger.
But just one defector - whose political career could be ended, analysts said, by such a betrayal of the voters who elected him or her - would be a lot to ask. Three would seem a miracle, even for Netanyahu.
And the likeliest candidates to be wooed by Netanyahu all insisted they were holding fast to their promises to see him into retirement and could not be bought off, no matter the inducement.
The anti-Netanyahu forces, for their part, showed some new fight Wednesday.
Lawmakers from all three center-left parties said they would propose or support legislation to bar Israel's president from asking a lawmaker under indictment to form a government.
Ofer Shelah, of Blue and White, said the party would pursue measures in Parliament to block Netanyahu from serving as prime minister.
He noted that Israeli law now prohibits someone under indictment from serving as an ordinary government minister but does not specifically address the prime minister's position.
"We believe such a law is worthy," Shelah said.
Nitzan Horowitz, leader of the left-wing Meretz party, encouraged Blue and White to "go for it," saying, "It reflects the will of the public, and it's the moral thing to do."
Ahmed Tibi, of the predominantly Arab Joint List, which won a record 15 seats in Parliament on surprisingly strong turnout among Palestinian citizens of Israel, said it, too, would support such a law.
It was not clear whether Avigdor Liberman's ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party, whose support would also be needed, would join in such an effort. His party emerged with seven seats, according to the unfinished tally.
Still, the idea of such a law drew howls from Netanyahu's supporters on the right, who said it would be retroactive and would not survive a court challenge.
Ayelet Shaked, a former justice minister from the right-wing Yamina party, accused the left, "which exalts democracy," of trying to use legislation to "cancel election results," and "with the aid of terror supporters" at that.
The term "terror supporters" referred to the Joint List, some members of which are accused by critics of having expressed sympathy for terrorists. Tibi is widely reviled among many Israeli Jews for, among other things, having been an adviser to Yasser Arafat, the longtime Palestinian leader.
Analysts said it was unlikely that the legislation barring an indicted lawmaker from serving as prime minister would be approved, in part because of the political storm it could kick up. But several suggested that the anti-Netanyahu parties were making a point as the jockeying over coalition talks begins.

Texto completo: JERUSALEM - With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's supporters for another term outnumbered by lawmakers who want him gone, Israel's political system - having cranked through the motions of a third election in less than a year only to produce another stalemate - began grappling Wednesday with what to do next.
A nearly complete vote count showed Netanyahu's coalition of right-wing and religious parties with 58 seats in the 120-seat Parliament, three short of a governing majority.
That leaves Israel more or less back at square one - except that Netanyahu's trial on felony corruption charges starts March 17, his opponents appear exhausted by a campaign in which he outclassed them to achieve a solid plurality and no one in the country appears willing to contemplate a fourth ballot.
Netanyahu's Likud party sought to maximize its leverage as the largest faction to emerge from Monday's election, floating the possibility of its recruiting right-leaning lawmakers from the mostly left-leaning Labor-Gesher-Meretz alliance or from the centrist Blue and White party, headed by the former army chief Benny Gantz, who was Netanyahu's leading challenger.
But just one defector - whose political career could be ended, analysts said, by such a betrayal of the voters who elected him or her - would be a lot to ask. Three would seem a miracle, even for Netanyahu.
And the likeliest candidates to be wooed by Netanyahu all insisted they were holding fast to their promises to see him into retirement and could not be bought off, no matter the inducement.
The anti-Netanyahu forces, for their part, showed some new fight Wednesday.
Lawmakers from all three center-left parties said they would propose or support legislation to bar Israel's president from asking a lawmaker under indictment to form a government.
Ofer Shelah, of Blue and White, said the party would pursue measures in Parliament to block Netanyahu from serving as prime minister.
He noted that Israeli law now prohibits someone under indictment from serving as an ordinary government minister but does not specifically address the prime minister's position.
"We believe such a law is worthy," Shelah said.
Nitzan Horowitz, leader of the left-wing Meretz party, encouraged Blue and White to "go for it," saying, "It reflects the will of the public, and it's the moral thing to do."
Ahmed Tibi, of the predominantly Arab Joint List, which won a record 15 seats in Parliament on surprisingly strong turnout among Palestinian citizens of Israel, said it, too, would support such a law.
It was not clear whether Avigdor Liberman's ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party, whose support would also be needed, would join in such an effort. His party emerged with seven seats, according to the unfinished tally.
Still, the idea of such a law drew howls from Netanyahu's supporters on the right, who said it would be retroactive and would not survive a court challenge.
Ayelet Shaked, a former justice minister from the right-wing Yamina party, accused the left, "which exalts democracy," of trying to use legislation to "cancel election results," and "with the aid of terror supporters" at that.
The term "terror supporters" referred to the Joint List, some members of which are accused by critics of having expressed sympathy for terrorists. Tibi is widely reviled among many Israeli Jews for, among other things, having been an adviser to Yasser Arafat, the longtime Palestinian leader.
Analysts said it was unlikely that the legislation barring an indicted lawmaker from serving as prime minister would be approved, in part because of the political storm it could kick up. But several suggested that the anti-Netanyahu parties were making a point as the jockeying over coalition talks begins.

Texto completo: Looking for a new pizza place, coffee shop or cozy cocktail lounge?
How about a sub shop, smoothie bowl stop or healthy food spot?
All of these and more – including the return of a long-shuttered Asbury Park restaurant – have opened recently or are soon will at the Shore; take a look.
Round Pie Pizza Company, Matawan Brothers Kash and Bek Miftari are New York pizza royalty: Their father and uncles own Pronto Pizza, with five locations on Staten Island.
Pronto is known for its pan pizza, but when the younger Miftaris branched out on their own two years ago and opened Round Pie on the island, they went thin crust. They added a location in Old Bridge last summer, and a Matawan restaurant is opening soon. The brothers are hoping for mid-March.
Round Pie's signature pizza has mozzarella, plum tomato sauce, Parmigiana, extra-virgin olive oil and fresh basil. Omit all but the mozzarella and tomato sauce for their classic cheese pie, and fresh mozzarella makes a Margherita. Add garlic puree to the signature for a grandma-style pie.
And while pizza is the go-to here, we have our eye on the beef and pea-stuffed rice balls, served Parmigiana style.
Go: 1124 Route 34; 732-582-0000, roundpie.com. Also at 2323 Route 516 in Old Bridge, 732-475-0000, and 1957 Victory Blvd. in Staten Island; 718-524-0000.
Shore Fresh Meal Prep + Kitchen, Toms River Three years ago, Dan Carroll had open-heart surgery. A quintuple bypass.
He was 30 years old.
The experience kick-started a journey to a healthier lifestyle.
Carroll has a culinary background, and opened a business that offers healthy food for people on the go.
"We're geared toward everyone, not just toward body-builders," Carroll said a few days prior to the March 1 opening of Shore Fresh Meal Prep + Kitchen. (The store, ironically, is opening in the Hooper Avenue space previously occupied by Dozenz Donuts.) "We're custom meal prep. It's all about being able to grab it and go."
Carroll, who is 34 years old and lives in the Bayville section of Berkeley Township, attended culinary school in Maine and worked the kitchens of Spring Lake Bath & Tennis Club and Manasquan River Golf Club. He owns Shore Fresh with Frank Guzman, 45, of the Forked River section of Lacey.
Each meal, priced between $8 and $12, comes with a protein, starch and vegetable. Carroll said he will offer around 15 meal options a day, including sweet Asian meatballs or Buffalo chicken meatballs with rice and asparagus, Teriyaki Hangar Steak with sweet potatoes and green beans, and Balsamic-Glazed Bell & Evans chicken with red bliss potatoes and broccoli. Diners can heat their food and eat at the restaurant, or take it to go.
Go: 1846 Hooper Ave.; 732-272-2029, shorefreshmealprep.org.
Una Pizza Napoletana, Atlantic Highlands From New Jersey to New York City and back again, Anthony Mangieri's highly anticipated new restaurant opened Feb. 28.
Why all the fuss? In a review last year, The New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells said that at Una Pizza Napoletana in lower Manhattan, "Mr. Mangieri makes what is unmistakably the finest sit-down pizza in the five boroughs."
But before becoming one of the city's premier pizzaioli, he was perfecting his pillowy, slightly charred pizzas at Una Pizza Napoletana in Point Pleasant Beach in the late 1990s. He is known for selling only whole pies — no slices, and just recently began allowing diners to customize their toppings.
"My plan was always to end up back in New Jersey and do what I love in the place that I love," Mangieri told The Asbury Park Press last year.
The 30-seat restaurant, which is co-owned by Garry Borealo, 58, of Roselle Park, will be open Fridays through Sundays at first, as Mangieri, who lives in New York City, divides his time between his two restaurants. The doors open at 5 p.m. and close when they run out of dough.
Go: 91A First Ave.; unapizza.com. Also at 175 Orchard St. in New York City; 646-692-3475.
Other restaurant news: Antoinetta's Waterfront Restaurant, West Creek: Closed. The restaurant owners, who had leased the waterfront space on Cedar Run Dock Road, report the property owners have listed the building for sale.
Beans N' Cream, Howell: The coffee shop, which also serves crepes, Belgian waffles and baked goods, opened Feb 23. 4224 Route 9.
Brooklyn Bistro, Toms River: The Italian restaurant closed its downtown Toms River location in early January and reopened in February in the Silverton section of the township. Brooklyn Bistro opened in the space previously occupied by Jules Italian Restaurant. 1861 Hooper Ave.; 732-244-2122; brooklynbistronj.com.
Franny's Pizzeria & Restaurant, Atlantic Highlands: After purchasing Francesco's Italian Restaurant in May 2019, Mya Anitai and Matt Marcus renovated the space and reopened as Franny's Pizzeria in January. Anitai also owns the restaurant Dinamo in Richmond, Virginia, and Marcus is the owner of three bars in New York. 279 Bay Ave.; 732-872-0080, frannyshighlands.com.
Lentil Tree, Asbury Park: The cafe, which closed more than a year ago, announced Feb. 26 via social media that it would reopen in mid-March: "Lentil Tree is coming back to life. Reintroducing a cultural blend of mouthwatering Turkish, Egyptian and Mediterranean cuisine. With both indoor and outdoor dining areas you can come, relax and allow our chefs to do the cooking for you." 808 5th Ave.; lentiltree.com.
Little Mia's Pizza, Toms River: The pizzeria and Italian restaurant, which is under construction, joins Bada Bean Cawfee and Jersey Shore Brewing Co. in The Shoppes at Hooper Avenue.
Long Branch Distillery, Long Branch: The 5,000-square-foot distillery, tasting room and lounge had a soft opening Feb. 20 and is open Thursdays through Sundays. Vodka and gin are currently being produced, along with craft cocktails. 199 Westwood Ave. 732-759-8321, lbdistillery.com.
Mystic Meat & Seafood Market, Stafford: Phil Tretola opened his Tuckerton deli, butcher shop and meat market in 2018, then added a Ship Bottom location this February. Next up, a franchise location in Manahawkin: Mystic Subs, owned by franchisee Jay Zimmerman of Tuckerton, will be located in the Manahawkin Mart Shoppes space previously occupied by Shore Fire Grille. As of press time, the anticipated opening date was April 1. 657 E Bay Ave.; mysticmeatandseafood.com.
Playa Bowls, Stafford: The acai berry bowl restaurant chain, which has more than 80 locations across the country, will open March 15 in the Main Street space previously occupied by cupcake shop Smallcakes. 399 N. Main St.; playabowls.com.
Umberto's Pizzeria, Fair Haven: The Italian restaurant and pizzeria on River Road announced March 2 that it would close March 28 after more than 30 years in business.
Ye Olde Pie Shoppe, Little Silver: The longtime bakery closed at the end of January.
"With bittersweet emotions, we announce our retirement after more than 35 years of rolling in the dough at Ye Olde Pie Shoppe," owners Eileen and Tom Caruso announced via social media. "Our journey began by taking a 'whisk' back in 1984 and purchasing a pie shop inside Andy's Market in Middletown from two local ladies. After a couple of years, we ran out of room and moved to our sugar-coated kitchen in Little Silver Shops.
"We are ready to take the apron off, put away the rolling pin and shut down the ovens. We're looking forward to sharing some new adventures and life experiences."

About the VSO
As the region's most celebrated musical, educational and entrepreneurial arts organization, the Virginia Symphony Orchestra continues to challenge expectations and push the boundaries of what an American orchestra can be as it approaches its 100th anniversary season next fall.
At the heart of the VSO's narrative is innovation. In 1991 the VSO made a very bold move in appointing the gifted young American conductor JoAnn Falletta as its music director. Since then, the orchestra has received national attention for its unique mission serving a home area of 1.7 million across the diverse communities of southeastern Virginia. Through appearances at the Kennedy Center and Carnegie Hall and commitment to adventurous programming, the VSO and its musicians have been highlighted in the media including The New York Times, The Washington Post, National Public Radio and BBC Worldwide News.
As the largest arts performing organization in southeastern Virginia, the VSO and VSO Chorus present more than 150 concerts and events to educate, enlighten and entertain more than 100,000 residents and visitors each year. Recent innovations include health and wellness programs, including interactive therapeutic experiences for people living with Alzheimer's and dementia. As it approaches its Centennial year, the Orchestra and its legions of fans look forward with anticipation as the VSO conducts a worldwide search for its next music director.

Texto completo: A book 20 years in the making.
A tribute to two autistic sons who live at Holy Angels in Shreveport.
A printing and distribution partnership with the Louisiana Association for the Blind.
Some books grab you not only with their story but with how they unfolded. "The Rat" by Shreveport banker Merrill Wautlet is one of those.
"The Rat" is about a profoundly autistic boy kidnapped for no apparent reason. Years later that same boy, now a highly trained operative for a covert government agency, sees something while on assignment that triggers a memory of his mother and his home. Without the benefit of being able to communicate verbally, he begins a perilous journey where he must navigate more than 900 miles of terrain while avoiding capture.
Wautlet wrote the book to honor his sons, Merrill III, who goes by M.C., 29, and Andrew, 27, and to deal with the grief he experienced when he and their mother, Jennifer Wautlet, placed their sons in a care facility. M.C. and Andrew were first in care at St. Mary's Residential Training School in Alexandria, then moved to Holy Angels in 2015, decisions which turned out well but were difficult.
"I wanted to honor my boys, so I took some of their strong characteristics—fearlessness, agility, high tolerance for pain, the ability to have iron focus—and created a character from that," he said. "The difference was that the character was a young boy with severe disabilities. He had tantrums, no speech or the ability to read and limited self-help skills. I then came up with a simple objective: After being forcibly taken from his family to be trained and used as a government tool, he decides he wants to go home to his mother, and nothing is going to prevent him from doing that."
Wautlet's sons are his role models in life. "They endure without complaint, they don't judge people, and they don't covet material possessions," he said. "They live in the moment and find joy in the simplest things, like a long car ride and an order of French fries. I try to live my life to be worthy of them, and I really wanted this book to be testament of my love for them."
A partnership with Louisiana Association for the Blind
After a business tour of Louisiana Association for the Blind (LAB) facilities in Shreveport, he chose their printing and office supplies division to publish "The Rat" and work with him on distribution. The paperback book sells for $26.95, including shipping, at https://lablind.com/therat.
LAB has been printing books for local authors since 2013 but is testing a program with Wautlet where it also fulfills orders for books. "We absolutely love working with local authors," LAB Director of Commercial sales Alison Young said. "The pricing varies based on page number, quantity, and graphic design. We have a creative team that can assist with guiding those solutions."
Several members of the LAB team read "The Rat" and loved it. "All reader comments have been that the book is outstanding, a fast and adventurous read, and should be turned into a movie," Young said. "One person said it reminded them of a mini-John Grisham novel. The background of how Merrill came to write the book and the individuals it has touched so far have been the best part of this story."
One LAB employee has an 11-year-old son who is autistic, and the employee read the book twice and loved it so much that he requested to meet Wautlet in person.
Book signing planned for March 19
The author's first public signing, sponsored by LAB, will be from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., March 19, at Red River Brewing. He will do a private signing March 12 for members of The Shreveport Club. Also, autographed copies are free with a $100 donation to LAB, with proceeds going to LAB and Holy Angels.
A 20-year process of writing
"Frankly it took so long because writing a story is one of the most difficult things I had ever done," Wautlet said. "Spelling errors, poor sentence structure, overuse of phrases and keeping timelines and character flow in the right sequences were challenging. I had a lot of characters and a lot of ongoing action in multiple settings, all of it taking place over a short period of time. Sometimes I had to walk away for a few months. Frustration and self-doubt were constant companions."
But he was determined to see it through.
"After a while, I'd remember why I was writing the book in the first place, and I would dive back in... At that point the book became more about honoring them for the way they lived their lives."
He did not finish until after he turned 60 and began to release the book a chapter at a time on his blog at www.merrillwautlet.com. "To my surprise I developed a small following of people who were really enjoying it."
He said he does not have an agenda with the book but merely hopes readers enjoy it and might want a follow-up. "I'm not trying to raise awareness for autism; there are plenty of vehicles for that already," he said.
More about the author
From New Orleans, Wautlet, a 1981graduate of Centenary College, wound up back in Shreveport after evacuating during Hurricane Katrina. Fun fact: Years ago he coached basketball at Southfield School in Shreveport before entering the banking profession. He is available to speak to groups of any size and may be reached at Shrevemc@yahoo.com.
Environmental historian to speak at Authors in April
Jack Davis, author of the Pulitzer Prize winning "The Gulf: The Making of An American Sea," will be this year's speaker at Authors in April, from noon to 2 p.m. April 25 at Margaritaville Resort Casino in Bossier. Tickets are $50, with proceeds benefitting the Pioneer Heritage Center.
Davis is a professor of history and Rothman Family Chair in the Humanities specializing in environmental history and sustainability studies. The New York Times called "The Gulf" a "beautiful homage to a neglected sea." The Pulitzers cited the book as "an important environmental history of the Gulf of Mexico that brings crucial attention to Earth's 10th-largest body of water, one of the planet's most diverse and productive marine ecosystems."
For information on reservations, contact Marty Young (318) 797-5339 or Marty.Young@lsus.edu.

DEMOCRATS MUST UNITE IF THEY WANT TO WIN THE LESSON OF THE HALF-CENTURY BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

Texto completo: Thanks to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the Democratic Party may feel more divided than at any time in recent memory. But neither Mr. Sanders' sizable cadre of young leftists nor the moderates who have coalesced around former Vice President Joe Biden, producing his strong Super Tuesday showing, realize that they're actually engaging in the latest chapter in a very long fight over the purpose and structure of the Democratic Party.
The party began to fracture with a narrow defeat in the 1968 election, which was the first in a string of losses that has embroiled party leaders and activists in a half-century-plus debate about how to win over the broadest possible slice of the electorate, one that hasn't abated even as the party has won the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections. Because the party has not regained the dominance it enjoyed in the 35 years after Franklin Roosevelt moved into the White House, the fractious fight continues over the best way to convince voters that Democrats share their convictions and are doing their best to serve voters' needs.
The discord between the wings of the Democratic Party burst into the open during the party's disastrous 1968 national convention. On those fateful days in Chicago, young foes of the Vietnam War, which President Lyndon B. Johnson had massively escalated, battled with thousands of police mobilized to silence them.
Over the next decade, moderates argued that the party had to chart a middle path between conservatives who hated "big government" and liberals who wanted to expand the welfare state in the interests of Americans of all races. They touted the potential for high tech to create economic growth and thought the poor should take some responsibility for their own plight.
Despite blowout losses by George McGovern and Walter Mondale, liberals didn't see it that way. They countered that the corporate rich were gaming the system for their own benefit and accused their intraparty rivals of blaming the victims of policies that weakened labor unions and cut back social programs. In their view, only federal intervention could restore the egalitarian promise that had made the New Deal so popular.
These battles have been waged repeatedly in primary campaigns during the past half-century. Because neither liberals nor centrists have been able to score a decisive win - or, sometimes, even agree upon which candidates fall into either camp - the argument rages on.
It was the 1988 election and the insurgent candidacy of the Rev. Jesse Jackson that provides insights into the current fight and why Mr. Sanders' campaign has captured such passionate support, particularly among young people who want to transform the political and economic system.
Unlike the more liberal contender in other primary fights - figures such as Ted Kennedy in 1980, Mr. Mondale in 1984 or Bill Bradley in 2000 - who mostly wanted to extend the liberal reforms of the Great Society, Rev. Jackson, the minister and civil rights leader, dreamed of something much bigger. He proposed a sweeping egalitarian overhaul of American society. He set forth, in stirring cadences, a program that included single-payer health care, free community college, equal pay for women, LGBTQ rights, some form of reparations for black people and a vast plan to build affordable housing and mass transportation that resembles Mr. Sanders' program now.
Like the Vermont insurgent, Rev. Jackson proposed reversing tax cuts for the richest Americans that the incumbent Republican president had signed into law and advocated sizable cuts in the defense budget, moving away from a foreign policy dependent on force to one that advanced disarmament.
Both candidates share another similarity: They transformed themselves from protest candidates into serious contenders for the nomination by building a multiracial coalition of the working class and the young. Rev. Jackson's "rainbow coalition" posed the most direct and far-reaching alternative to the party "establishment" before Mr. Sanders battled Hillary Clinton nearly three decades later. And unlike their moderate rivals, each man inspired a mass of ardent followers who dedicated themselves to the cause.
Rev. Jackson exceeded expectations in 1988 and won over 1,200 delegates. At the convention, he delivered a bravura oration that easily overshadowed the technocratic Michael Dukakis' rather tedious acceptance speech. When it seemed he might actually win enough delegates to take the nomination, most white Democrats - officeholders and ordinary voters alike - got cold feet. One of Rev. Jackson's closest advisers reflected, "As long as people could vote for him as sending a message to Democrats [that] we support this kind of economic populism and moral voice, they were anxious to vote for him. But as soon as he got close to actually winning the nomination ... people just said: 'Whoa, We're never going to do this."
Mr. Sanders is closer to winning the Democratic nomination than his leftist predecessor - who never held any political office - ever was. He has more money and a stronger organization, and even rank-and-file Democrats who support other candidates have warmed to his vision of "Medicare for All" and a Green New Deal. Yet as the establishment has coalesced around Mr. Biden, producing at least nine wins on Super Tuesday, the race is now at least even - as Mr. Sanders vowed to fight on and drew explicit contrasts with Mr. Biden in his Vermont victory speech.
But one thing is clear: Whether Mr. Sanders or Mr. Biden is the nominee, a contested convention would be disastrous. Dating to 1860, when the conflict over slavery split Democrats into two hostile factions, a party that does not smooth over its divisions by the time it holds its convention never goes on to win the White House.

Texto completo: Nick Offerman stars in a new, dark sci-fi series from Alex Garland. And "Better Things" returns for a fourth season on FX.
What's Streaming
DEVS Stream on FX on Hulu. Nick Offerman plays a tech mogul in "Devs," a dark sci-fi show about a Silicon Valley company angling to become the Uber of determinism -- the philosophical belief that every event in the universe is completely determined by previously existing causes. Created by the British writer-director Alex Garland ("Ex Machina," "Annihilation"), the series casts Offerman as Forest, a man whose company specializes in quantum computing, and aims to build a computer that can calculate the cause and outcome of any event. The plot centers on one of Forest's employees, an engineer named Lily (Sonoya Mizuno), who becomes suspicious that Forest has committed a crime. "Even through the slow stretches and occasional pretentiousness, I loved the sensual experience of 'Devs'; it was like a spa visit for my eyes and ears," James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times. Poniewozik called the show "half techno-thriller, half art-directed TED Talk on determinism, multiverse theory and the observer effect."
WENDY AND LUCY (2008) Stream on Amazon and Tubi; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. Kelly Reichardt's latest movie, "First Cow," about friends in mid-19th-century Oregon Territory who come to rely on a prized bovine, hits theaters this weekend. Her 2008 feature, "Wendy and Lucy," also shows a relationship between human and animal in the Pacific Northwest. The film stars Michelle Williams as Wendy, a young woman who meanders through Oregon and Washington on her way to Alaska. Her main companion is a mutt named Lucy. A.O. Scott labeled it a "short, simple, perfect story" in his review for The Times. "Underneath this plain narrative surface -- or rather, resting on it the way a smooth stone rests in your palm -- is a lucid and melancholy inquiry into the current state of American society," he wrote.
VERNON SUBUTEX Stream on Topic. A motley crew of Parisians drift in and out of "Vernon Subutex 1," Virginie Despentes's novel about a former record-store owner who starts living on the street. That book, the first volume of a trilogy, was shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize in 2018. Its main character is played by the French movie star Romain Duris in this TV adaptation, which aired overseas last year but is now available stateside.
What's on TV
BETTER THINGS 10 p.m. on FX. "Mom, I want to create a dating profile for you," Frankie (Hannah Alligood) says near the start of the new, fourth season of this dramedy. That mom would be Sam, a Los Angeles matriarch played by Pamela Adlon, who ended the previous season by celebrating her 50th birthday. This fourth season continues the show's investigation of, as James Poniewozik put it in his review of Season 3 for The Times, "aging, growing up, freedom, dependence, mortality, responsibility, the flowering and wilting of life, all at the same time."

Texto completo: Emmy Award winner James Lipton, the influential drama dean who for more than two decades hosted revealing conversations about the acting craft on "Inside the Actors Studio," has died. He was 93.
Lipton died Monday morning at home after a battle with bladder cancer, his wife, Kedakai Mercedes Lipton, told the New York Times.
The loquacious host was both exalted and lampooned for his hyperbole and over-the-top enthusiasm. He welcomed actors, filmmakers and writers on his long-running Bravo series to pull back the curtain on tricks of the trade, presenting professional questions to members of Hollywood's elite.

"It was my child, it was my love!" Lipton told the Los Angeles Times in 2007. "Of course I had hopes, but remember, this show is not about gossip. When I started it, I said it's going to be about craft, craft, craft. I had no dark hopes for it. I just had no way of guessing these things would happen -- that one day ... my friends would say, 'You are getting a lifetime achievement award.' I could not have looked ahead."
For 24 years, the erudite multi-hyphenate divulged his experiences as an actor, theater, film and television director and producer, as well as choreographer, author, playwright, lyricist, screenwriter, author and academic. Yes, at one point he even worked as a "macro" in Paris' red-light district, a topic broached during a sit-down with "Pretty Woman" star Julia Roberts.
Despite his rich back story, the Michigan native was modest when he spoke of himself, telling The Times matter-of-factly, "I've never achieved anything that's really exceptional in ways that others have." The interview show -- Bravo's first original series -- was offered as part of a course in a master's degree program at the renowned Actors Studio Drama School of Pace University in New York, of which Lipton was a founding dean. Each episode was a condensed version of a four- or five-hour master class in acting for graduate students.
"The relationship between the guest and the audience is totally different from any other show that I know of. Our guests come here because I've asked them to come and teach," Lipton said in 2013. "I ask questions that will elicit answers that will be of use and interest to our students, and it turns out they're of use and interest to Bravo's 94 million subscribers."
Luminaries, Oscar winners and former students plopped onto the studio's couch and shared tales of rejection, words of wisdom and improvisational bits for students and the cameras. Also unlike talk shows, Lipton never conducted pre-interviews, resulting in him and his guest being "out here on a high wire for four hours."
Lipton kicked off the series in 1994. His first guest was Paul Newman, but his favorite guest was former student Bradley Cooper. The "A Star Is Born" actor-director was a question-asking audience member as a student and went on to appear in five additional episodes -- not as Lipton's pupil but as his weeping guest.
Lipton interviewed Jane Fonda, Harrison Ford, Meryl Streep, George Clooney, Anthony Hopkins, Goldie Hawn, Jerry Lewis and Tom Hanks, among numerous others. He also managed to elicit revelations from Drew Barrymore, Jack Lemmon, Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie and Gene Wilder, as well as song, dance and improv performances from the likes of Carol Burnett, Robin Williams, Jamie Foxx, Will Smith, Sally Field and Dave Chappelle.
In 2018, Lipton stepped away from the series when it was announced that "Inside the Actors Studio" would be changing networks and getting new hosts. By then, it had received 19 Emmy nominations and one win with Lipton at the helm.
"It's very gratifying to see the legacy of 'Inside the Actors Studio' being carried forward for a new generation to appreciate and enjoy," Lipton said at the time.
His interview style became so well known that it was mercilessly spoofed by Sacha Baron Cohen on "Da Ali G Show" and by Will Ferrell on "Saturday Night Live." "He feasted on me," Lipton joked about Ferrell. "He devoured my flesh."
But it also led to a role in Nora Ephron's 2005 film "Bewitched," which co-starred Nicole Kidman and Ferrell, as well as dozens of appearances on his mentee Conan O'Brien's talk shows and guest roles on "Arrested Development," "The Simpsons," "Family Guy" and "Glee."
He also served as a boardroom advisor on Donald Trump's "The Apprentice" in 2012. Lipton began his television career writing for several soap operas, including "Another World," "The Doctors" and "Guiding Light," which he also starred in.
He also had a hand in numerous specials, including Jimmy Carter's inaugural gala, which was the first presidential concert ever televised; 12 Bob Hope birthday specials; and "The Road to China." He wrote and produced an adaptation of his dance novel, "Mirrors," for NBC and wrote the story and teleplay for "Copacabana," a 1985 TV movie for CBS based on the characters of Barry Manilow's 1978 song.
"An Exaltation of Larks," his classic nonfiction book of group terms and collectives, has been in print since its publication in 1968.
In 2007, he published his memoir, "Inside 'Inside,' " which served as an account of his experiences as the founding dean and Bravo series host.
He made his onstage Broadway debut at the Coronet Theatre in 1951 in the play "The Autumn Garden." He then wrote the book and lyrics for the musicals "Nowhere to Go but Up" (1962) and "Sherry!" (1967), and also produced the play "The Mighty Gents" (1978) and the comedy special "Monteith & Rand" (1979).
Though the majority of Lipton's numerous credits lie in television and theater, his first onscreen film credit came in 1953 with Joseph Strick's crime drama, aptly titled "The Big Break."
Lipton was born in Detroit on Sept. 19, 1926, to Jewish immigrants. His father, Lawrence Lipton, was a journalist and Beat poet but abandoned the family when Lipton was 6. He was raised by his mother, Betty, a teacher and librarian, and his upbringing was peppered with a newspaper apprenticeship and his decade-plus of studying acting and dance.
He underwent intense performance training under Stella Adler at the Stella Adler Studio for Acting for more than a decade, which inspired him to start the Actors Studio Drama School in 1994.
"I created the school to provide in three years what I studied over 12 years. I could have had four PhDs now if they had given degrees for those subjects," he said in 2007.
Lipton, who was also an avid horseman and a pilot, is survived by his wife, Kedakai, a model and real estate broker. He was previously married to Nina Foch.

Texto completo: The New York Times just debuted its new media critic, Ben Smith, with the headline "Why the Success of the Times May Be Bad News for Journalism" and I for one am very worried.
Not for journalism, for the New York Times.
It's certainly a provocative headline -- Ben Smith, most recently editor of the news site BuzzFeed, has just joined the staff of the New York Times and his first column is a criticism of his new employer?!? How counterintuitive! How courageous! Even "Morning Joe" was impressed enough to ask if Smith had managed to get fired on his very first day.

Why, it might even be considered a "hot take," if Smith was not so famously anti-hot-take that he once pulled two columns from BuzzFeed because, as he said in a Tweet, "We are trying not to do hot takes." (After near-universal outrage -- both posts were critical of BuzzFeed advertisers -- Smith apologized, reinstated the posts and later admitted he had bowed to advertiser pressure.)
Hot, his new media take might have been. Courageous, however, not so much. "Isn't it terrible that we're so amazing no one else can even hope to compete?" is not a promising start for a media commentator.
After introducing himself via ironic meet-cute -- at BuzzFeed, Smith was once so sure that he was part of a digital emergence that would "sweep aside dying legacy outlets like the Times" that he offered now NYT publisher A.G. Sulzberger a job -- Smith says he will be focusing on the "consolidation of everything" including that of journalism by the N.Y. Times.
By which he means that the N.Y. Times has done such an admirable job of transitioning from print to digital and other forms of journalism that it now dominates the journalistic landscape. So much so that it has "absorbed many of the people who once threatened it," including editors and reporters from Gawker, Recode, Quartz, Politico.
And, of course, BuzzFeed.
Smith goes on to describe the N.Y. Times' "recent" success in many ways for many paragraphs, one of which actually describes the paper as rising "from wounded giant to reigning colossus." Clearly, the N.Y. Times puts journalism at risk because honestly, there is only so much self-congratulatory hyperbole a news organization can take.
No, wait, the N.Y. Times puts journalism at risk because it may buy the podcast studio Serial Productions, potentially making it "the HBO of podcasts." Or maybe it puts journalism at risk because even though the N.Y. Times has (coughs self-deprecatingly) "more digital subscribers than the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and the 250 local Gannett papers combined," [ital his] it can't hire all the journalists put out of work because ... N.Y. Times reporters start at more than a hundred grand a year? (Which is not that much when you consider the level of experience required to work at a reigning colossus.)
Actually I am not clear why, exactly, Smith seems to think the success of the N.Y. Times makes it journalism's Death Star because he never bothers to explain. Having been a journalist myself for lo these past 30-odd years, I have a few notions of what constitutes bad news for journalism, including but not limited to: the rising cost of paper; the precipitous decline of print advertising; the inability to build a sustainable advertising-based digital model; the creation of profit-driven, 24-hour cable news networks and then the politicizing of same; the power of search engines; the spread of digital and social media platforms; the ubiquity of smartphones; and the growing suspicion among consumers, including and especially our president, that members of the media are inherently biased. Oh, and no more classified ads.
All of that has led to the shuttering and downsizing of many fine news organizations, which does indeed, as Smith says, pose a threat to democracy, both politically and culturally.
But the ability of the N.Y. Times to find paths to relative success despite the obstacles all news organizations face does not make it one of those obstacles. Would it be good for journalism if it had not?
Having watched the Los Angeles Times chipped, chiseled and then sledgehammered by market forces and owners who were, at best, hideously irresponsible, only to have it recently saved at the 11th hour by a local billionaire, I know that digital disruption is real and very scary.
I also know that even at legacy journalism's darkest hour, no sentient being thought BuzzFeed was going to sweep aside the New York Times.
Deservedly, and occasionally not, the N.Y. Times has long been the newspaper to beat. It has always cherry-picked from its competitors, and its rock-solid reputation has allowed it to survive scandal (Jayson Blair), mistakes (those weapons of mass destruction) and myopia (don't get me started on its many near-fictitious depictions of Los Angeles) that would have felled or deeply wounded other news organizations.
That it is succeeding in this time of transition while others fail or continue to struggle is not surprising, it's reassuring.
Granting a few news sources outsized influence has its dangers, of course, even in the best of times (see, please, the war in Iraq). But Smith does not analyze the perils of pride, which include the time-honored belief that the northeast corridor is the center of the universe, or even the more philosophical difficulties of seeking "domination" in a profession that purports to support the common good. At some point, one hopes that Americans will tire of having every state that was not an original colony described in ways that defy reality and subscribe to or resurrect their local paper/website (hint: If you think the media is too East Coast elite, subscribe to or watch outlets originating in other places).
But Smith does not even touch on that. Nor does he offer any examples of how the "reigning colossus" has harmed journalism, either through reportorial misadventure or omission, or how its "uneasy competition of dueling traditions" has damaged the culture.
I myself can think of several specific examples, but I don't think any of them pose an existential threat to journalism itself, and who am I to do Smith's job for him? (I'm also very curious about what exactly "Times executives" mean when they say they are "looking for a way to help out their weaker cousins" and if any of my fellow journalists would pay, say, 20 bucks for a T-shirt saying, "Do I look like a weaker cousin?" DM me if so.)
More important, having raised what he considers a problem, Smith does not offer a solution or even a way forward. Is the N.Y. Times supposed to stop growing? Should it buy that "small handful of news organizations scraping by on local subscriptions"?
Or is "N.Y. Times ruins journalism" just a done deal, until, of course, AT&T sues for use of "the HBO of podcasts."
Certainly nowhere in his column does Smith suggest that readers should stop reading him or even augment their worldview by subscribing to another outlet in addition to the New York Times.
Which actually would have been a very cool thing for him to do. Instead, under the guise of analysis, Smith praises his new employer in prose as breathless as an "omg you're so stunning I hate you" Instagram reply.
The column itself, however, does support the headline. If this is what passes for media analysis, then success of the New York Times may be bad news for journalism indeed.

Surveillance Court Bars F.B.I. Agents From Page Case

Texto completo: An opinion and ruling by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court also accepts a series of reforms the F.B.I. said it would make following a damning inspector general report.
WASHINGTON -- A secretive federal court on Wednesday effectively barred F.B.I. officials involved in the wiretapping of a former Trump campaign adviser from appearing before it in other cases at least temporarily, the latest fallout from an internal inquiry into the bureau's surveillance of the aide.
A 19-page opinion and order by James E. Boasberg, the chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, also largely accepted changes the F.B.I. has said it will make to its process for seeking national-security wiretaps following a damning inspector general report about errors and omissions in applications to monitor the adviser, Carter Page.
But Judge Boasberg ordered law enforcement officials to specifically swear in future cases that the applications to the court contain "all information that might reasonably call into question the accuracy of the information or the reasonableness of any F.B.I. assessment in the application, or otherwise raise doubts about the requested findings."
While Judge Boasberg also ordered the F.B.I. to report back about its progress on the changes, the move essentially brought to a close the court's intervention after the report. His predecessor as chief judge in December had ordered the F.B.I. to explain what it would do to regain the confidence of the judges who review wiretap requests.
The order comes as Attorney General William P. Barr has discussed administratively imposing even greater -- but as yet unspecified -- restrictions on F.B.I. spying conducted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, and lawmakers are debating legislation that would add more safeguards as federal law.
By contrast, the authority of the FISA court is limited: The court can grant or deny applications but lacks jurisdiction to micromanage how the F.B.I. and the Justice Department organize themselves to put together FISA requests as part of counterterrorism or counterintelligence investigations.
After the inspector general report was released in early December detailing a dysfunctional effort by investigators to seek court permission to surveil Mr. Page, whom they had suspected of being a link between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, the F.B.I. said it would take corrective steps.
Officials said the bureau would start enhanced training and use checklists to reduce the risk of repeating one of the significant breakdowns in the process: Evidence casting doubt on investigators' suspicions about Mr. Page failed to reach the court.
The F.B.I. has also since said it will starting requiring field office agents, rather than headquarters supervisors, to sign factual affidavits describing their cases to the court. That was a key suggestion of David S. Kris, a FISA expert whom Judge Boasberg had appointed to critique the government's changes. Mr. Kris told the judge that the F.B.I.'s initial changes did not go far enough.
Lawmakers have been debating more sweeping changes, such as requiring judges to appoint an outsider to critique the government's arguments more frequently. The proposals ranged from requiring the critiques only in cases involving First Amendment activity, like political campaigns and religious worship, to a broader call to use them in all cases involving Americans.
Some civil liberties advocates want to go even further by permitting defense lawyers to read FISA applications when their clients are prosecuted on the basis of evidence from a national-security wiretap to ensure that the applications were candid and complete. Defense lawyers are permitted to do that in ordinary criminal cases, but not national security investigations.
The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, found that four applications to wiretap Mr. Page, starting in October 2016 and extending through the summer of 2017, gave the court an incomplete and inaccurate picture of the evidence, including facts that undercut the F.B.I.'s belief that he might be a Russian agent.
Before the second renewal request, the F.B.I. talked to a source for a notorious set of claims about Mr. Trump and Russia, the so-called Steele dossier, that had formed part of the basis of the Page applications. The source contradicted certain claims the dossier had attributed to him, but the Justice Department did not tell the court.
The Justice Department has subsequently acknowledged to the FISA court that the full spectrum of evidence about Mr. Page available by the final two renewal applications in 2017 fell short of the legal standard to justify his continued surveillance.
While Mr. Horowitz did not find evidence to confirm Republican conspiracy theories that the Russia investigation and surveillance of Mr. Page were a high-level plot to sabotage Mr. Trump for political reasons, he rejected as unsatisfactory the excuse that the officials working on the applications were busy and referred all of them for internal investigation.
Judge Boasberg's new order also directed that no Justice Department or F.B.I. officials "under disciplinary or criminal review relating to their work on FISA applications shall participate in drafting, verifying, reviewing or submitting such applications to the court."
That ban would thus appear to cover the case agent whom the inspector general singled out as "primarily responsible for some of the most significant errors and omissions" in the Page wiretap applications, and who was among those referred for disciplinary review.
The report did not name him, but The New York Times has identified him as Stephen M. Somma, a counterintelligence investigator in the F.B.I.'s New York field office. The disciplinary review process takes some time, and the internal scrutiny of Mr. Somma and his colleagues is ongoing.
Meanwhile, lawmakers pressing for changes to the surveillance powers regrouped on Wednesday after Mr. Trump pressed Republicans at the White House a night earlier to draft a set of changes that could pass Congress and he could sign into law.
Aides to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the top House Republican, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, met to sort out where they may be able to agree on new privacy protections after an earlier legislative effort broke down amid disagreements about how far to go.
"McCarthy said that he thought he and Nancy Pelosi might come up with a package," Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters. "Well, if that happens, that's a big breakthrough."
Congress faces a deadline of March 15, when three F.B.I. national-security surveillance and investigative tools enacted after the Sept. 11 attacks are set to expire. While none of those tools were involved in the problematic Page wiretap applications, they have been caught up in the debate because any legislation to extend them is seen as a vehicle to for broader FISA changes.
Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.

Texto completo: The president who believes he can control events is confronted by further evidence that he cannot.
On Monday, President Trump was already having a bad week.
The coronavirus was spreading, the stock market was plummeting and his administration was getting blamed for an inadequate response to a health crisis.
Then came Tuesday. Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom Mr. Trump was so eager to paint as corrupt that his attempts to do so led to his impeachment, pulled off one of the most remarkable political comebacks in recent history, winning nine states and joining Senator Bernie Sanders as a front-runner in the Democratic presidential race.
U.S. stocks did make a comeback on Wednesday, closing nearly 1,200 points up, which counted as good news for a president betting the farm on a healthy economy. The bad news was the reason many analysts cited for the gains was Mr. Biden's Super Tuesday victories.
For Mr. Trump, whose belief in his own ability to shape external events is a source of comfort, it has been a week of confronting the fact that almost nothing is in his control right now.
He has dealt with the coronavirus, the first external crisis of his administration, by repeating a string of falsehoods rather than delivering reassurance. He has claimed, falsely, that a vaccine would be ready within months when in reality, it won't be ready for more than a year. And his insistence that his administration deserves an "A+++" for its response has done little to calm the rattled markets or an anxious electorate.
There has long been a disconnect between the way Mr. Trump sees politics and the way his more seasoned advisers do. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has been focused on Mr. Sanders and his longtime rival Michael R. Bloomberg. But privately, several advisers said on Wednesday that they were not surprised that Democrats rallied around Mr. Biden, even if the president was.
And they anticipated an ugly slog of a campaign going forward, with the brutal 2016 general election race against Hillary Clinton serving as a reminder of how Mr. Trump will try to tarnish his rivals, even as voters on Tuesday appeared to favor a candidate who projected calm stability over upheaval and uncertainty.
Trump campaign officials said on Wednesday that they viewed Mr. Biden as "Hillary Clinton Lite," a candidate who they will argue generated little enthusiasm of his own while coasting off the opposition to the president and Mr. Sanders among Democrats. They said they planned to undercut his support from black voters by highlighting Mr. Biden's vote for the now-controversial 1994 crime bill, while talking up Mr. Trump's work on criminal justice reform.
And they said they would seek to elevate his backing of trade policies like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal that originated under President Barack Obama.
But they face a daunting challenge. Mr. Obama remains deeply popular with Democratic voters, and highlighting Mr. Biden's work with him could simply energize his supporters to turn out for him in the fall if he is the nominee. And unlike Mrs. Clinton, who was viewed negatively by a large swath of voters over decades, Mr. Biden may have a stronger bond with some voters in his party.
Mr. Trump's frustration over the election results was evident in one of his early-morning Twitter posts on Wednesday -- a screed against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was forced into a runoff for his old Senate seat in Alabama, and whom Mr. Trump still blames for the two-year inquiry into a possible conspiracy between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials.
"This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn't have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!" Mr. Trump tweeted, after Mr. Sessions fell short of securing a majority in the Republican primary.
In a moment of uncertainty, Mr. Trump appeared to be grasping at the equivalent of comfort food: attacking Mr. Sessions. It was, people close to the president said, his reward for staying quiet during Mr. Sessions's primary race, and also a way for the president to highlight a race in which his sustained attacks on Mr. Sessions before the campaign ultimately affected his ability to cleanly win.
It was also clear that Mr. Trump's attempt to dictate the contours of the Democratic presidential contest has had little comparable effect.
For months, Mr. Trump has told aides he believes he can shape the Democratic race to his own advantage by focusing on specific candidates. And he has been more overt than any incumbent in trying to influence the nominating contest of another party, training his Twitter feed on his potential rivals and trying to deepen authentic divisions in the Democratic Party by stoking fears that the establishment was trying to rob Mr. Sanders of the nomination.
In January, he floated the idea that the Senate impeachment trial was intended to keep Mr. Sanders grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Iowa before the caucuses there.
"They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously," Mr. Trump tweeted. That month, Trump aides also began to see Mr. Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and sought to elevate his profile.
The president began singling out Mr. Sanders at his "Keep America Great" rallies as well as on Twitter. "Bernie is going up," Mr. Trump said in January at a rally in Toledo, Ohio. "He's surging. Crazy Bernie, he's surging." He has also highlighted the senator's surges in the polls.
Another target was Mr. Bloomberg, who spent millions of dollars on ads attacking Mr. Trump and had no compunction contrasting his wealth with the president's.
On Tuesday, as polls opened in 14 states, the president tried a directive to voters in Texas and Oklahoma. "Mini Mike Bloomberg will kill your drilling, fracking and pipelines," he tweeted. "Petroleum based 'anything' is dead. Energy jobs gone. Don't vote for Mini Mike!"
Mr. Bloomberg's withdrawal from the race on Wednesday may provide Mr. Trump with a small measure of comfort. But it also presents a looming challenge for his campaign, as Mr. Bloomberg has promised to spend $ 1 billion to help the Democratic nominee and immediately threw his support to Mr. Biden.
Also a challenge is the surprise surge of a candidate with a genuine connection with African-American voters, the essential element to Mr. Biden's success on Super Tuesday.
The Trump campaign has recently put money and time into trying to expand the president's popularity among black voters, employing tactics like opening storefronts in black neighborhoods and devoting a Super Bowl ad to overhauling the criminal justice system. Mr. Trump won only 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, but his campaign operatives thought that facing a candidate like Mr. Sanders, who had his own challenge winning over African-American voters, created an opportunity for Mr. Trump.
But for months, Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and his work for Burisma, a problem-plagued energy company in Ukraine, have been the main concern of the president and his advisers. That effort was central to the impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump tried to pressure Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens in exchange for releasing military aid.
The damage to the president was obvious, but the former vice president's candidacy also suffered. His poll standing fell as he struggled to answer questions from reporters and voters about his son.
But the revival of Mr. Biden illustrates the limits of Mr. Trump's influence.
"I think Democratic primary voters are numbing to Trump's buffoonery -- black voters in particular," said Addisu Demissie, who managed Senator Cory Booker's presidential campaign. "They are the ones who have breathed life back into Biden's campaign and, if anything, they may relish seeing Biden take him down."
The only real role that Mr. Trump appeared to play on Tuesday was to ensure that electability was a chief concern for Democratic voters and was the basis for Mr. Biden's support.
"I would describe him as Sideshow Bob in this process," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. "There's no evidence that he's commanding a large army of voters who are affecting Democratic primaries."
Despite his lack of influence, Mr. Trump appeared eager on Wednesday to continue his kibbitzing-from-the-sidelines role. "No question on the election?" he asked reporters in the Roosevelt Room, where he met with airline executives about the coronavirus.
The president smiled as White House aides quickly shuffled reporters out of the room.

Texto completo: After months of insisting he would not challenge the Republican incumbent, Mr. Bullock, the governor and ex-Democratic presidential candidate, has until Monday to file to run in Montana.
Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana is poised to reverse himself and run for the Senate, according to three Democratic officials, a decision that would hand the party a coveted recruit who could help reclaim a majority in the chamber.
After months of insisting he would not challenge Senator Steve Daines, Mr. Bullock, who ran for president last year, has told Democrats in the last week he is now inclined to run in what would immediately become one of the marquee Senate races of 2020. Mr. Bullock has only a few days to finalize his decision: The filing deadline to run in Montana is Monday.
In an email on Tuesday, Mr. Bullock, 53, declined to say whether he would run. But Matt McKenna, an adviser to Mr. Bullock who has long argued that the governor would not run for the Senate, on Wednesday would say only, "I don't have anything for you."
The Democratic officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Senate Democrats are chiefly on the offensive this year, and have high hopes to defeat incumbent Republicans in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina, where on Tuesday their preferred candidate captured the nomination. But with Republicans holding a 53-seat majority, and favored to defeat Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, it has not been clear which state could offer Democrats the fifth seat they would need to win a clear majority.
For months, even when he was still a presidential candidate, Mr. Bullock has faced questions about whether he would take on Mr. Daines. And when he dropped out of the presidential race in December -- after a spirited but underfunded campaign -- he again said that he would not run for the Senate.
But Mr. Bullock, who is barred by term limits from running for re-election this year, has faced one of the most sustained lobbying campaigns of any would-be Senate candidate -- a reflection both of his potential as a candidate and how badly Democrats need to put another seat in play.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, flew to visit him in Montana last month. And when Mr. Bullock was in Washington last month for the meeting of the National Governors Association, he also met with former President Barack Obama, as was reported by Politico.
At a fund-raising reception in New York City for Senate candidates last month, Mr. Schumer revealed that he was traveling to Montana and projected confidence that Mr. Bullock would agree to run, according to an attendee.
More quietly, a handful of union officials have reached out to Mr. Bullock to assure him he would have all the resources he needs in a state that still retains a strong labor tradition, according to one of the party officials, who was familiar with the conversations.
"I'm hopeful," said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, the powerful educators' union, about the prospect of the governor entering the race.
What may have proved most decisive for Mr. Bullock, however, is that his family is supportive of his candidacy, according to the officials familiar with the discussions. He has long been reluctant to commute to Washington because of the toll he feared it would take on his family.
While his party has been avidly pursuing him, Mr. Bullock is not the only Democrat interested in the race. A handful of candidates are already running, including Mayor Wilmot Collins of Helena and Cora Neumann, an economic development executive who has already raised over $ 600,000 for her bid.
Mr. Bullock, who was Montana's attorney general before being elected twice as governor, ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year calling for an overhaul of the country's campaign finance laws and urging Democrats to pay more attention to rural areas and the West.
But after running as a defender of gun rights in his earlier campaigns, Mr. Bullock said during his White House bid that he supported banning the sale of assault weapons, limiting the sizes of ammunition magazines and enforcing a waiting period to purchase firearms that provided "sufficient time for a full background check of the purchaser," as he put it in a New York Times survey. Mr. Daines and Republicans are sure to attack Mr. Bullock on those issues, even as some restrictions on firearms have grown more palatable in Montana.
Mr. Daines, a first-term conservative, has forged a close relationship with President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted his support for the incumbent.
Mr. Trump again hailed Mr. Daines on Wednesday: "Whoever the Democrat nominee may be, please understand that I will be working hard with Steve all the way," he wrote.
Mr. Trump is likely to carry Montana in the presidential election, just as he did in 2016, but Mr. Bullock could prove a formidable contender in the Senate race. That would particularly be the case if Democrats enjoy the sort of enthusiasm that helped propel Montana's other senator, Jon Tester, to re-election in 2018.
The larger question may be whether a Democrat running in a red state -- and one who mounted a bid to unseat Mr. Trump -- can prevail in a presidential election year and at a moment of such extreme polarization.
Twice elected governor while Democratic presidential candidates were being routed in Montana, Mr. Bullock largely governed as a pragmatist, expanding Medicaid in the state with bipartisan support.
He sought to carry his résumé to Iowa in the presidential race, but drew little support and even less money in a race dominated by flashier and better-known Democrats.
Should he enter the Senate race, money would be the least of his challenges: A Daines-versus-Bullock contest, with control of the Senate possibly at stake, would very likely be the most expensive campaign in Montana history.

Texto completo: Though panned by critics, a show based on the songs of the pop producer Max Martin is up for nine awards at Britain's equivalent of the Tonys.
LONDON -- "& Juliet," a musical that uses the songs of the chart-topping pop producer Max Martin to retell "Romeo & Juliet," dominated the nominations for this year's Olivier Awards -- the British equivalent of the Tonys -- that were announced in London on Tuesday.
The musical, which includes songs by Britney Spears and Ariana Grande, secured nine nominations, despite reviews that were mostly lukewarm at best.
Matt Wolf, in a review for The New York Times, said that "& Juliet" made very little plot go a long way, before adding: "I confess to hardly being the preferred demographic for a show that clearly wants to rival the Broadway-bound 'Six' in the pop-anthem sweepstakes."
"It's essentially glorified panto," wrote Dominic Cavendish wrote in The Daily Telegraph, referring to the campy British theater spectacles that popular around Christmastime. "Whether it outlasts the panto season, that is the question," he added.
The nine nominations for "& Juliet," including best new musical, put it one ahead of Trevor Nunn's revival of "Fiddler on the Roof," which opened at the Menier Chocolate Factory in 2018 before transferring to the West End. "Musically, geopolitically, emotionally, this Fiddler raises the roof," wrote Mark Lawson in The Guardian.
The nonmusical categories were led by two plays: a revival of Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman" starring Wendell Pierce, and a revival of Henrik Ibsen's "Rosmersholm" at the Duke of York's Theater. Both gained five nominations.
"Death of a Salesman" was expected to do well, having won praise from critics. Directed by Marianne Elliott and Miranda Cromwell, it reimagined Willy Loman, the doomed title character, as a black man in a white man's world. "What's most surprising," Ben Brantley wrote in his review for The New York Times, "is how vital it is."
"If this 'Salesman' had been retooled to be solely about race, it would shrink and oversimplify Miller's play," Brantley added. "Instead, race expands and exacerbates Willy's suppressed fears that the world regards him as outcast, a loser, a clown."
Pierce was nominated for best actor, and will compete with James McAvoy, nominated for "Cyrano de Bergerac" at the Playhouse Theater, Andrew Scott for "Present Laughter" at The Old Vic, and Toby Jones for "Uncle Vanya" at the Harold Pinter Theater.
The best actress category sees Phoebe Waller-Bridge nominated for a revival of "Fleabag." She is up against Hayley Atwell for "Rosmersholm," Sharon D. Clarke for "Death of a Salesman" and Juliet Stevenson for "The Doctor" at the Almeida Theatre, which transfers to the Duke of York's Theater in April.
The best new play category includes nominations for Lucy Prebble's "A Very Expensive Poison," about a Russian assassination on British soil, and Tom Stoppard's "Leopoldstadt," about Jewish life in Vienna, at Wyndham's Theater through June 13.
They will compete against Robert Icke's "The Doctor" and "The Ocean at the End of the Lane," an adaptation of a Neil Gaiman novel.
The winners are to be announced in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London on April 5.

Split Grows As Trump Cheers On Economy

Texto completo: President Trump has convinced his supporters that the economy's ability to grow rests solely with his continued leadership.
WASHINGTON -- One of President Trump's greatest strengths in his presidential campaign is his economic salesmanship: He has convinced a devoted share of Americans that his leadership has made the U.S. economy bulletproof and that markets would crash if he were defeated in November.
The president's ability to set the economic narrative is buoyed by an 11-year economic expansion, with rising wages and unemployment at a 50-year low. That strength presents a challenge for the Democrats hoping to unseat him in November -- even though Mr. Trump's cheerleading is often overstated and parts of the economy are slowing, including manufacturing.
That helps explain why Mr. Trump has played down economic damage from the coronavirus and dismissed the stock market plunge: They threaten to undermine the most effective story he tells about his presidency.
"The country is in great shape, the market is in great shape," Mr. Trump told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday, as stocks tumbled after the Federal Reserve's rate cut. The S&P 500 ended the day down about 2.8 percent.
Mr. Trump has blamed any growth hiccups on external events, like the Democrats running for president, troubles at the aerospace giant Boeing and the Federal Reserve. He has praised consumers and the economy's strength, even as forecasters warn that the virus could dampen growth at least temporarily this year.
On Monday, Mr. Trump suggested on Twitter that House Democrats pass a one-year cut in payroll taxes, a form of fiscal stimulus often aimed at boosting consumer spending at times of economic weakness. Yet the president did not concede any economic trouble.
"This is an incredible time for our nation," he wrote on Twitter. "Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging."
That kind of rhetoric has served Mr. Trump well during his first three years in office, helping him win credit -- at least among supporters -- for what remains a strong economy. But experts warn that it has also helped widen a partisan divide on the economy, which may make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to reassure the public in the event of a crisis, like the spread of coronavirus.
"The aura of the office, where people might have deferred to the message about the state of the economy, I think today that's gone," said Shanto Iyengar, a political scientist at Stanford University. "It's gone because of the hyper-partisanship."
Americans who tune into Mr. Trump's messages are far more likely to echo his language on the economy and are more optimistic about it, according to a new nationwide poll conducted last month for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey.
Respondents were asked to choose from a list of terms that could describe the state of the economy. Those who said they regularly watched or followed news coverage of Mr. Trump's speeches were about twice as likely to describe the economy as "booming" or the "best economy ever," and they were far more likely to express confidence in the economy and give Mr. Trump credit for its condition.
The split persisted among Democrats, independents and even among Republicans. More than eight in 10 Republican voters who regularly follow Mr. Trump's speeches say Mr. Trump deserves "a lot" of credit for the economy. Only about one in three Republicans who do not regularly follow the speeches said the same.
Will Hicks, a 32-year-old survey respondent in the oil field town of Roosevelt, Utah, said Mr. Trump's election provided an immediate jolt to people in his area. He credits Mr. Trump and his boosterism for much of that, even though he said the president's claims were often overstated.
"His viewpoint is all positive, that we're going to get greater, we're going to improve our economy," Mr. Hicks said. "I think that push forward, even though it might be a little bit of an exaggeration, has helped the economy."
Some economists agree. Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Yale, has described Mr. Trump's cheerleading as the driving force behind the continuation of the now-record economic expansion over the last three years.
In a presentation earlier this year -- in which he compared Mr. Trump's economic messaging to the spread of a pandemic virus -- Mr. Shiller reported than 62 percent of newspaper articles that mentioned a "strong economy" from 2017 to 2019 also mentioned Mr. Trump. That's more than twice the rate of association that President Bill Clinton enjoyed during a stronger economy in the late 1990s.
Mr. Trump "is our first motivational-speaker president," Mr. Shiller said.
Mr. Trump made grand economic promises a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, and he reveled in the stock-market surge that followed his victory. Even before he took office, consumer and small-business confidence levels soared, driven largely by Mr. Trump's Republican supporters. Both measures have remained elevated throughout his term, with sentiment among Republican consumers hitting a record high in February in a long-running survey from the University of Michigan.
But on several measures, the economy has fallen short of the president's promises. It grew 2.3 percent last year, well below the forecasts of Mr. Trump's economic team, as the president's trade war chilled business investment. Economic growth in the first three years of President Barack Obama's second term was nearly identical to that of Mr. Trump's first three years. Median wage growth is no higher today than it was in October 2016, and it remains well below the levels of the late 1990s.
Small business owners' expectations for capital investment now are essentially unchanged from before the 2016 election. Among consumers, the postelection rise in confidence has failed to translate into a sustained improvement in spending, shattering a longstanding relationship. After Mr. Trump's election, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, "a gap opened up between the spending and confidence numbers, and that gap has persisted."
The confidence gap is driven entirely by asymmetric partisanship, powered by a surge in Republican sentiment. When Mr. Obama was in office, surveys consistently showed that Democrats felt better about the economy than Republicans. When Mr. Trump was elected, the pattern reversed almost overnight, though the surge in Republican optimism was larger than the drop-off among Democrats.
Masha Krupenkin, a Boston College political scientist, said Republicans show bigger swings in economic confidence, and exhibit a similar pattern in surveys that ask about trust in government, depending on which party controls the White House, compared with Democrats.
The Times survey showed Democrats were less optimistic about the economy and less willing to credit Mr. Trump for it than Republicans were. Confidence among independent voters has fallen to a level between that of Democrats and Republicans, but closer to Democrats', during Mr. Trump's term. (Optimism among independents surged in January, but came back to earth in February, according to the Times survey.)
Douglas Prasher, a Democratic voter in Prescott Valley, Ariz., said he didn't buy claims that the economy was doing well -- and he didn't think Mr. Trump deserved credit if it was. Mr. Prasher, 68, recently retired to Arizona from San Diego, which he said had become unaffordable because of sky-high housing costs. His new home state is cheaper, but he has still had to take on a part-time job to make ends meet. He carries hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt from helping his daughters go to college.
"As far as I'm concerned, people are suffering," Mr. Prasher said. The supposedly strong economy, he said, "seems to only help the wealthy, which we're not in that category."
That rhetoric echoes the message of Democratic candidates running for the White House, who frequently claim that the economy is "rigged" or only works for the very rich. Democrats in the Times survey were much more likely to use that phrasing to describe the economy than Mr. Trump's preferred terms. So were independents, who were six times as likely to call the economy "rigged" or badly broken" as to say it was the "best economy ever."
Mr. Trump's aggressive claims -- that it is not just strong but "the best ever" -- may make him less credible to people not already inclined to support him, said Michele Claibourn, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. "It's easier to resist as information if it feels exaggerated," she said.
Ms. Claibourn said presidents have historically tried to distinguish between when they were speaking as party leaders and when they were addressing the public in their official, less partisan, capacity. Those lines have blurred over the decades. Under Mr. Trump, the distinction has disappeared almost entirely, she said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has formally revised a proposal that would significantly restrict the type of research that can be used to draft environmental and public health regulations, a measure that experts say amounts to one of the government's most far-reaching restrictions on science.
The revisions made public Tuesday evening mean the Environmental Protection Agency would give preference to studies in which all underlying data is publicly available. That slightly relaxed restrictions in an earlier draft that would have flatly excluded any research that did not offer up its raw data, even if that data included medical information protected by privacy laws or confidentiality agreements.
Even with the latest changes, scientists warned that the regulation would let the federal government dismiss or downplay some of the most important environmental research of the past decades. That includes research that definitively linked air pollution to premature deaths but relied on the personal health information of thousands of study subjects who had been guaranteed confidentiality.
The proposal is one of dozens of environmental protection rollbacks that the Trump administration is scrambling to finalize before the presidential election in November. It caps more than three years of efforts to dilute scientific research, especially on climate change and air pollution, which has underpinned rules that the fossil fuel industry calls burdensome.
Andrew R. Wheeler, the administrator of the E.P.A., said the proposed regulation was an effort to bring greater transparency to government research.
"I am committed to ensuring that the science underlying E.P.A.'s actions is of the highest quality," he said in a statement. Once the rule is finalized, he added, it "will ensure that all pivotal studies underpinning significant regulatory actions at the E.P.A., regardless of their source, are available for transparent review by qualified scientists."
Under the new version of the plan, the E.P.A., when writing or revising environmental regulations, would have to give greater weight to research in which the underlying data are available to be retested.
Critics of the proposal, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest general scientific society, argued that the administration's real goal was to raise suspicions about the bedrock studies that helped establish modern regulations governing clean air and water.
Seminal research that has definitively linked polluted air to premature deaths, like a 1993 Harvard University report known as the Six Cities study, often persuaded participants to offer personal health information and other private data by extending strict confidentiality.
Environmental activists and former Obama administration leaders said the new rule would make it easier for the E.P.A. to weaken or repeal existing health regulations because studies that had previously been used to show the benefits might now be discarded or assigned less importance.
Gina McCarthy, who led the E.P.A. under former President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration already was facing scrutiny over its handling of the coronavirus, and she criticized the agency for moving forward with the new rule in the middle of a public health crisis.
"Now is not the time to play games with critical medical research that underpins every rule designed to protect us from harmful pollution in our air and in our water," she said. "The American people have the right to know the truth about threats to our health, and the truth about our future in the face of the climate crisis."
Scott Pruitt, President Trump's first E.P.A. administrator, initiated the plan in 2018, and it faced an avalanche of criticism from the scientific community. When Mr. Wheeler succeeded him in 2019, he indicated that the agency intended to move forward with the plan but would take some time to review the public's concerns.
In November, a draft supplement offering additions and clarifications to the original rule was obtained by The New York Times. Rather than responding to the critics, the E.P.A. appeared to be widening the scope of the plan by allowing its limits on research to be applied retroactively to reverse existing air and water regulations.
The version made public on Tuesday appeared to drop the retroactivity element and said the rule would only apply to studies "that are potentially pivotal to E.P.A.'s decisions or influential scientific information that are developed in the future."
But several critics of the plan noted that many existing regulations come up for renewal or reconsideration every few years, so even longstanding rules could be subject to the restrictions. Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said benchmark science like Harvard's Six Cities air pollution study might soon be deemed inadmissible.
"They're putting in nonscientific criteria to decide what science the agency can use," Mr. Rosenberg said. "Now the most important thing is whether the data is public, not the strength of the scientific evidence."
The fresh revisions give the E.P.A. administrator the discretion to consider a study that has not made all its personnel and other data public. But Mr. Rosenberg said that would only take scientific decision-making out of the hands of scientists and hand it to a politically appointed administrator.
"It makes it easier for industry in most cases to say, 'There's too much uncertainty; you shouldn't move forward,"' he said.
In January an advisory panel of Mr. Trump and Mr. Wheeler's own scientists criticized the so-called transparency proposal, saying the E.P.A. "has not fully identified the problem to be addressed" by the new rule. When the plan is inevitably challenged in court, legal experts said, a judge was also likely to ask what health problem the agency sought to solve by enacting the regulation.
Stanley Young, a Heartland Institute adviser whose research has questioned the links between particulate matter pollution and premature death, called the latest E.P.A. plan a "reasonable compromise" and said regulations themselves could harm public health by straining the economy.
"It's well established over hundreds of years that the rich generally live longer than the poor," said Mr. Young, a retired statistician who is also a member of the E.P.A.'s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. "To the extent that resources are taken from individuals for a purported group improvement, there's a trade-off between the money you leave with the people and the money you take to execute government policy."
The public will have 30 days to comment on the addition to the proposed rule. Experts said a final regulation could be issued before the summer.

Texto completo: Readers analyze the reasons for his strong showing and what it means for Bernie Sanders.
To the Editor:
Re "Big Night for Biden Serves Notice to Sanders" (front page, March 4):
"We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us." With those nine words, Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina kicked off an incredible week for Joe Biden and for the Democratic Party. His endorsement, followed by a Biden landslide in South Carolina, more important endorsements and a superb Super Tuesday make clear what most Democrats want.
In the last three years, President Trump has enabled North Korea and Iran to become more dangerous and made a mess of our important alliances. Mr. Biden's comeback shows that having a plan for that or creating a revolution are less important than the security of "Joe knows us."
Elliott Miller
Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
To the Editor:
I could easily call myself a democratic socialist. I believe that Medicare is a lifesaver for senior citizens and that it should be extended to all Americans. What is the virtue in a college education that burdens people for years with loans? My heart is with Bernie.
And yet I voted for Joe. I don't believe that the country is ready for a revolution, and Bernie would find it impossible to advance his agenda if he won -- which I fear he might not. The time is not right for Bernie, and defeating Donald Trump is the top priority.
Lou Raye Nichol
Cary, N.C.
To the Editor:
The real hero of Super Tuesday was Elizabeth Warren. It was her courage, clarity and strategic skill that hit Mike Bloomberg in his first debate. She made him confront the grievances many had about his past. She demonstrated how ill prepared he was. This was a major blow to his threat to Joe Biden.
Thankfully, Mr. Bloomberg has shown the courage and integrity to step aside and play another role in taking the White House. I hope Senator Warren's immense strengths are put to work in rebuilding our country in a Biden administration.
Nancy Milio
Chapel Hill, N.C.
To the Editor:
In terms of policy, I'm a big Bernie Sanders fan. But, most of all, I'm committed to defeating President Trump, the political nightmare of my lifetime. I have trouble forgiving Joe Biden for his handling of the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. But he is a decent man with reasonably progressive instincts. Apparently, he can draw the African-American community (Obama coattails) and the white working-class guys.
He needs progressives to turn out -- not to blow the election off entirely or vote third-party -- so why not a ticket of Joe Biden (with a commitment to just one term) and Elizabeth Warren (who can excite so many of us)? Joe and Elizabeth, time for a private conversation? This is a very critical time.
Michael Rooke-Ley
Eugene, Ore.
To the Editor:
There are psychological explanations for Joe Biden's strength in the Super Tuesday voting. In the context of fearful times, when facing a novel deadly pandemic, people gravitate toward the familiar and calming, which Mr. Biden supplies, rather than Bernie Sanders's change and excitement.
Psychology also explains generational differences among voters' reactions to two candidates in their late 70s. Older voters seek Mr. Biden's continuity while youths seek Mr. Sanders's change.
Carol Goldberg
New York
The writer is a psychologist.
To the Editor:
Can the Democratic Party afford to lose its left wing? Until Tuesday, I was planning to vote for A.B.T. (Anyone But Trump) come November. But the Democratic establishment's rush to derail Bernie Sanders's campaign is making me think twice.
I do not know what Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar were offered in exchange for their endorsement of Joe Biden. Cabinet positions would be my best guess. This smells very bad and is very discouraging to those of us who wish to steer our party in what we believe to be the right direction.
The establishment may think we have nowhere else to go, but that would be wrong. I voted Green Party when, for example, I could not stomach supporting Gore-Lieberman in 2000. I am perfectly ready to do that again.
Please do not take us for granted.

To the Editor:
This country was built on the backs of black enslaved Africans. Now it is their descendants who are exercising their franchise to save our democracy.

To the Editor:
Re "5 Takeaways From a Super Tuesday That Changed the Democratic Race" (nytimes.com, March 3):
Perhaps the most striking takeaway is the utter failure of the massive amounts of money spent by Michael Bloomberg to have a discernible impact on the Super Tuesday outcome. Over the years, the obsessive quest for campaign contributions by candidates and elected officials on both sides of the aisle and at all levels of our political system has increasingly undermined public confidence in our government. Thank you, Michael Bloomberg, for opening our eyes and teaching us all this profoundly important lesson.
Paul Jellinek
Mercerville, N.J.
To the Editor:
It seems that the Democratic race has come down to two elderly men, one with a history of heart trouble and the other who may be having more and more trouble keeping his mind from wandering. Democrats, and all voters, have the right to know all they can about the health of these candidates. The public should demand that Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have complete physical and psychological workups, and that the full results be released.
The nation's future well-being is too important to be left to guesses and hope about the candidates' physical and psychological ability to handle the job they seek.
Jonathan J. Margolis
Brookline, Mass.
To the Editor:
After the Super Tuesday results, Bernie Sanders's supporters are justifiably disappointed. But what they need to realize is that a Joe Biden presidency would be only a beginning, not an end to their quest. Mr. Biden is no ideologue. He's "pushable," and if elected, he will owe the progressive wing big time if it supports him.
Progressives need to go to the streets and use every other means to promote their aims if Mr. Biden is elected. Want "Medicare for all," climate change or an end to college debt? Ask for it! And keep asking! But sit on your hands now and the penalty is four more years of President Trump, unrestrained this time by the need to be re-elected. A very dark place, indeed.
Jay Schleifer
Wellington, Fla.
To the Editor:
Joe Biden just had the biggest night of his long political career. Let the fretting and carping begin anew among Democrats. However, before recommencing eating itself, allow me to humbly suggest the party take a moment to celebrate.
Democrats have fought big battles in the past and won. The biggest question now is, can they stop fighting each other long enough to meet the challenge ahead? Namely, defeating Donald Trump in the fall. I believe that how they choose to face this challenge will shape the identity of the party for years to come.
Joe Elliott
Asheville, N.C.
To the Editor:
It was heartening to see Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Mike Bloomberg step aside in favor of Joe Biden in a true show of unity for a larger cause. I now ask supporters of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren whether they are so attached to their progressive vision (much of which I share) that they will take a substantial risk of four more years of President Trump's court picks, four more years of assaults on our democracy and four more years during which the warming of our planet may become unstoppable.

Justices Give Few Hints In Abortion Law Case

Texto completo: The Supreme Court is considering whether Louisiana can require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, in a case likely to yield an unusually telling decision.
WASHINGTON -- The argument at times sounded like a sterile analysis undertaken by management consultants: What were the benefits of requiring doctors who perform abortions to have relationships with nearby hospitals? Would requiring such relationships force abortion clinics to close?
The questions -- about medical regulations, hospital bylaws, travel times and safety records -- could seem pedestrian in their granular details. But the cost-benefit analysis undertaken on Wednesday at the Supreme Court illustrated its current approach to the right to abortion, one that seems to turn on contested factual disputes rather than broad constitutional principles.
The arguments were the court's first sustained consideration of abortion since President Trump's appointments of Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh shifted the court to the right. The case is very likely to yield an unusually telling decision, expected in June, with broad implications for the presidential campaign.
At issue was a Louisiana law that requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a requirement that abortion rights groups say is medically pointless and intended to limit the number of clinics in the state.
Supporters of the Louisiana law say it protects the health and safety of women seeking abortions and helps ensure the competence of doctors.
Opponents say the law's real purpose is to make it harder for women to get abortions. Doctors who perform abortions are often unable to obtain admitting privileges for reasons unrelated to their competence, the law's critics say, and the privileges themselves do not make abortions safer, as hospitalizations after abortions are rare and women receive medical care at hospitals regardless of whether their doctors have admitting privileges.
Since the Louisiana law was enacted in 2014, only two doctors have been able to meet the requirement, the law's challengers say, and one testified that he could not handle his clinic's work alone.
The members of the court who may hold the key votes -- Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Kavanaugh -- focused their questions on whether they were bound by a 2016 decision by the court that struck down an identical Texas law. They suggested that at least half of the cost-benefit analysis was identical in the two states, and they wondered whether that was sufficient to decide the case.
"I understand the idea that the impact might be different in different places," Chief Justice Roberts said, "but as far as the benefits of the law, that's going to be the same in each state, isn't it?"
The court's four liberal members seemed convinced that the Louisiana law, like the one from Texas, imposed the sort of "undue burden" on the right to abortion prohibited by the court's 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The law did nothing to protect women's health, they said, but it did create a substantial obstacle to the ability of women to obtain abortions.
Only Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked questions consistently supportive of the Louisiana law. Justices Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas asked no questions.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer said the very divisiveness of the societal debate over abortion argued in favor of respect for precedent.
"In the country, people have very strong feelings, and a lot of people morally think it's wrong and a lot of people morally think the opposite is wrong," he said. "The court is struggling with the problem of what kind of rule of law do you have in a country that contains both sorts of people."
"Why depart," he asked, "from what was pretty clear precedent?"
The vote striking down the Texas law in 2016 was 5 to 3, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, now retired, joining the court's four-member liberal wing to form a majority. The case was decided by an eight-member court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia that February. Since then, Mr. Trump appointed Justice Gorsuch to succeed Justice Scalia and Justice Kavanaugh to succeed Justice Kennedy.
In the 2016 decision, Justice Breyer, writing for the majority, said there was no evidence that the Texas law's admitting-privileges requirement "would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment." But there was good evidence, he added, that the requirement caused the number of abortion clinics in Texas to drop to about 20 from about 40.
Chief Justice Roberts repeatedly suggested on Wednesday that at least the first part of the analysis should be the same in Louisiana as it was in Texas. "Why do you look at each state differently if the benefits of the law" are "not going to change from state to state?" he asked.
Justice Kavanaugh asked whether the admitting-privileges requirement offered any benefits to women seeking abortions and, if it did not, whether that should be the end of the matter.
"Are you saying," he asked Julie Rikelman, a lawyer with the Center for Reproductive Rights, "that admitting privilege requirements are always unconstitutional such that we don't need to look at the facts state by state?"
"These laws have no medical benefits whatsoever, and only impose barriers to abortion," Ms. Rikelman said.
Justice Kavanaugh also asked whether the court would be required to strike down admitting-privileges laws even if all doctors seeking to provide abortions could obtain the privileges.
Ms. Rikelman said "that law would have no benefit." But she added that such a law "may pose a much harder question than this case."
The Louisiana law requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, a requirement that some justices questioned.
"What sense does the 30-mile limit make?" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked, noting that complications are likely to arise, if at all, after a woman returns home. "And her home has no necessary relationship to 30 miles from a clinic."
Lawyers for Louisiana and the federal government defended the law, saying it provided needed protections, and they urged the court to scrutinize the facts on the ground in Louisiana.
The burdens imposed by admitting-privilege laws, said Jeffrey B. Wall, a lawyer for the federal government, "may vary by state."
Justice Kagan discussed the record of a clinic in Shreveport, La. "There is evidence in the record that Hope Clinic has served over 3,000 women annually for 23 years, so that's around 70,000 women," she said, "and has transferred only four patients ever to a hospital."
Elizabeth Murrill, Louisiana's solicitor general, said those numbers may not have taken account of women who developed complications after the procedures. She added that the doctors had not tried hard enough to obtain privileges. "They sabotaged their own applications," she said.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the requirement was unrealistic, singling out one doctor.
"He's the doctor who does only medical abortions, not surgical," she said. "He hadn't done a surgical procedure for over 12 years. And your state's own expert testified that it was not likely that he was going to get privileges anywhere because he only did medical procedures."
The Supreme Court granted a last-minute request last year from abortion providers to block the Louisiana law while they pursued an appeal in the case. That interim ruling featured an unusual 5-to-4 coalition, with Chief Justice Roberts joining the court's liberals. He had dissented in the Texas decision.
The meaning of Chief Justice Roberts's vote to temporarily block the Louisiana law is unclear, and it is hardly certain that he will vote to uphold the law now that it is before the court on its merits. Instead, he might have meant only to ensure an orderly process in which the Supreme Court, rather than an appellate panel, decides whether to limit or overrule a recent Supreme Court precedent.
The court agreed to hear the abortion providers' appeal in October. At the same time, the court also agreed to decide another issue pressed by Louisiana in a separate petition: whether abortion providers have legal standing to challenge health and safety regulations on behalf of their patients.
If the court accepts that argument, it could avoid deciding whether the Louisiana law is constitutional. But only Justice Alito asked questions suggesting that he was prepared to accept the argument.
However the court rules, other abortion cases are likely to follow. Several state legislatures have enacted laws that seem calculated to try to force the Supreme Court to consider overruling Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. Mr. Trump has vowed to appoint justices who will vote to overrule the decision.

Texto completo: "Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?" he said a day after Joe Biden beat him in several key states. "The answer is no."
BURLINGTON, Vt. -- After losing most Super Tuesday states to Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Bernie Sanders delivered a striking assessment of his campaign, acknowledging that he was "disappointed" with the results and that his crucial campaign message of inspiring young people to vote was falling short.
"Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?" he told reporters during a hastily assembled news conference at his campaign office in Burlington, Vt. "The answer is no."
The concession underscored a fundamental challenge for Mr. Sanders's political revolution, one that has become increasingly clear: In state after state, there has been little evidence -- at least outside California -- that he has generated higher turnout among young voters. And though he has promised to deliver record turnout, it may in fact be Mr. Biden who is accomplishing that, lifted by his strong support among black voters.
In Texas, where Mr. Biden prevailed over Mr. Sanders, only 15 percent of voters were younger than 30, and nearly two-thirds were 45 or older, according to exit polls. The age breakdown was similar in California.
In no state did people younger than 30 account for more than 20 percent of the electorate, based on exit polls, and in most states they accounted for 15 percent or less.
Because so few young people voted, it did not matter that Mr. Sanders won them by huge margins, because Mr. Biden won the much more plentiful older voters.
In addition, while Mr. Sanders has succeeded in galvanizing Latino voters -- he won them by about 27 percentage points over Mr. Biden in California -- he has struggled to build support among black voters.
In Alabama, where black voters were half of the electorate, Mr. Sanders lost them by more than 60 points. He lost them by more than 50 points in Virginia, and by more than 40 points in Texas and North Carolina. In several states, he came in third among black voters, behind not only Mr. Biden but also Michael R. Bloomberg.
In Minnesota, Mr. Sanders had a large gender gap. He had the support of 37 percent of men, according to exit polls, very close to Mr. Biden's 39 percent. But he only won 25 percent of women, compared with 41 percent for Mr. Biden. Mr. Sanders did do unusually well among black voters, who were a point of struggle for him in other states: He won 43 percent of them. But he only won 27 percent of white voters, who account for most of the Minnesota electorate.
Unlike in the first nominating contests, when these failures did not stop Mr. Sanders from winning, his inability to expand the electorate was crucial to his losses on Super Tuesday, when Mr. Biden beat him in 10 of 14 states, including Texas, Virginia and North Carolina.
After Mr. Sanders's dominant performance in Nevada less than two weeks ago, his aides and advisers had operated with new swagger, cautiously optimistic about his chances even in Southern states like South Carolina that they had expected to lose. He competed especially heavily in Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Minnesota, holding big rallies that doubled as shows of force.
But as the clock ticked toward midnight on Tuesday and his losses began to pile up, the campaign's buoyant tone shifted sharply. When Mr. Sanders took the stage at an election-night rally in Essex Junction, Vt., he was defiant, declaring that he would "win the Democratic nomination" despite a series of weaker-than-expected results. Aides and advisers insisted it was still early, and urged reporters not to jump to conclusions.
"If you turn off your television at 10 p.m. tonight, you will wake up tomorrow to a different race," Mike Casca, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said at one point.
But by Wednesday morning, that optimism was gone.
"Of course I'm disappointed," Mr. Sanders said at the news conference in Burlington. "I would like to win every state by a landslide. It's not going to happen."
He blamed his underperformance in part on the "venom" of the "corporate media."
As he has begun to do in recent days, he also framed the race as one between him and Mr. Biden, and drew explicit contrasts between his record and the former vice president's.
"Joe and I have a very different voting record," he said. "Joe and I have a very different vision for the future of this country. And Joe and I are running very different campaigns."
"My hope is that in the coming months, we will be able to debate and discuss the very significant differences that we have," he added.
Appearing on "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC on Wednesday night, Mr. Sanders sharply criticized Mr. Biden's record on the Iraq war, bankruptcy and Social Security.
Mr. Sanders also said that Michigan, which holds its primary on Tuesday, had been "decimated" by trade deals that Mr. Biden supported.
"I walked the picket lines against NAFTA," Mr. Sanders said. "I went to Mexico to see what NAFTA would do. Joe voted for those terrible agreements."
Some supporters of Mr. Sanders -- including prominent surrogates like Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota -- have argued that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, by staying in the race while several moderates dropped out, was partly responsible for Mr. Sanders's disappointing performance.
But while backers of Mr. Sanders believe many of Ms. Warren's supporters would have migrated to him, exit polls suggested that the shift would have been too small to change the outcome in key states.
Take college-educated white women: Ms. Warren's strongest group and one of Mr. Sanders's weakest. If Ms. Warren had dropped out, Mr. Sanders could have benefited twice as much as Mr. Biden among those voters, said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. But Maine would probably have been the only state to flip from Mr. Biden to Mr. Sanders as a result.
Mr. Biden would most likely still have won Texas, Minnesota and Massachusetts -- just with somewhat smaller margins, according to Mr. Murray. Warren voters generally like Mr. Sanders, he said; "it's just her support isn't large enough that it would have split enough in his direction."
In fact, based on exit polls, Mr. Bloomberg almost certainly siphoned more votes from Mr. Biden than Ms. Warren did from Mr. Sanders.
Despite Mr. Sanders's wins or near-wins in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the results in those contests had already challenged his pledge to fundamentally transform the electorate and expand the Democratic base.
Turnout in Iowa was lower than expected, up 3 percent from 2016, and the increase was concentrated in well-educated areas where Mr. Sanders struggled, according to a New York Times analysis; in the precincts where he won, turnout increased by only 1 percentage point.
There was no sign of a Sanders voter surge in New Hampshire either, or in Nevada, where turnout fell well short of 2008 levels despite a decade of population growth and a new early-voting option that attracted some 75,000 voters.
There was also no clear evidence across the early states of much greater participation by young people, a typically low-turnout group that Mr. Sanders has long said he can motivate to get out to the polls. First-time Democratic voters' share of the electorate actually decreased in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada compared with 2016.

Texto completo: Craig Rothfeld has been advising Mr. Weinstein and his lawyers as the producer prepares for living behind bars.
During his monthlong trial, the film producer Harvey Weinstein was surrounded by an expansive, and expensive, entourage of advisers and assistants.
He had four lawyers, a jury selection expert, a crisis manager and a spokesman. There was even an employee who made sure his court-ordered ankle monitor was functioning correctly.
But about three weeks ago, well before a jury found Mr. Weinstein guilty of two felony sex crimes, another paid professional was brought into his camp: a "prison consultant" named Craig Rothfeld.
Mr. Rothfeld's private firm, Inside Outside Ltd., was created to help new inmates understand the details of what he calls "the journey"-- the confusing and often frightening passage from living an ordinary life to living behind bars.
Minutes after Mr. Weinstein was convicted, the judge in his case, Justice James M. Burke, revoked his bail and ordered him to be sent at once to jail.
But despite the ruling, Mr. Weinstein has so far been housed in a prison ward at the Bellevue Hospital Center, where he has been receiving treatment for chest pains, diabetes and high blood pressure, his spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, said.
In the last few weeks, Mr. Rothfeld has worked with Mr. Weinstein's lawyers to make sure that city jail officials give the producer medical attention while he is being detained before his sentencing, now set for March 11.
Over the weekend, photographs emerged online of Mr. Weinstein sitting in what seemed to be a common room at Bellevue, watching television in an armchair with a wheelchair parked beside him. The images prompted questions about whether the wealthy and well-connected mogul was getting special treatment.
"Different pokes for different folks," the writer Denis Hamill said on Twitter.
City correction officials have repeatedly declined to discuss why Mr. Weinstein is being held at the hospital rather than in a cell at Rikers Island.
"Any suggestion that Mr. Weinstein is receiving special treatment is false," said Peter Thorne, a spokesman for the Department of Correction. "He has access to the same services as anyone else at his location, no more, no less."
Mr. Rothfeld agreed with the department.
"Everyone thinks he has a sweetheart deal, but he doesn't," he said of Mr. Weinstein. "He's in the hospital, but he's still in a prison cell -- a regular cell, with a toilet open for the world to see."
Mr. Rothfeld said that quite a bit of work went into getting Mr. Weinstein sent to Bellevue. To persuade Justice Burke to recommend the hospital, he and Mr. Weinstein's lawyers submitted copies of his medical prescriptions and a notarized letter from a doctor certifying his physical disability.
It helped Mr. Weinstein's argument, he said, that over the summer the celebrity investor Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in the Manhattan federal jail cell where he was awaiting prosecution on sex-trafficking charges. Because of Mr. Epstein's death, there were now "major security issues surrounding high-profile people," Mr. Rothfeld said.
It is likely that Mr. Epstein's suicide is being taken into account by jail officials in their decision to keep Mr. Weinstein at Bellevue rather than transferring him to Rikers, according to one former jail official and one city official, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal Department of Correction practices.
The city official said that keeping Mr. Weinstein at Bellevue was "extremely unusual." Rikers inmates are normally not housed at the hospital for an extended period unless they have serious medical problems.
"They don't know what to do with him, understandably," the city official said. "Post-Epstein, I'm sure there is more concern."
Mr. Weinstein could spend as many as 29 years in prison, and after he is sentenced he will no doubt face conditions far less pleasant than those he has at Bellevue.
Mr. Rothfeld said he has met with Mr. Weinstein one on one to prepare him for the fast-approaching moment when he will be sent to prison. Their conversations, he said, have focused on getting the producer ready for having his head shaved and wearing handcuffs.
"When you go away, you're largely entering the Bermuda Triangle," Mr. Rothfeld said in an interview this week. "There's little information available, and at the lowest point in someone's life they usually have no idea of what's in front of them."
Like all city inmates convicted of violent felonies, Mr. Weinstein will first be sent to a reception area at the Downstate Correctional Facility -- about 75 miles north of the city, in Fishkill -- to await his assignment to an upstate prison, where he will start to serve his term.
Mr. Rothfeld said he was working with Mr. Weinstein's lawyers on a sentencing memo designed to persuade Justice Burke to recommend sending the producer to a prison with a medical or protective-custody unit, so that he can be housed apart from the general population. Mr. Weinstein also wants to be sent to a prison that is close to New York City or to one with a significant Jewish population, Mr. Rothfeld said.
Mr. Rothfeld, 49, founded Inside Outside in 2017, after he served two years in prison. In 2015, he pleaded guilty in Manhattan to charges of defrauding investors in a securities company he owned out of $ 11 million.
"As ashamed and remorseful as I am for what I did," he said, "I'm just as proud for taking responsibility and making something out of it."
Prison consulting is a relatively rare line of work whose practitioners generally cater to the wealthy. Companies including the Justice Advocacy Group in Virginia and Jail Time Consulting in Florida help new inmates to navigate the federal and, on occasion, the state penal systems.
Mr. Rothfeld declined to discuss his rates in detail, but said the cost of hiring him was more than what the average accountant charges to prepare a yearly tax return, but less than the retainer a white-shoe lawyer charges. He said that on occasion he has waived his fees for people who cannot afford them.
In the past two years, he said, he has had about 20 clients, though none has been as famous as Mr. Weinstein is. As part of his contract, Mr. Rothfeld said, he has counseled not only the producer, but members of his family, too, advising them on how to visit Mr. Weinstein once he enters prison, how to send him packages and how to contact him by phone.
"You're a therapist, a rabbi, a priest, a marriage counselor and a big brother," he said. "All the questions people have, if you can answer them correctly. It sheds a little light on the ultimate mystery: the prison system."

Texto completo: Deadly assaults against Afghan forces have increased since the U.S. and Taliban signed a deal to end their war. Afghans worry about the ambiguity of the Taliban's promises.
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Taliban have resumed attacks against Afghan forces soon after signing a deal to end their war with the U.S. military, raising concerns that the Americans are leaving their Afghan allies vulnerable to an insurgency unwilling to let go of violence as its main leverage.
The Taliban have carried out at least 76 attacks across 24 Afghan provinces since Saturday, when they finalized an agreement for a troop withdrawal by the United States, a spokesman for Afghanistan's national security council said. And on Wednesday, the United States conducted its first airstrike against the insurgents after an 11-day lull.
A senior Afghan security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Afghan forces had still not resumed their offensive special operations, but were remaining on active defense -- only targeting Taliban units that were advancing on their outposts.
The deadliest of the dozens of assaults so far were on the outskirts of Kunduz in the north in the early hours of Wednesday. The Taliban's elite Red Unit stormed Afghan Army outposts there from several directions, killing at least 15 Afghan soldiers, according to Lt. Col. Mashuq Kohistani, the commander of the Afghan Army battalion in the area.
"We were newly establishing the base, and our soldiers did not have proper trenches to protect themselves," Colonel Kohistani said. "The Taliban killed 15 soldiers, one was wounded, and just two soldiers could escape alive."
Colonel Kohistani said he had arrived at the scene to pick up the bodies in the morning, and had found that many of the soldiers had been shot in the head, most likely by sniper fire.
The Kunduz attack came just hours after President Trump spoke on the phone with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban's deputy leader, who negotiated and signed the agreement with the Americans.
"We've agreed there's no violence. We don't want violence," Mr. Trump said after the call. "We'll see what happens."
Afghan officials have long been concerned that, without some sort of binding cease-fire, the United States' eagerness to leave Afghanistan might make them vulnerable in future talks with the Taliban.
The wording of the U.S. deal leaves that topic to planned-for direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, with few assurances that the insurgency will negotiate in good faith.
"The fact that the Taliban now have an agreement with the United States, there is no reason left for the Taliban to continue their violence -- their own self-proclaimed so-called legitimacy is also gone," Hamdullah Mohib, Afghanistan's national security adviser, said in an interview with PBS.
As a confidence-building measure, the United States conditioned the finalizing of the deal on a week of reduced violence in the days leading up to the signing. The violence levels dropped to the lowest in years. American officials gave the impression that such a reduction would continue after the signing.
But the insurgents said this week that with the seven-day period over, their operations would continue against Afghan forces.
With so much ambiguity, only the United States seems to know what level of violence it agreed to as acceptable before direct talks can begin between the Afghan government and the Taliban. A joint U.S.-Taliban monitoring cell has been set up in Doha, Qatar, to assess progress on their commitments.
"The United States has been very clear about our expectations -- the violence must remain low," Gen. Austin S. Miller, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said in a Twitter message posted by his spokesman.
General Miller provided no details on what "low" means. However, on a visit with Afghan forces on Tuesday, he reiterated that the United States would continue to send air support when Afghan forces under attack need it. "We will continue to defend the Afghan security forces," he said, as quoted by the Afghan channel ToloNews.
That became apparent on Wednesday, when the U.S. military said it had carried out its first airstrike against the Taliban in 11 days, after the insurgents attacked Afghan forces in the Nahr-e-Saraj District of Helmand Province. The military said the Taliban had carried out 43 attacks in the province the day before.
"Taliban leadership promised the international community they would reduce violence and not increase attacks," Col. Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for the U.S. military command in Afghanistan, said in a statement. "We call on the Taliban to stop needless attacks and uphold their commitments. As we have demonstrated, we will defend our partners when required."
A tally by The New York Times of attacks across the country showed that at least 66 people, including seven civilians, had been killed since Saturday. In the same period, Afghan forces killed about 20 Taliban fighters a day in fending off their attacks, a senior Afghan official said. Those numbers could not be independently verified.
The four-day toll after the signing of the agreement is nearly double that of the entire week of the "reduction in violence" that preceded the period.
Nadir Naim, a member of the Afghan high peace council, said there was a fear of the "repeat of the Soviet withdrawal aftermath," when guerrilla forces continued to attack the Afghan government after Soviet soldiers began withdrawing, driving the country into a bloody anarchy.
"The unpredictability of Afghanistan's future is a cause of great concern right now," Mr. Naim said.

Texto completo: Fearful of the more progressive candidates, some finance executives had sidelined themselves from the elections until Mr. Biden surged.
After weeks of worrying that Senator Bernie Sanders would trounce his rivals on Super Tuesday and set the tone for a rancorous Democratic nomination, Michael Novogratz, the longtime trader and merchant banker, was newly motivated on Wednesday morning.
Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a moderate candidate with solid support on Wall Street, had notched an unexpectedly strong showing in the Super Tuesday primaries. Of course, Mr. Sanders could still win the nomination -- but for Mr. Novogratz and others on Wall Street, Mr. Biden's resurgence offered the opportunity to bankroll a Democrat they can get behind.
"There's a lot of momentum on Biden's side," Mr. Novogratz said. Already, one of his colleagues at Galaxy Digital, a cryptocurrency investment firm, was planning a Biden fund-raiser. Mr. Novogratz himself was set to host a dinner Wednesday night to raise money for voter-registration efforts in swing states. Stocks, hammered in recent days over fears of the coronavirus -- along with an undercurrent of worry about Mr. Sanders, according to some traders -- were rallying as he spoke on Wednesday morning. Between the easing of interest rates and the improving political picture, Mr. Novogratz said, "we're getting some bounce."
By the end of the day, the S&P 500 had risen more than 4 percent, bouncing back from a steep drop the day before, reflecting Wall Street's relief about Mr. Biden's success.
For moderates on Wall Street, this election season has been stressful. Accustomed to being courted by candidates seeking their financial support, bankers, investors, traders and executives from hedge funds and private equity firms have struggled to feel wanted in 2020. Mr. Sanders is an avowed democratic socialist who wants to tax billionaires -- of which there are plenty on Wall Street -- and has eschewed big donations. Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and a multibillionaire respected by many financiers, didn't want their money either. Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor and onetime McKinsey consultant whose common-sense centrism had intrigued others, had lost ground in recent weeks. And until this past weekend, Mr. Biden's path to the Democratic nomination appeared tenuous.
Against that backdrop, Tuesday night's results brought a surge of relief to many on Wall Street, who -- fearful of the anticapitalist sentiment espoused by Senator Sanders and wary of another four years of a polarizing President Trump -- had essentially sidelined themselves from political activism. Now, with Mr. Biden's victories presenting him as an effective political foil for Mr. Sanders, executives who had shrugged off the race are racing to support a candidate whom they believe can defend the social policies they are committed to without upending the economy.
Tracy V. Maitland, the president of Advent Capital Management and a supporter of Mr. Biden's, said he was fielding numerous calls and texts from elated friends on Wall Street and in the entertainment industry. "People think we've turned a corner," he said.
Even Leon Cooperman, the billionaire who had been supporting Mr. Bloomberg until he dropped out, expressed some relief. "I'm happy to see the country is not inclined towards electing a communist or a socialist," Mr. Cooperman said.
Their objections to Mr. Sanders, whose signature policy was a universal, government-sponsored health care plan called Medicare for All, were reactions to both his style and his substance. His harsh talk -- that aspects of the deceased Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's regime were admirable, and that billionaires shouldn't exist -- unsettled many. And his embrace of expensive, big-government social programs like health care and college-debt forgiveness, combined with new wealth taxes and a desire to more aggressively regulate lending and banking, felt to many Wall Streeters like an assault on their way of life.
"I don't like assassination by categorization," Lloyd C. Blankfein, the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said of Mr. Sanders in a recent interview with The Financial Times. Other finance executives, who felt similarly but were reluctant to go public with their own views for fear of alienating clients or employees, said they were relieved Mr. Blankfein spoke up.
Many Wall Street executives don't think Mr. Sanders's policies are sound. "Canceling all college debt will help relatively rich and high-earning university graduates, versus the money coming out of the pocket of everyone else, including those who never went to university and therefore earn less," Jennifer Fan, a former hedge fund manager who now invests her own money, said of Mr. Sanders's policies. "The ideas are just not good, the consequences aren't well thought out."
By contrast, Mr. Trump's economic policies, which have rolled back regulations, slashed taxes and focused on job creation, have favored corporations and coincided with a booming economy. Yet many Wall Street moderates are loath to support him, too. The president's tough immigration stance has rattled bankers and traders, many of whom travel widely and depend greatly on foreign-born employees to bolster their ranks. His apathy toward climate change, whose effects are increasingly driving investing and spending decisions, has concerned many. And even in an industry once known for its boorish behavior and treatment of women, Mr. Trump's meanspirited rants toward the Federal Reserve chair, the late Senator John McCain, and scores of other prominent public figures have landed badly.
Still, Wall Street's embrace of Mr. Biden could have downsides for the candidate. Hillary Clinton took in millions of dollars in campaign contributions from bankers and hedge fund managers. But during the 2016 election cycle, her private speeches to Goldman Sachs, including a remark that blaming the global banking system for the financial crisis was an "oversimplification," drew scathing attacks from both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, who argued separately that she was too beholden to Wall Street. Mitt Romney, who spent decades as a private-equity executive at Bain Capital before running for president in 2012, was attacked for the debt and layoffs his firm imposed on its investment companies during his tenure there.
Mr. Biden had already received Wall Street support early in the primary season. Both Jonathan Gray, the president of Blackstone, and Marc Lasry, the investor and big Democratic donor, co-hosted fund-raisers for Mr. Biden in Manhattan on Feb. 13. And Mr. Biden has taken in donations from the hedge fund manager Seth Klarman, Mr. Maitland and Stephen Scherr, the chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs.
Yet, on the campaign stump, Mr. Biden has invoked some of the same anti-elitist rhetoric that Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren have used to rile up Democratic voters. Speaking to a crowd in Los Angeles late Tuesday evening, as key Super Tuesday victories rolled in, Mr. Biden said, "Wall Street didn't build this country, you built this country." In his campaign literature, he has bemoaned the financial industry's putting profits over workers and the widening wealth gap in America.
The policy implications of a Biden administration for financial executives are not entirely clear. Mr. Biden has said he will shore up the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health-insurance reform act he helped enact during the Obama administration, which would presumably preserve the private-insurance system while enhancing government-subsidized coverage. He says he will reverse the Trump tax breaks and raise taxes on investment gains. Like Mr. Sanders, he has advocated for a $ 15 minimum wage. But he lacks the sort of detailed policy papers that Ms. Warren, a perennial critic of Wall Street, has generated, and his message is more focused on hope and solidarity than it is on attacking the current economic infrastructure.
Given all that, Mr. Cooperman said he would wait to hear more from Mr. Biden before committing to support him. "I'd like to see, hear more about what he's got to say," he said. But after watching the candidate surge past Mr. Sanders on Tuesday, he added, "hopefully the left wing of the Democratic Party understands they'll get murdered if they go with a left-wing candidate."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - With eight months until Election Day, President Donald Trump is having a bad week.
Despite Trump's concerted efforts to paint Joe Biden as corrupt - an attempt that led directly to his own impeachment - the former vice president pulled off one of the most remarkable political comebacks in recent history Tuesday, reemerging as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and Trump's opponent in November.
The stock markets tumbled again Tuesday amid fears about the ongoing spread of the coronavirus around the world, and by midmorning Wednesday, yet another case of the virus was confirmed in New York.
But futures markets bounced up Wednesday with the news of Biden's victories, after he won states across the South and Midwest by large margins and dealt a serious blow to the prospects of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
For Trump, whose belief in his own ability to shape external events is a source of comfort, it means now confronting a moment when almost nothing is in his control.
He has dealt with the coronavirus, the first external crisis of his administration, by repeating a string of falsehoods rather than delivering reassurance. And his insistence that his administration deserves an "A+++" for its response has done little to calm the rattled markets or an anxious electorate.
Biden even won the primary in Texas, a state that several Trump advisers saw as a bellwether given the makeup of its electorate.
Trump's aides said they are now preparing for a scorched-earth campaign against Biden in the coming months, even as voters Tuesday appeared to favor a candidate who projected calm stability over upheaval and uncertainty.
A sign of Trump's frustration was evident in one of his morning tweets Wednesday - a screed against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was forced into a runoff Tuesday night for his old Senate seat in Alabama, and whom Trump still blames for the two-year probe into possible conspiracy between the president's 2016 campaign and Russian officials.
"This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn't have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!" Trump posted on Twitter, after Sessions fell short of securing a majority in the Republican primary in the Senate race.
For months, Trump has told aides he believes he can shape the Democratic race to his own advantage by focusing on specific candidates. And he has been more overt than any incumbent in trying to influence the nominating contest of another party, training his Twitter feed on his potential rivals and trying to deepen authentic divisions in the Democratic Party by stoking fears that the establishment was trying to rob Sanders of the nomination.
He floated the idea in January that the Senate impeachment trial was designed to keep Sanders grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Iowa ahead of the caucuses there.
That month, Trump aides also began to see Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and sought to elevate his profile.
Another target was Michael Bloomberg, a longtime rival from New York who had no compunction contrasting his wealth with Trump's.
Bloomberg's withdrawal from the race Wednesday may provide Trump with a small measure of comfort. But it also presents a challenge for his campaign, as Bloomberg has promised to spend $1 billion to help the Democratic nominee and threw his support to Biden.
But Bloomberg was not the main concern of Trump and his advisers. For months, they fanned the flames about Biden's younger son, Hunter, and his work for Burisma, an energy company in Ukraine. That effort was central to the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump tried to pressure Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens in exchange for releasing military aid.
The damage to Trump was obvious, but the former vice president's candidacy also suffered in the process.
But the revival of Biden - who was buoyed by black voters, a core Democratic Party constituency, in several states - illustrates the limits of Trump's influence.
"I think Democratic primary voters are numbing to Trump's buffoonery - black voters in particular," said Addisu Demissie, who managed Sen. Cory Booker's presidential campaign. "They are the ones who have breathed life back into Biden's campaign and, if anything, they may relish seeing Biden take him down."

Texto completo: Early in the afternoon of March 1, 1954, four Puerto Rican nationalists smuggled pistols inside the U.S. Capitol, entered the visitors' gallery at the House of Representatives and opened fire on the floor below, where more than 240 members of Congress were voting on an immigration bill.
As the attackers shouted slogans supporting Puerto Rican independence, attempted to unfurl a Puerto Rican flag and fired at random, some representatives believed that firecrackers had been set off. Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr. (R-Mass.) declared the House in recess, apparently trying to maintain decorum, and took cover behind a marble pillar on the rostrum.
In the frantic minutes before the assailants were overpowered, they wounded five congressmen, all of whom survived. So, too, did the gunmen, the last of whom - Rafael Cancel Miranda - died March 2 at 89. Alternately labeled a terrorist and freedom fighter, he had devoted his life to the cause of Puerto Rican independence and spent a quarter-century behind bars before President Jimmy Carter commuted his sentence.
His death at home in San Juan, the U.S. territory's capital, was reported by the newspaper El Nuevo Día and confirmed in a Facebook post by his son Rafael Cancel Vázquez, who did not cite a cause.
While Mr. Cancel Miranda faded from memory in Washington, where the Capitol is now heavily fortified with metal detectors and police officers, he acquired a near-mythical status in Puerto Rico. Appearing in his trademark white guayabera summer shirt, he became a fixture of political rallies, wrote books and refused to apologize for a mass shooting that Martin once called "the wildest scene in the entire history of Congress."
In interviews, Mr. Cancel Miranda and his gun-wielding associates - Lolita Lebrón, Andrés Figueroa Cordero and Irvin Flores Rodríguez - said that they were fighting to free Puerto Ricans from the yoke of American colonialism. The island came under U.S. control after the Spanish-American War and became a commonwealth in 1952, although to Mr. Cancel Miranda and many others it never achieved true self-determination.
"We never controlled our own country," he told the New York Times in 2016, as the independence movement sought to reassert itself in Puerto Rico. Earlier that year, Congress created a financial oversight panel to manage the island's crippling debt, drawing accusations that "a dictatorship" was deciding its fate and leading Gov. Alejandro J. García Padilla to appear before a United Nations committee, where he effectively declared that Puerto Rico was still a U.S. colony.
Mr. Cancel Miranda, who stood more than 6 feet tall but was known by the diminutive nickname Pito, was immersed in the independence movement from a young age. The son of a businessman and fiery Nationalist Party leader, he spent two years in a Florida prison after refusing to join the Army and was said to have listened to radio reports from behind bars as anti-colonial revolts rocked Puerto Rico in 1950. Later that year, followers of Harvard-educated nationalist Pedro Albizu Campos tried to assassinate President Harry S. Truman.
Commonwealth status for the island soon followed, and in 1953 the United Nations removed Puerto Rico from its list of "non-self-governing territories."
"That's when the nationalists said, 'We have to send a message,' " Mr. Cancel Miranda told the Times. "That was the reason for the attack on Congress."
The shooting was reportedly orchestrated by Lebrón, who later said that she and her fellow attackers "went to die, not to kill." A note found in her purse called her group's actions "a cry for victory in our struggle for independence." Mr. Cancel Miranda, who was by then living in Brooklyn, said that he had made his peace with death, and assumed he would never see his children again after buying a one-way train ticket to Washington.
After lunching at Union Station, he and his fellow assailants got lost, asked a pedestrian for directions and eventually made their way to the Capitol. A security guard asked if they were carrying cameras before allowing them into the House gallery, where they were seated near a group of sixth-grade students and soon began firing Lugers and an automatic pistol as Lebrón yelled, "Viva Puerto Rico Libre!"
Roughly 16 shots were fired, according to a congressional history, before the attackers were subdued by a group including Rep. James E. Van Zandt (R-Pa.), then handcuffed and dragged before reporters on the Capitol steps.
"A few gangsters can't break up the friendship of great nations," Martin said the next day, as Puerto Rico's governor repudiated the attack and politicians urged unity.
All five injured congressmen returned to the House, and the assailants received sentences that threatened to keep them behind bars until their deaths. Mr. Cancel Miranda, who said that most of the wounded "got hurt by my gun," was sent to Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay and later to prisons in Kansas and Illinois.
His sentence was commuted in 1979, along with those of Lebrón, Flores and Oscar Collazo, who had tried to assassinate Truman. (Figueroa Cordero had been released two years earlier after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.)
Newspaper accounts suggested their release was part of a prisoner swap for CIA agents jailed in Cuba - the Carter administration cited "humane considerations" - and the former prisoners embarked on a tour through the United States, appearing before crowds in Chicago and New York.
While the popularity of the nationalist movement diminished during his prison term, Mr. Cancel Miranda insisted that he would continue to back violent actions in support of independence if necessary.
"I'll work for the revolution until I die," he told The Washington Post after his release, "and if I'm lucky I may find a little time to sing to the children."
Mr. Cancel Miranda was born in Mayagüez, on Puerto Rico's western coast, on July 18, 1930. His mother died when he was a child, and his father ran a furniture store while periodically hosting Albizu Campos at the family home. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.
On Facebook, Mr. Cancel Miranda's son Rafael recalled once asking his father how he managed to get on the train to Washington, despite knowing he would probably be killed.
"The love, the love I feel for you, for your mom, for all Puerto Ricans," Mr. Cancel Miranda replied. "Courage is born of love and I love my people. I am Puerto Rican and for you I give my life. I prefer to hug and recite verses, but if the moment requires bullets, I would do it again."

Texto completo: President seeks stay after defamation suit by writer who claims he raped her
NEW YORK - President Trump wants the benefit of asserting constitutional immunity when he is sued personally even as he files lawsuits against others, undermining his defense in the defamation case brought by a journalist who accused him of raping her years ago, the woman's attorneys argued in court Wednesday.
Trump's personal attorneys asked the judge overseeing E. Jean Carroll's civil case to delay the proceedings, noting that a state appellate court here in Manhattan imposed a stay in another defamation lawsuit brought by former "Apprentice" contestant Summer Zervos, who in 2016 accused Trump of sexually assaulting her several years before.
Trump has denied both women's allegations.
The stay in Zervos's case halts those proceedings until the state's highest court can rule on the presidential immunity question Trump has raised, under the theory that a sitting president cannot face civil or criminal charges in state courts.
Carroll's legal team has called attention to a lawsuit Trump's campaign brought against the New York Times, claiming libel in an opinion piece about the president's dealings with Russia. The suit was filed Feb. 26, the day before Trump attorneys first asked the court in writing to postpone Carroll's case. Trump's campaign has since sued The Washington Post over two opinion articles discussing Russia's election interference.
Carroll attorney Roberta Kaplan told Justice Verna Saunders that Trump cannot have it both ways - arguing immunity when he is defending a case and then suing his critics in the media who aim to hold him accountable.
"That kind of cherry-picking, your honor, is an intolerable abuse of the process," Kaplan said. ". . . It belies any contention, any reasonable explanation, that there could be some sort of undue burden on Donald Trump by having to defend this action."
Carroll's account of being raped more than two decades ago was published in her 2019 book, "What Do We Need Men For?: A Modest Proposal." In the memoir, she alleges Trump assaulted her in the dressing room of a Bergdorf Goodman department store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.
Carroll sued Trump in October, accusing him of defamation after Trump called her a liar. The lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court, says that "Trump lashed out with a series of false and defamatory statements" and that he "denied the rape."
"But there was more: He also denied ever having met Carroll or even knowing who she was," Carroll's civil complaint says. Carroll's legal team says she was harmed personally and professionally by the president's public statements.
Trump attorney Christine Montenegro argued that the president would "suffer irreparable harm" should the Carroll case go forward "without the benefit of meaningful appellate review."
She also argued that it was Trump's political campaign - not Trump himself - that has sued the media.
Kaplan said it was "obviously absurd" that Trump did not know his campaign was going to begin a legal battle with the New York Times.
Kaplan proposed a compromise to pausing the case, offering to hold off on seeking a DNA sample from Trump or from taking his deposition while the document-sharing process known as discovery gets underway. Most of the documents would be coming from Carroll's side, she said.
Carroll hopes to search for DNA on the dress she said she was wearing when she was attacked. Her attorney said the garment is now in safekeeping for use if testing goes forward.
Saunders did not rule on the petition by Trump's team and did not say when she expected to have a decision. Trump's attorney said the appeals court's decision in the Zervos case could come within months, while Kaplan countered that the panel may not even hear arguments until later this year.
"I'm filing this lawsuit not just for myself but for every woman in America who has been grabbed, groped, harassed, sexually assaulted and has spoken up and still has been disgraced, shamed or fired, which happened in my case," Carroll told reporters after the proceeding.
Carroll has said previously that Elle magazine dropped her as a columnist after Trump challenged her allegations.

Texto completo: Bobbie Battista, who was among the original anchors for CNN Headline News and hosted CNN's "TalkBack Live," a viewer participation program, died March 3 in Davenport, Iowa. She was 67.
The cause was cervical cancer, family spokeswoman Wendy Guarisco told CNN.
During her 1981-2001 career with the cable news company, Ms. Battista anchored coverage of major events including the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan, the Challenger space shuttle explosion and the Persian Gulf War.
When she moved from CNN Headline News to CNN in 1988, she anchored shows that included "CNN NewsHour."
After leaving the network, she started a public relations company and had hosting duties on Georgia Public Broadcasting and the satirical Onion News Network.
"It occurred to me that some would say, 'Oh, how the mighty have fallen,' " she told the New York Times regarding work for the Onion. "I thought about that, but I said, 'Hey, why not?' . . . You watch the news today, and you don't know what is real. When I was doing newscasts at CNN, people would come up to me and say, 'That story can't be real.' Now the lines are really getting blurred."
Referring to a segment about "lingerie football" on an actual news show, she asked herself: "My mouth was hanging open. How does this belong on the news?"
Barbara Ann Nusser was born July 23, 1952, and grew up in New Jersey. She graduated in 1974 from Northwestern University with a degree in radio, television and film production, and worked as a newscaster and disc jockey for a country radio station in Fuquay-Varina, N.C.
She joined the Raleigh station WRAL-TV as a secretary but was soon elevated to producer of a children's show and co-host of a morning show. She eventually spent several years as the first female evening news co-anchor (alongside Charlie Gaddy) in the market.
In 1981, she was the writer and assistant producer for the Peabody Award-winning documentary "Fed Up With Fear."
Her first marriage, to James Battista, ended in divorce. Survivors include her husband, John Brimelow; a stepdaughter; a brother; and a sister.

Texto completo: Betsy Byars, the author of "The Summer of the Swans" and other prizewinning works of children's literature drawn from the real world, with heroes and heroines who survive their lonely, sometimes broken existence by caring for one another, died Feb. 26 at her home in Seneca, S.C. She was 91.
She had complications from a fall, said her daughter Nan Byars.
Mrs. Byars wrote more than 60 books for those in-between children too young to be called big and too old to be called small. In her selection of subject matter, she abided by the old writer's dictum to write what one knows, which meant no wizards or vampires but also no shortage of fear or triumph.
"I take some kids and throw them into a crisis and solve the crisis," Mrs. Byars once told the Mini Page, a syndicated newspaper supplement for children, although she might have said with equal honesty that the children solve the crises themselves.
Among her best-known works was "The Summer of the Swans" (1970), which received the Newbery Medal for excellence in children's literature. The novel centers on 14-year-old Sara, who reports that "the peak of my whole life so far was in third grade when I got to be milk monitor."
Since their mother's death, she and her two siblings - a beautiful older sister and a younger brother who is intellectually disabled - have lived with an aunt in West Virginia. Captivated by the swans at a nearby lake, Sara's brother, Charlie, leaves the house one night and becomes lost in the woods. In her ultimate act of devotion, Sara finds Charlie, proving her mettle not only to the reader but also to herself.
"Betsy Byars has a gift for exposing the soul of the lost child - the damaged, the alienated, the unloved," children's author Marilyn Kaye wrote in a New York Times review of another book by Mrs. Byars, "The Glory Girl" (1983).
Like many of Mrs. Byars's books, "The Summer of the Swans" was based at least in part on real life. As a volunteer tutor, Mrs. Byars had formed meaningful relationships with children with intellectual disabilities. Charlie was "not one of the children," she said in her Newbery acceptance speech, but "the book would never have been written if I had not come to know the children I was tutoring."
Mrs. Byars said that after "The Summer of the Swans" received the Newbery, she had to install a larger mailbox to accommodate all the letters from young readers and other inquiries she received. No work, she reported, elicited more mail than "The Pinballs" (1977), a novel about three children - Carlie, Thomas J and Harvey, called "pinballs" for what seems to be their destiny to bounce around - who are placed together in a foster home.
In "The Night Swimmers" (1980), a young girl, Retta, cares for her two brothers after their mother dies and their father takes to the road as a country singer. The children seek fun - but also court mortal danger - with clandestine nighttime swims in a wealthier neighbor's yard. Mrs. Byars said that the novel, which received a National Book Award, was inspired by a friend who worried about the neighbor children who let themselves into her pool when she was away.
Mrs. Byars received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for her novel "Wanted . . . Mud Blossom" (1991), one of several books about the Blossom children, whose mother travels the rodeo circuit where their father was killed by a steer. Mud is the family dog, and his misadventures were inspired in part by those of Mrs. Byars's childhood dog Mac, who was "wanted" for the murder of a chicken.
She said the book she most cherished was "The Midnight Fox" (1968), about a boy, Tommy, and the love he develops for a black fox while spending a lonely summer on his aunt and uncle's farm. It was her first book that included elements of her life, Mrs. Byars said, and the first that "turned out the way I had hoped it would."
"I sometimes think my books are like scrapbooks of my life," she wrote on her website, "because almost every incident brings back a memory.
Betsy Alice Cromer was born in Charlotte on Aug. 7, 1928. Her father was a textile executive, and her mother was a homemaker.
She said she did not aspire to be a writer when she was growing up. "I had never even seen one," she wrote in a memoir, "The Moon and I" (1991), "but their photographs looked funny, as if they'd been taken to a taxidermist and stuffed."
"This corpselike look, I figured, came from sitting alone all day in a room typing, which couldn't be good for you," she continued. "I was glad there were people willing to do this. I loved books and didn't want them to become extinct. But I cared too much about myself and my future to consider becoming one."
She set out to follow her older sister as a math major in college but, deterred by a calculus class, instead received a bachelor's degree in English from what is now Queens University of Charlotte in 1950.
The same year, she married Edward Ford Byars. In addition to her husband, of Seneca, survivors include four children, Laurie Myers of Augusta, Ga., and Betsy Duffey of Atlanta, who write together as the Writing Sisters; Nan Byars of Charlotte; and Guy Ford Byars of Cincinnati; nine grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.
Mrs. Byars's earliest published writings were short articles for women's magazines and publications including the Saturday Evening Post. She began writing children's literature as her own children grew up, and she endured repeated setbacks before her first book, "Clementine," was published in 1962, after being rejected by numerous publishers.
By that time, the Byars family had moved to Morgantown, W.Va., where Mrs. Byars's husband taught at West Virginia University. She enrolled in a course about children's literature, later describing it as "one of the turning points in my career."
"For the first time I saw the realistic children's novel," she observed in comments for the Something About the Author Autobiography Series. "There had not been any of those when I was growing up. . . . I had never even considered anything realistic."
Some of her most popular books were part of the Bingo Brown series. "If there is such a thing as a typical American kid, Bingo Brown is it," author Fannie Flagg wrote in a Times review. "He is funny and bright and lovable without being precocious," while also serving as a vehicle for "serious themes like puberty, unwanted pregnancy, changing roles for men and women in society, etc."
Mrs. Byars and her husband were licensed pilots, and they lived on what her website described as an airstrip. "The bottom floor of their house is a hangar so they can taxi out and take off, almost from their front yard," reads the description of their home. "The top floor of the house? Betsy's studio!"
Her book "Coast to Coast" (1992) was about a girl, Birch, who flies across the country with her grandfather in his Piper Cub plane. Mrs. Byars said that she and her husband took the same trip, in a plane just like the grandfather's, and that everything her characters experienced had happened to them.
"Every time I sit down to write a book, I feel like that character in the old fairy tale who, in order to survive, has to spin straw into gold," she once told a publication called the School Librarian. "What I know about spinning straw is nil, and I have learned from hard reality that no little man in a funny suit is going to pop out of the woodwork to strike a deal."
"We authors write the best we can, with what skills we have, what tricks we've learned," she went on to say, "and then if we are lucky, very lucky, the straw actually will be turned into gold, for a fleeting moment by the miraculous mind of a child."

Texto completo: The best pizza in America might very well hail from Western Pennsylvania -- but it just won't have an official world championship title this year.
The spreading coronavirus will keep Nick Bogacz, owner of Pittsburgh-based Caliente Pizza & Draft House, and Chef Eric von Hansen from traveling to the World Pizza Championships in Parma, Italy -- and defending Caliente's best pizza in America title. Their flights to Italy were canceled by the airline.
"I think everyone is trying to be safe is what it comes down to," Bogacz said. "We looked forward to this all year long. ... It's just unfortunate that we're not going to be able to go."
Bogacz and a team of 35 people on a World Pizza Championship team have attended the event since 2001, which draws 600 competitors from more than 30 countries. A team from Caliente started attending the event last year, when van Hansen brought home the top prize for best pizza in America.
According to Bogacz, event officials are considering postponing the event and moving it to another location in Italy. The nation has reported more than 2,500 coronavirus infections and 79 deaths as of Wednesday.
Official details were not available on the championship's website and social media pages.
According to The New York Times, Italy has seen the largest outbreak of the coronavirus outside of Asia. On Tuesday, the death toll increased by 27 in one day, with 90% of infections located in the northern Italian regions of Veneto, Lombardy and Emilia Romagna -- where Parma is located.
"It's been nerve-wracking for my family," Bogacz said. "There's a personal side at home. You don't want to come back and get people sick over having a good time."
The restaurant still has other opportunities to compete, though.
The International Pizza Expo in Las Vegas is expected to continue as planned from March 31 to April 2, said show director Bill Oakley. The event draws up to 14,000 people from 45 countries.
"We certainly are adhering to the CDC guidelines," Oakley said. "We will be bringing in additional handwashing stations. We will be providing masks as needed."
There have been no reported cases of the coronavirus in Nevada, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Four of the five states surrounding it, however, have reported cases: Utah (1), Arizona (2), California (45) and Oregon (2), according to a New York Times tracker.
Bogacz hopes to attend the Las Vegas event along with the upcoming Napoli Pizza Village Festival in Naples, Italy. Slated for May 29 through April 7, the event draws more than a million people and produces more than 100,000 baked pizzas.
The entire Caliente team plans to attend the Naples event, Bogacz said.
"We're hoping everything will be OK," he said. Naples is about 400 miles south of Parma.
As for the World Pizza Championships, Bogacz said officials are reimbursing competition fees and hotels are currently reimbursing bookings by 80%.
"It seems like it's really spreading," he said of the virus. "It sounds like it's complete chaos."

Texto completo: Favors ‘means test’
Editor: There is absolutely no good reason for politicians, mostly conservative Republicans, to scare senior citizens by threatening to cut Social Security retirement benefits. There is no so-called Social Security crisis.
Virtually every serious, nonbiased study has concluded that the Social Security trust fund is fully solvent through 2034. After that, it will be able to provide 76% to 79% of benefits for 60 years afterward.
Does it need to be fixed? Of course it does. But it does not have to be done today and there is no need to cut anyone’s benefits.
A relatively simple and easy reform was proposed in 2015 by then-Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie, who called for reduced benefits for some seniors. I sat in the same car as Democratic presidential candidate and then-Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt in 1987 when he said that we should “means test” Social Security benefits.
For example, Social Security could become fully solvent well beyond 2034 if the benefits of those who have a yearly income of, say, $80,000 a year and higher are reduced by a certain percentage. I recall Babbitt saying “Stew, do multimillionaires really need the same Social Security benefits as senior citizens who are living in poverty?”
I urge members of Congress to stop scaring senior citizens. Something that might happen in 14 years that could be easily preventable is not a crisis and they all know it. It is so unnecessary and cruel for our senior citizens to be scared like this.

End predatory billing
Editor: People often turn to hospitals in a time of need and no one should have to worry about financial hardship as a result of seeking needed care at a hospital.
Across the country, consumers are targeted by hospitals with lawsuits and other predatory actions when hospitals have the option to pursue more consumer-friendly options first. All this comes at a time when Americans increasingly are anxious about the costs of hospital care.
According to recent research by Ipsos-CQC, 91% of patients are concerned about receiving surprise bills from hospitals and 65% say it’s difficult to understand the cost of care at a hospital, including finding out how much a hospital charges for specific types of care.
Because hospitals and the groups that represent them largely have failed to adequately address these practices, Consumers for Quality Care, a patient advocacy organization, recently sent a letter to the members of the National Governors Association urging them to take action and protect their constituents.
As patients continue to struggle financially due to these toxic practices, Gov. Tom Wolf has an opportunity to stand up for the people of Pennsylvania by implementing reforms that cut consumer costs and increase transparency in the health care system.

What Russians?
Editor: In the immortal words of baseball great Yogi Berra, “It’s dèjá vú all over again.”
If you are tired of hearing about how the Russians helped Hillary Clinton lose to President Donald J. Trump, get ready for round two. All I hear on cable channels like CNN, MSNBC and others is how Russians will “influence” our election to ensure the chances of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who most Democrats know has no chance of wining the general election.
He is a socialist, so I don’t think so. Not that Democrats have anyone else who could beat Trump. So exactly how can the Russians guarantee a winner? Since most polling places are not interconnected to a nationwide network, maybe they could sneak an operative into every polling place and alter the voting machines. Or maybe they could flood the airways with zillions spent in pro-Sanders and pro-Trump ads nationwide.
But money doesn’t assure a win; think of Michael Bloomberg. I would appeal to anyone to explain how the Russians can influence our election to get the winners they want. This effort is so transparent.
When Trump wins the election there will be a neverending curiosity about how he stole the election again and should be impeached. Sound familiar?
MIKE PHILLIPS
HAMLIN
Traitorous leader
Editor: If there was ever any doubt, it is clear that President Donald Trump is a traitor, as well as a serial liar and a criminal.
Three cheers for Times-Tribune columnist Chris Kelly for standing up for local newspapers but they are not the antidote to our problems. Our democracy is threatened by Trump’s morally bankrupt administration because the majority of Americans - and U.S. senators - seem to be too lazy to read. Were they to read the report by former special counsel Robert Mueller, they would know that Trump is guilty of multiple counts of obstruction of justice and that the Russians actively are interfering again in our elections on Trump’s behalf Gee, I wonder why Russian President Vladimir Putin prefers Trump.
Now, Trump has fired his acting national intelligence director for telling him the truth - that Russians continue to work to re-elect him - and he appointed a compliant and unqualified stooge to the director’s post. There are reports that Russians, egged on by Trump, are working to try to help Bernie Sanders become the Democratic Party presidential nominee because they believe he will be easier to beat than other opponents.
This is pure treason, but too many Americans won’t know about it because they prefer to lap up propaganda on TV and radio talk shows rather than take the trouble to read newspapers like the Times-Tribune, The New York Times and The Washington Post.
Shame on them. Shame on spineless Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for abetting Trump’s multiple betrayals of his oath of office.

Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler
R-Battle Groun
U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, has co-sponsored a bill that could expedite the development of a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
It's one of several attempts by three federal lawmakers from Washington to beat back the outbreak of the infectious disease, which has gained its first domestic toehold in their home state.
The Cure the Coronavirus Act would authorize the Food and Drug Administration to award vouchers for an expedited review of drugs that prevent or treat COVID-19, a new disease that is part of the family of coronaviruses.
“If bureaucratic red tape gets in the way of viable treatments, we're unnecessarily putting lives at risk,” Herrera Beutler said in a media release. “We will be infinitely more effective in containing and preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus in this nation if we work in a cooperative, bipartisan fashion and focus on solutions.”
Similar vouchers are already available for drug companies working on treatments for infectious tropical diseases, including Zika virus and Ebola. The bill would expand that existing program to include COVID-19.
Herrera Beutler was among the four members of Congress to support the bill introduced to the House floor on Friday. Two other co-sponsors hail from New York, where a second coronavirus case was confirmed Tuesday morning. The fourth lawmaker on the bill is from California, where multiple cases had been confirmed across six counties as of late Tuesday afternoon.
Nine people in Washington have died of coronavirus, the only U.S. fatalities linked to the disease thus far. Worldwide COVID-19 has killed more than 3,000 people, with epicenters in China, Iran and Italy.
Patty Murray, the senior Democratic senator from Washington, delivered a scorching rebuke of the White House's response to the coronavirus outbreak in an address before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Tuesday morning.
“I'm hearing from people that are sick who want to get tested are not being told where to go. I'm hearing that even when people do get tested — and it's very few so far — the results are taking way longer to get back to them,” said Murray, who serves as the committee's ranking member.
As reported by The New York Times, the Trump administration delivered mixed signals Tuesday on how quickly coronavirus testing could ramp up. The head of the FDA said in a White House briefing that the country could have the capacity for a million tests by the end of the week, but the companies developing those tests say their products are still weeks away. Testing labs, too, told the Times through a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson that public health labs can currently process up to 15,000 tests per day, although that capacity is expected to increase.
“The administration has had months to prepare for this, and it's unacceptable that people in my state and nationwide can't even get an answer as to whether or not they are infected. To put it simply, if some at the White House or in this administration are actually in charge of responding to the coronavirus, it'd be news to anybody in my state,” Murray said.
Later that day, Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell announced she had sent letters to 10 airlines and 15 airports asking leaders to detail their plans for handling coronavirus.
Cantwell requested information on airport and aircraft cleaning policies, as well as pandemic response plans. She also asked about existing protocol for notifying passengers when communicable diseases are detected and flight cancellation policies under those circumstances.
“There has been limited public guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or other federal health and security agencies regarding steps U.S. airports or the traveling public should take to address COVID-19,” Cantwell wrote, adding that the detailed information from airlines and airports would help determine what federal resources might be needed going forward.
Cantwell sent the letters in preparation for a subcommittee hearing today focused on how the aviation industry can best mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. She is the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.

Texto completo: The United States was gifted the ominous, glowing orb that became part of a viral meme that came out of President Trump's first foreign trip to Saudi Arabia in early 2017.
Photos of Trump, Saudi King Salman, and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi touching the orb, which Saudi media said was part of a ceremony that "officially activated" a welcome video to the foreign heads of state, prompted a stream of jokes online, with some noting the images looked like a gathering of villains enacting a sinister plot.
A new book titled, MBS, written by New York Times reporter Ben Hubbard, said after Trump departed Saudi Arabia an "orb, slightly used" appeared at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh.
“It sat in a hallway for a number of days, where diplomats passing by would pose for photos,” he wrote, adding that "the orb was hidden away in embassy storage" after “someone apparently worried that the photos would make their way online and cause a scandal."
Hubbard wrote that the U.S. media's response to the orb prompted the Saudi government to gift the orb to the U.S.

Biden path to nomination rests on avoiding Clinton's 2016 war with Sanders

Texto completo: Joe Biden finally found his footing on Super Tuesday, besting Bernie Sanders in 10 of 14 states. But he has a long way to go to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination.
To win the right to take on President Trump, the former vice president must keep up his energy and aura of momentum and avoid another nasty 2016-like primary fight against socialist Sanders.
“He has to keep doing what he's been doing to a large extent. Be a good politician. Work networks of relationships,” said George Mason University political science professor Jeremy Mayer.
Sanders asserted Wednesday that corporate forces and an insider party establishment are what is leading Biden to victory, but Biden coalesced centrist support largely because he proved to be hugely popular with black voters.
Black voters led Biden to victory in South Carolina, prompting other candidates to drop out and then endorse him, creating a wave of earned media momentum that brought out voters on Super Tuesday. He won by double digits over Sanders in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma (which Sanders won in 2016).
Exit polls in Super Tuesday states showed that Biden had a 41-point lead with black voters. He also won voters older than 45, white voters, college-educated voters, and those who decided whom to vote for in the last few days.
Biden’s advantage with black voters is poised to boost his odds of winning a large chunk of Southern delegates, such as Georgia’s 105 delegates on March 24 and Mississippi’s 36 delegates on March 10.
“In every year since 1968, with one exception, the winner of the Democratic nomination has been the one favorited by African Americans,” Mayer said. “It's what killed Sanders in 2016. It's what killed him on Super Tuesday — wasn't money. It wasn't media. It was his weakness with African American voters.”
Biden and his campaign proclaim that he is rebuilding President Barack Obama’s winning electoral coalition.
"He showed tonight that he is the only candidate tonight that can put together the Obama-Biden coalition," top Biden aide Kate Bedingfield said on CNN early Wednesday morning.
The challenge for Biden, though, is that Sanders has the most support from the other half of the Obama coalition: young voters and Hispanic voters.
Sanders had a 43-point lead with voters aged 18 to 29, an 18-point lead with those 30 to 44, and a 9-point advantage over Biden with Hispanic and Latino voters. His advantage in those groups led the Associated Press to call California for Sanders as soon as polls closed.
Instead, Biden’s base of support looks more like what Hillary Clinton had in 2016.
Super Tuesday delegate allocation is still being calculated, but the New York Times projects that Biden will have a slight lead over Sanders — with both of them around one-third of the way to securing a 1,991 delegate majority.
“This isn't over,” Mayer said. “Bernie Sanders showed in 2016 that he's willing to go right to the end, even if it's mathematically impossible for him to win.”
As Biden’s surge in media attention and endorsements wanes, he could have a hard time keeping his lead. Keeping energy and an aura of authority is essential. Voters are choosing Biden “because they're so afraid of Bernie and they really want to beat Trump,” Mayer said.
To keep from having a long, drawn-out primary like 2016, Biden will have to keep Sanders from amassing a big lead in Midwestern states. There are 125 delegates up for grabs in Michigan on March 10 and 251 between Illinois and Ohio on March 17.
Trade will be a major subject in those states: Sanders has long been against free trade agreements that Biden supported.
As he tries to gain support from portions of the electorate more inclined to support Sanders, Biden could benefit from praising them rather than attacking them for vicious online attacks — a subject that came up in several Democratic presidential debates.
“One thing I think he would be smart to do is really be nice to Bernie supporters,” Mayer said. “Talk about their passion, talk about how excited he is by young people who are with Bernie. Because he's going to need that fervor, and he's going to need that support. And he desperately needs to be in charge of a united party.”
Depending on whether and how long Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts stays in the race, and what delegates allocated to candidates who dropped out do, there is a possibility that neither Sanders nor Biden wins the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to win the Democratic presidential nomination, creating a contested convention.
In that case, it’s Biden’s task to ensure a plurality, since Sanders has said that he does not think superdelegates should crown a nominee who got fewer votes than another candidate. That could force Sanders into a position of having to support Biden, and a win on the second ballot may actually benefit him.
“It's the disaster they just may need,” Mayer argued, “because it will be such high profile TV viewing unlike conventions in the last 50 years.

Bloomberg proves it: Trump's campaign skills aren't a joke

Texto completo: Let Michael Bloomberg be a reminder that what President Trump did in 2016 is not easy.
It’s easy to imagine Bloomberg, doing laps in a pool of gold coins, thinking to himself, "If Trump could do it, so can I." Bloomberg, after all, is far richer than Trump and, maybe more importantly, had actual campaign and governing experience in America’s biggest city.
It didn’t take, and not just because Bloomberg gambled that he didn’t need to compete in the first four primary contests. He performed miserably on the debate stage, and he was weak in defending his own positions. All the money in the world couldn't have saved him, as he nearly proved.
He spent well over half a billion dollars to win a grand total of 12 delegates before dropping out of the race on Wednesday. In contrast, Trump in 2016 spent less than that in total, including all his donors' money, to win both the Republican primary and the presidency.
In the 2016 general election alone, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton spent nearly $770 million. Trump spent half that and thumped her in the Electoral College.
Recall that when Trump was criticized by every journalist in the national media for accurately describing the crime spilling across the southern border, he didn't back down because he believed what he was saying. Bloomberg, on the other hand, launched his campaign by apologizing for "stop and frisk," a policing policy he had defended for close to two decades.
Bloomberg might have learned from Trump, but he didn't. He thought this would be easy. It wasn't.
To be fair, Bloomberg wouldn’t have been the first person to convince himself that running for president is a cakewalk. Former Democratic candidate Andrew Yang was asked in an interview in January about what his “strategy” would be should he find himself in a general election debate with Trump.
“I think I can eviscerate Trump in a debate stage in part because I would make him seem ridiculous,” he said. “I can poke fun at him in a way that other candidates can’t.”
But Yang’s ability to “poke fun” is apparently limited to his self-deprecating joke about being an Asian person who knows math. He never really was a comic onstage, and he dropped out after the New Hampshire primary.
What Democrats don’t seem to understand, or perhaps do understand but won’t admit out loud, is that Trump is a great campaigner. And as absurd a figure as he might be, he’s not a joke.
Let’s not forget what happened in 2016. Trump, against all odds, tore through a field of highly accomplished Republicans, nearly all of whom were at one point believed to have been mint options for the nomination. One by one, senators, governors, and even a Bush were shredded to pieces on the campaign trail and on the debate stages.
Then there was Clinton — for all of her problems, still an exceptionally qualified candidate for president. She had all of the national media, all of Hollywood, and all of the Democratic Party at her side. Whom did Trump have? No one. Well, except the voters.
And remember the debates? Here’s a headline the New York Times ran on Oct. 9, 2015: “In Debate, Hillary Clinton will display skills honed over a lifetime.”
Here’s one from Vox on Sep. 27, 2016: “5 reasons debates showcase Hillary Clinton at her best.”
That turned out swimmingly for Clinton.
It’s not that Trump was a celebrity. It’s not that he had money. It’s not that “the electorate was angry.” It’s that he really is just that good.
Bloomberg, if no one else, now knows that.

Lara Trump: Questioning Biden's 'cognitive function' is fair game

Texto completo: Trump reelection campaign adviser Lara Trump thinks misstatements, embellishments, and other verbal fumbles by 2020 Democrat Joe Biden are fair game for criticism.
“It seems like if you’re a Democrat in this country, your choice right now looks to be a socialist who is a communist sympathizer or Joe Biden, who I think a lot of folks legitimately question his cognitive function in many cases,” the president's daughter-in-law said Wednesday on Fox News's America's Newsroom.
Trump said she, as someone who is supposed to root against Biden, gets worried about what he might say when he takes the stage to make a speech.
“And if I feel that way, I think Democrat voters out there probably feel very nervous about him,” she said.
Tweet
Biden has been on the receiving end of ribbing from critics who have questioned his mental health and fitness for office, including President Trump, since he announced his candidacy.
"For sleepy Joe, he doesn’t even know where he is, what he is doing, or what office he is running for," the president said at a rally in North Carolina this week. "It doesn’t matter. Maybe he gets in — because he is a little more moderate — so maybe he gets in, but he’s not going to be running it. Other people are going to."
Biden's allies worried in the early days of the Democratic primary that his missteps could haunt him as he seeks the party's nomination.
Mike Lux, a Democratic strategist who worked for Biden's 1988 presidential campaign in Iowa, told the New York Times last year that "it felt like he was a step slow. If Joe comes back strong in the next few debates, I think it’ll be fine. But I do think he looked kind of old in this debate.”
The former vice president, 77, dismissed concerns about his mental health or stamina during an interview with Stephen Colbert in September.
“I think it’s fair to go after a political figure for anything. OK? I mean we’re — we stand up, and that comes with the territory,” Biden said. "But here’s the deal. Any gaffe that I have made — and I’ve made gaffes just like any politician I know has — have been not about a substantive issue.”
In recent weeks, Biden has made more mistakes on the campaign trail, including claiming more than 150 million people have been killed by guns since 2007, all while winning key primary victories in South Carolina last week and in multiple states on Super Tuesday. As he addressed supporters after his Tuesday victories, he confused his wife for his sister while introducing them to a crowd in Los Angeles.
Lara Trump said her father-in-law's 2020 campaign is not concerned with Biden's recent surge to take the delegate lead in the Democratic primary.
"The results only increase the likelihood that no candidate will have enough delegates for a first-ballot victory at their convention," she said. "Which only means more chaos."

Elizabeth Warren should stay in the race if her goal is to stop Joe Biden

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who finished a humiliating third in her home state of Massachusetts, has no path to the nomination. While the conventional wisdom is that she needs to drop out if the Left has any hope of consolidating in time to stop Joe Biden, the reality is the opposite. Any Democrat who wants to stop Biden from becoming the nominee should hope that Warren remains in the race as long as possible.
Though I explained this theory in detail before Iowa, it's even more true now. The reality is that even though Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders supporters are often lumped together, they actually appeal to different constituencies beyond ideology. Some Warren supporters may prefer that Democrats nominate a woman or somebody (relatively) younger. Or they may prefer her policy proposals, or see her as a more loyal Democrat.
Once she drops out, some of her supporters would inevitably go to Biden. Should Warren remain in the race, it would allow the non-Biden contingent to maximize their support by grabbing all voters who could conceivably vote for a far-left candidate.
Following his huge Super Tuesday, Biden is in strong position to win the most delegates in the Democratic primaries, if not an outright majority. And if Biden falls short of a majority, the good news is that as things stand now, most of the remaining delegates (i.e., those not won by him or Sanders) have gone to people who are now endorsing him. With results still pouring in from California, the New York Times Upshot model is projecting that Biden will come out of the big day with 45% of the delegates. But if you add the projected totals of recent Biden endorsers, Michael Bloomberg (104 delegates), Pete Buttigieg (26 delegates), and Amy Klobuchar (7 delegates), then he actually ends up with a majority. Put another way, if Biden is close to a majority but not quite there going into the convention, other candidates with a total of 137 pledge delegates would be asking their delegates to vote Biden on the first ballot and prevent a contested convention.
If Warren drops out now, according to the same model, she would only have 97 delegates — so she wouldn't be in as much of a position to help Sanders. However, if she remains in the race, she could still keep amassing delegates. Were delegates to be split three ways instead of two in a number of contests, it will become harder for Biden to achieve a majority. At some point, maybe as soon as next week, she could pass the Bloomberg-Buttigieg-Klobuchar total, giving her more influence then them if no candidate receives a majority.
Furthermore, if she remains in the race, she'll be able to participate in the March 15 debate. Instead of it merely being Sanders and Biden hitting each other, Warren and Sanders would be able to team up against Biden and make the case in favor of more radical change. Alternatively, with Warren on the stage as an attack dog against Biden, Sanders would be able to take the high ground and attempt to broaden his appeal.
There is, of course, a bit of risk to this strategy. There's a worry that if Warren remains in the race, she'll merely siphon votes away from Sanders without reaching the 15% threshold and thus wouldn't even be keeping delegates away from Biden. But were I a member of the Left, I would consider this a risk worth taking, for multiple reasons.
One, if the campaign continues on its current trajectory, Biden is going to continue to consolidate support and run away with the nomination anyway. There isn't much to lose at this point. Two, with the further consolidation of the field, it becomes easier for Warren to meet the 15% threshold as she would be one of only three candidates making a serious play for delegates. This is especially true given that chunk of Super Tuesday voting occurred early, before some candidates had dropped out. In California, for instance, Warren is currently at 12.1% statewide. Yet 13% of the electorate cast ballots for Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, or Andrew Yang, who have all dropped out. Just a fraction of those voters could have put her over the top.
Of course, it isn't clear what Warren ultimately wants at this point. Throughout her political career she has vacillated between being an ideological warrior and a party loyalist. If she wants to unify the party (or at least not go out of her way to amplify party divisions), then it would make sense for her to drop out immediately. But if her goal is to stop Biden and do everything in her power to try and get somebody at the top of the ticket calling for structural change, it makes sense for her to remain in the race.

Texto completo: Few things illustrate the disconnect between voters and the news media more clearly than the latter’s long track record of endorsing losers.

Newspapers can say all they want about why a certain candidate is the best choice for America, but voters tend not to care all that much for the recommendations. In fact, in recent years, voters seem to be choosing candidates almost in spite of what editors say they should do.
In the 2020 Democratic primary, for example, reporters and pundits made a big deal of media outlets endorsing Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.

On Jan. 19, the senators were announced as the co-winners of a highly anticipated and highly publicized endorsement from the New York Times.

Warren later won the inexplicably coveted Des Moines Register endorsement ahead of the Iowa caucuses. She also won the Boston Globe’s endorsement ahead of Super Tuesday. Klobuchar, for her part, won the New Hampshire Union Leader’s endorsement ahead of the New Hampshire primary, as well as the endorsements of Las Vegas Weekly and the Las Vegas Sun ahead of the Nevada caucuses.

Warren came in third place in Iowa, making her the eighth Des Moines Register-backed candidate to lose the state’s caucuses since the paper began endorsing primary campaigns in 1988 (it is now four for 12 in supporting winning candidacies). Warren also placed third in her home state of Massachusetts on Super Tuesday. Klobuchar, meanwhile, came in fifth place in Iowa, third place in New Hampshire, and sixth place in Nevada.

Former Mayors Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg also won media endorsements, as did Andrew Yang and even Bill Weld. Bloomberg’s campaign did not last past Super Tuesday. Buttigieg’s campaign did not even make it to Super Tuesday.

On March 2, Klobuchar ended her campaign. The Minnesota senator won exactly seven delegates. Warren is still in the race despite that she has no path whatsoever to the nomination and despite the fact that she also lost her birth state of Oklahoma on Super Tuesday.

Klobuchar’s failure alone seems like an indictment of the supposed power of news media endorsements. But the thing that really drives that point home is Warren’s total failure as a presidential candidate. She was the chosen one, the darling of the media. From MSNBC to the Washington Post, no 2020 Democratic candidate has received softer, friendlier coverage than Warren. Media have run defense for her. They have excused or downplayed her shortcomings as a candidate. They have ignored outright her falsehoods and fabrications. And that is on top of the fact that they have implicitly endorsed her campaign with constant praise and approving coverage.

Yet, for all of that, Warren is polling in third place and has only 36 delegates to her name. That says as much about the newsrooms that have propped up her campaign as it says about the senator herself.

One takeaway here could be that, contrary to popular belief, the news media are not all-powerful in deciding elections. The press has power, sure, especially when it comes to the power to cover up unflattering or scandalous stories. But media praise and endorsements alone do not seem to do a whole lot to move the needle. The candidates themselves still need to provide an exciting and intelligible message.

Warren is certainly not the first candidate to find out the hard way that a pliant and friendly news media are not enough to deliver electoral victory (see: Wendy Davis, Beto O’Rourke, and, to a somewhat lesser degree, Pete Buttigieg). She certainly won’t be the last.

Biden leading in Texas and could take overall delegate lead: Latest Super Tuesday updates

Texto completo: Joe Biden is leading Bernie Sanders in the delegate-rich state of Texas, adding to a dramatic reshaping of the Democratic presidential primary field that could push the former vice president back to front-runner status.
Biden is projected to win more delegates than Sanders, according to a New York Times analysis.
The former vice president cemented his place as the top centrist alternative to socialist Sanders in a remarkable comeback, while the Vermont senator had an underwhelming Super Tuesday performance.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg are in trouble. Bloomberg said earlier on Tuesday that he has “no intention of dropping out," but his team reportedly plans to "reassess" his campaign on Wednesday.
The New York Times projects that Warren and the billionaire former New York City mayor will be at about 400-plus delegates behind Sanders and Biden after final tallies.
Where state results stand:
Alabama — 52 pledged delegates: Biden won the state with 63%, with Sanders in second at 16.4%, with 89% of precincts reporting.
Arkansas — 31 pledged delegates: Biden won the state with 40.1%, with Sanders in second at 22.4%, with 93% of precincts reporting.
California — 415 pledged delegates: The Associated Press called the state for Sanders as soon as polls closed. Sanders leads the state with 28.4% while Bloomberg is in second at 18.6% and Biden has 18.1%, with 30% of precincts reporting.
About 40% of California's primary electorate votes absentee by mail, meaning that Biden's wave of endorsements from former rivals on Monday could have a smaller effect there. Mail-in ballots could also delay declaring a winner in the primary. The last ballots are expected to arrive in mid-March.
Colorado — 67 pledged delegates: Sanders won the state with 35.9%, with Biden in second at 22.7%, with 82% of precincts reporting.
Maine — 24 pledged delegates: Not yet called. Biden is leading with 33.8%, with Sanders in second at 32.3%, and 68% of precincts reporting.
Massachusetts — 91 pledged delegates: Biden won the state with 33.4%, with Sanders in second at 27.1% and Warren in third at 21.4%, with 83% of precincts reporting.
Minnesota — 75 pledged delegates: Biden won the state with 38.6%, with Sanders in second at 29.9%, with 96% of precincts reporting.
North Carolina — 110 pledged delegates: Biden won the state with 42.9%, with Sanders in second at 24.1%, with 96% of precincts reporting.
Oklahoma — 37 pledged delegates: Biden won the state with 38.7%, with Sanders in second at 25.4%, with 97% of precincts reporting.
Tennessee — 64 pledged delegates: Biden won the state with 41.4%, with Sanders in second at 24.7%, with 98% of precincts reporting.
Texas — 228 pledged delegates: Biden is on track to win.
Utah — 29 pledged delegates: Sanders won the state and has 35.9%, with Bloomberg in second at 17.3% and Biden with 16.4% and 28% of precincts reporting.
Vermont — 16 pledged delegates: Sanders won the state with 50.7%, with Biden in second with 22.1%, with 98% of precincts reporting.
Virginia — 99 pledged delegates: Biden won the state with 53.3%, with Sanders in second at 23.1%, with 99% of precincts reporting.
American Samoa — 6 pledged delegates: Bloomberg won the contest, and long shot candidate Tulsi Gabbard, who was born in American Samoa, won at least one delegate there.
11:59 p.m. EST: Sanders roars back with California win
10:35 p.m. EST: Warren and Bloomberg fall flat
9:33 p.m. EST: Warning signs for Sanders in Texas and Oklahoma
8:05 p.m. EST: Big night for Joe Biden in early Super Tuesday states
7:18 p.m. EST: Biden vs. Sanders race taking shape as first polls close
Results from 14 states plus the territory of American Samoa on Tuesday account for 1,347 pledged nominating delegates, about one-third of the total. A candidate needs a majority of 1,991 pledged delegates to win the nomination on the first Democratic National Convention ballot and prevent a contested convention. In the event of a brokered convention, about 770 automatic superdelegates, party leaders such as Democratic National Committee members and Democratic members of Congress, are permitted to vote for whomever they wish.
Delegates are allocated based on the proportion of statewide votes and votes within congressional districts (except for Texas, which allocates district delegates based on state Senate districts rather than congressional districts). Candidates must obtain 15% support statewide or in at least one district to earn delegates, meaning that a candidate could pick up some district delegates even if they do not capture more than 15% support statewide.

Elizabeth Warren feels sting of Super Tuesday

Texto completo: HOUSTON — Elizabeth Warren’s team has long foreshadowed that her road to the White House would be rocky, not confident enough to name a contest she could win, including her home state of Massachusetts.
Now, preliminary Super Tuesday results for the 2020 Democratic field reveal just how narrow her path would be should she decide to push on to the party’s national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this summer.
Despite a massive organizing ground game, including 400 staff members in Super Tuesday states, the Massachusetts senator suffered blow after blow in the first four early nominating contests.
Then, on Super Tuesday, she won no contests and even finished third in her home state of Massachusetts.
Looking to allay concerns, Warren campaign manager Roger Lau circulated another memo this week before Democrats in 14 states and one U.S. territory decided how to allocate 1,357 delegates among the candidates still running for the right to challenge President Trump in November.
In the memo, he insisted his boss would remain “viable” after all of the votes were tallied, citing internal data showing she was expected to pick up delegates “in nearly every state in play on Super Tuesday” and be “in a strong position to earn a sizable delegate haul coming out of the night.”
“But as the dust settles after March 3, the reality of this race will be clear: no candidate will likely have a path to the majority of delegates needed to win an outright claim to the Democratic nomination,” he wrote.
In a sign of optimism, Warren committed funds from her record-breaking $24.6 million February fundraising haul in March voting states, spending $4.1 million on advertising ahead of contests on March 3, March 10, and March 17, as well as in Wisconsin, where Democrats go to the polls on April 7.
Advertising Analytics this week reported a cable television buy, running from Super Tuesday to March 9. Yet Persist PAC, the super political action committee that formed last month to boost her electoral chances, decided against deploying resources next week so it can replenish its coffers and provide Warren with time to consider her next steps, according to the New York Times on March 3. Persist PAC, founded after the senator railed against such groups for the majority of the primary cycle, spent almost $15 million on ads ahead of Nevada, South Carolina, and Super Tuesday.
With an eye to the horizon, however, Warren’s fortunes are unlikely to improve.
In Michigan, a March 10 voting state that was once part of the Democratic “blue wall” before 2016, she polled at 13% support in February when former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar were still in the race. In Florida and Georgia, where primaries will be held on March 17 and March 24, respectively, she attracted 5% and 4% of the vote, again when Buttigieg and Klobuchar were in contention.
Warren was once a front-runner in a crowded pack seeking the presidency. The disciplined messenger rose to the top of the polls based on her talent for retail politics and flurry of plans demonstrating she was ready for the opportunities and pressures of the Oval Office.
But despite her best efforts on the campaign trail and debate stage, she has been hurt by her inability to grow her base from white, college-educated Democrats, particularly among minority members of the party. She's also been hindered by her reluctance until recently to differentiate herself from ideological ally Bernie Sanders.
Whatever the reason, Warren, known for her sunny, upbeat disposition on the campaign trail, was notably low-energy during a CNN interview Monday night. Though she was endorsed by EMILY’S List, the mounting public backing of Joe Biden resulted in Sanders fans urging her to do the same but behind the Vermont senator for much of the day.
Warren addressed the conundrum onstage before 3,000 people in East Los Angeles later Monday, her final rally before ballots began being cast.
"We find ourselves barreling toward another primary along the same lanes as 2016: one for an insider, one for an outsider. Democratic voters should have more choice than that," she said.
Warren again downplayed the two-term vice president's endorsements, including those from Buttigieg and Klobuchar, as she herself voted in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Tuesday morning before flying to Michigan for her Super Tuesday event.
“This is about getting out and talking to people about what's possible, the change that's possible in this country. This isn't about strategy. This is about a moment in history,” she told NBC.
But Michael Bloomberg offered the bluntest, if not biased, take on her prospects when asked whether he would consider a third-place finish on Super Tuesday “good.”
"If there's only three candidates, you can't do worse than that,” the billionaire former New York City mayor said.
When the reporter reminded him of Warren, he replied, "I didn't realize she's still in. Is she?"

'Coup’: Sanders supporters fume over disappointing Super Tuesday showing

Texto completo: Super Tuesday did not go the way Sen. Bernie Sanders hoped it would, leaving his supporters to lash out helplessly at all the people, places, and things they blame for the 2020 candidate’s disappointing showing.

Former Democratic 2020 candidate-turned-Sanders surrogate Marianne Williamson, for example, accused the Democratic Party of staging a “coup” against the Vermont lawmaker.

“[CNN’s] Jake Tapper referred to the ‘resurrection’ of Joe Biden’s campaign,” she said in a since-deleted tweet, referring to the former vice president’s electoral success Tuesday evening. “This was not a resurrection; it was a coup. Russiagate was not a coup. Mueller was not a coup. Impeachment was not a coup. What happened [on Super Tuesday] was a coup. And we will push it back.”

YouTuber and professionally aggrieved person Carlos Maza blamed Sanders’s lackluster numbers on cable news.

“It’s easy to blame [Elizabeth Warren] for this,” he tweeted, “but the bigger culprit is cable news, which treated South Carolina like a major unexpected comeback for Biden and likely had a huge impact on last-minute voters worried about electability.”

Biden is currently projected to come out of Super Tuesday with 656 delegates to Sanders’s 585, according to estimates provided by the New York Times’s Upshot. That is a big turnaround from just a few days ago, back when members of the press predicted Super Tuesday would all but assure Sanders the Democratic nomination.

Because things did not turn out the way they hoped they would, Sanders’s supporters are fuming over what they see as failures of the Democratic Party, the Democratic base, the American electorate in general, and democracy itself.

“The last time Obama quietly picked the nominee and the entire party apparatus instantly fell in line it went so well,” grumbled the Nation’s David Klion.

He added, “But in fairness there were a lot of liabilities last time — Iraq war support, a sketchy international corruption scandal, a demonstrated inability to connect to voters on the ground, decades of regrettable positions and statements — that won’t pose any problem this time.”

Author Matt Stoller focused his ire on the voters themselves, saying, “I saw [Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] win her low turnout primary, but other than that I can't think of a single win against the Democratic establishment in fifteen years. Democratic voters do what Wall Street wants them to do and they are basically fine with the status quo.”

He added, “This is likely the last primary before we start reckoning with mass death. What is coming will change politics in ways that are hard to imagine.”

Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs added elsewhere of the Democratic Party, “If Biden wins the nomination, it will be a real lesson in how power works.”

“Bernie was on track to win,” he added. “Biden had no campaign, and they all knew it. So a few phone calls were made behind the scenes to Amy, Pete, Beto. Several million was put into a pro-Warren super PAC. Voila!”

He continued, predicting the Democratic establishment will release a “cascade of endorsements, cut deals with Bloomberg and Warren, have everyone turn their fire on Bernie relentlessly including the media orgs, and try to keep Joe Biden from speaking long enough for people to realize some of his marbles are missing.”

Then, there is Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who lamented progressive Democrats' apparent inability to get their act together.

“Imagine if the progressives consolidated last night like the moderates consolidated,” she said, “who would have won? That’s what we should be analyzing. I feel confident a united progressive movement would have allowed for us to #BuildTogether and win MN and other states we narrowly lost.”

As of this writing, Biden is on track to win 10 Super Tuesday states, including Omar’s state of Minnesota. He currently has 302 delegates to Sanders’s 241 (candidates need 1,991 delegates to win the nomination).

Texto completo: Today, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case involving a Louisiana law requiring that abortionists have hospital admitting privileges (June Medical Services v. Russo).
The state legislators who passed the requirement and the governor who signed their bill into law did so in light of a long string of abortion industry abuses that put the lives of Louisiana women at risk. Bayou State abortionists and abortion clinics — the very interests whose practices placed the state’s women in medical jeopardy, the very interests that Louisiana policymakers believed needed regulation to protect Louisiana women seeking an abortion — sued to block the law, claiming to defend the “rights” of their future clients and customers.
The case would be laughed out of court if, say, automakers claimed to represent the “rights” of their customers in objecting to car safety requirements. Or if the fox claimed to represent the interests of the hens in the chicken coop. Sadly, that’s not the case when it comes to regulating abortionists.
June Medical Services v. Russo gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to correct the flawed jurisprudence that has given “standing” to parties with a clear conflict of interest in the abortion arena. For all of its problems, the tragic 1973 Roe v. Wade decision creating a constitutional right to abortion was at least filed on behalf of an anonymous woman, Jane Roe. Since Roe, however, abortionists and abortion clinics are the ones most often running to our courts to oppose reasonable regulation, regulation designed to protect women at their most vulnerable, of their business.
The 1992 Supreme Court case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which ruled that any abortion regulation would be unconstitutional if it placed “substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability,” was brought not by any aggrieved woman in Pennsylvania, but by five abortion clinics and an abortionist. The foxes were being allowed to bring cases challenging henhouse safety regulations.
In 2016, the court accepted the legal challenge of abortion providers and struck down a Texas law requiring doctors who provide abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital in a 5-3 decision. Justice Clarence Thomas denounced the sloppy legal standards and slippery reasoning of his colleagues in his scathing Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt dissent. The majority, he wrote, “erroneously allowed doctors and clinics to vicariously vindicate the putative constitutional right of women seeking abortions.”
The challengers to the Louisiana law are abortion clinics and abortionists -- not one woman patient or prospective patient joined them. While Louisiana’s law is similar to Texas’, this case differs in important ways. Louisiana legislators were reacting to a well-chronicled record of health and safety violations on the part of Louisiana abortionists. Botched abortions, incompetent doctors, failure to stock emergency materials, lack of oversight of controlled substances, and gross medical negligence had placed women in serious risk. Interestingly, Louisiana requires all other ambulatory surgical doctors in the state to have hospital admitting privileges. The new law merely closed a loophole granting special treatment to abortion docs.
The “standing” rules in abortion cases have been bent so far that they are now broken. A person generally can go to court only to assert his or her own legal rights and interests. A narrow exception to this “standing” rule is when the third party has a close relationship to the right-holder, or the right-holder is unable to sue and can trust the third party to pursue his or her interests.
The conflict of interest at work in the abortion arena is spelled out in a number of “friends of the court” briefs. “The interests of abortion providers and the interests of Louisiana women do not run in ‘parallel’ with respect to [the Louisiana law],” the U.S. Department of Justice said, “but instead are ‘potentially in conflict.’” Louisiana legislators pinpoint the divergent interests: “One of the women’s interests is in protecting their safety when having an abortion, and one of the doctors’ interests — to eliminate a law that places a regulatory obligation on them — directly conflicts with that.”
More than 200 members of Congress also state that “abortion providers’ interests are at odds with their patients’ interests,” and 20 states specifically objected to the abortionists’ standing to file suit: “[A]bortion-law cases have become vehicles by which abortion practitioners and facilities attack health-and-safety regulations designed to protect women -- the same women whose rights the practitioners claim to invoke – from the practitioners themselves.”
The Supreme Court should pay heed. It’s time abortionists and abortion clinics no longer be allowed to pretend to speak in court on behalf of women when it comes to the health and safety of their clients or customers.

Texto completo: What a difference a few days make. They brought Joe Biden back from the dead.
After a landslide victory in South Carolina on Saturday, he collected a bonanza of important endorsements Sunday and Monday. Then, on Super Tuesday, when 14 states voted, he did exponentially better than almost anyone predicted. He probably exceeded his own dreams.
Bernie Sanders supposedly had the momentum in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Biden just stole it. He’s resuscitated, resurrected, resplendent. It’s some kind of miracle.
“I am here to report: We are very much alive!” Biden exulted in a victory speech, and you could almost see the adrenaline pumping from his pores. You could hear, in his thunderous voice, an amalgam of amazement and pure joy. Rambling, bumbling Biden was mostly gone. In his stead was an exuberant, articulate champion.
Biden won in places where black voters make all the difference and in places where they don’t. He won in places — Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma — where he hadn’t even competed. He won Virginia by 30 points. He won Texas, where Sanders’s outreach to Latino voters was supposed to put him over the top. He won and won and won, taking the overall lead in the delegate count.
And his momentum may be even bigger than the Super Tuesday returns suggested, for three reasons. One, early voting in some states preceded his surge and probably didn’t reflect it. Two, the coalescing of other Democrats around him is so new that it may not have fully registered with voters. Three, exit polls affirmed that Democratic voters care more about choosing the fiercest adversary for President Donald Trump than about embracing a candidate whose positions they like best. Super Tuesday cast Biden as that adversary. It gave him that glow. So he could shine brighter still when another six states vote in a week.
That’s especially true in light of what happened Wednesday morning: Michael Bloomberg, who had an epically disappointing and decidedly un-super Tuesday, dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden. Votes that would have gone to him are much more likely to go to Biden than to Sanders.
Sanders could be in big trouble. Or not. He’s going to win California, the state with by far the greatest trove of delegates. And his impassioned supporters have already begun to portray Biden’s Super Tuesday showing as the product of some Democratic establishment trickery. Who knows how this will play out? If 2016 and 2020 so far have taught us anything, it’s not to get ahead of ourselves.
This much is safe to say: The landscape of the Democratic primary was messy, and now it’s clean. So is the choice. The contest for the party’s presidential nomination comes down to two very distinct visions and two very different old men.
So much for the most crowded field of Democratic aspirants in memory. So much for that field’s diversity — for the formidable women in the hunt, for the compelling candidates of color.
So much for the gradations of progressivism, for the shades of gray. Biden is as smack in the middle of the party’s mainstream, whatever that is, as they come. He’s also the establishment incarnate, moderation made flesh. Sanders, well, he’s the revolution. That’s his motto, his mantra. It might as well be his middle name.
Biden calls for healing. Sanders vows to fight.
Whose Democratic Party is it, anyway? We may need the rest of March — or longer — to find out. But we know, thanks to the clearing and clarifying function of the states that weighed in Tuesday, that the party has arrived at a fork in the road much neater than many of us were expecting.
Bloomberg is formally gone. Elizabeth Warren — who did miserably Tuesday, losing even her home state — is effectively out of contention, too. Bloomberg’s underperformance was especially striking and humiliating in the context of the hundreds of millions that he spent to woo voters. He got a terrible return on that investment.
He hadn’t been on the ballot in the first four states to vote, but he was on the ballot everywhere on Tuesday, and he won … the territory of American Samoa. Break out the Dom Pérignon! In Virginia, where Bloomberg invested maybe 20 times the money that Biden did, he got less than 10% of the vote, finishing fourth. Biden got more than 50%.
Bloomberg did surpass the 15% threshold in other states, but not by so much that he was positioned to catch up with Biden or Sanders as the race progressed. There was no rationale for pressing on. There was no point.
Watching the returns, I heard the voice of the playwright Edward Albee, or rather of one of his characters in “The Zoo Story,” who said — I’m paraphrasing liberally — that sometimes you have to go a long way out of the way to come a short way back.
That’s the story of the Democratic primary. Rewind to the beginning of 2019, or possibly earlier, and there was a supposition that the battle for the party’s presidential nomination would boil down to a well-known and nonthreatening moderate versus an edgier progressive. While the stars of that show hadn’t been chosen, Biden and Sanders were very much in the running.
Super Tuesday brought the Democratic Party back to that dichotomy and back to those two. It was as if the meteoric and historic rise of Pete Buttigieg, who led in the delegate count after Iowa and New Hampshire, had never happened. It was as if the Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar moments, not to mention the longer stretch during which Warren was ascendant, had been hallucinations.
It was almost — almost — as if Bloomberg hadn’t complicated the race with his wall-to-wall television commercials, funded by his personal Fort Knox.
All of that receded as Biden and Sanders took center stage. Each focused on the other in dueling remarks on Tuesday night. Sanders used his to bash Biden’s record, portraying him as a foreign-policy hawk, a pawn of billionaires and a tool of the financial industry.
Biden returned fire. “We want a nominee who will beat Donald Trump but also keep Nancy Pelosi as the speaker of the House and win back the United States Senate,” Biden said. “We’ve got to beat Donald Trump, and we will, but we can’t become like him.” He didn’t mention Sanders. He didn’t have to.
“What in God’s name happened to Joe Biden?” I wrote a few weeks ago, and I could and should ask the question again. But, this time, I’m wondering about his strength, not his weakness.
I do have preliminary answers and explanations: Many anxious Democratic voters have been itching to unite behind a candidate so that everyone can then turn their attention and focus their energies on getting rid of Trump, and they needed just a few prompts to do that. They got those prompts over the past 96 hours.
If they hadn’t been rushing toward Biden before, they had never been running away. He was always there, so safe and so dear, a harbor at the ready, a perfectly acceptable landing. The intensifying chatter about Sanders as an easily caricatured radical spooked some of them, giving them extra incentive to cluster around an alternative. Biden was waiting, with characteristically open arms.
Sanders should be concerned — not just because Biden has staged an extraordinary comeback or because Bloomberg’s exit will invariably redound to Biden’s benefit, especially if Bloomberg starts spending big on Biden’s behalf. Sanders isn’t flexing the electoral muscle that he keeps claiming to have. In some states Tuesday, he did significantly worse than he had when he ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016, and this wasn’t the first time that his performance this year paled next to what he achieved four years ago.
How can he boast of an expanding movement if, by some measures, he’s contracting? And how does that contraction square with his insistence that he’s the one to vanquish Trump?
On Super Tuesday, Biden was the superhero. He could yet step on his own cape: He’s Biden, after all. But until then, he’s soaring.

John Leshy: Free-market plan to protect Utah’s landscape was working. Until Trump ended it.

Texto completo: The Trump administration has struck another blow to common-sense management of public lands in the West. Virtually all the spectacular country neighboring the Escalante River in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah will be reopened to cattle grazing, thanks to a new plan for managing the monument released by the Interior Department last month.
The move manages to be both anti-rancher and anti-environment.
Without justification, the Interior Department’s decision upends a landmark deal between ranchers and conservationists that for the past 20 years has allowed the flora and fauna in the remote red rock canyons of the monument to flourish once again. This backward step threatens free-market solutions that have given ranching families across the West the financial flexibility to move to greener pastures.
Under that deal, which had been honored by the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations, local ranchers voluntarily relinquished their permits to graze public lands in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars from conservationists.
Over the past few decades, similar deals around the West have sought to resolve conflicts between conservationists and ranchers running livestock on public lands by cooperation rather than confrontation and litigation.
In Nevada’s Great Basin National Park, for instance, ranchers who owned grazing permits in perpetuity on land that became part of the park when it was created in 1986 agreed to donate their permits to the Conservation Fund, an environmental group, in return for compensation.
These arrangements have attracted support from across the political spectrum. In 2001, George W. Bush’s libertarian interior secretary, Gale Norton, celebrated this approach as a “marketplace-oriented resolution for public land conflicts” — a win-win.
The labyrinthine canyon lands of the Escalante River, a magnet for adventuresome recreationists, show why the idea is such a good one. In the late 1990s, ranchers holding the grazing permits there decided they had had enough. One wanted to retire, one wanted to run his stock in less difficult terrain and a third wanted to move his operation to another state.
These willing sellers negotiated an agreement with the nonprofit Grand Canyon Trust to relinquish their grazing privileges for cash. The Utah State Division of Wildlife Resources then endorsed the idea of retiring the area from livestock grazing, Utah’s Republican governor, Michael Leavitt, signed off on it, and the Interior Department agreed, finding that it would restore a fragile and treasured gem to ecological health.
The effect on the local grazing economy was infinitesimal; over 96 percent of the original national monument remained open to grazing at the same level as before. (The area retired from grazing remained within the monument’s boundaries after President Trump drastically shrank it in 2017.)
Cows have now been absent from the area for two decades, and the results are striking, captured in before and after photographs. Wildflowers, willows, fish and wildlife, including beaver and otters, now flourish where there was once only fouled water and clouds of biting cow flies tormenting hikers. The area has become the most sought-out destination in the monument, drawing nearly 300,000 visits annually.
Now the Trump administration has gone back on the deal that made it possible. Its new plan calls for reopening to grazing more than 85 percent of the lands protected by the original deal, giving cows free rein and dooming the fragile desert to be trampled and fouled by livestock, except for the narrow river corridor itself. The effect of the administration’s abrupt U-turn will ripple way beyond those magnificent canyonlands. In the future, it will take a very brave, or very foolish, conservation buyer to want to invest in such arrangements so easily undone by executive caprice.
This means ranchers — particularly those struggling to scratch out a living on hardscrabble desert lands where conservation buyers are often the only willing buyers of grazing privileges — will suffer alongside recreationists, wildlife advocates and the environment.
Legislation introduced in Congress by Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington, and several co-sponsors would fix the problem, by protecting negotiated buyouts and permit retirements from the executive branch’s political whims.
Unfortunately, it faces an uphill battle. The national trade association of enterprises running livestock on public land, the Public Lands Council — seeking to preserve its membership and influence — fiercely resists retiring even a single acre of public land from livestock grazing.
Perhaps the recklessness of the Interior Department’s latest decision will spur more members of Congress to support this common-sense legislation that benefits ranchers while restoring public lands to health.
John Leshy is an emeritus professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law and the author of the forthcoming book “Our Common Ground,” a history of America’s public lands. He has been on the board of the Grand Canyon Trust since 2002.

Texto completo: While there's only been one confirmed case of the new coronavirus in Dane County so far, schools in the area are preparing for the potential for more as the virus spreads in other states.
Local officials have maintained the risk remains low in Wisconsin for an outbreak, but a U.S. Centers for Disease Control official last week encouraged parents around the country to prepare for the disease to spread.
"You should ask your children's schools about their plans for school dismissals or school closures," Nancy Messonnier, a director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a Feb. 25 press briefing.
In the Seattle area, the Seattle Times reported some schools are closed Monday because of students testing positive for coronavirus or suffering flu-like symptoms. The state of Washington has been among the hardest hit in the U.S., with 18 reported cases and six deaths, as of Monday.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus named SARS-CoV2, is a strand of the coronavirus that began to spread in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, according to the CDC. As of Feb. 27, the CDC reported there were 78,497 cases in China and 3,797 outside of China. Monday, the New York Times reported there were 88 cases in the United States confirmed by authorities, including the six deaths, most of whom were elderly and had underlying health issues.
Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to a fact sheet from the CDC.
The spread has led institutions like UW-Madison to cancel its study abroad programs in South Korea and Italy for the semester.
State officials are trying to help local districts prepare. Deputy state schools Superintendent Mike Thompson sent a message to district administrators last week encouraging them "to update pandemic plans and consider responses if an outbreak of a communicable disease affects their respective community," Department of Public Instruction spokesperson Chris Bucher wrote in an email to the Cap Times.
The Department of Public Instruction's website also includes a model pandemic plan for districts to build from and a Frequently Asked Questions document from the state Department of Health Services. DPI's March 2 update included a caution that "the health risk to the general public from SARS-CoV2 remains low, both in the U.S. and in Wisconsin."
Locally, schools are trying to keep parents calm and informed. Emails to parents have emphasized normal germ-prevention techniques like good hand washing and avoiding touching faces. Some area districts are also beginning work on their pandemic plans as advised by DPI.
The Madison Metropolitan School District released two coronavirus updates to parents on its website in early February after the first Dane County case was confirmed.
While the district hasn't posted new information since Feb. 11, assistant director of health services Sally Zirbel-Donisch said Monday the district has begun work on updating its pandemic plan to apply to the coronavirus.
"We had done planning around pandemics when we had H1N1, so we reviewed that pandemic plan and we've revised that plan for coronavirus," she said. "There's just a lot of planning going on right now."
While that pandemic plan is currently in draft form, Zirbel-Donisch said district officials are working to make sure guidelines and communications to families will remain up-to-date. She said there's also a focus on "how best we can keep our schools clean," ensuring students follow good hand-washing techniques and having people stay home when they're sick.
Her department will also be working closely with the curriculum and instruction and human resources departments to plan out what would happen if a school needed to close. The specifics of any such plan would depend on the school's enrollment and the grades it covers, Zirbel-Donisch said.
"We really need to connect with our local public health department to even learn what that might look like," she said. "We're all in the process of learning and trying to grasp what this may look like."
In the Verona Area School District, district leaders are convening a steering committee of administration, school nurses and medical professionals "to provide information and guidance for staff, students and families," according to a letter sent to families Monday.
"You can expect regular updates on this matter, even if the updates include minimal new information," the letter states.
Similarly, the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District's safety team was planning to begin work related to the pandemic planning guidelines from DPI, district spokesman Perry Hibner wrote in an email.
Earlier last week, Hibner said, he sent a communication to families "about general germ prevention recommendations and coronavirus facts from the CDC." Monday, he planned to send another communication to tell families that the district would continue to disinfect its facilities "on a regular basis following CDC guidelines."
"We understand there is uncertainty involved in this situation," Hibner wrote. "We will continue to update families as needed regarding recommendation or guideline changes."
Similar to Madison, the Monona Grove School District is updating its "health emergency plan" created during the H1N1 pandemic, spokeswoman Katy Byrnes Kaiser wrote in an email to the Cap Times.
"Beginning last week, we took steps to convene a districtwide cross-departmental team to review and update this plan as necessary. This plan addresses what is done before, during, and after a potential outbreak," she wrote. "If we encounter significantly increased illness or if there are local cases of COVID-19, we will work closely with Public Health Madison and Dane County and will follow and adhere to their directions."
The district is also continuing prevention efforts like hand-washing lessons for students and tracking absence rates, she added. Officials are also encouraging families to talk to students about the disease, "given a few reports of increased student anxiety around illness and pandemic planning." Advice includes reminding students of the low risk, sticking to factual information and avoiding assumptions or stereotypes about who might be sick.

Texto completo: A year ago, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democratic lawmakers unveiled the Green New Deal, the aggressive environmental proposal that sought to utterly overhaul the American economy and get the nation off fossil fuels within a decade.
The proposal eventually amassed 98 House backers -- all Democrats -- but flamed out in a 57-0 vote in the Senate, where not a single Democratic senator supported it.
Undeterred, Ocasio-Cortez last week offered a bill that would ultimately ban hydraulic fracturing -- or fracking -- in America by 2025. Unlike a year ago, Rep. Darren Soto, a Kissimmee Democrat, has joined Ocasio-Cortez in this effort.
"We cannot deny the overwhelming scientific consensus any longer," Soto said in a statement. "Fracking is a threat to our health, safety and environment."
"If we want to transition from fossil fuel emissions as we work towards building a 100 percent clean economy, pulling back from fracking is a critical first step," he added. "Failure to act will only make the crisis at hand even more detrimental for future generations of Americans."
We can understand why fracking concerns many like Soto, for reasons both above and below ground. We have opposed efforts to implement fracking in Florida, even as we appreciate how it has benefited our nation.
Yet a nationwide ban is the wrong way to go, as it is indisputable that fracking has been a net positive for America's energy sector, its customers and for climate change. Thus, we encourage Congress to ignore this proposal.
As Drew Johnson of the right-leaning National Center for Public Policy Research recently noted in an opinion piece, fracking enabled America to become the globe's leading natural gas producer in 2015. Just two years ago, natural gas production was up 60% over two decades ago, and, Johnson noted, "This newfound abundance of natural gas has helped our nation transition away from coal, which emits twice as much carbon dioxide."
According to him, "U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have hit 30-year lows, even as global emissions have increased by 50% during the same period. And since 2005, natural gas has done more to reduce power sector dioxide emissions than all renewable energy sources combined."
Per an Associated Press report, the Paris-based International Energy Agency recently announced that global man-made greenhouse gas emissions last year remained at 2018 levels. The biggest drop in carbon dioxide emissions was recorded in the U.S., which was partly attributed to closing coal-fired power plants.
What happens when those plants shut down? The New York Times explained last June: "Since 2005, most power companies have lowered their carbon dioxide emissions significantly, in large part by shifting from coal to (natural) gas."
A wholesale swap to wind and solar, with a correlating ban on fracking, would devastate America's economy, particularly workers in the fossil fuel industry, and crush utility customers.
A fracking ban sounds great in theory, but the economic consequences of its reality make it too risky an option to let it escape the drawing board.

PUBLIC DEMAND GROWS FOR MASKS, SANITIZERS

Texto completo: If you were to try and order a face mask on Home Depot's website Tuesday afternoon, an alert would've appeared informing customers that, "due to current events, supplies are limited."
A five-pack of "nuisance masks" meant to protect against dust and powders is unavailable for order as they are out of stock in all Home Depot locations within 100 miles of Allegheny County. The same goes for disposable multi-purpose dust masks.
Home Depot began seeing an increase in demand for face masks a little over a month ago - so much so that the Atlanta-based hardware store chain implemented a limited purchase quantity of 10 masks per person, according to Christina Cornell, a company spokeswoman.
The surge in face masks and surgical mask sales is due to the COVID-19 disease outbreak, which has infected 89,000 people across 70 countries, according to Tuesday estimates. As the worldwide death toll reached more than 3,000, the U.S. toll stood at nine victims through Tuesday, all in Washington state.
Health officials from the U.S. Surgeon General to doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned the general public against buying masks. Despite that, major retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's are working to expedite health products - face masks, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies - into consumers' hands.
Drugstore chains are experiencing the same high demand, but Rite Aid spokesperson Chris Savarese told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that those same products are typically in demand during cold and flu season.
"We are experiencing a run on those products due to heavy flu season compiled with the coronavirus outbreak," Mr. Saverese said.
Rite Aid is doing its best to manage inventory and remain stocked up on healthcare supplies to meet customers' needs, Mr. Saverese said.
CVS is experiencing similar demand pressure for face masks and cleaning supplies. The demand may "cause temporary shortages of certain products at some store locations and we are re-supplying those stores as quickly as possible," said Mike DeAngelis, spokesman for CVS Health.
Health officials say the overwhelming demand for masks and other hygenic products is creating a crisis for healthcare workers. Over the weekend, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted a stern warning to the public that read: "Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!"
Dr. Adams said face masks are not effective in preventing a COVID-19 infection, and the shortage only hinders healthcare providers who need masks to care for sick patients.
The World Health Organization has said masks should only be worn by healthy people who are taking care of someone sick, or someone who is already sick and is coughing and sneezing in public.

AG takes over case of alleged 'fake news'

Texto completo: The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office has taken over the prosecution of a Delaware County man accused of forging an email from county officials to create a race-fueled scandal for his news website.
Nikolaos Hatziefstathiou, 26, of Broomall, was arrested in July and charged with tampering with public records, forgery, identity theft, and related offenses. Hatziefstathiou, who goes by the nickname "Nik the Hat," has denied the charges, asserting that the email he touted on his website, YC News, was a legitimate document.
The referral of his case, formally announced at a hearing Monday, was made "out of an abundance of caution," according to District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer.
Stollsteimer, a Democrat, was chided by Republicans during his campaign in the fall for attending a news conference in May 2019 calling for the email to be investigated before it was debunked.
"It's one of these things where because the case came up during the course of the campaign, we just thought it best to have the attorney general step in and prosecute," Stollsteimer said. "It's nothing bigger than that."
On May 25, YC News reported about an email it said it had obtained from an unidentified source. The email, allegedly sent by a supervisor with the county's Adult Probation and Parole department, included racist language about African Americans, according to the story.
But after investigating the email, prosecutors led by then-District Attorney Katayoun Copeland alleged that it was a "fake news" hoax created by Hatziefstathiou by doctoring another email he had received from his own probation officer in an unrelated case.
Copeland also detailed instances in which Hatziefstathiou posed as a producer from Good Morning America and as a New York Times reporter in attempts to glean information from her office.
"He will use any means to create a false narrative," Copeland said of Hatziefstathiou after his arrest. "He will go to any length to do so."
Copeland, a Republican who lost her seat to Stollsteimer, went on to rebuke him and other elected officials who "jumped on Hatziefstathiou's bandwagon knowing these claims may be false, and were willing to believe the very worst about people without a shred of evidence."
But Stollsteimer said Monday that that was a mischaracterization of the intention of the news conference, which was organized by State Rep. Margo Davidson (D., Delaware) and attended by State Sen. Anthony Hardy Williams, a Philadelphia Democrat whose district includes parts of the county, among other politicians.
"All Margo said, and all I said, was that this should be investigated, and if someone sent the email, they should be prosecuted, and if it was a hoax, this should be prosecuted," Stollsteimer said. "We got what we asked for: It is being prosecuted."

Biden, Sanders, and the struggle for the Democrats’ future

Resumen: As Biden and Sanders battle in the primaries, there’s a fundamental clash lining up between the Democrats’ revolutionary and moderate wings.

Texto completo: So far, watching the 2020 Democratic primary process has been like riding a world-class roller coaster, full of wild swings, sudden climbs, and stomach-churning plummets.
And like a spin around Cedar Point amusement park’s “Steel Vengeance,” it has ended up back where it began: with former Vice President Joe Biden as the frontrunner and candidate with the clearest path to winning the nomination.
But don’t unbuckle yet. Sen. Bernie Sanders still has money, organization, and a devoted following on his side. Democratic Party rules, which award delegates on a proportional basis in each state, favor a close race.
There’s a debate scheduled for March 15 that will be essentially one-on-one. Events held a day or so prior to a vote have seemed extraordinarily influential this primary season.
Nor did Super Tuesday solve the basic division within the Democratic Party, which pits Senator Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and other progressive revolutionaries against moderates who wish to restore Obama-era priorities. That’s a split so fundamental it could cause intramural friction for years to come, no matter who wins the party’s 2020 nod.
While the restoration wing of the party seeks a return to political norms, civility, and respect for all after years of growing polarization, the progressive wing argues that the United States needs bolder, sweeping changes to everything from health care to climate change.
“I suspect everybody will get together and try to make sure we get rid of Trump. If that happens, we will postpone this conflict a little bit. But it will come back,” says Bill Carrick, a longtime Democratic consultant in Los Angeles.
From zero primaries to 11 Still, by almost any measure, Super Tuesday 2020 was a stunning uplift for an American politician who has been a fixture in Washington since winning a Senate seat in 1972, then served eight years as vice president, yet never before gained any momentum for his own burning presidential ambitions.
Joe Biden has run for the nation’s highest office three times. Before last Saturday in South Carolina, he had never won a primary. Now he has won 11. The other moderates in the race have dropped out and endorsed him.
He currently leads in delegates, with an estimated 433, according to a mid-afternoon Wednesday estimate from The New York Times. Senator Sanders trails with 388.
Mr. Biden benefited from a sudden coalescing of center-left Democrats around his candidacy. With Mr. Sanders surging, these voters decided it was time to settle, not moon after political crushes. African-American voters were crucial to the Biden coalition, which included substantial numbers of working-class whites and college-educated women.
Biden voters interviewed in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, won by Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in 2018 after 38 years of Republican representation, spoke of a number of reasons why they supported the former vice president. But one thing was on top of many of their lists.
“I just want him to beat Trump,” says Amy Davis, an African-American stay-at-home mom from Culpeper.
Ms. Davis adds that she also thought Mr. Biden did a good job as vice president.
“He impressed me when he worked under Obama,” she says.
Coming to Biden Some Biden supporters said they had switched from other candidates.
Pat Carl, a retired white man serving as a poll watcher with the Spotsylvania Democrats, says originally, he liked Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who withdrew from the race and endorsed Mr. Biden earlier this week.
But Mr. Carl says he’s confident that a Biden administration would have a place in it for Senator Klobuchar. And as a former Republican, he’s attracted by Mr. Biden’s ideological position in the Democratic Party.
“I’m a moderate kind of person,” he says.
Several Virginia Biden voters volunteered that they’d cast a ballot for President Donald Trump in 2016. They’d believed in his “Make America Great Again” slogan.
But they’ve found his behavior as president off-putting.
“Now he’s just lashing out at everyone, firing his own staff. I’m so disappointed in him,” says Alan Burnham, a white male school bus driver.
Given all the uproar over Mr. Biden’s sudden reemergence as the Democratic front-runner, it is easy to forget that only about one-third of the total number of pledged state delegates to the party convention in Milwaukee have been chosen. There is plenty of time remaining for a Biden stumble, or a Sanders rally.
Six states hold primary votes March 10, including the crucial Rust Belt state of Michigan. Four more states vote March 17, including Florida and Ohio.
Biden’s flaws; Sanders’ strengths As a candidate, Mr. Biden has flaws. That is part of the reason why he struggled to raise funds and attract voters in the primary season’s initial contests.
On the stump he is prone to garbled speech and other verbal miscues – at his victory appearance Tuesday night, for instance, he mistakenly identified his wife as his sister, and vice versa. (He quickly corrected the error.) He’s been known to run on, and on. Sometimes he gets names mixed up. Given his length of service in Washington, he’s not exactly an exciting new face.
“I don’t think he’s a weak candidate. I think he’s got some weaknesses as a candidate,” says Garry South, a longtime Democratic consultant based in Los Angeles.
But Democrats will start to look at Mr. Biden and see that “at the end of the day, that’s part of what makes him authentic,” Mr. South says.
Meanwhile, Mr. Sanders has strengths. His campaign is flush with cash, and his ability to raise small dollar donations online remains unparalleled. Many of his supporters are devoted in a way that Biden voters don’t appear to be. His rallies draw tens of thousands of fans to hear him excoriate billionaires and corporations and promote Medicare For All and free tuition at public colleges and universities.  
For all the attention given to Mr. Biden, the two men remain almost tied in the currency that matters most, delegate strength, Senator Sanders pointed out in an appearance at his Burlington, Vermont campaign office Wednesday.
“What this campaign … is increasingly about is, which side are you on? Our campaign is unprecedented” when it comes to grassroots support, Mr. Sanders said.
In Virginia, primary voters who opted for Senator Sanders stressed his appeal to young people, and how his proposals went to the heart of their concerns.
Amber Seagrave, a young white woman with pink hair who works as a stylist, says she voted for him in part because of his proposals to eliminate student loan debt.
“I’m going to be late on my student loans again this month,” says Ms. Seagrave. “I had to drop out of college because I couldn’t pay for it.”
Limits to the division The Democratic nightmare is that the animosity between the Sanders and Biden camps will extend past the convention, and that the loser’s side will sit on its hands and have a lower turnout rate for the general election.
“Over the next month or so, we will see a lot of animosity, anger, resentment. It will look bad and end up feeling pretty similar to 2016,” when bad feeling developed between the Hillary Clinton and Sanders campaigns, says Prof. David Barker, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University.
But Professor Barker says there are several reasons why this division won’t end up being as consequential as it was four years ago.
For one thing, President Trump is an incumbent both sides want very much to oust. For another, Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton. Ms. Clinton generated antipathy from both Republicans and the Democratic left wing. Mr. Biden perhaps doesn’t produce that level of animosity.
“The thing about Biden now is that while he doesn’t excite the young progressive left, he also doesn’t inspire the same level of loathing. There seems to be some level of warmth for the guy,” says Professor Barker.

Texto completo: Favors means test
Editor: There is absolutely no good reason for politicians, mostly conservative Republicans, to scare senior citizens by threatening to cut Social Security retirement benefits. There is no so-called “crisis.”
Virtually every serious, nonbiased study has concluded that the Social Security trust fund is fully solvent through 2034. After that, it will be able to provide 76% to 79% of benefits for the next 60 years afterward.
Does it need to be fixed? Of course it does. But it does not have to be done today and there is no need to cut anyone’s benefits.
A relatively simple and easy reform was proposed in 2015 by Republican presidential candidate and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. I sat in the same car as Democratic presidential candidate and then-Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt in 1987 when he said that we should “means test” Social Security benefits. For example, Social Security could become fully solvent well beyond 2034 if the benefits of those who have a yearly income of, say, $80,000 a year and higher are reduced by a certain percentage. I recall Babbitt saying “Stew, do multimillionaires really need the same Social Security benefits as senior citizens who are living in poverty?”
I urge members of Congress to stop scaring senior citizens. Something that might happen in 14 years that could be easily preventable is not a crisis and they all know it. It is so unnecessary and cruel for our senior citizens to be scared like this.

End predatory billing
Editor: People often turn to hospitals in a time of need and no one should have to worry about financial hardship as a result of seeking the care needed at a hospital.
Across the country, consumers are being targeted by hospitals with lawsuits and other predatory actions when hospitals have the option to pursue more consumer-friendly options first. All this comes at a time when Americans are increasingly anxious about the costs of hospital care.
According to recent research by Ipsos-CQC, 91% of patients are concerned about receiving surprise bills from hospitals and 65% say it’s difficult to understand the cost of care at a hospital, including finding out how much a hospital charges for specific types of care.
Because hospitals and the groups that represent them have largely failed to adequately address these practices, Consumers for Quality Care, a patient advocacy organization, recently sent a letter to the members of the National Governors Association urging them to take action and protect their constituents.
As patients continue to struggle financially due to these toxic practices, Gov. Tom Wolf has an opportunity to stand up for the people of Pennsylvania by implementing reforms that cut consumer costs and increase transparency in the health care system.

What Russians?
Editor: In the immortal words of baseball great Yogi Berra, “It’s deja view all over again.”
If you are tired about hearing how the Russians helped Hillary Clinton lose to President Donald J. Trump, get ready for round two. All I hear on cable channels like CNN, MSNBC and others is how Russians will “influence” our election to ensure the chances of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who most Democrats know has no chance of wining the general election.
He is a socialist, so I don’t think so. Not that Democrats have anyone else who could beat Trump. So exactly how can the Russians guarantee a winner? Since most polling places are not interconnected to a nationwide network, maybe they could sneak an operative into every polling place and alter the polling machines. Or maybe they could flood the airways with zillions spent in pro-Sanders and pro-Trump ads nationwide.
But money doesn’t assure a win, think of Michael Bloomberg. I would appeal to anyone to explain how the Russians can “influence” our election to get the winners they want. This effort is so transparent.
When Trump wins the election there will be a neverending curiosity about how he stole the election again and should be impeached. Sound familiar?

HAMLIN
Traitorous leader
Editor: If there was ever any doubt, it is clear now that President Donald Trump is a traitor, as well as a serial liar and a criminal.
Three cheers for Times-Tribune columnist Chris Kelly for standing up for local newspapers but they are not the antidote to our problems. Our democracy is threatened by Trump’s morally bankrupt administration because the majority of Americans - and U.S. senators - seem to be too lazy to read. Were they to read the report by former special counsel Robert Mueller, they would know that Trump is guilty of multiple counts of obstruction of justice and that the Russians are actively interfering again in our elections on Trump’s behalf Gee, I wonder why Russian President Vladimir Putin prefers Trump.
Now, Trump has fired his acting national intelligence director for telling him the truth - that Russians continue to work to re-elect him - and he appointed a compliant and unqualified stooge to the director’s post. There are reports that Russians, egged on by Trump, are working to help Bernie Sanders become the Democratic Party presidential nominee because they believe he will be easier to beat than other opponents.
This is pure treason, but too many Americans won’t know about it because they prefer to lap up propaganda on TV and radio talk shows rather than take the trouble to read newspapers like the Times-Tribune, The New York Times and The Washington Post.
Shame on them. Shame on spineless Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for abetting Trump’s multiple betrayals of his oath of office.

A puzzling new act from rapping word nerd Zach Sherwin

Texto completo: Walking around an urban landscape is a different experience for Zach Sherwin than it is for most people. The comedian and rapper, who brings “The Crossword Show" to WBUR CitySpace Friday night for a sold-out show, has a special relationship with words.
“I do wordplay everything — any bit of text on a building or a billboard or wherever I see it, stuff happens compulsively," he says. "One of the kinds of wordplay that my mind does on autopilot is looking for rhymes in things."
His new stage show has given Sherwin an outlet for his compulsion. In it, he leads a group of guest solvers through a crossword puzzle with musical cues and comic clues. He gets to rap and spin connections between words into bits as his guests — on Friday they include comedians Kelly MacFarland, Nonye Brown-West, and WBUR reporter Jack Lepiarz — guess and ad-lib.
Each show revolves around one puzzle; four shows are in rotation on the current tour with a fifth edition on the way. Writing each show takes four to five months, Sherwin says. The more time he spends concentrating on writing raps and clues for the show, the less inclined his brain is to search out anagrams and puns the rest of the day. “Sometimes it would be almost oppressive, especially if I'd had a lot of coffee. It felt like, 'Ugh, turn it off, stop!' "
He comes by his love of words naturally. “I come from a bookish family," says Sherwin, a Brandeis graduate. “My grandmother did The New York Times crossword puzzle every day. My mom is a big reader. My uncles are big, big readers, English majors. People memorize poetry and perform it at Thanksgiving."
Before he took up comedy, Sherwin loved rap. “I think that's why I got into hip-hop, because it was so interesting verbally," he says. He started his career in Boston doing sketch comedy before establishing himself as a hip-hop comedian under the name MC Mr. Napkins. His lyrics were unusually erudite, expertly wrapping words like sphygmomanometers (a.k.a. blood pressure cuffs) around a beat and calling out “goose MCs" (in that rap he compares himself to hero pilot Captain “Sully" Sullenberger and proclaims other rappers as “goose MCs all up in my engines.")
He dropped the Napkins name when he moved to Los Angeles and started contributing to the Web series “Epic Rap Battles of History" and writing for Rachel Bloom's musical sitcom “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend." He has also released three albums of clever comic hip-hop.
“The Crossword Show" feels to Sherwin like a career-defining project. “It draws upon my experience with writing raps, doing comedy, being interested in wordplay and trivia," he says, “and also hosting, being like a friendly, almost camp counselor-y presence onstage, which is how I came to view myself. So this is the culmination, at least thus far, of all of the stuff that I've been working on all this time."
“The Crossword Show" arrived at a point when Sherwin had been feeling creatively stalled. He didn't have the appetite to write comedy raps anymore and never really considered himself a stand-up comedian, despite doing regular spots around Los Angeles without music. That's when he connected with crossword constructor Will Nediger through Twitter and began a collaboration that eventually spawned “Crossword." Now it's all he really wants to do.
“It is really, really clear that I have found my home, at least for now," he says.
The mechanics of the show are difficult to describe for those who haven't seen it. Sherwin says it's part game show, part variety show, part TED Talk, and part magic show. It starts with the across clues, which Sherwin introduces with a rap. The solvers then move on to the down clues, and another rap. For each word, Sherwin has written a series of riffs and digressions and worked with his producer on an accompanying slide presentation. As the game moves on, he attempts to tie the words together, which he describes as going down a “rabbit hole."
“By the end of the show," he says, “these strange, impossible to predict scenes and connections, like a web of links, begins to build between all the different words that the constructor built into their crossword puzzle. And it really just goes to cool places."
Those who aren't crossword aficionados needn't worry. Sherwin believes the format is unique, but it's built for a broad appeal. “Once you're in the room it all makes sense," he says. “It's so niche sounding, and yet, watching these audiences find the connection that I'm attempting to provide for them, it is the most meaningful thing as a performer that I've ever done. I just feel I'm putting everybody's brain in the room, plugging them into mine, and we all just float in that space for an hour and a half and everyone goes home. It's so great."

PEOPLE
An upcoming memoir by Woody Allen is being blasted by two of his children, daughter Dylan Farrow and author-journalist Ronan Farrow.
Dylan Farrow, who alleged Allen molested her as a child in the early 1990s, calls the upcoming release "deeply upsetting." Allen has denied any wrongdoing, and he was never charged after two investigations.
Grand Central Publishing, a division of Hachette Book Group, announced Monday that the book is called "Apropos of Nothing" and will be released April 7.
Allen's agreement with Hachette means that he shares a publisher with one of his biggest detractors, his son Ronan Farrow, whose "Catch and Kill" was released last year by the Hachette division Little, Brown and Co.
"Hachette's publishing of Woody Allen's memoir is deeply upsetting to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalized on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men," Dylan Farrow said in a statement late Monday.
Dylan Farrow added that she was never contacted by fact-checkers for the memoir: "This provides yet another example of the profound privilege that power, money and notoriety affords. Hachette's complicity in this should be called out for what it is and they should have to answer for it."
Her brother, Ronan, blasted his publisher in a statement posted on Twitter Tuesday night for its decision to publish Allen's memoir and not fact-check it with his sister. He also said he had no notice that Allen's book was forthcoming.
"It's wildly unprofessional in multiple obvious directions for Hachette to behave this way," said Farrow, who won a Pulitzer Prize along with reporters for the New York Times for his reporting for The New Yorker on Harvey Weinstein's sexual abuse of women.
An email message seeking comment from the Hachette labels Grand Central Publishing and Little, Brown and Co. were not immediately returned.
Domingo's name taken off Washington Opera program
Placido Domingo's name has been removed from the Washington National Opera's young artist program "in light of recent developments," the opera house announced Tuesday, after an independent investigation found the legendary tenor had sexually harassed women while holding senior positions at the company.
Domingo was the leading figure at the WNO from 1996-2011 as artistic director and later general director. He created the young artists program in 2002, and it was named the Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program after him and the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation.
Last week, the American Guild of Musical Artists, the main union that represents opera performers, said its four-month investigation had found the 79-year-old singer had "engaged in inappropriate activity, ranging from flirtation to sexual advances, in and outside of the workplace."

Trump won't extend spy powers without reforms, senator says

Texto completo: White House Roundup
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump told his attorney general and top GOP lawmakers he will not extend surveillance authorities that expire this month unless Congress sends him a bill that incorporates reforms, according to a senator present for the Tuesday night meeting at the White House.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has led efforts to curtail the federal government's ability to spy on Americans, said Trump "made it exceedingly clear" he will not accept a straight re-authorization of the surveillance provisions. Trump wants changes before he will sign the bill into law, Paul said.
"The president said he's not signing without something happening," Paul told reporters after the nearly 90-minute meeting with top lawmakers. "He pushed back very vigorously and said, 'We're not doing this.' "
At the White House, Attorney General William Barr made the case to the president that the Justice Department could make regulatory changes to satisfy the critics of the surveillance programs. Barr and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell want to simply renew the surveillance authority and work on reforms that eventually could be legislation. McConnell made his preference for that approach known at the meeting, those involved said.
President says he spoke to Taliban leader, had 'good talk'
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump confirmed Tuesday that he spoke on the phone to a Taliban leader, making him the first U.S. president believed to ever speak directly with the militant group that harbored al-Qaida before the 9/11 attacks and is responsible for the deaths of thousands of U.S. troops in nearly 19 years of fighting in Afghanistan.
"We had a very good conversation with the leader of the Taliban today, and they're looking to get this ended, and we're looking to get it ended. I think we all have a very common interest," Trump said. "We had, actually, a very good talk with the leader of the Taliban."
Tuesday's call, which the Taliban said lasted 35 minutes, came days after the United States and the Taliban signed an agreement calling for the withdrawal of American troops - allowing Trump to make progress on a key campaign pledge to extract the U.S. from what he calls "endless wars" and paving the way for all-Afghan talks to begin on Tuesday.
Trump campaign sues Washington Post over columns
President Donald Trump's campaign sued the Washington Post for defamation on Tuesday over two opinion columns published last year that alleged a connection between the campaign and Russian election interference.
The campaign sued the New York Times last week for another opinion column that had asserted such ties.
Legal experts say Trump stands little chance of prevailing in court in either case because libel laws extend a high degree of protection to published material about public figures and to opinion articles. Nevertheless, the campaign may be aiming to highlight its criticism of the mainstream media and to blunt suggestions that it colluded with Russian operatives.
The new lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, alleges that op-eds by Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman were false and defamatory.

Resumen: [...]it was when Bowey was on the faculty at Winona State University that he began to think about the power of media as a way to bridge social division. Basically, he hopes this combination of visual portraits and artistic language will create empathy, allowing viewers to suspend their judgment and be open to the story of another person. Bowey describes the evenings more as live theater, as he and members of the audience read the refugee stories accompanied by live music.

Texto completo: A national touring exhibit is currently on display at libraries in Arlington Heights and Palatine, and at multiple locations in Skokie. The same display ran last year in Schaumburg and Wheaton.
Its topic? Meeting immigrants and hearing their stories in a poignant photo exhibit titled "When Home Won’t Let You Stay: Stories of Refugees in America."
The images feature portraits of individuals accompanied by their first-person, poetic stories that give perspectives on their often hidden lives and compelling experiences as refugees now living in local communities.
Take a woman from Somalia named Samsam. In her story, she describes fleeing the killing and violence in Mogadishu that took the lives of her neighbors and cousins.
"Every day we were living in fear that something would happen to us," she says. "I couldn’t stay."
Another immigrant from Mogadishu, Mohamed I., described a terrorist who blew himself up in front of his medical school.
"The force knocked me down," he says. "A schoolmate lost his eyes. I wrapped my shirt around his head and held him."
The exhibit is the work of freelance photojournalist James Bowey, a Glen Ellyn native now based in Chicago. In the early part of his career, one of his assignments was to cover the war in Bosnia, which led to 15 years of capturing images of international poverty and conflict.
Over the years, his work has appeared in The New York Times, Time magazine and The Associated Press, among others. But it was when Bowey was on the faculty at Winona State University that he began to think about the power of media as a way to bridge social division.
"We’re in a world awash in more information, but we have even less understanding," Bowey says.
Beginning in 2015, he sensed a difference in the way people viewed immigrants, basically seeing them not as victims but as enemies and as people to be feared. His journalism instincts compelled him to explore the story.
He sought out immigrants through old-fashioned, shoe leather journalism and working with refugee organizations. That led to photo sessions in the immigrants’ homes. After hearing their stories, Bowey boiled them down into a type of poetry called found poems.
"For me," he says, "it’s a way to combine journalism and art."
Basically, he hopes this combination of visual portraits and artistic language will create empathy, allowing viewers to suspend their judgment and be open to the story of another person.
It certainly captures attention. At last year’s exhibit at the Schaumburg Township Public Library, officials there estimate more than 10,000 people viewed or interacted with the display.
A cornerstone of his exhibitions are the community receptions with Bowey that he insists accompany the photo display. The program at the Palatine Public Library, 700 N. North Court, takes place at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 4, while the one at the Arlington Memorial Library, 500 N. Dunton Ave., is at 7 p.m. March 20.
These are more than the traditional meet and greet at your local library. Bowey describes the evenings more as live theater, as he and members of the audience read the refugee stories accompanied by live music. He opens up the program to questions in the second hour.
"The conversations that result are often very powerful," Bowey says. "When you bring people together through stories, they break down division. There’s this artistic engagement that captures and promotes our empathy."
Officials at both the Arlington and Palatine libraries agree.
"We hope that our diverse community becomes more connected as they engage and empathize with the experiences shared in the photographs and stories," says Melissa Gardner, assistant director of the Palatine Public Library.
Ultimately, Bowey describes the exhibit as a project of hope and renewal that allows people to experience a sense of connection with others and imagine the possibility for a shared future.

"We hope that our diverse community becomes more connected as they engage and empathize with the experiences shared in the photographs and stories," says Melissa Gardner, assistant director of the Palatine Public Library.
Ultimately, Bowey describes the exhibit as a project of hope and renewal that allows people to experience a sense of connection with others and imagine the possibility for a shared future.

Texto completo: A national touring exhibit is currently on display at libraries in Arlington Heights and Palatine, and at multiple locations in Skokie. The same display ran last year in Schaumburg and Wheaton.
Its topic? Meeting immigrants and hearing their stories in a poignant photo exhibit titled "When Home Won’t Let You Stay: Stories of Refugees in America."
The images feature portraits of individuals accompanied by their first-person, poetic stories that give perspectives on their often hidden lives and compelling experiences as refugees now living in local communities.
Take a woman from Somalia named Samsam. In her story, she describes fleeing the killing and violence in Mogadishu that took the lives of her neighbors and cousins.
"Every day we were living in fear that something would happen to us," she says. "I couldn’t stay."
Another immigrant from Mogadishu, Mohamed I., described a terrorist who blew himself up in front of his medical school.
"The force knocked me down," he says. "A schoolmate lost his eyes. I wrapped my shirt around his head and held him."
The exhibit is the work of freelance photojournalist James Bowey, a Glen Ellyn native now based in Chicago. In the early part of his career, one of his assignments was to cover the war in Bosnia, which led to 15 years of capturing images of international poverty and conflict.
Over the years, his work has appeared in The New York Times, Time magazine and The Associated Press, among others. But it was when Bowey was on the faculty at Winona State University that he began to think about the power of media as a way to bridge social division.
"We’re in a world awash in more information, but we have even less understanding," Bowey says.
Beginning in 2015, he sensed a difference in the way people viewed immigrants, basically seeing them not as victims but as enemies and as people to be feared. His journalism instincts compelled him to explore the story.
He sought out immigrants through old-fashioned, shoe leather journalism and working with refugee organizations. That led to photo sessions in the immigrants’ homes. After hearing their stories, Bowey boiled them down into a type of poetry called found poems.
"For me," he says, "it’s a way to combine journalism and art."
Basically, he hopes this combination of visual portraits and artistic language will create empathy, allowing viewers to suspend their judgment and be open to the story of another person.
It certainly captures attention. At last year’s exhibit at the Schaumburg Township Public Library, officials there estimate more than 10,000 people viewed or interacted with the display.
A cornerstone of his exhibitions are the community receptions with Bowey that he insists accompany the photo display. The program at the Palatine Public Library, 700 N. North Court, takes place at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 4, while the one at the Arlington Memorial Library, 500 N. Dunton Ave., is at 7 p.m. March 20.
These are more than the traditional meet and greet at your local library. Bowey describes the evenings more as live theater, as he and members of the audience read the refugee stories accompanied by live music. He opens up the program to questions in the second hour.
"The conversations that result are often very powerful," Bowey says. "When you bring people together through stories, they break down division. There’s this artistic engagement that captures and promotes our empathy."
Officials at both the Arlington and Palatine libraries agree.
"We hope that our diverse community becomes more connected as they engage and empathize with the experiences shared in the photographs and stories," says Melissa Gardner, assistant director of the Palatine Public Library.
Ultimately, Bowey describes the exhibit as a project of hope and renewal that allows people to experience a sense of connection with others and imagine the possibility for a shared future.

Texto completo: I've long thought that the human body was not meant to run on empty, that fasting was done mainly for religious reasons or political protest. Otherwise we needed a reliably renewed source of fuel to function optimally, mentally, emotionally and physically.
But prompted by recent enthusiasm for fasting among people concerned about their health, weight or longevity, I looked into the evidence for possible benefits -- and risks -- of what researchers call intermittent fasting. Popular regimens range from ingesting few if any calories all day every other day or several times a week to fasting for 16 hours or more every day.
A man I know in his early 50s said he had lost 12 pounds in about two months on what he calls the 7-11 diet: He eats nothing from 7 p.m. until 11 a.m. the next day, every day.
I was skeptical, but it turns out there is something to be said for practicing a rather prolonged daily fast, preferably one lasting at least 16 hours. Mark P. Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, explained that the liver stores glucose, which the body uses for energy before it turns to burning body fat.
"It takes 10 to 12 hours to use up the calories in the liver before a metabolic shift occurs to using stored fat," Mattson said. After meals, glucose is used for energy and fat is stored in fat tissue, but during fasts, once glucose is depleted, fat is broken down and used for energy.
Most people trying to lose weight should strive for 16 calorie-free hours, he said, adding that "the easiest way to do this is to stop eating by 8 p.m., skip breakfast the next morning and then eat again at noon the next day." (Caffeine-dependent people can have sugar-free black coffee or tea before lunch.) But don't expect to see results immediately; it can take up to four weeks to notice an effect, he said.
Mattson and his colleague at the aging institute Rafael de Cabo recently reviewed the effects of intermittent fasting on health, aging and disease in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Their article was prompted by frequent questions patients are asking their doctors about the health effects of fasting. Given their limited knowledge of nutrition, doctors are often unable to advise their patients, Mattson said.
Although a number of recent studies have assessed the effects of intermittent fasting on people, none are long term, and the vast majority of disease-related findings stem from research on laboratory animals. For example, in an animal model of stroke, those fed only intermittently suffered less brain damage because they were better able to resist the stress of oxygen and energy deprivation.
Other animal studies have shown a "robust disease-modifying" benefit of intermittent fasting on "a wide range of chronic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers and neurodegenerative brain diseases," the researchers reported. Their review of both animal and human studies found improvements in a variety of health indicators and a slowing or reversing of aging and disease processes.
For example, human studies of intermittent fasting found that it improved such disease indicators as insulin resistance, blood fat abnormalities, high blood pressure and inflammation, even independently of weight loss. In patients with multiple sclerosis, intermittent fasting reduced symptoms in just two months, a research team in Baltimore reported in 2018.
If you think evolutionarily, Mattson said, predators in the wild fight for prey in the fasting state and are better at recovering from injuries. The human counterpart -- people who evolved in feast-or-famine environments -- would not have survived unless somehow protected by fasting.
"Our human ancestors did not consume three regularly spaced large meals, plus snacks, every day, nor did they live a sedentary life," the researchers wrote. The studies they analyzed showed that "most if not all organ systems respond to intermittent fasting in ways that enable the organism to tolerate or overcome the challenge" and then return to normal.
Mattson explained that during a fast, the body produces few new proteins, prompting cells to take protein from nonessential sources, break them down and use the amino acids to make new proteins that are essential for survival. Then, after eating, a lot of new proteins are produced in the brain and elsewhere.
A reasonable question might be, "How safe is intermittent fasting?" When fats are used for energy, they produce substances called ketone bodies that "regulate the expression and activity of many proteins and molecules that are known to influence health and aging," the researchers reported. Ketosis, a buildup of acidic ketones in the blood, is a state that the Atkins diet, the ketogenic diet and other carbohydrate-restricted diets aim to achieve. Taken to extremes, however, ketosis can damage the liver, kidneys and brain and is especially dangerous to people with various chronic disorders like diabetes and heart disease.
Another important question is, "How practical is intermittent fasting?" Not very, especially in its early weeks or for people with limited control over their mealtimes.
"Many people will experience hunger, irritability and a reduced ability to concentrate during periods of food restrictions," the researchers wrote. They added, however, that these side effects usually disappear within a month.
How well this diet might work for you may depend largely on your usual pre-diet snacking and drinking habits and the kinds and amounts of foods you consume during the nonfasting hours. Knowing you cannot eat at all for a prescribed period may prompt some people to cram in whatever they want during the eating window, regardless of its nutritional value.
Mattson warned intermittent dieters to "eat healthy foods, including whole grains, healthy fats and protein, limit saturated fats and avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates. And on fasting days, stay well-hydrated." He also suggested a gradual decrease over four months in the hours and days of restricted eating and in the amount of calories consumed on fasting days.

Texto completo: The Chicago Tribune's Critic's Choice Dining Awards honor the chefs who made 2019 so deliciously memorable. The lineup of excellence begins with our Chef of the Year, Erick Williams, and continues with impressive newcomers, ambitious veterans and at least two separate comeback stories. \
CHEF OF THE YEAR
Erick Williams, Virtue
It's no exaggeration to say that Erick Williams owned 2019. His Hyde Park restaurant, Virtue, won a three-star review from this critic, was named one of the country's best new restaurants by Eater in July, and one of the Best New Restaurants in America by Esquire magazine in November.
In between, he was included in a New York Times story on "16 Black Chefs Changing Food in America," and received the Tribune's annual Game Changer award. Last week, he was named a semifinalist for the James Beard Foundation's Best Chef: Great Lakes award.
All this while keeping his restaurant humming along, and maintaining grace and humility in the face of relentless praise.

ROOKIE OF THE YEAR
Mariya Russell, Kumiko, Kikko
You can't help cheering for a chef who's put in charge of a kitchen for the very first time and proceeds to turn the opportunity into a Michelin star, and just last week, became a semifinalist for Best Chef: Great Lakes by the James Beard Foundation. Mariya Russell worked with Noah Sandoval at the late Senza and four-star Oriole before being named chef de cuisine at Kumiko and, four months later at Kikko, the intimate omakase bar built in Kumiko's basement. Diners have two ways of enjoying Russell's food -- either the a la carte bites menu upstairs (matched to Julia Momose's cocktail wizardry) or the 12-course menu downstairs, where you can watch the chef in action. There's no wrong choice.

PASTRY CHEF OF THE YEAR
Craig Harzewski, Brindille
Whether I've dined at Naha (for all of its 18 years) or Brindille (seven years and counting), one delightful constant has been the superior work by Craig Harzewski. Harzewski fashions complex, art-gallery-worthy desserts that never lose sight of the sheer joy of eating them, whether he's creating feather-soft clafoutis, chocolate cremeux with hazelnut spongecake, or a custardy blancmange with star-anise sorbet. All this while overseeing a terrific savory bread program. (I'm not the only voice praising Harzewski's work; earlier this year, the Jean Banchet Awards named Harzewski its Pastry Chef of the Year.) One of the many reasons to look forward to Carrie and Michael Nahabedian's Naha 2.0, or whatever it will be named, is that Harzewski will have yet another outlet for his artistry.

COMEBACK OF THE YEAR
Carlos Gaytan, Tzuco
The talented Carlos Gaytan abruptly lost his 10-year-old Mexique restaurant in 2018, a reversal of fortune that sent the chef back to Mexico, where he created Ha, a highly regarded restaurant in Playa del Carmen. But Gaytan appeared periodically in town, at events such as Chicago Gourmet, in the interim, and by September he was back for good with Tzuco, a restaurant named after Gaytan's hometown of Huitzuco, and proceeded to take the Chicago dining scene by storm (Tzuco was just named a semifinalist for Best New Restaurant by the JBF). Here was Gaytan at his finest, cooking with a stronger sense of place than the fusion dishes that characterized Mexique, and demonstrating that, despite many setbacks, that talent will out.

RAISING THE SUSHI BAR
B.K. Park, Mako
Since 1999, B.K. Park has been synonymous with sushi excellence in Chicago, thanks to his work at Mirai, Arami and Juno restaurants, but he exceeded even his own standards with the opening of Mako, an intimate, 22-seat temple where Park's near-silent ministrations can be viewed up close. At $175, Park's 16-course omakase menus are beyond the reach of many, but watching Park working in front of a black-and-gold background is like viewing a stage performance, and a brilliant one at that.

THE ENGAGING SUSHI CHEF
Otto Phan, Kyoten
Sushi dining can be as solemn as a religious rite, silent but for the occasional brief explanation of what the chef just handed you. Otto Phan shattered that mold when he moved here from Austin, Texas, in search of a bigger stage and -- he's not shy about saying so -- Michelin recognition. To dine at Phan's Kyoten is to enter a culinary conversation with a chef who cracks jokes, solicits on-the-fly feedback and happily explains the thinking behind his fish sourcing and rice selection. "I want every bite to be a home run," Phan says. Usually, it is. Phan didn't land a Michelin star his first year out, but just you wait.

KEEPING THE FIRE BURNING
Carmen Lemons and Lynn Walker Harvey, Lem's Bar-B-Q
The history of Lem's Bar-B-Q and the legendary Lemons brothers goes back for decades (indeed, the business celebrated its 65th year last summer), but when the last brother, the great pitmaster James Lemons, died in 2015, his daughters were there to keep the torch aloft. Owner Carmen Lemons and sister, Lynn Walker Harvey, who began working at Lem's at 20 years old, not only have maintained the restaurant's sky-high standards, they've also worked to improve the place, completing a five-month renovation (remarkably, without shutting down) featuring new cabinetry, quartz tiles and doors. Eventually, the duo hopes to bring Lem's famed sauce, seasoning and hot links to retail markets. So many iconic Chicago operations vanish once the founder steps down or passes on. It's rare for someone to step up and keep the flame burning, and more rare to see it done this well.

PERFECT TIMING
Gene Kato, Momotaro
When opening chef Mark Hellyar resigned from Momotaro for family reasons, owners Kevin Boehm and Rob Katz wasted little time reaching out to Gene Kato, who had returned east after the closing of his Sumi Robata Bar. "The whole time I was in Charlotte (North Carolina), I was trying to get back," Kato said, and he quickly repacked his bags. In what has proved to be an ideal pairing, Momotaro was able to maintain its reputation as Chicago's finest Japanese restaurant, while Kato got the high-profile gig he has long deserved. Not to mention the backing for a new project, the Japanese-Italian Momotaro Italia, opening later this year (fingers crossed), and a Best Chef: Great Lakes nod (semifinalist) by the James Beard Foundation.

Texto completo: "You ask me what life is," wrote the great Russian playwright Anton Chekhov. "That's like asking what a carrot is. A carrot is a carrot, and there's nothing more to know." Well, Anton, I think there's a lot more that can be said and known about the matter.
Almost everyone loves a carrot, from toddlers clutching the little batons to grown-ups at holiday feasts, where a gleaming platter of roasted carrots radiates a deeper, more complex type of sweetness. I can't think of another vegetable with such wide appeal.
Such a treat are they, indeed, that they're the symbolic "reward" dangling off the end of so many "punishment" sticks. "Turnip and stick," "parsnip and stick": They just don't have quite the same ring -- or the same vivid, bold, happy-making color, being the white, gnarly roots that they are.
Originally, orange wasn't the predominant color for carrots; they could have equally been white, purple, dark red or black. In Holland, where orange carrots became popular in the 16th and 17th centuries, the proliferation was mythologized as a show of support to William of Orange, who ushered a revolt against the Spanish that brought about Dutch independence. Many a geneticist, however, would identify carrots' recessive gene, and selective breeding, as explaining the predominance of the orange variety.
The myths are not just political. They're biological as well. Carrots are credited with making hair on little heads curl and, of course, being able to grant the ultimate super power: being able to see in the dark. Although all the beta carotene (a vitamin A precursor) in carrots does not help keep eyes healthy, the origins of the somewhat exaggerated claims can be traced back to World War II when the Royal Air Force was trying to divert the Germans from learning of its plans to develop radar technology. The Germans were, so the story goes, made to believe that all the carrots the British pilots were eating helped them see so well at night.
Myths, legends, baton sticks, regal weapons or revolutionary tool notwithstanding, carrots will always be a majestic vegetable for me. I love the fact that they hold their shape so well and that they don't lose their vivid orange color when subjected to heat. These wonderful abilities to retain color, shape and texture are really what this recipe is all about.
Nestled on a bed of yogurt or labneh, and green oil, the carrots jump out in their vibrancy and sharp form. This contrast is echoed in the textures -- creamy yogurt, tender carrots and crunchy dukkah -- as well as in a subtler flavor contrast of sweet and sharp.

Grilled carrots with yogurt, carrot-top oil and dukkah
You can serve these carrots with Greek yogurt, or with homemade labneh, if you start the night before (see tip below). This recipe calls for making your own dukkah: You'll have more than you need, but keep any leftovers in a sealed container to sprinkle over salads, grilled meat or fish. A bunch of carrots from your farmers' market will work best here, but you can also use regular carrots that have been halved or quartered lengthwise. If you can't find bunches of carrots with their fresh tops, you can prepare the oil using parsley instead, or double the tarragon for an even more herbaceous version.

Makes: 4 servings
Total time: 1 hour

For the carrots and carrot-top oil:
2 1/4 pounds (6-inch) carrots with greens attached
3/4 cup roughly chopped fresh tarragon leaves
1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons honey (runny honey)
1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 2/3 cups full-fat Greek yogurt

For the dukkah:
1/4 cup blanched hazelnuts, toasted
1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted
2 tablespoons coriander seeds, toasted
1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons black and white sesame seeds, toasted
1 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

1. Wash and peel the carrots and trim the tops, leaving about 1 inch of the greens attached. Measure out 1 packed cup leafy carrot tops and wash well. Squeeze out as much water as possible, and pat dry. Roughly chop the carrot tops then transfer them to a blender.
2. Add the tarragon, 6 1/2 tablespoons oil and a small pinch of salt. Blitz until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as needed, then transfer the mixture to a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl. Strain the mixture, extracting as much oil as possible. (You should have about 3 tablespoons.) Discard the solids.
3. Meanwhile, prepare a steamer for your carrots by heating water in your steamer or setting a colander over a large pot with a few inches of simmering water. Once ready, add the carrots and steam for 10 minutes, or until you can easily pierce the thick parts with a knife but the carrots are not overly soft. Transfer the carrots to a large, shallow dish along with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, plus 1/2 teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper. Toss to combine.
4. In a large bowl, whisk the honey, vinegar and a tiny pinch of salt. Set aside.
5. Make the dukkah: Add all the dukkah ingredients to a food processor and pulse a few times until the nuts are roughly chopped. (You should have 1 scant cup.)
6. Heat a well-oiled grill pan over high. Working in a few batches to avoid overcrowding, grill the carrots on all sides, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer the grilled carrots to the bowl with the honey dressing, and toss gently to combine.
7. Season the yogurt with 1/4 teaspoon salt, then spread it out on a large platter. Drizzle all over with the carrot-top oil then add the carrots, arranging them artfully so they're all facing the same direction. Spoon a generous amount of dukkah on top and pass the rest.
Tips: To make your own labneh, combine 2 3/4 cups plain full-fat yogurt with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a medium bowl. Transfer the mixture to a colander lined with cheesecloth or a clean tea towel, folding the overhang over the yogurt. Place the colander over a larger bowl and top with a couple of cans or other heavy items to apply weight to the mixture. Refrigerate overnight or up to 48 hours, then squeeze out any excess liquid and transfer the labneh to a container.

US-UK trade deal vital? Nope

Texto completo: When Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain used to talk about a new trade agreement with the United States, he often fell into the baroque language -- "massive," "fantastic," "enormous" -- of President Donald Trump, the man he figured would be sitting across the bargaining table from him.
Trump has not dialed back his tone about the deal's potential -- it would be "magnificent," he promised when the two men met at the United Nations last September -- but Johnson certainly has, a reflection of both economic and political reality.
As his government laid out its objectives for the negotiations with Washington on Monday, Johnson emphasized instead the points Britain would not give up in a negotiation -- chief among them, food safety and the sanctity of the country's National Health Service. He did not play up the Texas-size windfall from a deal, as he once did when he sold it as a lucrative fringe benefit of Brexit.
"We're going to drive a hard bargain to boost British industry," Johnson said. "Trading Scottish smoked salmon for Stetson hats, we will deliver lower prices and more choice for our shoppers."
In its negotiating blueprint, Johnson's government predicted that even if the talks were successful, an American deal would expand the British economy, at most, by 0.16% by the middle of the next decade.
This more circumspect tone reflects the realization that a trade deal with the United States was always going to be far less important for Britain than its parallel talks with the European Union, given their greater trade and closer integration.
As the trans-Atlantic talks get underway, the politics of a deal are becoming complicated on both sides of the ocean.
The presidential election in the United States means that Congress is highly unlikely to approve a trade deal with Britain, even if Johnson and Trump sign one before November.
In Britain, Johnson's free-spending domestic agenda -- recruiting nurses and police officers, building high-speed broadband and rail networks -- offers a bigger political payoff than easing tariffs on Scotch whisky.
"This isn't the No. 1 priority that people thought it was going to be," said Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Center for European Reform. "From Johnson's point of view, it makes more sense to focus on the domestic economy."
Johnson's priorities became clear last month when he agreed, over the objections of the United States, to allow the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei to supply equipment to Britain's 5G broadband network.
Even leaving aside Huawei, some experts question how much of an economic incentive there is to do a deal. The United States is not trying to recast an unbalanced relationship as the Trump administration is doing in its negotiations with China. The United States currently runs a $5.5 billion surplus with Britain in goods, and $13.3 billion in services -- numbers that would normally make Trump smile.
Both countries are competitive in industries such as finance and digital services; executives in those industries say they could benefit writing rules looser than those of the European Union. But Britain must still decide whether to tax American firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon.
The Trump administration will push to reduce barriers to its farm products and press the National Health Service to pay more for American drugs -- both of which raise vexing political issues in Britain.

How to buy wine: 5 questions to ask

Autor: Asimov, Eric.

Texto completo: The act of buying wine can rank high among life's unpleasant tasks.
It's not a physical or mental issue so much as a psychological one. We're just talking about a bottle of wine, after all, first among first-world problems. But often the act of selecting that bottle is fraught with the fear of making a mistake, of wasting money and of appearing foolish in front of other people.
With the barest effort, you can simplify the entire procedure of selecting a wine while feeling better about it. It's simply a matter of confidence.
It's an assurance that allows you, without fear, to put trust in the people whose job it is to help you, and a faith that wine is not a measure of character, but a vehicle for pleasure. Developing that confidence is simply a matter of taking the measure of your aims and desires, and then communicating them to the people who matter.
Here are five questions that will improve your chances, whether in a restaurant or retail shop, of always getting a satisfying bottle.
1. What's the occasion?
Understanding the purpose of the bottle and its meaning to you is crucial. Start with a basic question: Are you buying a wine to accompany a meal? Or just to drink while hanging out with friends?
If it's for hanging out, you know it's something casual, a background voice that will enhance the socializing without intruding or interfering. If it's to go with a meal, what sort of meal? The nature of the event dictates the sort of wine that will be best.
We tend to imagine that all wines are evaluated on a universal scale of quality, but in fact each occasion has its own scale. The best wine for one sort of event can be very different from the preferred bottle for another.
For example, are you joining friends at a restaurant for no other purpose than to catch up on one another's lives? That's a worthy occasion, but it doesn't necessarily suggest a memorable bottle the way a 30th birthday celebration might, or a wedding anniversary. Instead, it calls for a wine that makes people happy, promoting the casual joy of gathering with friends rather than concentrating the mind on a life marker.
This may not seem intuitive, because we have been taught to think about wine rationally, and to describe it in terms of detectable aromas and flavors. But it's more effective to consider the emotions that an event conjures, and find a wine that matches.
Wine professionals such as sommeliers and retail merchants are skilled at translating emotions to wines. Articulating those emotions is a first step to gaining a satisfying bottle.
2. How much do I want to spend?
This is the bottom line, a crucial determination that can only be made individually, depending on your bank account and where wine figures in your life's priorities. The only shame comes in not facing this question squarely, and later regretting it.
It's important to understand that no direct correlation exists between the price of a bottle and the quality of a wine. Spending more may buy status and scarcity, but that may not translate into quality. Yet, it's equally wrong to think that expensive bottles are never worth it. It's again a question of pairing bottle to occasion.
Generally speaking, for ordinary drinking, I believe the best ratio of price and quality at wine shops is in the range of $15 to $25. For many reasons, this price range does not translate easily to restaurant wine lists.
While responsible restaurants will generally charge two to two-and-a-half times the retail price, cheaper bottles tend to be marked up more than expensive bottles.
But I do think that if a meal is a special occasion, your wine outlay should rise, too. If you are spending $40 a person at a trattoria, a bottle of wine for $50 or so would not be unreasonable. At a more expensive place, you would also spend more for the wine.
The important thing, however, is to plan, pick a reasonable budget and stick to the spirit of it.
3. What do I like?
This is perhaps the hardest question of all, and one that can be answered only with experience. Even then, it can be hard to put into words.
One hint: Try to be as general as possible. "I love rich, fruity reds," allows far more leeway than, "I love wines that taste like creme de cassis, with a core of plum essence and hints of shiso."
Developing a vocabulary for describing wine is not easy. Tastes and smells can vary widely. One person's strawberry is another's cherry. But the term "red fruit," or just "fruity," conveys a message that a more specific reference may not.
Perhaps other elements, beyond the flavors, are important. We've already referred to emotions. You may also care how grapes are farmed and how wine is made. All of these factors are important to keep in mind.
Using modern tools might be a better solution than relying on a personal vocabulary. Take photos of the labels of wines you like, as well as those you don't. Store them separately in your phone so you don't confuse the two. It may perhaps be easier to convey your taste by displaying these photos than by trying to verbalize it. Or you can use an app such as Vivino as an organizational tool.
4. What am I eating?
No, wine does not always have to go with food. But wine is at its best as part of a meal, whether at a restaurant or at home. So it pays to select bottles that will go well with what's being served.
It's far simpler when choosing a wine for home consumption, when everybody is generally eating the same meal. The cooking tends to be less nuanced, and generalized pairings tend to work just fine.
Despite all the ink devoted to precise food-and-wine pairings, most people are satisfied with combinations that do not clash. That is, as long as the food does not ruin the wine, or vice versa, it's good enough not to warrant undue fussing.
The exceptions would be old, rare or fragile wines, which require more thought, and perfectionist personalities, whose obsession with transcendence can interfere with their appreciation of the good.
Restaurants are another matter. A party of four may order four contrasting dishes, making it a challenge to choose a wine that will satisfy everybody. Luckily, most restaurants with even decent wine selections have a wine professional to help you select a bottle.
5. Can you give me some guidance?
With an idea of the occasion, the budget, your taste and the food, now it's time to ask for help.
A good shop or a restaurant will always have somebody who is fervent about wine and ardent about hospitality. They want you to be happy enough to return.
In a store, you need to define your mission. Are you browsing without purpose, always a pleasure for wine lovers? Stocking up on reds or whites? Building a home cellar? Or maybe you're shopping for dinner tonight.
Whichever your aim, enlist help. If nobody knows much about wine -- and believe me, I've seen plenty of shops like that -- go somewhere else. Finding the best possible store, with a helpful staff and wide selection, is paramount.
Restaurants present a clearer situation. If you want wine to match the food, you need to decide first what you are going to eat. For a party of four, this may take some time. Don't allow yourself to be rushed into ordering before you are ready, though you may want an aperitif or cocktail while you ponder.
When you are ready, ask to speak to the sommelier. Give the details of your order, and your budget, and ask for a couple of recommendations. It may be that you will want a bottle with the appetizers and another with the main course, or perhaps one bottle will do. That part is up to you.

Texto completo: Many iPhone owners believe Apple purposely slowed down their old devices as it released new ones. Now some of them might be in line for a small payday: Apple has agreed to pay some iPhone owners about $25 each to settle such complaints.
Under a proposed settlement disclosed Friday, Apple agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of intentionally slowing down certain iPhones years after they were released. The settlement requires a federal judge's approval. A decision is expected to take several months.
On Monday, an Apple spokeswoman pointed to court documents in which the company denied the allegations and agreed to the settlement to avoid costly litigation.
In late 2017, customers publicly complained that they believed Apple was engaged in planned obsolescence -- intentionally slowing its older phones as it released new models. In response, Apple said software on certain older iPhones sometimes reduced their processing power when the battery was low to prevent them from abruptly shutting down.
That statement angered many customers, and Apple sharply cut the cost of replacing old iPhones' batteries, even making it free for some devices.
A group of Apple customers then sued. The two sides fought in court for two years before agreeing to the proposed settlement last week.
Apple would pay from $310 million to $500 million, depending on how many customers filed claims. Customers are expected to receive $25 per eligible device they owned.
Eligible devices include any iPhone 6, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus and SE that ran iOS 10.2.1 or later, or any iPhone 7 or 7 Plus that ran iOS 11.2 or later.

Texto completo: The cast of the cult TV comedy "Schitt's Creek," now in its sixth and final season on Pop TV and Netflix, will bring "Schitt's Creek: The Farewell Tour" to Hard Rock Live at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood on May 22.
Reserved-seat tickets will cost $155, $100, $70 and $50 and go on sale 10 a.m. Friday, at MyHRL.com. A venue presale will begin at 10 a.m. Wednesday through the Seminole Hard Rock Hollywood's Facebook and Twitter pages.
The event will join fans with "Schitt's Creek" cast members, including series creators Eugene Levy and son Daniel Levy, for an interactive evening that explores the making of the series with behind-the-scenes footage and stories. Also appearing will be Catherine O'Hara, Annie Murphy, Emily Hampshire and Noah Reid.
"Schitt's Creek" follows the rich and pampered Rose family after their wealth suddenly vanishes, forcing them to move into a downtrodden motel in Schitt's Creek, a small backwoods town they once bought as a joke.
In a lengthy January profile of "Schitt's Creek" and its four Emmy nominations, The New York Times acknowledged that "thanks to a daffy charm - a winning combination of its characters' caustic wit and the show's fundamental warmth - and enthusiastic word-of-mouth support, the series rose from humble origins to the pinnacle of TV acclaim."

Texto completo: Writing about the problem of misinformation from
U.S. government and health officials during the 1918 flu pandemic, Barry noted
that the public became suspicious of all information: "without leadership, without the truth, trust evaporated."
As concerns grow about the new coronavirus, COVID-19, the public needs to trust that they're getting accurate information about it to follow recommendations for slowing the spread. In his 2017 Smithsonian essay about the 1918 flu pandemic, historian John Barry wrote that when the world faces the next pandemic, "the effectiveness of interventions will depend on public compliance, and the public will have to trust what it is being told ... The most important lesson from 1918 is to tell the truth. Though that idea is incorporated into every preparedness plan I know of, its actual implementation will depend on the character and leadership of the people in charge when a crisis erupts."
The spread of COVID-19 motivated me to learn more about the 1918 flu pandemic that resulted in the deaths of millions of people around the world, possibly as many as 100 million. I read Barry's article "How the Horrific 1918 Flu Spread Across America" and Allison Meier's 2019 article "The 1918 Parade That Spread Death" to learn more. Both put the impact of that pandemic in perspective by describing how 12,000 people died in Philadelphia in a period of just six weeks in 1918.
How did it spread so quickly in Philadelphia in particular? Here's the simplified timeline: a few sailors with the virus arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in September of 1918. Within days 600 sailors had it.
About 10 days later, a patriotic rally and parade to raise money for the war brought 200,000 Philadelphians to mingle in the streets. Within a few days after that gathering, every hospital bed in the city was occupied with people suffering from the flu. Reverend Thomas Brennan recorded what he saw at Holy Cross Cemetery during the pandemic, writing, "Who can describe the scenes that met the eye during these harrowing days? Animus meminisse horret luctuque refugit" (meaning, "my soul shudders at the recollection.")
But why, knowing that the deadly disease was spreading so quickly, did the city allow the rally to go on? In the days just before the parade, why did the head of Philadelphia's Naval Hospital tell newspapers that, "there is no cause for further alarm. We believe we have it well in hand."
Barry explains that part of the answer to this puzzle is that Congress passed the Sedition Act in May of 1918, making it a crime with a possible sentence of up to 20 years to "utter, print, write or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form of government of the United States...or to urge, incite, or advocate any curtailment of production in this country of anything or things ... necessary or essential to the prosecution of the war." Government propaganda instructed Americans to report to the Justice Department anyone "who spreads pessimistic stories ... cries for peace, or belittles our effort to win the war."
In this wartime atmosphere, some public health officials tried to keep morale high at the cost of truth. Shortly before the parade, newspapers reported that Philadelphia's public health director, Wilmer Krusen, said he had "no concern whatever" about his ability to "nip the epidemic in the bud." He ignored doctors' pleas to call off the rally. Doctors tried sending letters to newspapers, but editors wouldn't print their letters, or stories based on the doctors' warnings.
Writing about the problem of misinformation from U.S. government and health officials during the 1918 flu pandemic, Barry noted that the public became suspicious of all information: "without leadership, without the truth, trust evaporated."
Learning about mistakes made in Philadelphia in 1918 makes me ponder the situation we find ourselves in now, with the new coronavirus.
Earlier this week, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the Center for Disease Control's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said of the virus that "it's not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness ... We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread among close contacts ... The goal here is to slow entry of this virus into the United States."
President Trump reacted to these facts with tweets suggesting there's a widespread conspiracy among the media and Democrats to weaponize the outbreak to hurt him politically. He tweeted, "low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) & @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Coronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible. Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action. USA in great shape!"
Then, during a press conference Wednesday about the virus, President Trump claimed, "We're rapidly developing a vaccine ... In speaking to the doctors we think this is something that we can develop fairly rapidly." In fact, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that a vaccine won't be ready for 12 to 18 months, and that's only if trials taking place now succeed.
During that same press conference, Trump announced that he is charging Vice President Mike Pence with leading the national COVID-19 response, asserting that Pence "has a certain talent for this." However, as a former governor of Indiana, Pence oversaw a rural HIV outbreak that spread to epidemic proportions when he slow-walked approval for needle exchanges. It became a case study in what not to do during a public health emergency. During the press conference, Trump noted that he was also requesting $2.5 billion to respond to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The scramble to assign unqualified people to carry out the U.S. response to the virus and to fund that response is happening because the Trump administration has hollowed out the government agencies needed for pandemic prevention and response. For instance, the executive branch team charged with coordinating a response to a pandemic was eliminated by the Trump administration in 2018. With regard to funding, there have been significant funding cuts to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under Trump. In 2018, the CDC's funding for global disease outbreak prevention was cut by 80 percent. The result was that the CDC canceled its work in 39 of 49 countries – including China – to prevent infectious-disease threats from becoming epidemics.
In a step sure to further erode public trust, the day after Trump's press conference the New York Times reported that Mike Pence will be vetting all statements about the COVID-19 situation coming from government health officials and scientists.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation's leading experts on infectious diseases who has advised half a dozen presidents on public health crises, was scheduled to go on five talk shows this coming Sunday. According to news reports today, Friday February 28, Dr. Fauci canceled all five appearances."

Texto completo: Things spreading across the globe: coronavirus, the lies being told by Democrats about it and liberal cheerleading when something bad happens because of it.
The virus, thankfully, hasn't yet spread broadly in the United States (although it is reasonable to assume that many more cases will emerge in the coming weeks). But that hasn't stopped the American left from saying outlandish things about the Trump Administration's response.
Joe Biden, who claims to be the antithesis to Trump's dishonesty, tried to incite public panic while campaigning in South Carolina.
"We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. ... (Trump's) wiped all that out. ... He cut the funding for the entire effort," Biden said, harkening back to his days as Barack Obama's vice president.
Not to be outdone, Mike Bloomberg, who claims to be the antithesis to Trump's incompetence, went even further:
"There's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. And (Trump's)...defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing."
These candidates, united by a reckless disregard for truth and responsible public rhetoric during a public health emergency, should be ashamed of their galactically irresponsible remarks. The Trump Administration has not "wiped out" or "defunded" the CDC or the National Institutes for Health. Further, there are several experts figuring out "what the hell" to do.
According to the Associated Press, funding has increased for both agencies during the Trump Administration, and the experts in charge have earned praise from across the political spectrum: Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director, is so good Hollywood based a movie on her work, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the NIH's infectious disease head, has advised six presidents.
It is outrageous that leading Democrats would so brazenly lie to the public about the American government's response. But who will hold them accountable? Let's check in with our national newspaper of record, The New York Times:
"Let's call it Trumpvirus," blared a headline atop a column written by Gail Collins, one of the paper's most well-known writers. Columnist Paul Krugman, also using the "Trumpvirus" label, excitedly tweeted "Dow 25,000!" as the stock market tanked.
Other corners of the American left, ever disdainful of organized religion, pounded Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump tasked with leading the government's response. As governor of Indiana, Pence once said he wanted to pray about a controversial needle exchange program in response to an outbreak of HIV/AIDS in his state. And a photo of his coronavirus task force with heads bowed in prayer earned widespread scorn, with one New York Times Magazine contributor tweeting that America is "so screwed."
I wonder: Do the liberals hammering Pence have the same thoughts about Democratic presidential candidates attending Bloody Sunday church services in Selma this past weekend?
As if we needed another reminder, Donald Trump has broken these people. Absolutely broken them. A virus jumps from an animal to a human halfway around the world and the liberal intelligentsia tries to name it after the American president, cheerleads a decline in the retirement fortunes of millions of Americans and crusades against basic religious practices.
There is no high-minded, we-are-all-in-this-together alternative to Trump. There is no paragon of honesty or virtue or competence waiting to turn the American presidency into a new season of "The West Wing." There is just a disgustingly disloyal opposition, whose happiest recent days were brought on by a global pandemic.
But even as his opposition grows more irresponsible, Trump is not absolved of the need for an accurate, clear and sober public message. He should not minimize the risk or engage in his usual hyperbole. This is where the rubber hits the road on public trust, and Trump needs to get it exactly right or face extreme political damage.
His best course is to simply be calm and honest: More people will get this virus, some will die, and washing your hands is a good way to stay healthy. The administration should give routine updates on progress toward a vaccine, mortality rates and travel advice. And he should put experts like Schuchat and Fauci on TV as much as possible.
There's no room for error, and Democrats have already crossed the line. If Trump gets his coronavirus response right, it would represent a major turning point in how the public views his honesty and competence heading into the November election.

Getting quite sick of media hype

Texto completo: Two weeks ago, I was happily sailing on a huge cruise ship in the Indian Ocean.
My wife Collen is a travel agent and I was tagging along with her and her group on a Celebrity Cruise Line ship as it sailed from Dubai to Singapore and back with 2,300 souls aboard. Everyone on board our ship knew what was happening that same week to the unlucky people stuck on the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked offshore Tokyo.
Because a passenger who left Diamond Princess nine days earlier in Hong Kong had tested positive for the new coronavirus sweeping China, the Japanese government had ordered everyone to stay aboard the luxury cruise ship.
We weren't doctors or epidemiologists, just vacationers. But we knew that cooping 2,666 people together on the Diamond Princess for 14 days was going to be trouble – and it was.
Because Japanese officials dithered around and then screwed up their containment measures on the ship for two weeks, the Diamond Princess became what the New York Times called "a floating epidemiological disaster." According to the Times, "with 634 infections and two deaths, the cruise ship represents the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China."
We were a lot luckier, even though we never made it all the way to Singapore. Our wise captain decided it wasn't worth the risk of getting any closer to the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak and we turned back to Dubai after stopping at Sri Lanka.
The Celebrity Cruise Line people did everything right. Everyone was compensated for their lost cruise time and given $500 to pay for straightening up their travel arrangements. Most important, as far as I know, no one on our cruise ship caught the flu.
Since I've been back in Southern California, however, I've been getting sick watching the mainstream media sensationalize the dangers of the coronavirus. Every time another country like Brazil gets its first official coronovirus case, they throw up another panicky headline.
The mainstream media rarely take the trouble to point out that it is the already sick, the very old and the very young who are most likely to die from problems like pneumonia, strokes and heart attacks.
The coronavirus may yet live up to its media hype and become a true pandemic in the United States or elsewhere that kills hundreds of thousands. But as the stock market dropped a few thousand points last week on the Dow Jones, it'd be a nice public service if the media put the death toll of the coronavirus in the proper perspective.
President Trump did exactly that during his news conference last week. He pointed out to the entire country that old-fashioned Asian flu – the regular kind of constantly changing viruses that many of us take shots for every year – kills from 25,000 to 69,000 Americans a year.
When President Trump admitted he was "shocked" to learn that the "regular" flu was so deadly, he was, of course, mocked for his ignorance by the mainstream liberal media and their Democrat pals.
But I bet most Republicans and Democrats were unaware of how deadly the "regular" flu is. For example, did you know that 2017-18 was one of the deadliest flu seasons in our history? Did you know that 80,000 Americans – older, younger, sicker Americans — died that flu season, the most since the mid-1970s?
Do you remember the scary media stories, the doomsday predictions, the panic in the streets of early 2018? Neither do I — and neither do the media.

Sandmann files more suits against media outlets

Texto completo: Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann has filed lawsuits against five national media outlets accusing them of defamation.
Sandmann became part of a social media firestorm in January 2019 when he was filmed with Native American activist Nathan Phillips in Washington D.C. The clip that went viral shows Sandmann and Phillips standing face-to-face in a crowd. Phillips plays a drum and sings.
The situation unfolded after the March for Life, which Sandmann and his classmates attended. Phillips was attending the Indigenous Peoples March.
On Monday, Sandmann sued ABC News, CBS News, the New York Times, Gannett and Rolling Stone.
Gannett is the parent company of The Enquirer.
These are just the latest lawsuits stemming from the incident on the National Mall. Sandmann sued CNN, NBC and the Washington Post in the first half of 2019.
The NBC and Washington Post lawsuits are still working their way through U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Kentucky, where the new suits were filed.
CNN reached an out-of-court settlement with Sandmann. The details of that settlement are not public.
The new lawsuits make similar arguments to the previous ones.
According to the lawsuit, Sandmann and his lawyers accuse the media outlets of publishing false and defamatory reports that cast Sandmann in a negative light, which brought public ire and threats upon Sandmann and his family.
Sandmann also states the media outlets relied on narrative from the "demonstrably unreliable" Phillips.
Sandmann is seeking punitive and compensatory damages from all the media outlets.
$275 million from NBC
$250 million from the Washington Post
$195 million Gannett
$95 million from ABC News
$65 million from the New York Times
$60 million from CBS News
$35 million from Rolling Stone
This brings the total amount of damages sought in the lawsuits – not including the undisclosed CNN settlement – to $975 million.

Look out for Russian vote interference, experts say

Texto completo: LANSING – With the March 10 primary one week away and Michigan seen as a battleground state in November, voters and election officials should be on guard for Russian and other foreign interference, experts say.
Threats range, they say, from false information posted online about when and how to vote, to "fake news" Facebook posts intended to increase division and reduce voter turnout, to actual attacks on voter databases and other election-related infrastructure.
But they say, residents should be mindful that one of our greatest vulnerabilities is ourselves.
Ben Nimmo, an international Internet sleuth whose work helped Facebook and other social media platforms ban thousands of accounts that spread disinformation during the 2016 election campaign, said it is the hyperpolarized nature of the U.S. political scene that makes the country more vulnerable to disinformation campaigns, which are increasingly difficult to detect.
"Disinformation operations tend to target anger and fear," said Nimmo, who is based in Scotland as director of investigations for the social network analysis firm Graphika.
"If you see a post on social media that makes you angry or afraid, take a step back and ask, 'Why is someone trying to manipulate me?'"
Nimmo, a founder of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which seeks to expose and explain online disinformation, said if there were no American Internet trolls, there could be no Russian trolls operating in the U.S., since Russian trolls pose as American trolls to exert influence on social media.
"Russian trolls did not create American trolls and they did not create the hyperpartisan atmosphere in the U.S.," he said.
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson encourages residents "to follow our social media and use our website to ensure they have accurate information about voting and voter registration," said Jake Rollow, a spokesman for Benson.
"We also direct voters to their local election clerks, as they often have the best local information," Rollow said. "Finally, when we are contacted about public misinformation — whether spread intentionally or not — we take action to have it corrected immediately."
Russian interests are not alone in spreading election-related disinformation on both sides of the political spectrum, but only Russia was identified by U.S. national intelligence agencies as having interfered in the 2016 election in an effort to help Republican Donald Trump and hurt Democrat Hillary Clinton. In 2018, a federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian intelligence agents and three Russian entities, accusing them of operating Internet "troll farms" in an attempt to sow divisions and influence the election through social media.
According to the New York Times and other media reports, intelligence officials told House Intelligence Committee members in February that a similar effort is underway in 2020, aimed at helping Trump get reelected.
John Hultquist, who tracks cyber espionage threats for government and private clients as director of intelligence analysis for FireEye, a California-based cyber threat company, said there has been relatively little election-related activity with links to Russia so far in the primary and caucus season. But he would expect such activity to ramp up as November approaches, he said.
"It's important to remember that these actions are attempts to undermine our democratic process by making it appear illegitimate," said Hultquist. "It's important to talk about this stuff, but it's important we don't do their job for them.
"Part of the intent here is to make us question everything, and we have to be very careful" only to make such connections when there is evidence to back it up, he said.
Nimmo said the last documented incident of Russian interference in the 2020 election cycle was October 2019, when Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, removed about 50 mostly Instragram accounts linked to Russia, which had names including @michigan_black_community.
Part of the Russian disinformation effort in 2016 targeted black voters in an an attempt to reduce turnout for Clinton.
A report produced in 2018 for the Senate Intelligence Committee said that Russian messaging targeted at black voters, who tend to vote Democratic, stressed "that the best way to advance the cause of the African American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead."
Nimmo said Russian operatives have a track record of focusing on swing states, which include Michigan. Since October, "not to say it's not happening, but we don't have proof," he said. It would make sense for any interference efforts to be concentrated closer to the November general election, rather than the primary elections, to maximize the impact, he said.
The Internet Research Agency, the online propaganda arm of the Russian government, is making greater efforts to cover its tracks, including use of U.S. servers, rather than ones based overseas, Nimmo said. At the same time, Facebook and other platforms are trying much harder to catch any foreign interference efforts, he said.
In 2016, a Twitter account was set up as the unofficial account of the Tennessee Republican Party and was registered with a Russian cellphone number, he said. That would be very unlikely to happen in 2020, either on the Russian end or by the U.S. social media platform in allowing the registration.
With the verified activity in October 2019, the Russian-backed trolls were mostly copying and pasting content created by Americans, he said. This makes detection more difficult because one of the ways to flag Russian accounts was by the use of broken English language in content they created themselves.
The accounts taken down in October 2019 each had between 2,500 and 5,000 followers, he said. That's an order of magnitude below what the 2016 accounts had, he said.
"If you're only copying and pasting other people's words, you don't have your own personality," and it is more difficult to attract followers, he said.
Hultquist said another major element of Russian interference from 2016 that so far has not been seen in the U.S. in 2020 is the hacking, theft and dissemination of emails and other documents, as happened in 2016 with internal records from the Democratic National Committee.
There is some evidence, Hultquist said, that Russian-backed agents attempted a hack on Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian-based energy company that employed as a board member Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a Democratic candidate for president. It's not clear whether the hack was successful, but if it was, it is possible records stolen in that attack could be released later in the election season, timed to have maximum impact, he said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, plus state election officials and a range of voter rights groups, say they are monitoring and working to combat any disinformation efforts, as well as any possible attacks on election infrastructure.
Michigan follows best practices by using paper ballots and tabulators that are not connected to the Internet until voting is finished and unofficial results are recorded on paper, he said. Benson created a panel of experts to review the election system and appointed the state's first election security expert, Rollow said.
Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, criticized Congress for not approving more funding and action to combat the foreign threat.
"We know that (in 2016) Russia took aim at black voters in particular," and tried to "promote racial discord," Clarke said. "There is great urgency to this matter. The threat is very real."
Rollow also said Benson will be "issuing guidance" to local clerks later this week on how to prepare for other contingencies, such as power outages affecting voting precincts on Election Day.
Asked whether there had been strong or concerted efforts recently to hack into Michigan's voter database, Rollow said: "We would not speak to this with respect to Michigan specifically."

Russia gets its 'Disneyland,' a Cold War dream come true

Texto completo: MOSCOW - A young girl finds a magic necklace made of mushrooms, but then an evil gnome steals it. Adventure ensues. According to her creators, Alfreya, the hero of a new children's book who was conceived for Russia's first theme park, is "an ordinary girl 10 to 12 years old with large, thoughtful eyes."
One thing she is not is a Disney character. Opening a real international Disneyland in Moscow would be out of the question amid the current political standoff with the United States.
But Russia's decadeslong quest to build a theme park, which began during the Cold War rivalry with the United States, finally reached its fairy-tale ending.
The $1.5 billion Dream Island, which opened Saturday, may certainly remind some visitors of Disneyland. In place of Elsa from "Frozen," there is the Snow Queen, and in the Russian version of "The Jungle Book," the jungle is populated by talking dinosaurs. Developers said the park will be inhabited by dozens of fairy-tale characters, all domestically produced.
Dream Island does not mind if you invoke Disneyland to describe the park but will point out that it has no connections to the Happiest Place on Earth.
"The word Disneyland is on people's tongues," said Alena Burova, a publicist for the site. "In Russia, we say Disneyland when we mean just a theme park."
The park has been built only now because it will benefit from something more essential than snow queens and fairy princesses: a large pool of middle-class consumers in the Russian capital, something that was missing when two previous attempts failed.
So, some 60 years after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev first floated the idea of building an analogue to Disneyland, President Vladimir Putin stopped by to inspect the park last week.
For Amiran Mutsoev, a former shopping mall developer who is the park's owner and director, the site is a major bet that middle-class purchasing power will hold up despite Western sanctions and low prices for oil, a major Russian export. That the opening coincided with the coronavirus outbreak, when some may want to avoid crowds, is another concern.
"Will people come, or will they not come?" Mutsoev asked. "Of course, we are worried."
The park expects 5 million Moscow residents and 2 1/2 million tourists, mostly from elsewhere in Russia, to visit the animated dinosaurs and haunted houses each year, Mutsoev said. Tickets on a weekend cost 11,000 rubles, or about $163, for a family of four.
The average monthly pay in Russia last year was 46,073 rubles, or about $683. And it has been dropping in inflation-adjusted terms. The minister of labor recently proposed lowering the minimum wage - because the cost of potatoes had gone down. Overall last year, about 14% of the population lived on less than $160 per month, the official poverty line.
But Moscow and its 13 million residents are an exception. The average wage in the capital last year was about twice the national average. The trickle of oil money has already given birth to new businesses, some of the world's largest malls and what sociologists see as pent-up demand in the Moscow middle class for better government services.
The developers said it is the largest covered park in Europe - and the only option for remaining open through Moscow's long, grim winter.
The theme park has nine zones. Five were created by "Russian artists specifically for Dream Island," according to a promotional brochure. The others are licensed attractions: Hotel Transylvania, from Sony Pictures; the Smurfs, from the Belgian company IMPS; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, from Viacom; and Hello Kitty, from Sanrio of Japan.
The Cuningham Group, a Minneapolis firm that has designed a variety of theme parks, including Warner Bros. Movie World in Madrid, created all nine themed zones based on the Russian and foreign-licensed concepts.

Texto completo: LANSING – With the March 10 primary one week away and Michigan seen as a battleground state in November, voters and election officials should be on guard for Russian and other foreign interference, experts say.
Threats range, they say, from false information posted online about when and how to vote, to "fake news" Facebook posts intended to increase division and reduce voter turnout, to actual attacks on voter databases and other election-related infrastructure.
But they say, residents should be mindful that one of our greatest vulnerabilities is ourselves.
Ben Nimmo, an international internet sleuth whose work helped Facebook and other social media platforms ban thousands of accounts that spread disinformation during the 2016 election campaign, said it is the hyperpolarized nature of the U.S. political scene that makes the country more vulnerable to disinformation campaigns, which are increasingly difficult to detect.
"Disinformation operations tend to target anger and fear," said Nimmo, who is based in Scotland as director of investigations for the social network analysis firm Graphika.
"If you see a post on social media that makes you angry or afraid, take a step back and ask, 'Why is someone trying to manipulate me?'"
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson encourages residents "to follow our social media and use our website to ensure they have accurate information about voting and voter registration," said Jake Rollow, a spokesman for Benson.
"We also direct voters to their local election clerks, as they often have the best local information," Rollow said. "Finally, when we are contacted about public misinformation – whether spread intentionally or not – we take action to have it corrected immediately."
According to the New York Times and other media reports, intelligence officials told House Intelligence Committee members in February that a similar effort is underway in 2020, aimed at helping Trump get reelected.
Nimmo said the last documented incident of Russian interference in the 2020 election cycle was October 2019, when Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, removed about 50 mostly Instragram accounts linked to Russia, which had names including @michigan_black_ community.

"If you see a post on social media that makes you angry or afraid, take a step back and ask, 'Why is someone trying to manipulate me?'"
Nimmo, a founder of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which seeks to expose and explain online disinformation, said if there were no American Internet trolls, there could be no Russian trolls operating in the U.S., since Russian trolls pose as American trolls to exert influence on social media.
"Russian trolls did not create American trolls and they did not create the hyperpartisan atmosphere in the U.S.," he said.
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson encourages residents "to follow our social media and use our website to ensure they have accurate information about voting and voter registration," said Jake Rollow, a spokesman for Benson.
"We also direct voters to their local election clerks, as they often have the best local information," Rollow said. "Finally, when we are contacted about public misinformation — whether spread intentionally or not — we take action to have it corrected immediately."
Russian interests are not alone in spreading election-related disinformation on both sides of the political spectrum, but only Russia was identified by U.S. national intelligence agencies as having interfered in the 2016 election in an effort to help Republican Donald Trump and hurt Democrat Hillary Clinton. In 2018, a federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian intelligence agents and three Russian entities, accusing them of operating Internet "troll farms" in an attempt to sow divisions and influence the election through social media.
According to the New York Times and other media reports, intelligence officials told House Intelligence Committee members in February that a similar effort is underway in 2020, aimed at helping Trump get reelected.
John Hultquist, who tracks cyber espionage threats for government and private clients as director of intelligence analysis for FireEye, a California-based cyber threat company, said there has been relatively little election-related activity with links to Russia so far in the primary and caucus season. But he would expect such activity to ramp up as November approaches, he said.
"It's important to remember that these actions are attempts to undermine our democratic process by making it appear illegitimate," said Hultquist. "It's important to talk about this stuff, but it's important we don't do their job for them.
"Part of the intent here is to make us question everything, and we have to be very careful" only to make such connections when there is evidence to back it up, he said.
Nimmo said the last documented incident of Russian interference in the 2020 election cycle was October 2019, when Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, removed about 50 mostly Instragram accounts linked to Russia, which had names including @michigan_black_community.
Part of the Russian disinformation effort in 2016 targeted black voters in an an attempt to reduce turnout for Clinton.
A report produced in 2018 for the Senate Intelligence Committee said that Russian messaging targeted at black voters, who tend to vote Democratic, stressed "that the best way to advance the cause of the African American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead."
Nimmo said Russian operatives have a track record of focusing on swing states, which include Michigan. Since October, "not to say it's not happening, but we don't have proof," he said. It would make sense for any interference efforts to be concentrated closer to the November general election, rather than the primary elections, to maximize the impact, he said.

Texto completo: Trash on our highways
is a disgrace
My family and I just traveled to and from Florida, and most of the interstates were fairly clean thanks to inmate assistance and cleaning crews. However, our Pennsylvania roadways, particularly routes Interstate 78 and Route 22, look horrible as evidenced by the trash and debris along the side of the highways.
Perhaps the use of more cleaning crews, volunteer work, community service or prison inmates could help rectify the dirty state our Pennsylvania highways are currently in.

Volunteer helped
care for cemetery
Last week we said farewell to a real local hero, James Brasted. He and wife Bonnie worked tirelessly in Union and West End Cemetery in downtown Allentown for over 20 years, spending hundred of hours. They did everything: pick up trash daily, provide water in the hot summers and food in the winter for wildlife.
They spent much of their own money to plant native oaks, maples and flowering trees in the cemetery that will provide shade, beauty and comfort forever in this hectic city neighborhood. He and Bonnie were a daily inspiration to the volunteers who struggle to maintain the cemetery.
We will do our best to honor his legacy. He and Bonnie rescued many injured or orphaned wild animals they found, driving them the long distance to Red Creek Wildlife Center in Schuylkill County. God rest you, Jim.

Suspend licenses if drivers
don't remove snow
What happened to Christine Lambert in 2005, as described in a recent Road Warrior column in The Morning Call, was listed as an accident but was totally preventable. Snow must be removed from any vehicle before it is moved. Snow turns to ice, and the ice can be deadly, as proven.
The offending drivers are lazy and can face fines, which are a joke. A driver's license being suspended will do more for snow removal than any fine.
Without a license, he/she must find another way to get to work, bus and truck companies will lose drivers and the other drivers will be safer.
Driving on ice is bad enough without worrying about being hit by a chunk of ice.

Trump's style: fear, intimidation and retribution
As has been vividly demonstrated by his personal life, his business life, his television reality show life, his presidential campaign life and now his presidential life, the character and management style of Donald Trump can be summarized with three attributes: fear, intimidation and retribution.
In the past several weeks since the conclusion of the Senate impeachment trial, he has greatly intensified this pattern. And with virtually no guide rails to influence him to conform to historical presidential, Constitutional and societal norms, now we can only imagine what the future holds.

Trump is solving
decades-old problems
Well, what flavor Kool-Aid will the left drink today? I read the op-ed by Alan Jennings ("Trump voters: Is this what you meant?"), and it is so nice that The Morning Call gives everyone a forum to voice their opinions.
I don't have enough room in my letter to refute everything Mr. Jennings said, but many of us believe that our choice for president was best for our whole country. The Chicken Littles of our country often preach doom and gloom, but so far he is making strides in solving decades-old problems that no one thought possible.
I wonder, could our president bring peace to the Middle East? Could he denuclearize North Korea? Could he correct our many trade imbalances throughout the world? Could he solve the border problem, etc.? Why demonize those who support our president?
He is not a politician but a hard-working businessman who wants to restore our nation to greatness. Why not join him in working to better the inner cities that you care so much about?

History could be repeating itself. In the 2016 Republican primary, there were too many candidates, many of whom had no chance of securing the nomination. This resulted in such a dilution of votes among them that Donald Trump was able to win the nomination; the worst possible candidate for the country.
This year, the Democrats are in danger of doing the same thing. In the primaries and caucuses so far, Bernie Sanders has about 30-35% of the vote. This means that 65-70% of Democrats don't want him as their nominee. Yet, because there are so many candidates dividing the anti-Sanders vote, he might be able to win the nomination. Again, he would be the worst possible candidate for the country.
If this were to happen, it puts Americans in a lose-lose situation regarding their choices for president.

Trump is trying to
muzzle free press
I read that President Trump's campaign is suing The New York Times for libel about an opinion piece regarding the president and the Mueller investigation into his campaign's alleged involvement with Russia's interference in the 2016 election. While the report said there was no evidence of a conspiracy, the report clearly stated that the Trump campaign knew of the Russian interference and welcomed it. This alone should frighten all of us.
I suggest that Barack Obama sue Donald Trump for slander regarding Trump's accusations about Obama not being born in the U.S. and therefore being ineligible to be president. The investigators that Trump claimed he sent to Hawaii and found "... they cannot believe what they're finding," should testify at the court proceeding, providing the details about these findings.
Two of the things that make America great are freedom of the press and freedom of speech. Apparently, President Trump missed that lesson in school along with any lessons about our Constitution. It's a danger to America when a president tries to suppress criticism of himself, his policies and his administration.
When will some Americans begin to understand what makes us great and recognize the dangers that are coming from within?

Texto completo: MOSCOW - A young girl finds a magic necklace made of mushrooms, but then an evil gnome steals it. Adventure ensues. According to her creators, Alfreya, the hero of a new children's book who was conceived for Russia's first theme park, is "an ordinary girl 10 to 12 years old with large, thoughtful eyes."
One thing she is not is a Disney character. Opening a real international Disneyland in Moscow would be out of the question amid the current political standoff with the United States.
But Russia's decadeslong quest to build a theme park, which began during the Cold War rivalry with the United States, finally reached its fairy-tale ending.
The $1.5 billion Dream Island, which opened Saturday, may certainly remind some visitors of Disneyland. In place of Elsa from "Frozen," there is the Snow Queen, and in the Russian version of "The Jungle Book," the jungle is populated by talking dinosaurs. Developers said the park will be inhabited by dozens of fairy-tale characters, all domestically produced.
Dream Island does not mind if you invoke Disneyland to describe the park but will point out that it has no connections to the Happiest Place on Earth.
"The word Disneyland is on people's tongues," said Alena Burova, a publicist for the site. "In Russia, we say Disneyland when we mean just a theme park."
The park has been built only now because it will benefit from something more essential than snow queens and fairy princesses: a large pool of middle-class consumers in the Russian capital, something that was missing when two previous attempts failed.
So, some 60 years after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev first floated the idea of building an analogue to Disneyland, President Vladimir Putin stopped by to inspect the park last week.
For Amiran Mutsoev, a former shopping mall developer who is the park's owner and director, the site is a major bet that middle-class purchasing power will hold up despite Western sanctions and low prices for oil, a major Russian export. That the opening coincided with the coronavirus outbreak, when some may want to avoid crowds, is another concern.
"Will people come, or will they not come?" Mutsoev asked. "Of course, we are worried."
The park expects 5 million Moscow residents and 2 1/2 million tourists, mostly from elsewhere in Russia, to visit the animated dinosaurs and haunted houses each year, Mutsoev said. Tickets on a weekend cost 11,000 rubles, or about $163, for a family of four.
The average monthly pay in Russia last year was 46,073 rubles, or about $683. And it has been dropping in inflation-adjusted terms. The minister of labor recently proposed lowering the minimum wage - because the cost of potatoes had gone down. Overall last year, about 14% of the population lived on less than $160 per month, the official poverty line.
But Moscow and its 13 million residents are an exception. The average wage in the capital last year was about twice the national average. The trickle of oil money has already given birth to new businesses, some of the world's largest malls and what sociologists see as pent-up demand in the Moscow middle class for better government services.
The developers said it is the largest covered park in Europe - and the only option for remaining open through Moscow's long, grim winter.
The theme park has nine zones. Five were created by "Russian artists specifically for Dream Island," according to a promotional brochure. The others are licensed attractions: Hotel Transylvania, from Sony Pictures; the Smurfs, from the Belgian company IMPS; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, from Viacom; and Hello Kitty, from Sanrio of Japan.
The Cuningham Group, a Minneapolis firm that has designed a variety of theme parks, including Warner Bros. Movie World in Madrid, created all nine themed zones based on the Russian and foreign-licensed concepts.

Sanders is the best candidate to take on Trump

Texto completo: Who is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump in November?
This was the urgent question facing voters in South Carolina's Democratic presidential primary, where 60% of the electorate are African Americans. Communities of color can't afford another four years of a president who gives encouragement to white supremacists, routinely violates the rights of immigrants and refugees, and actively plans to suppress votes in black and brown neighborhoods.
South Carolina was viewed as a testing ground to determine which candidate can build the inclusive, multiracial coalition necessary for a Democratic victory in 2020.
The "Sanders Surge" is causing intense anxiety within the consultant class, who earn fat fees by telling us what we are supposed to think.
Best-selling author Anand Giridharadas summed it up in a tweet from his appearance on MSNBC, which went viral: "This is a wake-up moment for the American power establishment. Many in this elite are behaving like aristocrats in a dying regime ..."
Here's an idea: Since these aristocrats - along with their pundits and pollsters - were so thoroughly wrong about the last presidential election, why don't we listen to actual voters this time around?
As Peter Beinart pointed out in The Atlantic, while party elites are hostile to the Vermont senator, "among ordinary Democrats, Sanders is strikingly popular, even with voters who favor his rivals."
The available data indicate that Sanders is better positioned than anyone else to unify Democrats and lead a winning campaign:
* A recent Monmouth University poll shows Sanders with a net favorability rating of 53%, the highest of any Democratic candidate.
* A survey from Quinnipiac University shows Sanders receiving high marks - a net favorability of 43% - from Democrats who describe themselves as "moderate" or "conservative."
* In trial heats, Sanders regularly defeats Trump - more consistently, and typically by larger margins than his principal opponents.
* Sanders has created a grassroots fundraising army of 1.4 million small donors, far more than any other candidate, an essential ingredient for a successful general election campaign.
Sanders speaks truth more directly to power, than power is accustomed to hearing: he often calls out the billionaires, Wall Street titans, military-industrial complex, and other elites. He is an unconventional front-runner. So why is he winning?
A lot of the answer is in his consistent track record and the honesty that it shows: he has been saying the same things for decades, fighting for greater equality - including racial equality - and better living standards for working people. Agree with him or not, nobody doubts he is a man who means what he says.
Authenticity goes a long way with today's skeptical voters, especially when it's backed up by detailed plans that address real-life problems - such as health care costs and access, low and stagnant wages, and the low incomes of senior citizens that need a boost from expanded Social Security benefits.
If you listen to the pundits, you'll hear that "Medicare-for-All" is an electoral liability. In fact, polls in early primary and caucus states found that Sanders' plan for universal health care is overwhelmingly popular among voters. So is his proposal for free college tuition among voters generally, and his commitment to increase taxes on the wealthy to fund vital public programs.
The inequality of income and wealth in this country is out of control and has been worsening for decades. Requiring the well-off to pay a little more so everyone else can make ends meet has wide appeal across race, class, gender and geography. Sanders won Nevada, the New York Times reports, with "a multiracial coalition of immigrants, college students, Latina mothers, younger black voters, white liberals and even some moderates ..."
That sounds like a winning formula, especially in the hands of a guy who knows how to win. Bernie Sanders has won 11 statewide races in Vermont since 1990; in every presidential election year when he was also on the ballot, he received more votes than Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry or Barack Obama. That means more than a few Vermonters pulled a Republican lever for president, then looked down ballot and selected a gruff Brooklyn-born fighter who tells it like it is and has a long track record of standing up for the underdog.
There are a lot more underdogs than overdogs in America. That's why it looks like Bernie Sanders will prevail in the primaries, unify a diverse Democratic coalition, and be the person who puts his hand on the Bible in January 2021.

WHICH CANDIDATE COULD HANDLE A CRISIS? IT MAY BE THE CORONAVIRUS TODAY, BUT A DIFFERENT ISSUE IS SURE TO FACE THE NEXT PRESIDENT

Texto completo: It should go without saying that the potential for a coronavirus outbreak shouldn't be politicized. But though it shouldn't be politicized, it obviously has political implications.
If the Trump administration generally handles the situation well, then the pandemic will probably help his re-election chances, because he is the guy who ran against open borders and a highly interconnected global economy. If he handles it badly, and the outbreak proves to be serious, he will lose, full stop.
The events of the past week should also make us think hard about the Democratic primary field. Which of these people would you prefer to find in charge of a full-blown pandemic?
Not that they're going to be asked to run the COVID-19 response; whether we have a bad outbreak or not, the worst is likely to be over by Jan. 21, 2021. However, the exercise suggests which candidates might best manage the different crisis we aren't expecting but which will almost certainly arrive during the next presidential term.
Which candidate do you think can allow expert civil servants to do their jobs, without unnecessary micro-management or political interference - but can also set priorities, quickly resolve the inevitable turf battles and communication lapses, and clear away obstacles?
Who can rapidly take in a lot of information on an unfamiliar subject, cope with the many uncertainties and deliver a final decision that's likely to be right? Not certainly, because no one is ever right all the time, but most likely? And when they make mistakes, as they will, who is most likely to recognize an error, admit it and move to fix things rather than wasting time trying to shift the blame?
Can the candidate focus the policy response on empirical data and pragmatic action, rather than looking for the solutions that best please the base or fit ideological priorities? Can he or she take bold steps that might not be immediately politically popular?
Finally, can the candidate lead? When he or she goes on television to reassure America, will most Americans feel comforted? This sounds minor, but it isn't at all. When people panic, they do stupid and dangerous things, including not listening to public health officials who are trying to prevent an epidemic.
Whatever your answer to those questions, don't focus on health policies. The next president is bound to face some major crisis during a term or two in office, but it's unlikely to be a health crisis - it will be a Cuban missile crisis, or an Iranian hostage situation, or gosh knows what else.
In some ways, a candidate's preferred solutions to already-known problems are the least interesting things about them. After all, George W. Bush ran on "compassionate conservatism" but left office as the president of 9/11, the Iraq War and the bungled Hurricane Katrina response. Even Barack Obama, who talked about the financial crisis on the stump, only did so in the two months after the September collapse of Lehman Brothers; he had spent most of the previous year making health care his signature issue.
So instead of focusing on detailed policies that will probably be overtaken by events, think about who can be flexible enough to deal with novel problems, yet rigid enough to keep an administration full of ambitious zealots, plus a bureaucracy full of turf-protective civil servants, all moving in roughly the same direction.
Personally, I'd pick Mike Bloomberg. Though I disagree with him on many topics, I know that Mr. Bloomberg has run a city that has the fifth-biggest government workforce in the country, and run it reasonably well, under some very trying circumstances. These included the other party controlling most of the key political offices in his city and the state, as well as a financial crisis that devastated his city's main source of tax revenue. None of the other candidates has ever managed anything on that scale, or under that kind of pressure.
I'm not saying that your answer has to be mine. You might prefer Elizabeth Warren's wonkiness, or Joe Biden's experience, or even Bernie Sanders' passion. I'm just saying that before you vote, it would be a good idea to close your eyes and picture the candidate you're supporting thrust onto the front lines of an epidemic, or a really bad earthquake, or a massive terrorist attack. Be honest with yourself, because you'll never have to defend your answer to anyone else: Would he or she actually do what needs to be done?
The answer to that question probably matters more than any other you could ask.

PUBLIC DEMAND GROWS FOR MASKS, SANITIZERS

Texto completo: If you were to try and order a face mask on Home Depot's website Tuesday afternoon, an alert would've appeared informing customers that, "due to current events, supplies are limited."
A five-pack of "nuisance masks" meant to protect against dust and powders is unavailable for order as they are out of stock in all Home Depot locations within 100 miles of Allegheny County. The same goes for disposable multi-purpose dust masks.
Home Depot began seeing an increase in demand for face masks a little over a month ago - so much so that the Atlanta-based hardware store chain implemented a limited purchase quantity of 10 masks per person, according to Christina Cornell, a company spokeswoman.
The surge in face masks and surgical mask sales is due to the COVID-19 disease outbreak, which has infected 89,000 people across 70 countries, according to Tuesday estimates. As the worldwide death toll reached more than 3,000, the U.S. toll stood at nine victims through Tuesday, all in Washington state.
Health officials from the U.S. Surgeon General to doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned the general public against buying masks. Despite that, major retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's are working to expedite health products - face masks, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies - into consumers' hands.
Drugstore chains are experiencing the same high demand, but Rite Aid spokesperson Chris Savarese told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that those same products are typically in demand during cold and flu season.
"We are experiencing a run on those products due to heavy flu season compiled with the coronavirus outbreak," Mr. Saverese said.
Rite Aid is doing its best to manage inventory and remain stocked up on healthcare supplies to meet customers' needs, Mr. Saverese said.
CVS is experiencing similar demand pressure for face masks and cleaning supplies. The demand may "cause temporary shortages of certain products at some store locations and we are re-supplying those stores as quickly as possible," said Mike DeAngelis, spokesman for CVS Health.
Health officials say the overwhelming demand for masks and other hygenic products is creating a crisis for healthcare workers. Over the weekend, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted a stern warning to the public that read: "Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!"
Dr. Adams said face masks are not effective in preventing a COVID-19 infection, and the shortage only hinders healthcare providers who need masks to care for sick patients.
The World Health Organization has said masks should only be worn by healthy people who are taking care of someone sick, or someone who is already sick and is coughing and sneezing in public.

Texto completo: City Theatre's 2020-21 season comes in with a fright of fancy - a multimedia production of "Frankenstein" - and continues to deliver on its new-play mission.
The new season includes two plays developed by the company, the return of Dominique Morisseau and Adam Rapp's "The Sound Inside," which was on Broadway as recently as January.
One of the premieres, the season-ender, is a community project called "A Pittsburgh Immigration Story," to be written by Donora native James McManus "weaving together a new work of fiction exploring the many ways that people have made this city of bridges a home. The work is supported by one of a dozen Allegheny Regional Asset District Impact Grants awarded to celebrate the 25th anniversary of RAD's founding.
City Theatre's 2020-21 season
(Some details TBA; for season-ticket packages, check citytheatrecompany.org or call 412-431-CITY.)
Sept. 19-Oct. 11: "Frankenstein" by Manual Cinema (MainStage). The award-winning Manual Cinema collective ("The Forger") tells the classic horror tale with a production that combines live music and actors with shadow puppetry, cinematic techniques and a multichannel sound design.
Nov. 7-29: "Paradise Blue" by Dominique Morisseau (MainStage). The third City production, after "Pipeline" and "Sunset Baby," of a work by the MacArthur Grant winner and book writer for Broadway's Temptations musical, "Ain't Too Proud." In "Paradise Blue," the human cost of urban renewal is personified in a musician and club owner in a gentrifying Detroit neighborhood circa 1949.
Jan. 16-Feb. 7: "The Sound Inside" by Adam Rapp, directed by Marc Masterson (MainStage). Bella is a Yale literature professor who gets life-altering news at the same time that she meets a brilliant, quirky student. Told in a series of intense encounters, the recent Broadway showcase for Mary-Louise Parker was described by Jesse Green of The New York Times as "riveting ... a gripping small-scale mystery." In 2004, City produced Adam Rapp's "Gompers," starring his brother, Anthony Rapp ("Rent").
March 6-28, 2021: "Vietgone" by Qui Nguyen, directed by Oanh Nguyen (MainStage). Described as "highly theatrical, irreverent and sexy," the circa 1975 play tells a love story about two very new Americans on a "fast-paced, hip-hop infused" road trip. "Vietgone," the 2016 Steinberg New Play Award winner, premiered at South Coast Rep, when City's Masterson was artistic director there.
April 10-May 16, 2021: "The Garbologists" by Lindsay Joelle (Lester Hamburg Studio). The premiere of this unconventional buddy comedy, set on the dirty streets of New York, follows a Momentum Festival reading at City in 2019. It finds a longtime sanitation worker and a newbie sharing the back of a 19-ton garbage truck, and learning lessons about what we discard, and that some things are easier to let go of than others.
May 15-June 6, 2021: "A Pittsburgh Immigration Story" by James McManus, directed by Michael John Garcés (Mainstage). The work will reflect "the countless origin stories Pittsburgh has to offer." Created in conjunction with Cornerstone Theater Company and community partners All for All, ARYSE, Global Minds and Literacy Pittsburgh.
In addition to a six-play subscription series, the season includes the block-party fundraiser The Bash (Sept. 12), the Young Playwrights Festival, the Momentum Festival and the Momentum Reading Series, along with special events and community activities through the theater's City Connects initiative. City Theatre also will introduce a new holiday show from the creative team behind last season's "Santa's Ted Talk."

Texto completo: Comedian Jacqueline Novak is coming to Boston with her one-woman show, “Get on Your Knees," a live stand-up routine that explores her sexual coming-of age, her love of literature, and, well, male anatomy.
“In theory, it's about [sex]," said Novak of the show in a January appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon ." “But it's very high brow. It's literary. It's spiritual."
The 16 Boston performances, scheduled for March 31 to April 12, are the first leg of the comedian's monthslong tour. After the Boston run, Novak will hit Austin, Texas, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Seattle, and London.
“Get on Your Knees" originally debuted in New York last summer, where its off-Broadway run was extended four times.
The Boston performances will be held in the Nancy and Edward Roberts Studio at the Boston Center for the Arts' Calderwood Pavilion, a smaller space than Novak's NYC venues.
“We are so excited for Boston audiences to experience this artist," said Erica Lynn Schwartz , the general manager of the Colonial Ambassador for Theatre Group, which is presenting the performance.
Natasha Lyonne , the “Russian Doll" and “Orange Is the New Black" star, is another presenter of the 75-minute show. Written by Novak, the show is directed by John Early and produced by Mike Birbiglia .
Tickets go on sale Friday, March 6, at 10 a.m. Tickets may be purchased online at bostontheatre scene.com.DITI KOHLI

Texto completo: I've grown quite attached to my face over the years.
My face and I do all the normal things that a person does with a face: Eating, drinking, breathing, looking at stuff. Nothing crazy. Sometimes we whistle.
It's not an especially impressive face, it's true. But it is mine.
And now, amid the scary spread of the coronavirus, my beloved face is off-limits. The simple act of touching your face puts you at much greater risk for contracting the novel coronavirus, doctors say. Putting your filthy fingers near your somewhat less filthy mucus membranes (mouth, eyes, nose) gives the virus — any virus, really — an easy path into your body.
“Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth," a World Health Organization Q&A explains. “From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick."
A recent New York Times headline offered a straightforward prescription:
“Stop Touching Your Face!"
OK, fine. Per doctor's orders, I had already redoubled my efforts on the hand-washing front, lathering up in the men's room every couple hours like I was scrubbing in for surgery. Surely I could give up wiping my mouth, rubbing my eyes, and scratching my nose, too. How hard could it be? I'm not a 4-year-old licking the buttons in the elevator; I'm a grown man in control of my various scratching and rubbing functions.
And if forced to choose between a small chance of dying horribly and walking around all day with something dangling from my right nostril, I'll take the booger every time.
So on Monday, I resolved to quit cold turkey. If I needed to scratch something, I'd commandeer a plastic fork. If I needed some sort of mucus-based service I'd grab a tissue, which probably I should have been doing anyway. If I discovered something wedged between an incisor and a canine, well, I'd cross that bridge when I came to it. And while I do tend to spend a lot of work and personal time with my head in my hands wondering where my youth went, I decided to be less demonstrative about my ennui.
I started at about 3 p.m. and while sitting at my desk, almost immediately caught myself reaching up to brush aside a stray eyebrow hair that had fallen into my field of vision. Then my ear started to itch. Do ears count? I wasn't sure. Probably not the outside of an ear, but I don't think it's smart to dig around in there. I grabbed my plastic fork and did a little light exfoliation near my ear hole.
It turns out not touching your face requires a level of mindfulness that is typically associated with monks and tech CEOs.
Eighteen minutes into my grand experiment in making my own face off-limits, I was absentmindedly clawing at my cheek as if it was the inside of a coffin in which I'd been accidentally buried alive.
Completely unrelated: I've had a low-grade man-cold since roughly November.
How hard is it to stop touching your face? A 2015 study published in the American Journal of Infection Control found that participants put finger to face 23 times an hour, with nearly half of those touches contacting the aforementioned mucus membranes.
Anything you do 23 times an hour is going to be pretty tough to quit. You might as well ask me to give up breathing, or checking my phone.
The Internet is replete with ways to make this work, each dumber than the last. Wear gloves. Wear mittens. Sit on your hands. Each of these genius strategies was typed by someone whose fingers were gently caressing a filthy keyboard and then going straight into their mouths.
At this point I gave up, washed my hands again, and then began pawing at my face like a zombie. I threw the soiled ear fork in the trash.
If I end up in quarantine, at least I won't have food in my teeth.

AJC TOP LOCAL STORY CORONAVIRUS: CDC urged to expand virus testing: Specialists say screening has been inadequate; Fulton County man, son recovering from illness.

Texto completo: Some prominent infectious disease specialists are criticizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying testing has been inadequate, as diagnoses continue to crop up around the country, including two family members in Georgia.
So far, there are more than 100 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in the United States, including people in Washington, California, Florida and New York. Many of the diagnoses have come in the last week.
Fulton County health officials told reporters that the two confirmed coronavirus cases in Fulton County are a 56-year-old man who returned on Feb. 22 from a work trip to Milan, Italy, and his teenage son, who was infected by his father. They are both doing well and have minimal symptoms, according to health officials. The household also includes a wife and younger child who are in isolation and being monitored.
Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said the CDC needs to expand testing around the country.
"I think it's quite clear to many of us who are specialists in public health and infectious disease specialists, that we have thought for some time, we need much more widespread testing," he said. "And yes, I think the numbers are higher. I don't know how much higher, but we will start to see it as more people are tested."
A series of missteps by the CDC has delayed diagnostic testingforcoronavirusinGeorgia and across the country.
State health departments initially received flawed diagnostic kits from the agency, which made them unusable. That meant all testing had to be done at the CDC. Georgia health officials only recently received new test kits.
Schaffner called the problems with the test kits, "unfortunate." But Dr.Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, was more harsh in his assessment, telling The New York Times, "the incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the CDC."
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last week it will allow hundreds of labs across the country, which include those run by universities and private companies, to also test for the virus.
About 15 people in Georgia have been tested for coronavirus, public health officials said.
Though members of the Fulton County family tested positive, the children are home schooled, limiting opportunities to expose others to the virus.
"Things are going well for the two folks who tested positive last night. They remain in home monitoring," Gov. Brian Kemp told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, a growing number of patients and doctors are complaining they can't get testing.
Schaffner said he was recently contacted by a woman who had developed symptoms of an upper respiratory infection after traveling to Italy. He referred the patient to the Tennessee state laboratory, but officials there said she could not be tested because she did not meet the testing criteria at the time.
The CDC has tested 500 Americans with suspected infections, according to the most recent estimates available, while other countries have tested tens of thousands. And China, where the outbreak started, has reportedly tested millions.
Many people experience mild symptoms, such as a cough, or none at all.Because of that, experts said, many people may be unknowingly spreading the disease. That could mean explosive growth around the globe.
"That's why the most important thing to do now for public health in the U.S. is to quickly find cases and, as rapidly as possible, try to contain them," said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the former director of the CDC. "Given the day-to-day march we're seeing, we do expect it's going to be seen in many places very quickly. Whether it will be there for a long period of time or will be controlled, only time and our efforts will tell."
In Atlanta, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has created the Mayor's Pandemic Coordination Team to lead the city's strategic plan if a pandemic erupts.
Kemp urged the public to remain calm. "Everyone remains at a low risk, as we said last night. And make sure to rely on information coming out of the governor's office, the Department of Public Health and the CDC. There's a lot of information flying out there, and some of it is not accurate."
Up until recently in the U.S., the CDC only recommended testing people who have symptoms and have been to China or who have symptoms and have been in contact with a suspected or confirmed case.The CDC has expanded guidelines for coronavirus testing to include people with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath coupledwith travel not only to China but also other high-risk areas, including Italy, Iran and South Korea.
Vice President Mike Pence said at a Monday afternoon press conference that all passengers on direct flights from Italy and South Korea will now be screened.
Within the United States, there are no travel restrictions.
GeorgiaDepartmentofPublicHealthCommissionerKathleen
Toomey indicated health officials are not planning to get in touch with passengers on the flight with the Fulton County man who tested positive after his trip to Italy.
He did not exhibit symptoms until several days after returning to Georgia, she said.
The CDC says it's possible for people to transmit COVID-19 while being asymptomatic, but believe infected people are most contagious when experiencing symptoms.

Texto completo: Two new comedy series -- BET's "Twenties" and FXX's "Dave" -- follow creative protagonists building careers.
What's on TV
TWENTIES 10 p.m. on BET. After Lena Waithe's groundbreaking 2017 Emmy win -- in which she became the first African-American woman to receive an Emmy for outstanding writing in a comedy series -- the filmmaker Ava DuVernay posted to social media a photograph of a young Waithe balancing trays of coffee in the back seat of a car. It was a throwback to Waithe's early career, in which she was an assistant to people in Hollywood, including DuVernay. That period of Waithe's life provides the basis for her new, semi-autobiographical comedy series, "Twenties," which centers on a 24-year-old aspiring television writer, Hattie (Jonica T. Gibbs) -- though it moves the action to the present day. "This is our world post my character on 'Master of None;' it's a world post 'Get Out'; it's a world post 'Moonlight,"' Waithe said of the show in a recent interview with The New York Times. "This is the first time a masculine-of-center black woman has been the center of a show on prime-time TV."
DAVE 10 p.m. on FXX. The rise of a different entertainer is chronicled in this new series, which stars Dave Burd (a.k.a. the YouTube-born comic rapper Lil Dicky) as a fictionalized version of himself. The first episode begins in a doctor's office, with Dave (Burd) giving a detailed description of his nether regions -- a perfect litmus test for viewers deciding whether or not the series is for them. Burd's co-creator, Jeff Schaffer ("The League," "Seinfeld"), said in a recent interview with The Times that "the arc of the first season is, how do you go from having people view your video to being viewed as an actual rap artist?"
What's Streaming
LIL PEEP: EVERYBODY'S EVERYTHING (2019) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. A distinctive blend of emo and hip-hop shot the rapper Lil Peep to stardom, before his death from an accidental overdose in 2017 cut his career short. "Everybody's Everything," directed by Sebastian Jones and Ramez Silyan, offers a documentary look at the rapper's rise. The film "doesn't spend enough time on Peep's lyrics and music-making process," Ken Jaworowski wrote in his review for The Times. "And it was completed before a recent contentious lawsuit was filed by his mother against her son's talent agency and label, whom she accuses of plying him with drugs." Nevertheless, Jaworowski wrote, the documentary "is an engaging account of Peep's life and the alt-music scene."
THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS (2009) Stream on Hulu and Netflix; rent on iTunes and Vudu. About a decade before he played a mustachioed Army man in Hulu's recent "Catch-22" adaptation, George Clooney played a ... mustachioed Army man in this dark comedy. Adapted from a book by Jon Ronson and directed by Grant Heslov, "The Men Who Stare At Goats" casts Clooney, Jeff Bridges and Stephen Lang as members of an experimental Army program concerned with parapsychology. Manohla Dargis called it a "likable, lightweight, absurdist comedy" in her review for The Times.

Texto completo: Ronan Farrow has threatened to cut ties with Hachette over an upcoming memoir by his father, Woody Allen.
"I was disappointed to learn through press reports that Hachette, my publisher, acquired Woody Allen's memoir after other major publishers refused to do so and concealed the decision from me and its own employees while we were working on 'Catch and Kill,' " the journalist said in a statement posted to Twitter on Tuesday. "I've also told Hachette that a publisher that would conduct itself in this way is one I can't work with in good conscience."
Farrow's 2019 book recounted the challenges he faced while reporting on the allegations of sexual misconduct against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. As Farrow explains in his statement, it is "a book about how powerful men, including Woody Allen, avoid accountability for sexual abuse." The book was published by Hachette imprint Little, Brown.

In his statement, Farrow also blasted the publisher for not fact-checking Allen's upcoming book. His sister Dylan made similar accusations against the publisher Monday.
Dylan's statement called the upcoming autobiography "deeply unsettling and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalized on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men." She said she was never contacted by fact-checkers to verify any information.
"This provides yet another example of the profound privilege that power, money and notoriety affords," she added. "Hachette's complicity in this should be called out for what it is and they should have to answer for it.
Grand Central Publishing, an imprint of the Hachette Book Group, announced Monday that Allen's memoir, "Apropos of Nothing," would be released April 7 in the U.S., France, Germany, Italy and Spain, followed by other "countries around the world." The book was shopped around last year but reportedly attracted little interest from major publishers in the era of #MeToo.
In fact, according to the Associated Press, Grand Central secretly acquired the book in March 2019 after Ben Sevier, the publisher and senior vice president, read a full draft of the memoir.
In a statement to The Times on Tuesday, Dylan Farrow said the publisher "has no interest in fact-checking" and had permitted Allen to continue "perpetuating a false and harmful narrative." She added that her experience being published has been entirely different. "Every word I have published has had to go through a gauntlet of lawyers and fact-checkers. ... The journalists I have worked with always reached out for comment. It is a naked double standard. The lengths to which Hachette has gone through to hide this book's existence from myself and my brother Ronan shows that money, not truth, is their motivation."
Farrow said she did not know what was in the book. A spokesperson for Hachette declined to comment beyond the press release announcing the publication.
According to the New York Times, Hachette Chief Executive Michael Pietsch had explained to Ronan Farrow via email that Hachette's divisions operate independently.
Allen, 84, best known for his movies "Annie Hall" and "Manhattan," is considered among the most influential filmmakers of his time. The director and actor, who starred in many of his own films, has won four Academy Awards.
In 1992, Dylan Farrow, who was then 7, accused Allen of molesting her in the home of her mother, actress Mia Farrow. Despite two separate investigations in the 1990s, Allen was never charged. He went on to direct several hit movies, including "Bullets Over Broadway," "Mighty Aphrodite" and "Match Point."
But in 2014, Farrow renewed her allegations in a New York Times column. Allen spoke out against the allegations in an opinion piece published shortly afterward, calling them "ridiculous."
In the era of #MeToo, Allen suffered professional repercussions. Last year, Amazon backed out of a four-film production deal with the writer-director.
Grand Central described Allen's book as "a comprehensive account of his life, both personal and professional," touching on "his work in films, theater, television, nightclubs and print. Allen also writes of his relationships with family, friends and the loves of his life."
Ronan Farrow and his mother, actress Mia Farrow, have been estranged from Allen for years.

Texto completo: Care was mandated by the government, but it's not clear who has to pay.
Frank Wucinski and his 3-year-old daughter, Annabel, are among the dozens of Americans the government has flown back to the country from Wuhan, China, and put under quarantine to check for signs of coronavirus.
Now they are among what could become a growing number of families hit with surprise medical bills related to government-mandated actions.
Mr. Wucinski, a Pennsylvania native who has lived in China for years, accepted the U.S. government's offer to evacuate from Wuhan with Annabel in early February as the new coronavirus spread. His wife, who is not an American citizen and remains in China, developed pneumonia that doctors think resulted from Covid-19, the disease caused by the respiratory virus. Her father, whom she helped care for, was infected and recently died.
The first stop for Mr. Wucinski and Annabel was a two-week quarantine at Marine Corps Station Miramar near San Diego. During that time, they had two mandatory stays in an isolation unit at a nearby children's hospital. The first started upon arrival in the United States, and the second was a few days later, after an official heard Annabel coughing.
"The hospital staff were very nice, they brought us a lot of toys," Mr. Wucinski said. "Each time it was three or four days. I love my daughter to death, but being in the same room that long, she is not a great conversationalist."
Both have repeatedly tested negative for the virus.
After their release from quarantine, Mr. Wucinski and his daughter went to stay with his mother in Harrisburg, Pa. That's where they found a pile of medical bills waiting: $ 3,918 in charges from hospital doctors, radiologists and an ambulance company.
"I assumed it was all being paid for," Mr. Wucinski said. "We didn't have a choice. When the bills showed up, it was just a pit in my stomach, like, 'How do I pay for this?"'
Mr. Wucinski's employer, a standardized testing company, provided health benefits when he lived in China but does not offer coverage in the United States.
Patients in the United States regularly confront surprise medical bills that are hard to decode. Mr. Wucinski's case suggests that those held in mandatory isolation for suspected coronavirus may be no exception.
The federal government has the authority to quarantine and isolate patients if officials believe them to be a public health threat. These powers, which date back to cholera outbreaks among ship passengers in the late 19th century, are rarely used. They don't say anything about who pays when the isolation happens in a nongovernmental medical facility -- or when they're brought there by a private ambulance company.
"There is no uniform practice," said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. "They do have the powers, but they've almost never used them in modern times."
Few patients have been held in mandatory isolation, but the number is likely to grow if the coronavirus continues to spread across the United States. Eleven cases were confirmed in San Antonio on Friday evening. Earlier in the day, public health authorities identified a second case in California and a first in Oregon in which patients who had not traveled to an affected country became infected.
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman declined to comment on whether it would pay the bills of patients kept in mandatory isolation.
Mr. Gostin worries that high charges for mandatory isolation could make patients wary of seeking needed medical treatment.
"The most important rule of public health is to gain the cooperation of the population," he said. "There are legal, moral and public health reasons not to charge the patients."
These hospital stays could prove expensive. The International Federation of Health Plans estimates that the average day in a U.S. hospital costs $ 4,293, compared with $ 1,308 in Australia and $ 481 in Spain. The hospital stays may be especially costly for patients without health insurance or for those who have large deductibles, which they must pay before their health benefits kick in.
Mr. Wucinski recalls other patients asking about how medical bills would be handled during daily town hall meetings for those quarantined at the Marine Corps station. He felt the answers weren't clear.
He did receive a document upon leaving quarantine directing him to contact a government email address with any medical bills. He sent an email on Feb. 24 detailing the charges and asking what would be done.
"My question is why are we being charged for these stays, if they were mandatory and we had no choice in the matter?" Mr. Wucinski wrote in his message.
He has not received a response, he said. When contacted by The New York Times, a Rady Children's Hospital spokesman said the physicians' bill had been sent in error and that the family would not be held responsible for the charges.
"We're in the process of assessing how the error occurred," the spokesman, Benjamin Metcalf, said. "We are working with government agencies regarding billing for these cases."
But the hospital bill represented only a fraction of those the family received.
The ambulance company that transported the Wucinskis, American Medical Response, charged the family $ 2,598 for taking them to the hospital. A company representative declined to comment on the bill "due to patient privacy concerns," but said the company would look into the case.
An additional $ 90 in charges came from radiologists who read the patients' X-ray scans and do not work for the hospital. Having such doctors, who may be outside a patient's insurance networks, provide services to hospital patients is one of the major causes of surprise medical bills.
The radiologists' employer, San Diego Medical Imaging Group, did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Wucinski is looking into whether he or his daughter might qualify for Medicaid, the public insurance program that covers low-income Americans. Some news outlets have seized on the fact that he coughed enough on a recent television interview to require water.
Mr. Wucinski recently noticed that his daughter is blinking a lot and hopes to get the issue examined by a doctor, but is worried about the charges they may face. He has wondered whether the stress of the past month and the separation from her mother has played a role.
"I should take her to the doctor this week for a checkup, but we don't have insurance, so it's just going to have to be cash," he said.

Texto completo: Aran Bell and Roman Mejia are among the nominees in the dance category. Sophia Anne Caruso and three actors new to Broadway are competing for the theater prize.
Broadway newcomers and two dancers from New York City Ballet's corps de ballet are among the eight finalists for this year's Clive Barnes Awards, the first since the death of its founder Valerie Taylor-Barnes in 2019. The winners, one for dance and one for theater, will be announced on April 6 at a ceremony hosted by the New York Post columnist Michael Riedel.
Ms. Taylor-Barnes, a former soloist at the Royal Ballet in London, created a foundation in 2009 to administer the awards and commemorate her husband Clive Barnes, The New York Times and New York Post theater and dance critic who died in 2008 at 81. The prizes, which come with $ 5,000 for the winners, are meant to recognize promising young performers.
"It was always in Valerie's vision that the Clive Barnes Foundation would live on past her time on earth," said Holly Jones, the organization's co-president. "She started the foundation in Clive's honor but really to support and champion young dancers and actors, who she continued to stay in touch with as time went on."
India Bradley and Roman Mejia, colleagues at New York City Ballet, are up against Kellie Drobnick from Twyla Tharp Dance, and Aran Bell, a recently promoted soloist at American Ballet Theater, for the dance honor. Gia Kourlas noted Mr. Bell's contribution to Alexei Ratmansky's "The Seasons" at American Ballet Theater in her review for The Times last year: "In the commanding role of Winter is an impressive Aran Bell, radiating composure and elegance."
Three of the four theater finalists made their Broadway debut this season: Andrew Burnap starred in "The Inheritance," by Matthew Lopez; Christopher Livingston played dual roles in the Lincoln Center Theater production of Robert Schenkkan's "The Great Society"; and Celia Rose Gooding made a splash in "Jagged Little Pill," the Alanis Morissette jukebox musical. The fourth finalist, Sophia Anne Caruso, was recently performing in "Beetlejuice" on Broadway.
Ben Brantley called Mr. Burnap "electrically vivid" as Toby Darling, a "flamboyant playwright" who, he said, "has a Hidden Past he pretends never happened." Last week, it was announced that "The Inheritance" will close March 15 after a disappointing New York run.
The selection committee for this year's awards includes Diana Byer, the founder and artistic director of New York Theater Ballet, Jenny Chiang, an instructor at the Alvin Ailey School and Frank DiLella, the host of "On Stage," the weekly theater program on NY1.

A Reader, a Letter and a Twist

Texto completo: The Letters desk receives up to 1,000 submissions a day. Here's the story behind one of them.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
My editor pinged me with an email. Subject line: "Caneel reader." Days earlier, we had published a six-month investigation into the closure of Caneel Bay Resort on St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands, territories devastated by hurricanes in 2017.
The email included the name and phone number of the reader, based in Los Angeles, and a request that I call. I dialed. A woman named Michelle, ' answered. She had written a letter to the editor and asked if she could read it aloud. "I don't know if it will be good enough," she said.
As a reporter, I appreciate feedback. Sometimes readers point me to another story or provide a more textured perspective. Other times, I'm given explicit instructions about where to go. Rarely does a reader ask me what I think.
The phone went quiet as she gathered the letter and put on her glasses. In a lilting voice, she recalled the winter of 1965, when her group of friends, just starting a band, pitched their tents on a campsite nestled within the heart of the Virgin Islands National Park.
"We lived in our bathing suits and snorkeled with the millions of fish that swam among the coral reefs," the letter said. "We chartered a catamaran every full moon, dipping in and out of the warm Caribbean, holding onto the nets between the pontoons, laughing our heads off."
Her verse read like a love letter to St. John, or perhaps the opening chapter of a book.
"It was just such a beautiful gem, a part of our lives," she told me, adding that when she learned of the damage inflicted by the storms there: "I did weep."
Most letters that arrive at The New York Times don't come to us like this one: read over the phone and later faxed to our office -- four pages in careful script, like sheet music.
But no matter the form, a letter would be likely to wind up with The Times's Letters desk, a three-person team that typically receives 500 to 1,000 responses a day. In interviews, editors on the Letters team expressed an ethical commitment to reading every one.
"It's a personal thing for me," said Thomas Feyer, who has been the letters editor for some 20 years and who left with his family from communist Hungary in 1956 when he was 3 years old. "It's part of what informs my worldview, the importance of the free flow of ideas in a democracy. That's what we try to promote on the Letters page."
The editors -- Mr. Feyer, Mary Drohan and Sue Mermelstein -- pick about 50 to 70 letters to publish each week on the daily editorial pages, representing a cross-section of opinions. (The Book Review, the Sunday Magazine and the Sunday Metropolitan sections field their own letters. Reader comments on stories online are separate and not considered for print publication.) The team makes revisions for space and accuracy and writes back to those readers individually to review changes and verify their names.
Occasionally, those names are recognizable. James Baldwin, former President Jimmy Carter, Nadine Gordimer, the Rev. Al Sharpton, Susan Sontag, Gloria Steinem and Kurt Vonnegut are among those who've written, individually or with co-authors, over the decades.
While in the mailroom in 2017, Mr. Feyer said he found a small envelope "just sitting on a pile" on the counter. That letter, from the Oscar-winning actor F. Murray Abraham, is one of the few others submitted in handwritten form to be published in recent years.
Over the course of several phone calls with Michelle, I provided a fax number and promised to get her letter to the right person. After embarking on a multifloor journey to hand-deliver the fax, I met Ms. Mermelstein.
"She was a really elegant writer," Ms. Mermelstein recalled. "It didn't need much editing." Instead, she focused on confirming the letter's authenticity.
That's partly because on a later call that I had with Michelle (to confirm the fax), she remarked offhandedly of her friends' time on St. John: "That whole experience is a really big part of the story of the Mamas and the Papas."
She had made a similar reference in her letter -- which I had overlooked. Born decades after the band broke up, I had assumed the name referred to the group of friends' eventual parenthood.
I hung up and Googled: Popping onto my screen was a photograph of the folk rock band that was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and known for top Billboard hits like "California Dreamin"' and "Monday, Monday." The members were listed below the photograph: John Phillips, Cass Elliot, Denny Doherty -- and the last surviving member: Michelle Phillips.
I referenced my call log, which bore her name. I have spent the intervening weeks listening to their music, and I can hear the echo of St. John in their verses.
"I will always cherish those memories shared by that little funky group that became the Mamas and the Papas," Ms. Phillips wrote, "our music then in its embryonic state. That May, we left for California, leaving behind the Virgin Islands dream that had changed our lives forever."

Texto completo: Lee, the Oscar-winning filmmaker, said he would not attend another home game this season. He and James L. Dolan, the team's owner, are at odds because Lee was pulled aside after entering Madison Square Garden on Monday.
Spike Lee, the Oscar-winning filmmaker and most famous fan of the Knicks, has accused the franchise and its owner, James L. Dolan, of repeatedly lying about why he was stopped shortly after entering Madison Square Garden before a game on Monday night.
Lee said he would not be returning for another Knicks home game this season.
"I was praying, hopefully, that the Knicks would put in a good effort, so it could be a competitive game," Lee told The New York Times in a phone interview on Tuesday. "This is the last thing I wanted."
At dispute is which entrance Lee can use to attend games. Lee said he had used an entrance on West 33rd Street for nearly 30 years, including as recently as last week; that entrance is typically reserved for the news media, employees and attendees who are disabled.
But on Monday, as the Knicks prepared to face the Houston Rockets, Lee said he went through the entrance, had his ticket scanned and was stopped by Madison Square Garden staff members, who told him he had to leave and re-enter elsewhere. Lee declined, he said, because his ticket had already been scanned. This led to a heated confrontation, video of which quickly went viral on social media. The Knicks later said -- and Lee denied -- that he had been told several times not to use that entrance.
"The idea that Spike Lee is a victim because we have repeatedly asked him to not use our employee entrance and instead use a dedicated V.I.P. entrance -- which is used by every other celebrity who enters The Garden -- is laughable," the Knicks said in a statement on Tuesday after Lee appeared on ESPN's "First Take" television show to discuss the incident. "It's disappointing that Spike would create this controversy to perpetuate drama."
In an interview with The Times, Lee fired back: "What's laughable is how the Knicks are the laughingstock of the league."
The back-and-forth between Lee and the Knicks, especially the team's cutting statement on Tuesday, seemed to encapsulate the Knicks of the Dolan era. Rather than trying to de-escalate tension, the team alienated an individual who has remained loyal to the franchise through its many lows and who is as linked with the team as any player.
"This press release, which is upsetting me, is an unmitigated, baldfaced lie," Lee said. "Capital letters. On my late mother and my late brother's grave, this is a lie. That they say that they had repeatedly asked me not to use the employee entrance. That is a lie."
Earlier, in a text message to The Times, Lee said, "Dolan is harassing me," echoing comments he made on ESPN.
Lee eventually made it to his usual courtside seat on Monday. At one point he shook hands with Dolan, a gesture shown in a photograph that was tweeted on the Knicks' public relations account on Tuesday. It was accompanied by a statement that said of Lee: "He is welcome to come to The Garden anytime via the V.I.P. entrance; just not through our employee entrance, which is what he and Jim agreed to last night when they shook hands."
Lee told The Times he thought that the photo was "planned," calling it "a set-up photo op."
"At halftime, Mr. Dolan comes to my seat and says, 'We need to talk.' And I said, 'Talk about what?' 'We need to talk.' I said, 'Mr. Dolan, no one told me. I've not been informed by texts, emails, phone calls that there's a new policy on using the employee entrance. No one told me,"' Lee said.
As for the handshake?
Lee initially said he had not shaken Dolan's hand but later acknowledged that he was mistaken.
"If I shook hands, you know what? I was not in my right mind, so I'll retract that statement," Lee said. "First of all, I didn't want to speak to him. It wasn't until halfway through the conversation when I got out of my seat."
Lee said that even before the incident, he did not have much of a relationship with Dolan.
"I went to one picnic," Lee said. "That's it. I'm courteous. If I see him, I say hello. That's it. We're not having any conversation."
In the meantime, Lee said with his well-known cackle, he has already been approached by the Nets, the Knicks' crosstown rivals, to attend games. The Nets took a dig at the Knicks on social media, posting a picture of Lee shaking hands with their star Kevin Durant, along with a caption that said, "What's this about a handshake photo?" The team later deleted the post.
"I'm not going to let anybody take away my love for the orange and blue skies," Lee said, referring to the Knicks' colors. "It's not happening. I wish the Nets luck. But that ain't happening."
This incident was the latest twist in an unusually dramatic season for the Knicks -- even by the franchise's standards for grabbing unwanted headlines. This feud has overshadowed what was supposed to be a jubilant first day of work for the new team president, Leon Rose, and Monday's thrilling 125-123 win over the playoff-bound Rockets.
The Knicks will most likely miss the playoffs for the seventh straight year -- the longest streak of postseason absences for the franchise since the 1960s. After years of attendance numbers that seemed immune to poor on-court performance, the crowds at Knicks games have begun to decline. But Lee, until now, has been a constant.
Now the Knicks will find themselves without one of their most dedicated fans. The conflict recalled the 2017 incident when Dolan barred the beloved former Knick Charles Oakley from the arena.
According to Lee, when staff members stopped him on Monday, he demanded to be arrested like Oakley. During the telephone interview, Lee said he had already heard from Oakley, plus Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner, and Reggie Miller, the former Indiana Pacers guard who bedeviled the Knicks in the 1990s, often mere feet away from Lee. Miller also poked fun at Lee on Twitter on Tuesday, encouraging him to become a Pacers fan.
Lee said he felt that he was being targeted personally by Dolan, but he wouldn't speculate as to why. He added that he wanted Dolan to sell the team -- "but that's not going to happen."
His comments soon turned to the existential.
"I went to bed last night. You know what I was thinking about? Am I going to go to the grave without another banner being raised in the world's most famous arena?" Lee said.
Then he added: "Hey, I don't like to predict the future, but I'm 62 years old. How long have I got left?"

Texto completo: The lawsuit concerns two opinion articles that tied the 2016 Trump election campaign to Russia. A week ago, the campaign filed a similar action against The New York Times.
President Trump's re-election campaign sued The Washington Post for libel on Tuesday, citing two opinion articles from last year that linked Mr. Trump to Russian election interference. The action came a week after Mr. Trump's campaign filed a similar lawsuit against The New York Times.
Mr. Trump's attacks on news organizations have been a defining mark of his presidency, and The Post has been one of his frequent targets. In 2017, the newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles by David Farenthold that examined Mr. Trump's philanthropic claims. The president has often belittled The Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, the billionaire Amazon founder, who bought it in 2013.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, centers on two opinion articles from a Post blog called The Plum Line that accused the 2016 Trump election campaign of inviting help from foreign governments. The Post's opinion section operates separately from its newsroom.
In one post, published on June 13, Greg Sargent wrote that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, had "concluded that Trump and/or his campaign eagerly encouraged, tried to conspire with, and happily profited off" Russia's efforts.
In a post on June 20, Paul Waldman wrote: "Who knows what sort of aid Russia and North Korea will give to the Trump campaign, now that he has invited them to offer their assistance?" The word "invited" in the article was hyperlinked to a transcript of an ABC News interview with Mr. Trump, in which he said he would consider accepting information from a foreign government about a political opponent.
The Trump campaign accused The Post of making "false and defamatory" statements.
"There has never been any statement by anyone associated with the campaign or the administration 'inviting' Russia or North Korea to assist the campaign in 2019 or beyond," the court filing said. "There also has never been any reporting that the campaign has ever had any contact with North Korea relating to any United States election."
A spokeswoman for The Post, Kristine Coratti Kelly, said on Tuesday, "It's disappointing to see the president's campaign committee resorting to these types of tactics, and we will vigorously defend this case."
Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer at Gibson Dunn who has previously worked on high-profile media cases, said the lawsuit "flies in the face of basic First Amendment doctrine."
"The complaint is attacking opinions where the authors are expressing their views based on widely reported facts," he said. "It's all part of the overarching war on the press."
Mr. Trump's re-election campaign sued The Times on Feb. 26, claiming that an essay published in the newspaper's Opinion section last March falsely asserted a "quid pro quo" between Russian officials and Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign. (Like The Post, The Times's Opinion section is separate from its newsroom.)
In both lawsuits, the campaign is represented by Charles J. Harder, a lawyer who has worked on a number of legal battles with news organizations.
Mr. Harder is best known for representing Terry G. Bollea, the former professional wrestler known as Hulk Hogan, in a lawsuit that decimated Gawker Media and was secretly underwritten by the tech investor Peter Thiel.
He also represented Melania Trump, Mr. Trump's wife, when she sued The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, in 2016 over its report that a modeling agency she had worked for in the 1990s was also an escort service. The Daily Mail later retracted the article and paid damages in a settlement.

Texto completo: The legal authority for some F.B.I. surveillance tools expires next week, and law enforcement officials and lawmakers are divided.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump met on Tuesday at the White House with Attorney General William P. Barr and key Republican lawmakers in an effort to resolve a fight in Congress over domestic spying powers before three F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation tools expire next week.
The meeting came as a range of surveillance critics on Capitol Hill -- from liberal advocates of civil liberties to conservative allies of President Trump who have been critical of the Russia investigation -- were seeking to restrict the F.B.I.'s authorities. They want to attach changes to legislation to reauthorize the three provisions run out on March 15.
No clear resolution came out of the meeting, according to congressional officials briefed on it. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Mr. Barr made a case for passing a bill that would simply extend the expiring provisions without changes, relying on rules changes Mr. Barr could make on his own.
But several House Republicans pushed for a bill that would impose sharp new limits on national security wiretapping -- and Mr. Trump appeared to be more sympathetic to the idea of a sweeping overhaul, too, according to the officials. Mr. Barr met afterward with some of those House lawmakers, including Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of Mr. Trump's staunchest supporters in Congress, to discuss such restrictions, according to two administration officials.
It is far from clear, however, whether any legislation that makes substantive changes to surveillance law can pass both chambers before March 15.
Other voices at the meeting, like Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, argued for a short-term extension of the expiring provisions -- such as for a month -- to permit time to draft a bill. Mr. Graham noted that the expiring tools were different than the wiretapping in the Russia investigation that Mr. Trump and his allies widely denounced.
But for that to work, Mr. Trump would need to sign any extension into law. The president has a history of volatility on surveillance issues, responding to Fox News commentators but displaying little grasp of the legal policy details of national security surveillance. Mr. Barr has stepped in to float the idea that he could tighten many rules on F.B.I. wiretapping on his own.
Further, some longtime libertarian-leaning members of Mr. Trump's own party -- including several who attended the meeting, like Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky -- want to seize the moment to install more sweeping changes through legislation.
Disagreements among Democrats over whether proposed changes go too far or not far enough have already derailed legislation in the House, and the determination of some would-be reformers to capitalize on the window of opportunity created by the deadline heightened the possibility of an impasse allowing the tools to expire without any overhaul.
Mr. Trump's frequent complaints about surveillance whipped up new levels of support among some of his congressional allies for broad new restrictions on the F.B.I. The president has pointed to its wiretapping of his former campaign adviser Carter Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, as evidence that the bureau abused its power in an effort to undermine him.
Though an inspector general inquiry found serious mistakes with the wiretapping of Mr. Page, it did not find evidence to support the narrative pushed by Mr. Trump and his allies that the high-level F.B.I. officials conspired to weaponize FISA against him.
Before the meeting, Mr. McConnell said he would try to prevent an outcome in which gridlock allowed the provisions to lapse, but acknowledged significant differences of opinion among members of Congress.
"Whether we can resolve those and pass new legislation is unclear," Mr. McConnell said at his weekly news conference in the Capitol. "If we are unable to resolve our differences, my preference would be for another extension, which would give us more time to talk."
While Mr. McConnell and many Republican senators want to largely leave the surveillance powers intact, deferring to Mr. Barr to make policy changes within the Justice Department to address concerns raised by Mr. Trump, some of their most vocal opponents come from within Republican ranks.
Before the meeting, Mr. Lee said that extending the expiring provisions without revising the FISA law was "one of the dumbest things we could do." He called such a move "policy and political malpractice" and said it would happen "over my dead body."
Democrats have their own internal disputes, with national security-minded moderates facing off with progressives driven by what they see as undue infringement on civil liberties. The tensions burst into the open last week, when a senior Democratic lawmaker effectively derailed a bill negotiated by two House chairmen that would have extended most of the expiring powers while putting in place some new limits to FISA and allowing a dysfunctional and defunct National Security Agency call records program to lapse.
The Democratic lawmaker, Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, planned to offer amendments backed by progressives and some Republicans that would have curtailed surveillance, including requiring a "friend of the court" be appointed to critique the government's arguments whenever it applied for a warrant to spy on Americans.
The main Democratic bill -- backed by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who negotiated it with the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York -- would also expand the role for such a so-called amicus.
But it would have significantly less operational consequence. The Nadler-Schiff bill would call for the appointment of a critic when a FISA warrant request would affect First Amendment activities like a political campaign or religious worship, as opposed to every time any American is targeted.
Mr. Schiff said on Tuesday that he was leading last-minute talks with Ms. Lofgren and other progressive lawmakers to try to find a compromise. But with time dwindling, he had yet to close the gap.
"We are trying to arrive at an agreement on when an amicus would be called for, how long business records should be retained," Mr. Schiff said in an interview.
But Democratic leaders in the House concede that it is increasingly likely they will simply have to accept whatever the Senate passes and sends to the House for consideration -- likely a short-term extension of the powers -- or let the program lapse and deal with the consequences.
The Justice Department first moved to impose more oversight over the FISA process in December, when its inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, released the scathing results of an investigation into the wiretapping of Mr. Page. The report found several instances where law enforcement officials seeking permission to wiretap his phone calls and emails gave the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court incomplete or incorrect information about Mr. Page.
Mr. Horowitz did not find evidence that the agent responsible for most of the problems was politically biased against Mr. Trump. But he rejected the explanation that he and his supervisors were simply busy with other aspects of the Russia investigation.

Texto completo: Health care providers and other readers worry about inadequate testing, quarantines and protective equipment.
To the Editor:
Re "C.D.C.'s Missteps in Screening Left Potential for Virus's Spread" (front page, March 3):
I am a doctor. It is a privilege to take care of patients. When I am on call, I perform surgery that saves lives. The feeling of gratification is indescribable. I love my job.
I am a mother. It is a privilege to raise my children. When they smile at me with pure joy over a shared joke or an accomplishment, the feeling of gratification is indescribable. I love my family.
We have a shortage of personal protective equipment for health care workers. At the health facilities where I work, I was told that suppliers would no longer ship regular supplies of N95 respirator masks because of a shortage. In countries with inadequate protections, health care workers are dying.
Unless the shortage of personal protective equipment is rectified immediately, health care workers will be faced with a difficult choice: Do I do my job and risk my own life and that of my family, or do I stay home from work knowing that patients will die from lack of medical care?
What would you do?

Re "Tapping Private Labs, U.S. Seeks Nearly a Million Tests This Week" (front page, March 3):
Vice President Mike Pence said at his news conference Monday that travelers arriving from one of the coronavirus hot spots, such as South Korea or northern Italy, are being screened -- their temperature is taken and they are asked about symptoms. However, they are not being quarantined for 14 days.
This is completely unacceptable. A person who is not showing signs of an infection might still be incubating the disease. This is the whole basis for the concept of quarantine.
The current policy means that, if asymptomatic, a person arriving from a coronavirus hot spot is free to go to work the next day, whether in a hospital, a classroom or a large office building.
How can we hope to contain the coronavirus outbreak if we continue to allow fresh cases to arrive from abroad?

To the Editor:
Of course Covid-19 is underreported. On Friday night I showed symptoms of flu -- cough, aches, fever, chills -- the worst I've ever felt. Because I had a flu shot this winter, I emailed my doctor to see if I should be tested for the coronavirus.
Since test kits were not widely available, he encouraged me to get an oximeter (measures the estimated oxygen saturation of red blood cells). I am to monitor at home, and if my oxygen saturation drops beneath 92, consider proceeding to the emergency room.
So far, I have stayed in home isolation and have been hovering around 93. So, here is the problem with reporting. If I am lucky enough to stay above 92 and heal on my own, I will never know if I had the coronavirus and spread it to others while asymptomatic. Nor will others know.
I have elected to stay in isolation for two weeks for the greater good, and I am sure I'm not alone. We are not prepared.

To the Editor:
I am a doctor on the front lines seeing cough and fever all day long. On Saturday I saw approximately 40 pediatric patients in 12 hours. We had a very limited supply of personal protective equipment for our entire urgent care. We also had to go to YouTube to remind ourselves how to don the gear. Where is the C.D.C. leadership? Meanwhile, patients with fever and cough keep coming in without wearing masks and sitting next to 6-week-olds.
I worry that I am sending children with high fever and cough home, children who are negative for the flu, knowing full well that this could be the coronavirus. I am glad to hear that more test kits are being made available nationwide and that some relaxing of the criteria to test a patient has happened.
This is still not enough, though, since most coronavirus patients will not meet even the new guidelines for testing. Doing some random testing would be helpful to at least learn about how many in the community are already positive.
Otherwise, we as health care workers will be the canaries in the coal mine.

To the Editor:
As "Avoiding the Virus May Be Unaffordable" (Business, March 2) pointed out, many people cannot afford to miss work and/or do not have sick days to use. When Congress considers adequate funding for the virus response, it should add funds to reimburse employees who are quarantined for time lost at work. Obviously, medical verification of the quarantine must be required.
Without such funding, many sick individuals will hide their symptoms and continue to work, thus endangering co-workers and the public. If our response to this pandemic is to be effective, it must account for the economic reality of Americans with limited incomes.

To the Editor:
Please stop publishing photographs of well persons wearing face masks during this Covid-19 outbreak. I know these images are compelling, but The Times is sending the wrong message. These photos encourage the inappropriate use of masks, may contribute to a shortage of masks, and don't emphasize the important prevention messages about hand washing, cough and sneeze hygiene, and social distancing.
As the number of infections increases in this country, masks should be reserved for sick persons and their caregivers.

Texto completo: "They are prisoners with no information in there," said a relative of a resident of the nursing center where dozens of patients remain, waiting in their rooms.
SEATTLE -- The first public indication that something was wrong inside the Life Care nursing care center in Kirkland, Wash., came on Friday, prompting an alarming sign to go up on the front door: "WE ARE HAVING RESPIRATORY OUTBREAK."
Since then, officials have announced a series of coronavirus cases, some of them fatal, from the facility, which has become an ominous symbol of the dangers the virus poses.
On Tuesday, the authorities made another jarring announcement: The first virus-related deaths tied to the nursing center occurred days earlier than previously known -- and well before residents had been quarantined in their rooms.
A man in his 50s, who was rushed from the facility in a Seattle suburb to a hospital on Feb. 24, died last Wednesday. On the same day, another patient from the center, a woman in her 80s, died at her family home. Both of their deaths have now been attributed to the coronavirus.
The ire of the relatives of those inside was growing with each new revelation.
"Because these are elderly and infirm people, it's like we are waiting for them to be picked off, one by one," said Kevin Connolly, whose 81-year-old father-in-law, Jerry Wall, has been at Life Care for about a year, recovering from heart and kidney failure.
Mr. Connolly said about 65 families with relatives in the facility have been in touch after Life Care emailed the families a generic update yesterday but left their email addresses visible. "Everybody on that thread started sharing their stories," said Jodi Connolly, who said that her father's regular nurse was not working and that he had not been told why.
"They are prisoners with no information in there," she said.
The news that two people from the center died of coronavirus days before officials identified the emerging crisis suggested that the virus had been circulating inside the facility even longer than had been understood. That means it may have been a threat to visitors, workers and residents for days, widening the circle of people who may be at risk.
Nowhere else in the country has been known to have been hit as hard by the virus as Kirkland.
Seven residents of the Life Care center were dead from the virus, and seven other people with connections to the home had been sickened by it. One visitor to the center apparently traveled home to North Carolina before testing positive for the virus, an outcome North Carolina officials announced on Tuesday.
Dr. Chris Spitters, the health officer in Snohomish County, north of Seattle, said resources have become stretched in a way that limits how much officials can focus on any one case.
"Really, we're kind of having to triage our efforts," he said.
Across Washington State, nine people have died, the only deaths in the United States in a coronavirus crisis that has killed 3,000 people worldwide. State officials also announced that several more people have been sickened, including two people in their 20s who were hospitalized in the Seattle suburb of Issaquah. On Tuesday, Amazon told employees via email that a worker in one of its many office buildings in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood had tested positive for the virus.
Dr. Manisha Juthani, an associate professor at Yale School of Medicine who studies infectious diseases in older populations, said it was sad but not unexpected that the virus had reached a nursing facility and, once there, caused multiple deaths.
"Are we going to see this again in other facilities?" Dr. Juthani said. "Unfortunately, I wouldn't be surprised if we do."
In Kirkland, a quarter of the city's firefighters and a few police officers have been asked to isolate themselves after they visited the nursing center. A dozen of them had flulike symptoms, an official said.
Families of the nursing facility residents were growing increasingly anxious as residents continued to be kept inside the center, and visits were not allowed.
"I went from not worrying much to being really worried now," said Debbie Delosangeles, who said in an interview with The New York Times on Monday that she had been told that her 85-year-old mother had been symptom free. On Tuesday, she learned that her mother's health had declined. Workers told Ms. Delosangeles that they would treat her mother for her high fever but did not intend to test her for coronavirus unless she developed breathing problems.
Bridget Parkhill said her 77-year-old mother had been sick inside the facility for nearly a week, and had a breathing issue for a short while, but had not been tested.
"Mom found out today that a friend that would come see her all the time was in the hospital and not doing well," Ms. Parkhill said. She said she had visited the facility and walked around the exterior, to see her mother through a window.
Officials at the Life Care center have said that they were following federal protocol and were doing the best they could given a chaotic situation. At Harborview Medical Center, where one person has died, officials were working to determine which staff members may have been exposed to the virus.
Officials in Washington State were rushing to take steps to contain the spread. Health officials were asking the State Legislature for an additional $ 100 million in funding to help respond to the virus. Some leaders were weighing widespread closings of events.
Businesses, schools and houses of worship altered their practices. Amazon and Microsoft have turned events related to International Women's Day later this week into online meetings. The Archdiocese of Seattle indefinitely postponed an annual Mass and dance for people with disabilities that had been set for Saturday. And a baseball league for youths told parents that players would be discouraged from giving high-fives and handshakes.
Officials from the Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday that they were closing a Seattle field office of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services after an employee visited the Kirkland nursing care facility and developed symptoms of illness. The employee had been going to work after the visit but before getting sick.
Dr. Spitters, the health officer in Snohomish County, said officials may get to a point where they need to limit public gatherings, such as high school basketball games and conventions.
"These things could end up becoming temporarily discouraged, if not prohibited," Dr. Spitters said.

Texto completo: The New York Times asked the candidates about their plans for housing and homelessness. They back many of the same programs, but are split on national rent control and a renter's tax credit.
More than 550,000 people in the United States are homeless on any given night. More than 18 million spend more than half of their income on housing. And there is no state in which the number of affordable homes matches the number of low-income households.
Affordable housing, or the lack thereof, is a crisis no matter which way you slice it, and has been for many years. But it has never gotten as much attention in a presidential campaign as it is getting now, with candidates proposing hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending and terms like redlining and Section 8 starring in stump speeches.
And the public debate over housing and homelessness has grown increasingly prominent in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday, such as California, where the crisis has been particularly acute.
A new survey of the Democratic candidates on a variety of housing policies, conducted last week by The New York Times, finds they are largely united on offering incentives for affordable development and increasing tenant protections. But the responses to the questionnaire also revealed significant differences, including on rent control.
Of the five candidates still in the race, three -- Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York -- completed the survey.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. did not complete it, but he recently released a housing plan, and where possible, The Times used that to determine his positions. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii did not complete the survey and has not released a plan.
Advocates both for tenants and for the housing industry agree that supply is at the core of the affordable housing crisis. By some estimates, the United States would need seven million more affordable rental units to meet demand, and as of 2018, there was no state in which the number of affordable homes matched the number of low-income households, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
In fact, in eight states -- including the two most populous, California and Texas, both of which vote on Tuesday -- there were 30 or fewer affordable homes per 100 very low-income households.
The candidates want to sharply increase funding for an array of programs that help states and localities build affordable housing or create incentives for private developers to do so.
Mr. Sanders, for instance, is proposing nearly $ 1.5 trillion in funding over 10 years for the National Housing Trust Fund, which is tasked with creating permanently affordable units. Ms. Warren would increase funding for that program by $ 445 billion, and Mr. Biden by $ 20 billion.
Mr. Sanders also wants to add $ 15 billion "to purchase and revitalize abandoned properties" on behalf of historically disadvantaged groups, and $ 500 million for the Agriculture Department's Section 515 program for rural housing.
Ms. Warren would provide $ 25 billion for the Capital Magnet Fund, which builds homes for low- and middle-class households, and $ 4 billion for a "middle-class housing emergency fund." Mr. Biden would create a $ 100 billion affordable housing fund.
All of them want to push cities to change exclusionary zoning rules that perpetuate segregation: Mr. Bloomberg, for instance, said he would tie federal infrastructure funding to rezoning efforts and provide $ 10 billion for municipalities "that offer the best solutions to restrictive zoning."
"We're very encouraged by how there's a general consensus among all the candidates that the nationwide housing shortage is the root cause of this affordability crisis," said Greg Brown, senior vice president for government affairs at the National Apartment Association, an advocacy group for the rental housing industry. "If you can break down some of the physical barriers and the regulatory barriers to the development of new supply, you can address that challenge."
The candidates also agree that the government should help low-income Americans afford down payments; that homeless shelters should not be able to discriminate against transgender people, as the Trump administration wants to allow; and that source-of-income discrimination, in which some landlords refuse to accept Section 8 housing vouchers, should be banned.
That is an area where tenant and industry groups diverge, and the candidates are much more aligned with the tenant advocates. The National Apartment Association, for instance, supports expanding the Section 8 program to cover more people but argues that landlords should not be required to accept the vouchers.
Most of the candidates support a "just cause" requirement for evictions and want to repeal the Faircloth Amendment, which effectively prohibits the construction of new public housing. (Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren were united on those two policies; Mr. Biden's and Ms. Gabbard's positions are unclear.) They generally want to expand access to federally backed mortgages.
Notably, the three candidates who completed the survey all agreed with the statement that "the federal government has an obligation to proactively address racially discriminatory housing policies from the past."
The candidates' responses reflect a shift not only in the amount of attention being paid to housing issues, but also in the direction of the focus.
"To the extent that housing has ever been talked about in previous presidential campaigns, it's almost always been related to middle-class homeownership," said Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. "This time, it's almost entirely about the housing needs for lowest-income renters and people experiencing homelessness, where the solutions are most needed."
The differences between the candidates' plans, Ms. Yentel added, "are, for the most part, a matter of scale." But there are a few significant points of disagreement.
Mr. Sanders, for instance, is the only candidate calling for a national rent control law. Specifically, he wants to limit annual rent increases to 3 percent or 1.5 times the Consumer Price Index, whichever is higher. Landlords could apply for waivers if they made significant improvements to an apartment or building.
"Landlords cannot be allowed to raise rents to whatever they want, whenever they want," Mr. Sanders's campaign wrote in response to the survey, adding that he would encourage states and cities to enact even stricter rent control.
Ms. Warren's campaign said that she did not want a federal rent control law but that she "strongly supports state and local rent control efforts, which she believes will be more effective at protecting renters from unacceptable rent increases while ensuring adequate affordable housing supply."
Mr. Bloomberg said he opposed national rent control, and Mr. Biden's plan does not mention it.
The candidates are evenly split on the question of a tax credit for renters, and not along the usual ideological lines: Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders support it, while Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Warren do not.
Under Mr. Biden's plan, renters would receive the credit if their rent and utilities exceeded 30 percent of their income, and the credit would be large enough to bring the costs down to that 30 percent mark. He said he would allocate $ 5 billion a year for the credit, which would help "low-income individuals and families who may make too much money to qualify for a Section 8 voucher but still struggle to pay their rent."
Mr. Sanders's campaign said that while he supported a renter's tax credit, it "must be paired with rent control to ensure it is not a windfall for real estate investors." Landlords should not be allowed to raise rents at will "and then have the federal government subsidize those rent increases," he said.
Ms. Warren, by contrast, said that while she supported "robust funding" for rental assistance programs, the housing crisis was rooted in a lack of supply, and that she wanted to focus on policies that would address the shortage of affordable housing.
Individual proposals, especially ones as forceful as national rent control, are subjects of disagreement among advocates and experts -- and, of course, among candidates. But rarely has the debate played out on such a large stage.
"After decades of chronic underinvestment by Congress, it is remarkable that presidential hopefuls are now using their platforms to elevate the housing crisis and its solutions," Ms. Yentel said. "Candidates are talking more substantively about solutions to the housing crisis than perhaps any presidential campaign in history, and we're still eight months out from the election."

Texto completo: As we watch the returns roll in on Tuesday night, a key threshold could make all the difference.
Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.
Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.
A lot has happened in the Democratic presidential campaign over the past 24 hours or so: Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar are ending their bids and planning to throw their weight behind Joe Biden, who has also picked up endorsements from the former Senate majority leader Harry Reid and a number of other Democratic Party officials.
On Super Tuesday eve, the contours of this race are shifting fast.
The big question heading into voting tomorrow is whether Mr. Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg can stop the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders by consolidating some of the anti-Sanders vote.
As I watch the returns roll in tomorrow night at New York Times headquarters, I'm going to be looking to one number for an answer: 15 percent.
That's the critical hurdle that candidates must clear to win delegates in the 14 states holding primaries on Super Tuesday. (As we know, the campaign for the Democratic nomination is a race for delegates -- not for the popular vote.)
Why does this 15 percent threshold matter so much? Well, take a look at what happened in Nevada.
Mr. Sanders won about one-third of the raw votes from the first stage of the caucuses there last month. But when other candidates who did not hit 15 percent were excluded (to oversimplify the caucus process a bit), Mr. Sanders eventually won 24 of Nevada's 36 pledged delegates.
In the end, he turned one-third of the raw vote into two-thirds of the delegates.
A similar process could play out on a much broader scale tomorrow evening.
Primaries are simpler than caucuses, but they still follow the Democrats' 15 percent rule. Delegates are allocated both statewide and by congressional district; a candidate must win at least 15 percent of the vote, either statewide or in a district, to be eligible for those delegates.
Polling shows that only Mr. Sanders is positioned to break the threshold across all the states and in most districts. The more candidates who don't clear 15 percent, the better the night will be for him. But the more places where multiple candidates hit that 15 percent mark, the more it will cut into Mr. Sanders's expected delegate lead.
Here's how this could play out.
Let's pick a congressional district: California's 19th, which includes San Jose. It awards six delegates.
And let's say Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren all break the threshold. The delegates would be split proportionally among them, meaning Mr. Sanders would get, at most, four delegates out of the district. But if only Mr. Sanders breaks 15 percent, he captures all six delegates.
Now, multiply that kind of math by the whole state of California, which has 415 pledged delegates -- 271 apportioned based on the results in the state's 53 congressional districts and 144 awarded by statewide vote -- and you can see how those small gains really start to add up.
In the contests so far, Mr. Sanders has benefited from the fact that many of his rivals failed to break that 15 percent threshold. In Iowa and New Hampshire, he captured about a quarter of the vote. In South Carolina, he won about 20 percent. Yet he still leads the delegate race, with 39 percent of the delegates awarded so far.
Now, with Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar out of the race, the question is whether their supporters might help put Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Bloomberg over that 15 percent mark in enough states and districts to prevent Mr. Sanders from building an insurmountable lead.
It's unclear whether the voters backing Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar will follow their lead and flip to Mr. Biden. Some of their supporters presumably cast their ballots already, given that several million early votes have been cast across the Super Tuesday states, according to Democratic strategists. And voters don't always stay within ideological lanes: At least one poll shows that Mr. Sanders is the most popular second choice of Buttigieg backers.
By the time all of Tuesday's votes are counted, a 300- or 400-delegate advantage for Mr. Sanders would be nearly impossible for his rivals to overcome later in the race.
If the anti-Sanders wing of the party is going to stop his rise, Super Tuesday is when it would happen. And breaking 15 percent is how.

The mad last dash to Super Tuesday (or in some cases, just a last dash)
The final days before the Super Tuesday primaries are always a blur of states, rallies and campaigning. Here's a taste of what the trail is like from our candidate reporters.
Reid Epstein, covering Pete Buttigieg: Before Mr. Buttigieg dropped out, he was in North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama on Saturday and Sunday. It felt a bit like a farewell tour, and in the end, it was. But we haven't heard the last from the 38-year-old former South Bend mayor. He's likely to be an eager surrogate for Mr. Biden, and don't forget the chant at his withdrawal speech: "Twenty-twenty-four, twenty-twenty-four."
Nick Corasaniti, covering Amy Klobuchar: The Klomentum has finally come to a halt. Smack in the middle of a four-day, 11-state swing, Ms. Klobuchar decided to drop out and endorse Joe Biden tonight at a rally in Dallas. Though she was coming off two consecutive sixth-place finishes in Nevada and South Carolina, Ms. Klobuchar was pinning her Super Tuesday hopes on a win in her home state, Minnesota. Now that she's dropped out, Minnesota and its 75 delegates could be a prime pickup for Mr. Sanders, who won the state in the 2016 primary, or perhaps for someone else.
Sydney Ember, covering Bernie Sanders: By the time polls begin to close on Tuesday, Bernie Sanders will have been in eight states in six days (South Carolina, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Virginia, California, Utah, Minnesota, Vermont) as he looks to amass an insurmountable delegate lead on Super Tuesday. The swing has been frantic and exhausting -- Mr. Sanders himself has seemed somewhat drained by the end of some days, with a hoarse voice -- but his campaign is optimistic and determined heading into Tuesday.
Katie Glueck, covering Joe Biden: Mr. Biden split his time on Saturday between South Carolina, which he won resoundingly, and North Carolina, and then jetted to Alabama overnight. He participated in a ceremony and church service in remembrance of "Bloody Sunday" in Selma, then headed to Norfolk, Va., for a raucous rally -- something he virtually never had in the heavily white states of Iowa and New Hampshire. He spent Monday campaigning in Texas. The mood in the Biden camp is, as one donor put it, euphoric. He faces enormous challenges on Super Tuesday, but there is the sense that he's back in the game and that a number of external dynamics -- Mr. Buttigieg's exit from the race, for example -- are breaking his way. Super Tuesday, which will unfold in states where he has been vastly outspent and out-organized, will test how long that good mood lasts.
Tom Kaplan, covering Michael Bloomberg: Mr. Bloomberg campaigned in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama and Texas over the weekend before traveling to Washington to address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Monday. Then he returned to Virginia, and he planned to spend Tuesday in Florida, which votes on March 17. Mr. Biden's comeback is adding to the uncertainty for Mr. Bloomberg in Tuesday's contests. A moment from the weekend that did not inspire confidence in Mr. Bloomberg's standing: When he and Mr. Biden appeared at the same church in Selma on Sunday, Mr. Biden was greeted enthusiastically, while Mr. Bloomberg faced a very different reception, with some attendees standing and turning their backs on him while he spoke.
Astead Herndon, covering Elizabeth Warren: Ms. Warren has, as she calls it, persisted through disappointing results in the early states. In the last four days, she has attended rallies in Arkansas, Texas, California and South Carolina, and on Super Tuesday she will be in Michigan, which votes March 10. There continues to be pressure on her to drop out of the race, thrust on her by supporters of Mr. Sanders who see the moderate wing consolidating. However, that is an unlikely result: Ms. Warren wants to pitch herself as an alternative to Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg. She is set to give a speech in Los Angeles tonight.
... Seriously
Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar were really holding down the average age!

Texto completo: "It's becoming clear that in order for us to win this nomination, that road clearly flows through Joe Biden," Bernie Sanders's campaign manager said.
ST. PAUL, Minn. -- On Sunday night, Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Senator Bernie Sanders, received a call from his onetime boss and longtime mentor, former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada.
Mr. Reid was delivering disappointing news: He planned to endorse former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., who was quickly emerging as Mr. Sanders's chief rival in the presidential primary.
The call would set off a whirlwind 24 hours for the Sanders campaign, which just days earlier had seemed as if it was on a runaway train to the Democratic nomination. Hours after Mr. Reid's phone call, as Mr. Sanders prepared to host a rally in Salt Lake City, news broke that Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a moderate, planned to drop out of the race and endorse Mr. Biden. Reports also flowed in that Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who had dropped out Sunday night, would back Mr. Biden, too.
The swiftness of the coalescence around Mr. Biden caught the Sanders team off guard. Even after Mr. Biden handily won in South Carolina on Saturday, beating Mr. Sanders by nearly 30 percentage points, aides had spent Sunday reluctant to declare the primary a two-person race between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden. By Monday afternoon, however, everyone on the campaign recognized the new dynamics.
"We always anticipated that there would be consolidation of an establishment side," Mr. Shakir said in an interview Monday night. "It's one thing to know it's going to happen, and it's another thing to watch it happen so very quickly."
"Because of the swiftness with which it moved," he added, "it's becoming clear that in order for us to win this nomination, that road clearly flows through Joe Biden."
As the contours of the race heading into Super Tuesday became more apparent, the campaign began reaching out to progressive groups and politicians, Mr. Shakir said, hoping to consolidate more support quickly. It also hashed out a strategy that involved drawing more explicit contrasts to Mr. Biden.
The campaign plans to be on the air with advertisements in key states that will vote on March 10 and March 17, including Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Arizona; the ad blitz will include a spot about Mr. Biden's record on Social Security. It is considering running an ad in Midwestern states like Michigan and Ohio -- where both candidates are competing for an overlapping slice of white working-class voters -- that will emphasize Mr. Biden's record on trade, including his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Sanders campaign also circulated a memo to surrogates and supporters highlighting "the contrasts that we expect to now be in the spotlight as we head into Super Tuesday and beyond."
"We are now entering the phase of the primary in which the differences between Bernie and Biden will take center stage," the memo said. "These differences make clear that the choice between these two candidates is stark."
Since Mr. Sanders got into the race a year ago, his top advisers have ached for a two-way race with Mr. Biden, viewing the moderate former vice president as the perfect foil for Mr. Sanders's promise of a political revolution: a throwback Democrat who touts his ability to work with Republicans and who has been criticized by rivals for telling donors that under a Biden administration, "nothing would fundamentally change."
But the reality of such a direct confrontation with Mr. Biden, a five-decade fixture in Washington politics, poses challenges for Mr. Sanders, whose style of grass-roots politics and long history as an outsider means he cannot muster the same kind of institutional forces. Instead, he relies on a loyal army of individual donors who give $ 18 at a time, and a progressive network that for all of its ambition remains in some ways disjointed and uncoordinated.
"There's a reason the establishment has power, keeps power and maintains powers, because these are the things that they do well," Mr. Shakir said.
Complicating matters, Mr. Sanders's chief ideological rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, remains in the race despite finishing out of the top two in all of the first four nominating contests -- including a distant fifth in South Carolina. Though there have been fissures in the united facade their two campaigns presented for much of the primary race, Sanders aides respect her and do not want to publicly pressure her to drop out.
"We respect the fact that she's going to make whatever decision she makes, and she should be allowed to do that," Mr. Shakir said, adding that she "should be given the time and space" to determine her path forward.
He declined to say whether the two campaigns had discussed efforts to consolidate the liberal wing of the party.
Even before Mr. Reid's phone call, the Sanders campaign had been gearing up for a showdown with Mr. Biden. On Sunday, it announced it would be up on the air in nine more states this week. In the days leading up to Tuesday, Mr. Sanders went on a frenetic, exhausting swing of states that at times left him hoarse, holding especially enormous rallies in Los Angeles, Boston and Northern Virginia.
Speaking to reporters Monday morning during a rally in Salt Lake City, Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager, struck a confident tone, saying that the campaign was not nervous about any of the recent developments and that it did not intend to change its strategy.
"Watching the campaign, watching the 10 debates unfold, we believe they have constantly shown that Bernie is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump, and that's still the case," Mr. Rabin-Havt said. "And we think we still are in a very strong position heading into Super Tuesday."
During that rally, Mr. Sanders made no mention of Ms. Klobuchar's decision to drop out of the race and endorse Mr. Biden, nor did he talk about Mr. Reid.
But earlier in the day he told reporters: "We are taking on the establishment. And I fully understand, no great surprise to me, that establishment politicians are not going to endorse us."
As the day wore on, however, the campaign realized the scale of the effort to block Mr. Sanders's path to the nomination. Mr. Shakir blasted out a tweet calling Mr. Reid's endorsement "disappointing," in what became something of a call to arms for Sanders supporters.
By Monday night -- when Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Buttigieg and former Representative Beto O'Rourke were joining Mr. Biden in Texas for a public show of support -- the Sanders campaign began to put some of its new strategy into play, and the candidate himself displayed more public urgency.
At a rally in St. Paul, Minn., before thousands of supporters, he laced into Mr. Biden for his record on Social Security, bankruptcy and his vote to authorize the war in Iraq.
"Joe is a decent guy," Mr. Sanders said, as the crowd began to boo. "He's just wrong on the issues. He's just wrong with regard to his vision for the future."
He reserved his most cutting remarks for Mr. Biden's record on trade.
"Here in the Midwest and all across this country, we have lost millions of good paying manufacturing jobs because of disastrous trade agreements," Mr. Sanders said, his target firmly in sight. "Joe Biden voted for those trade agreements. Does anybody think that Joe can go to Michigan or Wisconsin or Indiana or Minnesota, and say, 'Vote for me, I voted for those terrible trade agreements'? I don't think so."
And in a flash of magnanimity Mr. Sanders encouraged Buttigieg and Klobuchar supporters to join him instead of Mr. Biden.
"The door is open," he said, grinning. "Come on in!"

With Suppliers in China Hobbled, India Curbs Exports of Vital Drugs

Texto completo: The outbreak has hobbled Chinese factories that supply India's vast drug industry with ingredients for antibiotics and vitamins, raising the prospect of global shortages.
MUMBAI, India -- The spreading coronavirus may soon affect people's health in a different way: The outbreak is now starting to hurt the supply of essential drugs.
Drug makers are struggling to get vital raw ingredients for common antibiotics and vitamins from Chinese factories, which were closed for weeks as China battled to contain the coronavirus. Now, even as some of the country's factories have restarted, shortages of some drugs may develop.
The disruption is being felt most acutely in India, where the authorities on Tuesday ordered the country's vast pharmaceutical industry to stop exporting 26 drugs and drug ingredients, most of them antibiotics, without explicit government permission.
That's a problem for the rest of the world, which relies on India's drug makers for much of its supply of generic drugs. India exported about $ 19 billion of drugs last year and accounted for about one-fifth of the world's exports of generics by volume, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation.
The shortage of Chinese drug ingredients is the latest example of the global economy's dependence on products made in China, from iPhones to auto parts. Last month, Apple cut its sales expectations, partly because production of its gadgets was ramping up more slowly than expected as China reopened its factories. Much of the fallout may still be hidden and is likely to play out over months.
India's decision to limit drug exports was particularly delicate since other countries rely on its manufacturers. On Tuesday, one Indian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the government wanted to ensure an adequate supply of medicines for Indians before allowing exports.
Last week, the Food and Drug Administration warned that one undisclosed drug was already in short supply in the United States because of problems related to the virus outbreak. The agency said it was watching about 20 other drugs whose manufacturers relied solely on China for finished products or active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Dr. Stephen Hahn, the head of the F.D.A., told the Senate Health Committee on Tuesday that the agency had learned of India's export curb that morning.
"We're working very closely to look at that list to assess how that will affect the medical supply chain," he said.
Lawmakers and Trump administration officials have been eyeing the global supply chains that deliver drugs and other medical supplies to the United States, wary that the coronavirus might lead to shortages of key supplies.
In a hearing in July, experts told the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission that America had a troubling reliance on China for its drug supply -- but that purchasing from India instead would also have its downsides.
Rosemary Gibson, a co-author of "China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America's Dependence on China for Medicine," who testified at that hearing, said India also imported the bulk of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, or A.P.I.s, that it used to manufacture drugs from China. She added that sourcing those raw ingredients for drugs within India would have implications for drug prices.
"The main reason that India wants to import A.P.I.s from China is because it's cheap," said Ms. Gibson, a senior adviser with the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute. "If we choose to move from China to India, even if it has the capacity to manufacture its A.P.I.s, it would make it more expensive."
India's exports of the specified drugs are unlikely to be completely stopped, said Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents most of the country's large pharmaceutical companies.
"It's not a ban on export," he said. "It's a restriction. What we want to do is monitor the movement of the drugs."
The antibiotics facing export limits are tinidazole, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, erythromycin salts, neomycin, clindamycin salts and ornidazole.
Other drugs on the restricted list include the painkiller acetaminophen, the hormone progesterone, the antiviral drug acyclovir, and the vitamins B1, B6 and B12.
India decided to restrict exports after a high-level government committee analyzed the country's dependence on Chinese drug ingredients and concluded last week that 34 drugs had no alternative suppliers, according to a report on Tuesday in The Economic Times, a major Indian newspaper.
Indian drug makers depend on Chinese factories for important ingredients, particularly for antibiotics and vitamins. Although Indian companies had stockpiled extra ingredients ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, those reserves are now running low.
Krishnanath Munde, who follows the pharmaceutical industry for India Ratings and Research, a unit of Fitch Group, said that for now Indian manufacturers are getting by, in part by sourcing some ingredients from European and Indian suppliers.
"But if this trend continues beyond March and the coronavirus spreads to other regions in China and around the globe, we expect a disruption of the supply chains," he said. "Then everyone will be hit -- every sector."
Mr. Jain said that larger manufacturers had ingredient stocks to last until May for most drugs, but some products could be affected earlier. India's scores of small manufacturers are already struggling to cope with rising prices for some ingredients, such as those that go into acetaminophen.
Cipla, one of India's largest drug makers, whose main generic products include asthma inhalers and H.I.V. drugs, declined to comment on Tuesday on the export limits but said in a statement that it had enough inventory to last one to two months.
"We see shipments coming in," the company said. "We have also secured some additional inventory from vendors who have ready stocks available. This will ensure that we do not face any disruptions in case the situation does not resolve in the coming weeks."
Over the longer term, the Indian government is considering pushing forward with a long-stalled plan to make more drug ingredients domestically and reduce the country's reliance on Chinese suppliers.
"For any product, you cannot be dependent on one location," Mr. Jain said. "Health care security for every country is important."
Karan Deep Singh contributed reporting from New Delhi, Katie Thomas from New York and Ana Swanson from Washington.

Texto completo: The justices seemed split along familiar lines in a case challenging the independence of the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
WASHINGTON -- Paul D. Clement, a lawyer appointed by the Supreme Court to defend the independence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the Trump administration refused, gave a timely example on Tuesday to illustrate why it can be a good idea for agencies to be insulated from politics.
"People are trying to make a political football out of dealing with a pandemic disease," he said, referring to the coronavirus outbreak. A reasonable congressional response, he said, might be to make it harder to fire the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "That is the kind of sensible decision that Congress has been making for over 100 years," Mr. Clement said.
In the case before the justices, a challenge to the constitutionality of the consumer bureau's leadership structure, the court's conservative majority generally seemed open to setting limits on agencies' independence.
The bureau is the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren, then a law professor at Harvard and now a Democratic senator and presidential candidate, and was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in 2010 after the financial crisis. In an effort to protect the bureau from politics, the act said the president could remove its director only for cause, defined as "inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance."
That standard is used in many laws, but it tends to limit the president's power to fire officials on multimember commissions.
Kannon K. Shanmugam, a lawyer for a firm challenging the bureau's structure, said using that standard when an agency was led by a single director was novel and dangerous. "Never before in American history," he said, "has Congress given so much executive power to a single individual who does not answer to the president."
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the standard left presidents with plenty of control. "This is a very modest restraint," she said. "It stops the president from at whim removing someone, replacing someone with someone who is loyal to the president rather than to the consumers that the bureau is set up to serve."
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. suggested that the court could avoid the weighty constitutional issues in the case by interpreting the standard to impose only modest limits on presidential power. "We might want to scrutinize a little bit how rigorous a limitation that is," he said, "before we get to the point of striking down the statute."
Justice Neil M. Gorsuch rejected that approach. He said it would be more honest to overrule precedents allowing limits on the president's power to fire people than to water down the standard.
Republicans and business groups have long accused the bureau of regulatory overreach. Businesses have repeatedly challenged the limits on the president's power to remove the consumer bureau's director, saying they violated the separation of powers.
The Trump administration agreed with the challengers. The bureau once took the opposite position, but it changed its stance last year, agreeing that its director could be fired at will.
Justice Ginsburg asked Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco, who represents the administration in the Supreme Court, why it did not defend the challenged law. "Isn't it uncommon for the Department of Justice not to defend a statute passed by Congress?" she asked.
Mr. Francisco responded that "we defend the acts of Congress unless it infringes upon the president's own executive power."
Though the law firm and the administration agreed that the bureau's structure violated the Constitution, they were divided about whether actions taken by the director would have to be voided if the Supreme Court struck it down. Mr. Shanmugam said yes, while Mr. Francisco said no.
Since the two sides agreed on the basic issue, the court appointed Mr. Clement to defend the constitutionality of the law.
He was afforded no special courtesies. Justice Gorsuch, in an unusually testy exchange, accused him of dodging questions and being disrespectful to other lawyers.
"If we could avoid disparaging our colleagues and just answer my question, I would be grateful," Justice Gorsuch said.
Mr. Clement, perhaps the most accomplished appellate lawyer of his generation, was making his 101st argument in the Supreme Court, and it was characteristically vigorous and clear. He seemed taken aback by Justice Gorsuch's repeated hostile questions.
The case before the court, Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, No. 19-7, was brought by a law firm that objected to an investigation of aspects of its debt relief services. The firm challenged the bureau's power to pursue the investigation, saying its director was unconstitutionally insulated from presidential control.
The firm lost in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which concluded that Supreme Court precedents upholding limits on presidential power to remove officials on multimember commissions and independent counsels allowed the bureau's structure.
In 2018, in a separate case, the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the contested provision. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, then a judge on that court, issued a 73-page dissent arguing that "the C.F.P.B. is unconstitutionally structured because it is an independent agency that exercises substantial executive power and is headed by a single director."
Much of the argument explored the differences between single directors and commissions, and opinions varied on which structure provided for more independence.
"There are a thousand things that go into whether a president has influence over any particular agency," Justice Elena Kagan said, "of which the question is it one or multiple members is not so important."

Texto completo: The direct contact between an American president and a top Taliban official would once have been unthinkable, showing President Trump's drive to make a peace deal stick.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump spoke on Tuesday with the deputy leader of the Taliban, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, in the latest sign of his determination to see that a peace deal signed Saturday with the Afghan insurgent group holds, allowing him to withdraw thousands of American troops in an election year.
"I spoke to the leader of the Taliban today. We had a good conversation," Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House, slightly inflating Mr. Baradar's position.
"They're looking to get this ended and we're looking to get this ended," Mr. Trump said later in the day. "The relationship is very good that I have with the mullah."
Mr. Baradar was the Taliban official who, along with Mr. Trump's envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, signed the peace agreement in Doha, Qatar, to begin the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan and start talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government, which was not a party to the agreement.
The direct contact between an American president and a top Taliban leader would once have been unthinkable. But in his drive to end the war in Afghanistan, Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to engage with the leaders of a Sunni fundamentalist group that first harbored Osama bin Laden while he planned the Sept. 11 attacks and then battled American troops for more than 18 years.
At the outset of a coronavirus briefing at the White House on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he would be "meeting personally with Taliban leaders in the not-too-distant future," but offered no further details.
Mr. Trump also credited the Taliban for "killing terrorists."
During an earlier round of peace talks, in September, Mr. Trump invited those leaders to the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland, but abruptly called off the meeting -- and the talks -- after a Taliban attack killed an American service member.
Since then, the United States has pounded the Afghan insurgents with airstrikes, and 11 American military personnel have been killed in the country, according to the website iCasualties.org.
But Mr. Trump, who boasts at campaign rallies that he is ending "endless wars," is eager to reduce, and possibly end, America's presence in Afghanistan. And the bloodshed of recent months and years did not prevent either Saturday's deal or what Mr. Trump described as a positive call on Tuesday.
"We had a good, long conversation today," Mr. Trump said.
In a statement, the Taliban said Mr. Baradar spoke to Mr. Trump for 35 minutes, and told him to stand firm in his commitment to withdraw from the country. The statement said Mr. Trump told the Taliban leader that the Afghan people were strong and that the American withdrawal would be good for all involved.
Mr. Trump "emphasized the need to continue the reduction in violence" that preceded the agreement and "urged the Taliban to participate in intra-Afghan negotiations," the White House said in a statement. The United States, the statement continued, "stands ready to continue its support for the Afghan people as they pursue a peace settlement."
Afghanistan's president, Ashraf Ghani, has complained about elements of the deal, rejecting a provision that said his government would release 5,000 Taliban prisoners before talks with the militant group.
In their statement on Tuesday, the Taliban said Mr. Trump assured Mr. Baradar that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would speak to Mr. Ghani to remove hurdles to the so-called intra-Afghan talks.
Speaking to reporters, Mr. Trump signaled frustration with members of Congress, including some senior Republicans, who have complained that he did not win sufficient concessions from the Taliban. Mr. Trump said it was "not easy to get out of these conflicts."
"Very complex in terms of all of the people you have to deal with, including, frankly, people in the Senate, people in the House," he added.
More than 20 House Republicans, led by Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, sent a letter on Feb. 26 to Mr. Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper questioning whether the agreement with the Taliban was stringent enough to justify an American troop withdrawal.
It was unclear which "terrorists" Mr. Trump was referring to in his remarks on Saturday. The Taliban have been allied in the past with Al Qaeda -- the reason for the initial American invasion of Afghanistan. But they have also battled against the Islamic State, which has sought a foothold in the country.
"They will be killing some very bad people," Mr. Trump said at the time. "They will keep that fight going."
Since signing the deal on Saturday, the Taliban have renewed their attacks on Afghan forces after a weeklong reduction in violence across the country.
Asked whether the conversation had been his first with the Taliban leader, Mr. Trump demurred. "I don't want to say that," he replied.

Texto completo: The author of "Catch and Kill," which was published by a division of Hachette Book Group, said he wouldn't work with the company again after it announced plans to publish his father's memoir.
The journalist Ronan Farrow, the author of the best-selling book "Catch and Kill," said on Tuesday that he would cut ties with his publisher, Hachette Book Group, after it announced that one of its divisions was publishing Woody Allen's autobiography next month.
Mr. Farrow is Mr. Allen's son with the actress Mia Farrow, and his adopted sister, Dylan Farrow, has long accused Mr. Allen of molesting her when she was a child, allegations he has denied.
In an email exchange, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Farrow, whose reporting on accusations of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men helped touch off the #MeToo movement, harshly criticized Hachette, calling its decision to publish Mr. Allen's memoir a betrayal.
"Your policy of editorial independence among your imprints does not relieve you of your moral and professional obligations as the publisher of 'Catch and Kill,' and as the leader of a company being asked to assist in efforts by abusive men to whitewash their crimes," Mr. Farrow wrote in an email to Michael Pietsch, the chief executive of Hachette, whose Little, Brown imprint published "Catch and Kill."
"As you and I worked on 'Catch and Kill' -- a book in part about the damage Woody Allen did to my family -- you were secretly planning to publish a book by the person who committed those acts of sexual abuse," Mr. Farrow added.
"Obviously I can't in good conscience work with you any more," he wrote at the end of his message. "Imagine this were your sister."
The email to Mr. Pietsch came the day after Grand Central, another imprint of Hachette, announced that it had acquired Mr. Allen's autobiography, titled "Apropos of Nothing," and would publish it on April 7.
A news release described the book as "a comprehensive account of his life, both personal and professional," that would cover "his relationship with family, friends and the loves of his life."
In a telephone interview on Tuesday evening, Mr. Pietsch declined to provide further details on the book, such as its initial print run or how much Grand Central paid for it. And he declined to say anything further about the contents, beyond that it was "the complete story of his life, from the beginning to the present moment," told in "Woody Allen's unmistakable voice."
Mr. Pietsch said he had called Mr. Farrow on Monday after hearing from the author's agent that he was unhappy about the publication. And he reiterated what he said he had told Mr. Farrow: that a basic principle of publishing was that its divisions do not interfere editorially with each other.
"We do not allow anyone's publishing program to interfere with anyone else's," he said, noting that Hachette publishes "thousands of books" a year.
"Each book has its own mission," he said. "Our job as a publisher is to help the author achieve what they have set out to do in the creation of their book."
Asked about the mission of Mr. Allen's book, he paused. "Grand Central publishing believes strongly that there's a large audience that wants to hear the story of Woody Allen's life as told by Woody Allen himself," he said. "That's what they've chosen to publish."
Mr. Farrow declined to comment on his conversations with Mr. Pietsch or the publication of Mr. Allen's book. Letty Aronson, Mr. Allen's sister, said he had no comment.
The announcement of the memoir's impending publication was a surprise twist in the literary fortunes of Mr. Allen, whose career has been stalled in the #MeToo era. In recent years, actors including Greta Gerwig and Timothée Chalamet have expressed regret about working with Mr. Allen. In 2018, Amazon Studios ended a multimovie distribution deal with the filmmaker, citing a renewed focus on the allegations against Mr. Allen, among other reasons.
In May 2019, The New York Times reported that Mr. Allen had been trying to sell a memoir since late 2018 but had been "met with indifference or hard passes," based on interviews with four publishers who had been approached about a possible book.
In fact, Ben Sevier, the senior vice president and publisher of Grand Central, had acquired the book quietly last March. At the time, Little, Brown, another division of Hachette, was in the midst of editing Mr. Farrow's "Catch and Kill," which was published in October and spent 11 weeks on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list.
In that book, Mr. Farrow wrote candidly about his relationship with his sister, at one point describing how he asked for her advice about how to talk to someone who is "accusing a very powerful person of a very serious crime" before he interviewed one of Mr. Weinstein's accusers. He also blamed NBC News executives for impeding his reporting on Mr. Weinstein before he eventually published it in The New Yorker.
In his email to Mr. Pietsch, he expressed concern that Dylan Farrow had not received a "fact-checking call," and described his sister's allegations as being "backed up by mountains of contemporaneous reports and evidence."
Mr. Pietsch declined to comment on the issue of fact-checking, which is generally not a standard practice in book publishing, though books on sensitive subjects are often reviewed by lawyers to avoid libel.
On Monday, in a statement posted on Twitter, Dylan Farrow called Hachette's announcement "deeply upsetting to me and an utter betrayal of my brother."
Ms. Farrow, whose own first novel, "Hush," will be published in the fall by Wednesday Books, an imprint of St. Martin's Press, also criticized the publisher for not contacting her for fact-checking, which she called "an egregious abdication of Hachette's most basic responsibility."
"This provides yet another example of the profound privilege that power, money and notoriety affords," she said. "Hachette's utter complicity in this should be called out for what it is and they should have to answer for it."

Crisis tests control while adding means of maintaining it

Texto completo: Chinese leader's virus-related surveillance is unlikely to abate

BEIJING - Ancient Chinese doctrine has it that when heaven is unhappy with the emperor, it signals its displeasure by raining down disasters such as floods, plagues and swarms of locusts. The philosopher Mencius said a ruler could lose his "mandate of heaven" if he neglected his responsibility to care for the ordinary people.
These beliefs, still widespread, should concern China's modern-day emperor, Xi Jinping, as the country battles a coronavirus epidemic and braces for an invasion of locusts.
"He's got an enemy that, for the first time, is absolutely uncontrollable, in a state that has always ruled by control," said the Asia Society's Orville Schell. "You can't imprison a coronavirus or get it to undergo 'thought reform.' "
Yet the recent introduction of coronavirus-related surveillance measures, many of them unlikely to disappear when the epidemic is over, has also given Xi an opening to assert even tighter control over society.
Drones with cameras chase grandmas down rural roads if they're spotted not wearing a mask, calling out to them in a robotic voice. Apps enable users to pinpoint the nearest virus case to within 10 yards.
Since ascending to the top jobs in China's political and military hierarchy in 2012, Xi has moved to make himself the strongest leader since Mao Zedong, the founder of this Communist state. He unleashed an anti-corruption campaign to purge rivals and presided over an Orwellian expansion of the surveillance state.
Two years ago he scrapped term limits, effectively enabling him to stay in power indefinitely, and this year he has been styling himself as the "People's Leader" - a term last applied to Mao.
But with China's death toll from the coronavirus nearing 3,000, Xi faces an unprecedented challenge to his leadership.
"When things get out of kilter, heaven expresses its disfavor," said Schell, citing the Chinese philosopher Mencius. "Xi has been stripped of his air of invincibility and that is calling into question his 'mandate of heaven.' "
The party's botched response to the virus has pierced Xi's armor in multiple ways. His admission that he knew about the outbreak by Jan. 7, two weeks before China activated its emergency response, directly implicated Xi in the initial coverup.
The outbreak has derailed his political and economic agenda by forcing the party to postpone its showcase annual meetings, where cadres rubber-stamp Xi's plans for the year. Economists say the shutdown of swaths of the country will hammer growth.
More concerning for Xi will be the criticism that has burst into the open, notably with the death of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang.
Dissent on Chinese social media is quickly erased by the party's censors, but Chinese-language discussion forums hosted overseas are full of comments about Xi being "gutless" for not going to Wuhan, displaying "tedious" leadership and being an "autocrat."
Two prominent intellectuals who have criticized him have disappeared, apparently detained by security services.

Xu Zhiyong, a legal scholar and public intellectual, went into hiding before publishing an essay Feb. 4 in which he called Xi "clueless and hopeless" and urged him to step down. Still, he was detained shortly after.
Tsinghua University professor Xu Zhangrun is thought to be under house arrest after he wrote that the coronavirus epidemic "has revealed the rotten core of Chinese governance; the fragile and vacuous heart of the jittering edifice of state has thereby shown up as never before."
Chinese journalists who have tried to do independent reporting have vanished, most recently Li Zehua, an anchor for the state broadcaster who resigned so he could be a "citizen reporter" in Wuhan.
The party has been battling to hide its missteps.
"With the failure of the central authority to provide even very basic public health information to the public, I think there's now a lot more skepticism of the party," said Victor Shih of the University of California at San Diego.
All of this has led to predictions - including from Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass - that the coronavirus could bring about a change in the way the party operates and may compel it to be more transparent and responsive to the population. Some columnists have characterized the epidemic as China's "Chernobyl moment," a tipping point that precipitates the end of Communist rule akin to the nuclear disaster that hastened the demise of the Soviet Union.
But the opposite is likely to be true, at least in the near term.
"The novel coronavirus has exposed flaws in Xi's autocracy: the control on information, the absence of civil society and the lack of transparency have all had human costs," said Natasha Kassam, a former Australian diplomat in China who is now at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney think tank.
"But rather than prompt a rethink in Beijing, Xi and China's leaders are more likely to double down on the most repressive elements of the regime."
With new cases dropping and the World Health Organization praising their response, China's leaders are likely to feel vindicated, Kassam said.
In addition to effectively putting tens of millions of people under house arrest to contain the outbreak, China's authorities have harnessed the tools of their techno-authoritarian surveillance state in the name of stopping the epidemic. More than 200 cities across China have adopted "Alipay Health Code," a QR code that runs through the payment app operated by tech giant Alibaba's financial division. Alipay is now working, at the government's behest, to take the service nationwide.

People are assigned a green, orange or red code, according to their risk of having the coronavirus, and must scan green codes before they can enter stores or restaurants, or take public transportation - an electronic passport for daily life.
The code syncs with payment and messaging apps but in Hangzhou, Alibaba's hometown, the code can even be linked to a person's social insurance and medical records, according to local reports. It will soon be required to enter office buildings, factory sites and technology parks.
The New York Times reported that the software's code shares data, including the user's location, with the police.
Some officials and experts are talking of keeping these new systems in place after the epidemic, adding them to the arsenal of tech tools at Chinese authorities' disposal. The government has already promoted a "social credit" system aimed at monitoring and evaluating people's activities in society, similar to a financial credit score. Hangzhou's Communist Party secretary, Zhou Jiangyong, has praised the technology and said the city should look at ways to use such tools more widely.
"We must forge ahead along this path with resolve," Zhou said Monday, while hailing the development of the QR health code.
Continuing to require health-code scans will "increase the efficiency and lower costs for health-care services" after the outbreak, said Zhou Tao, a professor at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
But human rights advocates outside China and ordinary people inside the country have voiced concerns. "I feel very uncomfortable about this kind of snooping," one person wrote using a pseudonym on the Weibo microblogging site. By deploying traditional measures of political control - including censorship, arresting dissidents and citizen journalists, nationalistic propaganda, and tighter surveillance - Xi has strengthened his hand, said Elizabeth Economy, director of Asian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a book about Xi.
"But this is a short-term victory," she said. "Over the long term, these actions have the effect of corroding the Communist Party's legitimacy among the Chinese people. At some point after the virus subsides, Chinese citizens and the rest of the world will likely demand a full accounting of what transpired."
Still, the coronavirus crisis is unlikely to produce a fundamental change in the way that Xi does business, or to precipitate a return to a more collective style of leadership.
"His approach to governance is rooted in an extraordinary degree of personal and party control," Economy said, "and he has little interest in opening space for civil society to act independently."

Texto completo: President Trump's campaign sued The Washington Post for defamation Tuesday over two opinion columns published last year that alleged a connection between the campaign and Russian election interference.
The campaign sued the New York Times last week for another opinion column that had asserted such ties.
Legal experts say Trump stands little chance of prevailing in court in either case because libel laws extend a high degree of protection to published material about public figures and to opinion articles. Nevertheless, the campaign may be aiming to highlight its criticism of the mainstream media and to blunt suggestions that it colluded with Russian operatives.
The new lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, alleges that op-eds by Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman were false and defamatory.
Sargent's June 13 column was titled "Trump just invited another Russian attack. Mitch McConnell is making one more likely." The lawsuit contends that it was defamatory because it contained a claim that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III concluded that the campaign "tried to conspire with" Russia in a "sweeping and systematic" attack during the 2016 election.
Waldman raised a similar issue in his column published June 20, writing, "Who knows what sort of aid Russia and North Korea will give to the Trump campaign, now that he has invited them to offer their assistance?" The campaign said that statement was false and defamatory because it is "not seeking Russia's or North Korea's help in the 2020 election."
Mueller's report chronicled dozens of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian nationals, as well as 10 instances of potential obstruction by Trump. Mueller testified last year that his investigation focused on whether campaign officials took part in a criminal conspiracy. He concluded that the evidence was insufficient to bring criminal charges.
Trump has repeatedly criticized The Post and its owner, Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos. At one point during the 2016 campaign, Trump barred The Post's reporters from covering his events.
A division of Amazon, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is locked in a legal dispute with the Defense Department over the awarding of a $10 billion Pentagon cloud-computing contract to Microsoft. The company asserts that Trump interfered in the contracting process to exclude AWS, a claim backed up by former defense secretary Jim Mattis in a recent memoir.
The Trump campaign's lawsuit says the articles in question are "part of the The Post 's systematic pattern of bias against the Campaign, designed to maliciously interfere with and damage its reputation and ultimately cause the organization to fail."
"It's disappointing to see the president's campaign committee resorting to these types of tactics, and we will vigorously defend this case," said Post spokeswoman Kris Coratti.
The campaign is represented by attorney Charles Harder, who sued the website Gawker on behalf of pro wrestler Hulk Hogan, winning a $140 million judgment in 2016 that bankrupted the site and led to its sale. Harder also represented Melania Trump in lawsuits against the Daily Mail and a Maryland blogger who asserted that her former modeling agency had acted as an escort service. The first lady settled those suits after the plaintiffs agreed to compensate her.
Libel standards in the United States make it "virtually impossible" for Trump to win his cases against The Post and the Times, said RonNell Andersen Jones, a law professor at the University of Utah who specializes in media law. Public figures such as the president must prove that a publication knew a statement was false before it published it, a difficult standard to prove. What's more, opinions about the conduct of public officials are given wide protection to encourage robust discussion.
"The suit is less a legitimate effort to seek legal redress and more a publicity measure designed to generate disdain for the media amongst a base that is already quite inclined to vilify the press," Jones said Tuesday.
She added: "Trump and his lawyers of course do not believe they can win a libel suit over an opinion column discussing one of the major domestic and foreign relations issues of our day. What they believe is that they can use the suit to continue their own narrative about Russian interference and to compound the attacks on the press that they have made so central to their administration."

Texto completo: Headnote MICHAEL BLOOMBERG
I know that Michael Bloomberg wasn't on the primary ballot in South Carolina, but he was on the debate stage there. And he was using it to talk beyond the state to the swarm of states that will vote on Super Tuesday, states in which he has spent an absolutely obscene amount of money on ads that amount to propaganda.
In South Carolina he painted a sunny picture of success governing a diverse city. But the reality was far from what he made it seem. For Black people in particular, Bloomberg's mayoralty was more thorns than roses.
Super Tuesday voters, particularly Black ones, this takedown is for you.
It was an absolute outrage to hear Bloomberg call for the decriminalization of marijuana and the expunging of criminal records for those caught with small amounts of the drug.
As the Drug Policy Alliance pointed out in 2012: "In the last decade since Michael Bloomberg became mayor, the NYPD has made 400,038 lowest level marijuana possession arrests at a cost of $600 million. Nearly 350,000 of the marijuana possession arrests made under Bloomberg are of overwhelmingly young Black and Latino men, despite the fact that young whites use marijuana at higher rates than young Blacks and Latinos."
In addition, as the professor Harry Levine of Queens College put it in the report, every year the Police Department was "stopping and frisking more than a half million mostly young Black and Latino men and falsely charging them with marijuana possession in public view."
As the alliance pointed out: "Getting arrested for marijuana is no small matter - not least because it creates a permanent criminal record that can easily be found on the Internet by employers, landlords, schools, credit agencies, licensing boards and banks."
Bloomberg also boasted about what he accomplished on the educational front, particularly for Blacks and Híspanles. After taking over more control of the schools, for instance, he instituted a school choice system that allowed eighth-graders to apply to any school in the city.
But by that time, many Black students had already been so underserved that they got no advantage from it.
As The New York Times editorial board put it in 2017:
"The choice system was constructed not for the poor, but to keep white middle-class families invested in the public schools. Even some who supported the strategy 20 years ago, though, now recognize that it promotes class segregation and presents enormous obstacles to vulnerable families."
Bloomberg's policies privileged whiteness, and that's a fact.
Students of color experienced a different city: Bloomberg wants to brag about his educational accomplishments for these children, but he vastly overstates them. And in their days after school, he conducted a terror campaign that destroyed the lives of many young people of color.
Bloomberg also bragged about the number of affordable housing units he created. But the fact is that he let the developers run roughshod over the city, when, as Politico recently reported: "A report released as his third term was winding down placed nearly half the city's residents at or near the poverty line. Under his rule, the city's homeless population swelled and public housing conditions deteriorated."
Bloomberg was mayor of New York from 2001 to 2013. That encompassed almost the entire census decade between 2000 and 2010. That last census, in 2010, was the first since Reconstruction in which the number of African Americans in the city fell.
I have called what Bloomberg did a public policy form of ethnic cleansing of New York, and I stand by that characterization.
As the city made itself more attractive to young white people, it made itself less attractive to young Black ones. As Reniqua Allen wrote in 2017 in The New York Times, a report issued the year before by the New York City comptroller, Scott Stringer, "found that between 2000 and 2014 about 61% of millennials moving to New York were white, while only 9% of 18- to 29-year olds moving into the city were Black."
Bloomberg wanted to run a data-driven administration. He may love data, but he lacks empathy. He sees patterns in numbers but not humanity in people. As such, real people get injured in these greater-than, less-than factorings.
He wanted to model the city on his business, but stockholder responsibility and civic responsibility are not the same thing. In business, you hire only the people you want and can fire those who can't or won't live up to your expectations and idea of performance. Civil responsibility is different. You must find a way to help encourage and better the lives of even the least productive. They can't simply be removed.
But gentrification, housing scarcity, economic outpacing and police pressure can perform this precise purchase: replace the struggling in a city with those most likely to prosper.
Lastly, people often ask about something Bloomberg touts: How could he have been so bad and still been elected to three terms as mayor?
This may sound familiar: He was able to exponentially outspend his opponents. But it was more complicated than that: He was a less brash version of his predecessor Rudy Giuliani (also sound familiar?), although he had some of the same instincts.
He also ran for his first term shortly after Sept. 11, when the city was reeling emotionally and its economy was suffering. Having a technocratic businessman at the helm of a city so dependent on Wall Street didn't seem like a stretch. It actually seemed safe. As the city recovered and regained a sense of itself, much of the credit for that rebounded to Bloomberg. He was able to ride that election also in part because his opponents were so weak.
And as stop-and-frisk continued to aggressively expand over the years, two things were true: Lor people outside of the targeted areas, the practice was virtually invisible to them, and for many aware and upset about it, much of the anger was directed at the police and not the mayor. This was a campaign conducted in the dark against the dark, a system in which officers on patrol were blamed, not necessarily the politicians.
I wrote my first column involving stop-and-frisk in 2009, and it didn't even mention Bloomberg. I too assumed that this was a police policy gone awry. I continued to write about it, but it wasn't until 2011 that I mentioned him, and even then I didn't directly blame him for the policy.
That is because it wasn't until the last few years of his mayoralty that Bloomberg himself began to give public, full-throated defenses of stop-and-frisk, like the speech he gave in 2012 at a Brooklyn church as a court case against the city loomed.
Then it was abundantly clear: This wasn't a practice being perpetrated by rogue cops; it was a dictate coming from the top, from Bloomberg himself. Simply put, Bloomberg escaped much of the blame for stopand-frisk during his mayoralty, because he never stepped forth to accept it. He hid behind the police department and let it take all the arrows.
This is why the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association president, Patrick Lynch, blasted Bloomberg in November when he cynically apologized so that he could run for president. As Lynch put it:
"Mayor Bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street. We said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities. His administration's misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence, and stripped away many of the tools we had used to keep New Yorkers safe. The apology is too little, too late."
That is the problem with having a leader so slavishly devoted to data: The underlings will seek numbers rather than justice to satisfy him.
Bloomberg wants to claim sole credit for reducing New York's violent crime rate, particularly in minority neighborhoods, even though it was already beginning to fall before he entered office and continued to fall once his racist stop-and-frisk policy was curtailed. This is the paternalistic white savior syndrome operational in the man. It is ego. It robs minority communities of agency and activism. It says that those communities are doomed to perpetual darkness without outside pressure and correction. It's outrageously offensive.
At the debate in South Carolina, Bloomberg tried to shield all the damage he has done by saying: "But if you talk to the people in New York City, I have over 100 Black elected officials that have endorsed me. A lot of them are in the audience tonight. And I've earned the respect of people in New York City."
But that's no shield at all. The Black political establishment is still an establishment, and it is just as susceptible as any other power and pressure. As lames Baldwin once put it, "The terrible thing, and here we have an American phenomenon in relief, is the fact that the Negro representative, by virtue of his position, is ever more removed from the people he ostensibly serves."
These people will walk over the frisked bodies of our children to repay a Bloomberg favor or in anticipation of one.
There is nothing Bloomberg can do or say, or have Black surrogates do or say on his behalf, that will wash his hands dean.
Michael Bloomberg threw Black New Yorkers against a wall and treated them like the undeserving and undesirable. Super Tuesday voters should return the favor.

Texto completo: The New York Times' David Brooks writes about how the "folk schools" started in the Nordic nations in the 1870s ("How Scandinavia got great," Commentary, Feb. 23) have created such successful, socially equitable, economically productive societies today.
We have such a school in New Market, Tenn., started in 1932 by Myles Horton to bring education to people in Appalachia, whose needs had been neglected by public education.
It is the Highlander Education Center (highlandercenter.org), an education program for people of all ages, where folks learn to understand the world they live in, their relationships with each other, their civic roles and responsibilities, and the growing complexity of our world. Yes, it is also the school where Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. spent time, and the school where Rep. John Lewis, as an adult, had his first shared meal with Anglos.
Over the years, the Highlander Education Center has had its troubles because it was willing to bring people of different skin shades and ideas together to talk about building community relationships.
In March 2019, a group that left behind a white supremacist symbol set fire to the school's administrative buildings. Why would that happen now? What and who is fanning the flames of intolerance and hate for education that promotes tolerance, understanding of differences, and civic rights and responsibilities in our society?
Our own public schools in the United States were established to do a lot of what Highlander and the folk schools in Nordic nations were successful at accomplishing - learning civic understanding and responsibility for self, family, community and society.
Whatever happened to our commitment to the education of the whole person - as an individual, as a worker and as a citizen in the local community and in society? Why have public schools been forced to have bake sales to pay for science equipment? Why do our teachers have less respect and salary than local rock stars?
We should continue to build and develop rather than burn down islands of civility like Highlander Learning Center. And we should support such learning models in our public education systems, from pre-K to at least two years at community college, our only hope for a nation that can be united by understanding, civility and responsibility for each other.

Texto completo: It has been nearly three months since the first cases of a new coronavirus pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, China, and it is now a global outbreak. And yet, despite nearly 90,000 infections worldwide (most of them in China), the world still doesn’t have a clear picture of some basic information about this outbreak.
In recent weeks, a smattering of scientific papers and government statements have begun to sketch the outlines of the epidemic. The Chinese national health commission has reported that more than 1,700 medical workers in the country had contracted the virus as of Feb 14. (That’s alarming.) The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that some 80% of those infected have a mild illness. (That’s comforting.) Last week, a joint World Health Organization-China mission announced that the death rate in Wuhan was 2% to 4%, but only 0.7% in the rest of China — a difference that makes little scientific sense.
In recent days, the WHO has complained that China has not been sharing data on infections in health care workers. Last month, the editors of the journal Nature called on researchers to “ensure that their work on this outbreak is shared rapidly and openly.”
Much more could be known and, in all likelihood, some scientists out there have good, if not definitive, answers. And yet, the lack of consistent, reliable and regularly updated information on the key measures of this outbreak is startling. In an era when we get flash-flood warnings on phones and weekly influenza statistics from every state, why is data on the new coronavirus so limited?
Science, politics and pride have all, in various ways, conspired to keep potentially vital, lifesaving knowledge under wraps. That is problematic at a time when more information is needed to be strategic about preparedness.
It began early in the course of the epidemic. On Dec. 30, a Chinese physician, Dr. Li Wenliang, posted on social media about a small number of people with unusual pneumonia. Though scientists in labs were already sequencing the virus, he was “warned and reprimanded” by local officials for rumor-mongering and the “illegal activity of publishing false information online.” (Li later died of the illness.)
There is a tradition in China (and likely much of the world) for local authorities not to report bad news to their superiors. During the Great Leap Forward, an economic and social campaign by the Communist Party of China from 1958 to 1962, local officials reported exaggerated harvest yields even as millions were starving. More recently, officials in Henan province denied there was an epidemic of AIDS spread through unsanitary blood collection practices.
Indeed, even when Beijing urges greater attention to scientific reality, compliance is mixed. On Feb. 13, the Communist Party secretaries of Wuhan and Hubei provinces lost their jobs over their botched initial handling of the crisis. But damage had been done. As the virus was taking hold, doctors were not wearing proper protective equipment. Sick people, thinking they had just a cold, didn’t seek medical attention. And travelers continued to board cruise ships, spreading a new pathogen.
“Early on, management was less than optimal in Hubei and they’re paying for that now,” Dr. Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health who has been working in China and advising the Chinese government since the SARS outbreak, told me.
There were, of course, genuine barriers to understanding what exactly was happening in Wuhan: Cases of pneumonia are not unusual in winter, and there was no way to know there was a novel virus. (Lipkin’s group is working on building a new test that distinguishes between different causes of viral pneumonias, with a researcher headed to China next week for testing.)
Lest Americans feel it could never happen here, Lipkin pointed out that it took many months for health officials in the United States to acknowledge and recognize HIV as a new virus, despite gay men turning up at alarming rates with unusual pneumonias and skin cancers.
Scientific competition has also slowed reaction and response, experts fear — leading to the extraordinary editors’ plea in Nature. For a young researcher, a paper in Nature or the New England Journal of Medicine is gold in career currency. Scientific prestige may encourage perfecting data for peer review, but preparedness requires rapid dissemination of information.
While federal officials in the United States warn Americans to be ready for the virus, there are important aspects of its spread about which we have little information — even though they have likely been studied by scientists and officials in China, Japan and elsewhere. Scientists in various countries are presumably gathering large amounts of data day by day and the world deserves to see more of it.
“Were there patterns around infections, places, procedures? Maybe that is being collected and readied for the medical literature. But it would be hugely important to know,” said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which studies epidemics.
For example: Of the more than 1,700 health workers infected in China, did those infections occur before they knew to wear protective equipment? Were they doing procedures that might lead to exposure? Those answers would quell fears about how the virus spreads and how to protect front-line workers.
Likewise, hundreds of people tested positive aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship and were transferred to the hospital. But little public information has been released about what shape they were in. How many in the cohort were really sick, how many just had minor symptoms, and how many just needed isolation? Does the pattern of infection suggest a role for transmission via plumbing on the ship?
Finally, the world’s public health researchers need much more transparency about how officials are monitoring this epidemic. What exactly is China’s surveillance strategy among the general population? To gauge the actual death rate of COVID-19, researchers would need to know how many people actually have it, even if they have only mild symptoms. In-country surveillance may reveal a very large pool of people with mild or no symptoms at all.
Lipkin noted that because cases observed early in an epidemic are the most severe, early mortality estimates tend to be high. As more information comes out, the death rates are likely to fall. “We’re probably six months out from having a good picture, and when we do I’d guess the mortality will drop dramatically,” he said.
Compared with the situation in 2003, when it took about five months for the Chinese central government to publicly acknowledge a deadly crisis associated with SARS, the flow of information has clearly improved. But since then, travel and commerce between China and the rest of the world have increased manifold. The spread of information about emerging infectious diseases needs to keep up with that new reality.

Texto completo: Donna Brazile is shocked — shocked! — that anyone would suggest that a brokered Democratic convention is going to be “rigged” against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

She has apparently never met the 2017 version of herself.

“First of all,” the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee said Tuesday during an appearance on Fox News, “I want to talk to my Republicans. First of all: Stay the hell out of our race! Stay the hell out of our race! I get sick and tired … of listening to Republicans tell me and the Democrats about our process.”

Brazile’s remarks are a response specifically to Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who alleged recently that a brokered Democratic convention will almost certainly be “rigged” against the 2020 Democratic primary front-runner, especially if the superdelegates who oppose him “have their way.”

“And for people to use Russian talking points to sow division among Americans," Brazile added. "That is stupid. So, Ronna, go to hell! Go to hell! … We are not trying to prevent anyone from becoming the nominee.”
DB
Brazile did not leave it at just that. She continued, protesting maybe a little too much the idea that the Democratic establishment will rob Sanders of the nomination.

“This notion that, somehow or another, Democrats are out there trying to put hurdles or roadblocks before one candidate — that’s stupid!” Brazile said. “I know what’s going on. They’re scared of Democrats coming together to defeat Donald Trump. They need to be focusing on what we’re focusing on, the Democratic Party, and that is preventing foreign interference in our elections. Stop using Russian talking points, Madame Chairwoman!”

Worth mentioning at this point is the fact that McDaniel is not just fabricating talking points from thin air. The New York Times reported on Thursday that there is “overwhelming opposition," including from some 93 superdelegates, "to handing Mr. Sanders the nomination if he fell short of a majority of delegates."

More important, however, is the fact that Brazile is pretending to be shocked and appalled that anyone would accuse the DNC of doing to Sanders what Donna Brazile and the DNC did to him in 2016. She claimed in her postelection “tell-all” that, as the interim chairwoman of the DNC, she “stumbled onto” the Clinton campaign’s “secret takeover” of the Democrats’ formal governing body. Brazile alleged the DNC agreed in 2015 to a fundraising scheme with the Clinton camp wherein the former secretary of state was supposedly awarded an overwhelming advantage in the primary. Her stupid postelection confession even included a line about her calling Sanders to tell him she believed the Clinton campaign had acted unethically.

Naturally, Brazile’s 2017 account omits mentions of her own attempts to tilt the Democratic primary in Hillary Clinton’s favor. There are no mentions of her brazen lies after it was revealed she fed debate questions to the former secretary of state. There are no mentions of the fact that Brazile herself spent much of 2016 lying about her efforts to secure Clinton the nomination. The way she tells it, she was merely a witness to the Clintons’ and former DNC Chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s unethical behavior.

I guess we were supposed to forget about all of this because Brazile, now a Fox News contributor, is acting like her own book never happened. She is pretending now to be disgusted that anyone would accuse the DNC of conspiring to do exactly what she accused it of doing in 2016.

And that is one of the problems with being a liar. You tend to lose track of what you said not too long ago.

Biden seals place as top Sanders alternative in stunning Super Tuesday comeback

Texto completo: Joe Biden's Super Tuesday task was to cement his place as the top centrist alternative to Bernie Sanders and prove that he can mount a comeback not only in South Carolina, but nationwide.
He crushed his competition.
Biden had such a lead in Virginia, North Carolina, and Alabama that media outlets called the states for him seconds after polls closed. The former vice president swept states where he had no field offices, next to no television advertisements, and where he never visited, like Massachusetts. It made former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's more than $600 million in ad spending seem like a lost cause and a desperate attempt to spend his way to support.
He earned more votes in Virginia than Barack Obama did in 2008, more than 705,000 compared to Obama's, which was about 628,000, and won Oklahoma and Minnesota, states that Sanders won in 2016.
Full results are being calculated, but the New York Times projects that Biden will amass a slight delegate lead over the socialist Vermont senator, while his only centrist competition, Bloomberg, is expected to be hundreds of delegates behind Biden. Whether he slightly leads or slightly trails Sanders, Biden's place as the main Sanders competitor is set.
It is a stunning comeback for a candidate whose campaign was on life support a few weeks ago.
For much of the last year, the former vice president seemed to be one of the least-threatening presidential primary front-runners in recent memory.
Biden's near-universal name recognition and his nearly half-century of experience in office did not dissuade more than two dozen challengers from jumping into the race. He had trouble raising money. Verbal slip-ups made voters question whether the 77-year-old retains the cognitive capacity to be commander in chief. Bloomberg entered the race in November in part because he saw an opening to replace Biden as the main centrist alternative to socialist Sanders.
His dismal fourth- and fifth-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire seemed like they could be the end of his campaign.
“They said it would be over, but it may be over for the other guy,” Biden said in a speech Tuesday night. “We’re very much alive.”
But then, Biden crushed his competition in South Carolina, winning the state by nearly 30 points. He got a wave of energy, seeming stronger on the stump than he did in Iowa and New Hampshire. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race within 24 hours of each other, preventing centrist voters from splitting votes among candidates. Both of them and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who also sought the 2020 Democratic nomination, endorsed Biden on the eve before Super Tuesday.
Biden acknowledged a bump in support as a result of the endorsements.
“We won Minnesota because of Amy Klobuchar, and we’re doing well in Texas because of Beto O’Rourke," he said Tuesday.
And he took a jab at Sanders's rhetoric, noting a surge in participation indicating support for him rather than the senator who campaigns on increasing turnout.
“People are talking about a revolution. We’re creating a movement,” Biden said.
The Biden campaign's new strength and energy was personified by top aide Symone Sanders swiftly tackling and removing a protester who rushed the stage on Tuesday evening.
In his phoenixlike rise from ashes, Biden has found a new core campaign message that may resonate with voters more than his usual argument that he will return the country to normalcy post-Trump.
“For those who’ve been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign.”

Trump reelection campaign files libel lawsuit against Washington Post

Texto completo: President Trump's reelection campaign filed a libel lawsuit against the Washington Post, accusing the outlet of knowingly publishing false information that was detrimental to him.
The lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, focuses on two stories published in June of 2019 that the president's team claimed included "false and defamatory statements of and concerning the Campaign."
One piece cited in the lawsuit, headlined, "Trump just invited another Russian attack. Mitch McConnell is making one more likely," was written by Greg Sargent for his Plum Line blog and published on June 13. The Trump team took issue with the claim that special counsel Robert Mueller found that Trump's 2016 campaign "tried to conspire with" a "sweeping and systematic" Russian attack.
Mueller's report, released in spring 2019, said there was insufficient evidence to charge the Trump campaign with criminal conspiracy with Russia.
The lawsuit also alleged a story published a week later headlined, "Trump: I can win reelection with my base," and written by Paul Waldman, an opinion writer for the Plum Line blog, was defamatory when it said, “Who knows what sort of aid Russia and North Korea will give to the Trump campaign, now that he has invited them to offer their assistance?”
The lawsuit said the Washington Post was "well aware at the time of publishing" that the statements "were not true."
Jenna Ellis, the senior legal adviser to the campaign Donald J. Trump for President, said in a statement, “Today the President's re-election campaign has filed suit against The Washington Post for false statements contained in two published articles, including defamatory claims that the campaign ‘tried to conspire with’ a ‘sweeping and systematic’ attack by Russia against the 2016 U.S. presidential election and ‘who knows what sort of aid Russia and North Korea will give to the Trump campaign, now that he has invited them to offer their assistance?’
“The statements were and are 100 percent false and defamatory," she continued. "The complaint alleges The Post was aware of the falsity at the time it published them, but did so for the intentional purpose of hurting the campaign, while misleading its own readers in the process. The campaign files suit to publicly establish the truth and seek appropriate legal remedies for the harm caused by false reporting.”
“It’s disappointing to see the President’s campaign committee resorting to these types of tactics and we will vigorously defend this case," Kristine Coratti Kelly, vice president of communications at the Washington Post, said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.
The lawsuit comes after the reelection campaign filed a similar one against the New York Times last week.

New York Times fails to mention Trump in article about his nomination of first black Air Force chief

Texto completo: The New York Times reported that the U.S. Air Force is set to name its first black chief of staff without mentioning that President Trump nominated him.
The eight-paragraph article published Monday and titled "Nominee for Air Force Chief Would Be First African-American in Post" did not include the president's name or a mention of him once.
Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., who goes by the nickname C.Q., is currently the commander of U.S. Pacific Air Forces and one of only two black four-star generals currently serving. He is also a decorated fighter pilot who has served multiple combat tours across the globe.
“The USAF will be well served by the formidable talents of CQ Brown,” Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett said about the appointment. “He has unmatched strategic vision & operational expertise. His leadership will be instrumental as the service continues to focus on the capabilities & talent we need to implement the #NDS.”
Brown, if confirmed, will be taking over for Gen. David Goldfein, who has filled the position since 2016 but is expected to resign this year.
“Congratulations to Gen CQ Brown on his nomination to be our next Chief. He’s led worldwide — in the Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa,” Goldfein said on Twitter. “When it comes to global, operational savvy there’s nobody stronger — one of the finest warriors our @usairforce has ever produced.”
Trump’s reelection campaign sued the New York Times last week for libel related to an article about Russian interference in the 2016 election.

How to not overreact to the coronavirus

Texto completo: People have responded to the rise of the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, as they have with other pandemics: in a calm, rational way.
Just kidding! Stores are selling out of groceries, hand sanitizer, and face masks — even though those surgical masks won’t keep you from getting the virus.
The masks that will help should be reserved for medical professionals who really need them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend the everyday use of respirators. Instead, it suggests “everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as avoiding people who are sick, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue.”
With numbers including a global death toll of over 3,000, six deaths in the United States, and over 92,000 people affected worldwide, the coronavirus is, reasonably, causing alarm. Most of those who die from the disease, however, are elderly and have preexisting conditions. If those circumstances do not apply to you and you have not been diagnosed with COVID-19, breathe easier, and take these pieces of nonprofessional advice:
Do not buy a mask.
A surgical mask will not save you from contracting the virus, but a medical respirator or an N95 mask will. However, the CDC says this type of mask “is recommended only for use by healthcare personnel (HCP) who need protection from both airborne and fluid hazards (e.g., splashes, sprays).” You don’t need a mask, but you do need to stop touching your face.
Do not buy up half the grocery store.
Reports of long lines at grocery stores and empty shelves have confirmed that people are more than a little panicked about the coronavirus. But odds are you’ll still be able to go out in public for some time, so there’s no harm in buying perishable goods or holding off on buying a dozen cans of chicken noodle soup. And yes, you can still buy Corona beer.
Tweet
Do buy hand sanitizer — but not all of it.
To keep germs at bay, the CDC recommends an “alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60% to 95% alcohol.” As stores are running out of hand sanitizer, searches for “how to make hand sanitizer” have spiked online. The DIY method is a pretty simple solution — that is, until stores also start selling out of aloe vera and rubbing alcohol.
Do not politicize it.
No, this is not "Trumpvirus." At least two New York Times columnists have adopted the nickname, but as annoying as it is for political narratives, you can’t blame the spread of a virus based out of China on President Trump. This is no excuse to punish Chinese expats either. You can still safely go to Chinese restaurants and enjoy your chow mein.

Warren and Bloomberg fall flat: Latest Super Tuesday updates

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren are in big trouble as early Super Tuesday reports show their candidacies falling flat.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders challenged the Massachusetts senator on her own turf by holding multiple rallies in the state in the days before Super Tuesday. But it was Joe Biden leading the state at 33%, with 28% of precincts reporting. Sanders is in second with 25%, and Warren is in third place with 21%.
The New York Times projects that Warren and the billionaire former New York City mayor will be around 400-plus delegates behind Sanders and Biden after final tallies.
Bloomberg said earlier on Tuesday that he has “no intention of dropping out," but his team reportedly plans to "reassess" his campaign on Wednesday. He is facing pressure to drop out of the race to prevent splitting the centrist vote between him and Biden, which risks giving socialist Sanders a path to earning a plurality of delegates.
Beating Bloomberg and Warren is another sign that Biden's victory on Saturday in South Carolina, followed by the quick endorsements of former rivals Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Beto O'Rourke, gave a serious boost to what had been a flagging campaign that many people were already writing off. News organizations called Virginia, North Carolina, and Alabama for Biden just seconds after polls closed, indicating that his wins were by such big margins that they could not be in doubt.
9:33 p.m. ET: Warning signs for Sanders in Texas and Oklahoma
8:05 p.m. EST: Big night for Joe Biden in early Super Tuesday states
7:18 p.m. EST: Biden vs. Sanders race taking shape as first polls close
Results from 14 states plus the territory of American Samoa on Tuesday account for 1,344 pledged nominating delegates, about one-third of the total. A candidate needs a majority of 1,991 pledged delegates to win the nomination on the first Democratic National Convention ballot and prevent a contested convention. In the event of a brokered convention, about 770 automatic superdelegates, party leaders such as Democratic National Committee members and Democratic members of Congress, are permitted to vote for whomever they wish.
Delegates are allocated based on the proportion of statewide votes and votes within congressional districts (except for Texas, which allocates district delegates based on state Senate districts rather than congressional districts). Candidates must obtain 15% support statewide or in at least one district to earn delegates, meaning that a candidate could pick up some district delegates even if they do not capture more than 15% support statewide.
Polls have not yet closed in California, which has the most delegates of the Super Tuesday states at 415. They close at 11 p.m. EST (8 p.m. PST).
About 40% of California's primary electorate votes absentee by mail, meaning that Biden's wave of endorsements from former rivals on Monday could have a smaller effect there.
Mail-in ballots could also delay declaring a winner in the state's primary. The last ballots are expected to arrive in mid-March.

Texto completo: An elderly patient who died last week in Washington has tested positive for COVID-19, sparking renewed concern about the transmission of the disease and U.S. health officials' ability to detect and isolate infected people.
Susan Gregg, a spokeswoman for the Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, said hospital staff were without knowledge of the person's illness and possibly could have been infected with coronavirus through standard care procedures.
“In coordination with Public Health, we have determined that some staff may have been exposed while working in an intensive care unit where the patient had been treated,” Gregg told the New York Times on Tuesday.
Washington state and Seattle, in particular, have been most affected by the outbreak, and the patient's death last Wednesday marks the seventh in the nation, including some from the same nursing home.
Washington health officials asked the state legislature to provide more than $100 million in emergency funding to combat the disease as lawmakers debate whether to close schools and postpone public events amid the health crisis. State officials have proposed utilizing motels in the Seattle region to quarantine patients who may be infected with the illness.
More than 2,800 people have died and over 80,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 since the disease spiraled out of control in China late last year.

Democrats have benefited from Russia more than Republicans

Texto completo: Political consultants on both the Left and the Right actually know very little about politics, and there’s no one who demonstrates that better than former Obama White House adviser David Plouffe.
Tuesday on MSNBC, Plouffe actually said with a straight face that Democrats are at a disadvantage going into the election because, “We don't have Fox, Sinclair, or the Russians.”
Who knew Republicans were so lucky? They’ve got Chris Wallace, a handful of local TV stations and, naturally, the Russians!
President Trump should be thanking God right at this very moment for that bounty.
And how sad for Democrats because what do they have? Only the entire entertainment industry, the New York Times, the Washington Post, NBC, CBS, ABC, MSNBC, and CNN.
It’s laughable to suggest that it’s Republicans who benefit in any way from anything having to do with Russia.
Russia is the Democrats’ favorite weapon in Washington. They even use it among themselves.
At the Democratic debate last week, Michael Bloomberg told Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that “Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States and that is why Russia is helping you get elected.”
Hillary Clinton called Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard a “Russian asset.”
Both the Washington Post and the New York Times eagerly ran stories in January, alleging that Russian hackers had breached the internal systems of Burisma, the Ukrainian oil company that implicated Joe Biden and his son in the impeachment saga. The origin of that claim: Oren Falkowitz, who is working with Democratic presidential candidates.
It’s a great myth that Russia provides a great boost to Trump. The opposite is true. No one has been hurt more by Russia than Trump. Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, based on the ridiculous premise that Trump’s campaign was working with Putin, ate through two years of Trump’s first term, giving Democrats in Congress the perfect excuse to refuse to cooperate with the president and Republicans on anything and everything.
What did Trump get out of Russia? Emails? Hilarious. Does anyone even remember what was in them? The only remarkable thing to come out of the WikiLeaks email dumps was the truth that the Democratic establishment had wanted Clinton as its nominee and was working to undercut Sanders in 2016. As if that weren’t obvious from the beginning of that campaign.
Russia has not been great for Republicans at all. But at least they have Wallace and Sinclair!

White House lawyer cited in Vindman testimony named National Security Council intelligence chief

Texto completo: A White House lawyer who was named in the Ukraine impeachment investigation is the new senior director for intelligence on the National Security Council.
Michael Ellis, a deputy to White House counsel John Eisenberg, took on the role on Monday, according to Politico.
Ellis has strong ties to Republicans loyal to President Trump. He served as a counsel to the House Intelligence Committee when it was led by Republican California Rep. Devin Nunes. In his new position, Ellis serves as the link between the U.S. Intelligence Community and the White House. The role oversees the most sensitive information that is stored in the National Security Council’s servers.
Ellis has been at the White House since 2017. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an impeachment witness who was removed from the National Security Council, said Ellis was one of the officials who ordered a transcript of Trump’s call with Ukraine's leader to be moved to the council’s highly secure server that is typically reserved for highly classified information only a select few can access. Ellis’s testimony was requested by House Democrats during the impeachment hearings, but he declined to appear for a deposition.
Democrats accused the president of improperly pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, and Trump was impeached by the House on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The GOP-led Senate acquitted the president last month.
Ellis was also a key figure connected to the Republican inquiry into the origins of the FBI investigation into Trump’s campaign. He was named by the New York Times as one of the White House officials who informed Nunes that Trump’s campaign had been incidentally caught up in surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies.

Supreme Court rules states can prosecute illegal immigrants for providing false information on federal work papers

Texto completo: The Supreme Court on Tuesday expanded the rights of states to prosecute illegal immigrants who use fake Social Security numbers to obtain a job.
In a 5-4 decision, the court reinstated convictions won by prosecutors in Kansas against three illegal immigrants who used other people’s information when applying for a job, the Wall Street Journal reported.
“In the present cases, there is certainly no suggestion that the Kansas prosecutions frustrated any federal interests,” Justice Samuel Alito said in a written opinion.
Lawyers for the undocumented workers argued the state could not prosecute them because of a federal statute that previously barred prosecution of these individuals based on the information provided on I-9 forms.
Ramiro Garcia, a line cook in Kansas, was arrested and charged in 2012 after he provided another person's Social Security number on a work authorization form. A state court reversed his conviction on appeal in 2017, citing the federal statue.
Prosecutors appealed the State Court's ruling, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case during this year's term.
Kansas was backed by the Trump administration and 12 states in arguing that it can prosecute because the same information also appears on state work forms, the New York Times reported.
In his dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the law “reserves to the federal government—and thus takes from the states—the power to prosecute people for misrepresenting material information in an effort to convince their employer that they are authorized to work in this country."
Breyer was joined in his dissent by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.

Texto completo: Chicago • The number of known coronavirus cases in the United States spiked over the weekend and into Monday, with dozens of new diagnoses bringing the total of confirmations to more than 100.
Public health officials reported that the virus was spreading among people with no history of overseas travel. Schools closed. Governors declared states of emergency.
The New York Times has been tracking every case in the United States for more than a month and maintaining a database using information from federal, state and local officials to keep an accurate count.
The number of patients treated in the United States remains a small fraction of those diagnosed overseas, where thousands of people have died and tens of thousands have been infected. Most states have not had any confirmed cases.
[ Read more: Complete coverage of the coronavirus ]
But as concern about a broader outbreak spreads, here is what is known about the current cases.
There’s unexplained spread on the West Coast.
For weeks, nearly all the coronavirus cases in the United States could be directly connected to overseas travel or to close personal contact with someone who had recently returned from a trip. In recent days, that has started to change.
Health officials in California, Oregon and Washington state have all reported incidents of the virus turning up in people with no high-risk travel history, suggesting that it could be spreading undetected within the United States.
The toll has been especially severe at a nursing home in suburban Seattle.
Six people have died in Washington state.
The first coronavirus deaths in the United States were reported over the weekend in King County, Washington, which includes Seattle.
The first fatality, announced Saturday, was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions. The second, announced Sunday, was a man in his 70s who was a resident of the nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, where several cases have been identified.
On Monday, officials in Washington announced that four more people, including three nursing home residents had died from the coronavirus. Other residents of that facility were hospitalized in critical condition.
Patients have been treated in 15 states.
While coronavirus has been diagnosed on both coasts and in the Midwest, it has mostly been concentrated in just a handful of states.
Combined, California and Washington account for 60 of the cases. Those patients include a mix of people who contracted the illness locally, traveled in China or were passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which docked in Japan after an outbreak on board. Doctors in Nebraska, where there is a hospital unit specializing in biocontainment, have treated 13 coronavirus patients, all of them former Diamond Princess passengers.
Health officials in Illinois, Florida, Georgia, Oregon, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have all reported multiple cases of coronavirus. And individual patients, all of whom had a high-risk travel history, have been treated in Arizona, New Hampshire, New York, Utah and Wisconsin.
Nearly half of U.S. patients were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
Forty-three Americans who spent time aboard the ship, where the virus spread among passengers and crew members, were evacuated and treated in the United States.
Those patients, who were flown out of Japan on two U.S. government flights, have received care at hospitals in California, Nebraska, Texas, Utah and Washington state.
Dr. Matt Willis, the public health officer in Marin County, California, said one Diamond Princess passenger who tested positive was being monitored at a hospital there. The patient, Willis said, was “not sick at all” and eager to return home.
“We’re just sort of waiting to see what plays out as the body fights the virus,” Willis said. “And potentially it could be weeks. And that’s tying up a precious hospital bed for a long time.”
The vast majority of patients traveled overseas.
Though more and more unexplained cases have been identified, most people with coronavirus in the United States recently spent time in a country with a larger outbreak.
A woman in Washington state who traveled to South Korea was diagnosed late last week. On Sunday, the first diagnosis in New York was announced, involving a woman who had traveled in Iran.
And over the weekend, health officials in Rhode Island said two people, including a teenager, who had returned from a school trip to Italy were diagnosed with coronavirus. Others who went on that trip were being held out of class, and the school was closed for deep cleaning.
Several patients have already recovered.
Many people with coronavirus experience only minor symptoms, and some of the first patients in the United States have already recovered and returned to daily life. Those people include a man in Washington state, two people from China who were diagnosed while traveling in California, and a married couple in the Chicago area.
“They have now had multiple rounds of negative testing for the virus and are clinically well,” Dr. Allison Arwady, the county public health commissioner in Chicago, said last month as the couple was released from isolation. “They do not need to wear masks, and neither does anyone interacting with them. They have been cleared.”

Texto completo: The new coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, now threatening to snowball into a full-fledged pandemic, has already begun to wreak a sort of global havoc, causing alarm and even panic in several countries, spasms in financial markets and, most painfully, loss of life. There has been very little time so far for reflection, and few of us have stopped to wonder what this crisis might tell us about ourselves — about our bodies, our communities, our political systems and the nature of our growing interconnectedness across borders. But I believe it has something crucial to tell.
Well before the current outbreak, a global tendency to build walls and seal off national borders — between the United States and Mexico, Israel and Palestine, Hungary and Serbia and Croatia and elsewhere — had taken hold. The resurgent nationalism instigating this tendency nourishes itself on the fear of migrants and social contagion, while cherishing the impossible ideal of purity within the walled polity.
The border closures, obstacles to travel and quarantines now being imposed in response to the viruses are on the surface medical measures, but they are also symbolic, resonating with the same basic logic as the construction of physical walls for political reasons. Both acts are meant to reassure citizens and give them a false sense of security. At the same time, they ignore the main problem — the poor state of transnational governance and decision-making that are vitally important for tackling climate and migrant crises, pandemics and economic crimes like tax evasion.
Survivalism has always followed a trajectory parallel to that of virulent nationalism. At its core is the fiction of a self-reliant, totally independent and autonomous, Crusoesque individual, the one who is smart and strong enough to be able to save himself (the gendered pronoun is not accidental here) and, perhaps, his family. Following the trail of the theological doctrine of salvation reserved for the select few, this attitude abstracts human beings from the environmental, communal, economic and other contexts of their lives.
As panic sets in in some quarters, personal border closure imitates the knee-jerk political gesture: Food and medical supplies are hoarded, while the wealthiest few prepare their luxury doomsday bunkers. But what the novel coronavirus demonstrates, in contrast to these survivalist fictions, is that borders are porous by definition; no matter how fortified, they are more like living membranes than inorganic walls. An individual or a state that effectively manages to cut itself off from the outside will be as good as dead.
Viruses are more than occasional threatening eruptions on the seemingly calm global horizons; they are also figurations of the contemporary social and political world. (We might say, tongue in cheek: The bug is not a bug but a feature.) And in this case, a symbol subtler than the wall emerges — that of a crown.
COVID-19 belongs to a group of RNA viruses transmissible between animals and people. As this feature indicates, it does not obey natural systems of classification and species boundaries, either. The club-shaped spikes on the virus’s spherical surface have earned it the name coronavirus, derived from the Latin word for “crown,” corona , which harkens back to the Greek korōnē , meaning “wreath” or “garland.” The attribute of sovereignty par excellence, a crown is bestowed on a microscopic entity that defies distinctions between various classes of beings, as well as between the domains of life and death. Transgressing old borders, the virus becomes a figure of sovereignty in the age of the dispersion of power. To understand its workings is to get a glimpse of the way power operates today.
One aspect of viral activity is to infiltrate and to transcribe the texts of host cells and computer programs. Another is to replicate itself as widely as possible. In the social media universe, both aspects are actually coveted: When a photograph, a video, a joke or a story is shared, quickly spreading among internet or cellphone users, it is said to go viral. A high rate of viral content’s replication is not sufficient, as it needs to make an impact, transcribing, as it were, the social text it has infiltrated. The ultimate goal is to assert one’s influence through a widely disseminated image or story and wield that power. Going viral introduces a fair degree of complexity into our affective relation to viruses: feared, when we become their targets and possible hosts; desired, when they are our instruments for reaching a sizable audience.
The comparison of going viral on the Internet and a coronavirus pandemic is not far-fetched. The global dimension of recent epidemics is a result of the increasing mobility and physical interconnectedness of large segments of world population engaged in mass tourism, educational and professional exchanges, long-distance relations, international cultural and sports events, and so on. It was on board cruise ships, such as the Diamond Princess, on planes, in trains and hotels that the virus traveled beyond the hot spot of its initial outbreak — in other words, in those cases when one sent oneself , not just one’s image or message, elsewhere.
Whether we like it or not, we are all hosts for elements that are alien to us at every level of existence. Moreover, there is always a risk that hosts would be harmed by those they host. This risk is ineliminable. Rather than conjure up the specters of sovereign nation-states and autonomous individuals, we need to learn to live in a world that is interconnected not only ethereally or ideally, through communication technologies, but also materially, via direct embodied contact. In short, we must learn to live in a reality that may, at any moment, go viral.

Texto completo: Before the South Carolina Democratic primary, many in elite political circles were writing the Joe Biden campaign’s obituary. And they were enjoying it.
Political cycles love stories of trajectory: an improbable rise or a tragic fall. Coasting lacks sizzle. A coronation lacks sensation. So being an early front-runner is a precarious position. The power of story pulls on you like gravity, willing you to the ground.
But, with Biden’s blowout victory in South Carolina, he breathed new life into his limping campaign, offering new hope not only to his campaign but also to moderate Democrats who have yet to settle on a primary champion.
But, aside from Biden’s victory, exit poll data from the state offers a number of warnings and signals for Democrats moving forward.
First, if the results in Nevada and South Carolina are harbingers for the rest of the nation, this primary season will further explode the people-of-color, intersectional interests argument. It is completely plausible that black and Hispanic voters could consistently and repeatedly pick different candidates, Biden for the former group and Bernie Sanders for the latter.
Biden is not only benefiting from Barack Obama’s cultural residue, his more moderate policies speak to the moderate, and even conservative, streak in many black voters.
Sanders’ outreach to the Hispanic community seems to have paid more dividends than his outreach to the black community. One contributing factor is that Sanders does better in general among younger, more idealistic voters, and the Hispanic population in America is generally younger.
As the Pew Research Center has pointed out, nearly 60% of the nation’s Hispanic population are millennials (those now ages 24 to 39) or younger, while “half of the black population and 46% of the U.S. Asian population are millennials or younger.”
There are very real implications of this chasm to consider. What would it mean for the Democrats to choose a candidate who couldn’t carry the black vote in a single state? Or conversely, not win the Hispanic vote? How would that play in November?
Second, for all the Democrats holding out hope that Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire carpetbagger carrying the weight of his horrific racial history, could muscle his way into the races and force voters into submission and amnesia, South Carolina waved a giant red flag.
Bloomberg wasn’t on the ballot in the state, but voters at the polls were still asked their opinion of him along with their opinion of the other candidates. A whopping 66% said that they had an unfavorable opinion of Bloomberg. That was higher than the unfavorable rating of any other candidate. No other candidate’s unfavorable rating crossed the 50% mark. Only 26% of voters in the state had a favorable opinion of Bloomberg.
Of course, Bloomberg didn’t saturate the airwaves with his propaganda in South Carolina the way that he has done in Super Tuesday states, so results this week could be different. But Democrats should be extremely concerned that when voters are left to discover a candidate on their own, through the press and their own research, they come away with such a repulsed impression.
Third, people can like you as a person but simply not believe that you are the best candidate. Pete Buttigieg’s candidacy provided an example of this. Before he dropped out of the race Sunday, a plurality of South Carolina voters (49%) said that they had a favorable opinion of the former mayor, but only 7% thought he best understood the concerns of racial/ethnic minorities.
Trying to replicate the Obama victory is a fool’s errand. That was a lightning strike. It won’t hit the same spot twice.
Finally, there is a religious split that we should track and deeply consider. In South Carolina, 83% of voters said they attend religious services occasionally or more often than that. Biden won a majority of those voters. Sanders won only 17% of them. Sanders did, however, win a plurality of the 17% of voters who said they never attend religious services.
On this metric, South Carolina matches up rather well with the country as a whole. In 2016, 78% of voters said that they attended religious services at least a few times a year. The problem was that Donald Trump won those who attended those services most often.
Democrats must decide how important it is to have a candidate who can compete for those religious voters, or if a different coalition centering on different interests can compensate for this.
There are lessons and considerations coming out of South Carolina that every Super Tuesday voter must grapple with. With Biden’s win, the electability argument once again takes center stage.

Texto completo: To Pete Buttigieg’s many other virtues, add these: He’s not delusional, and he can see beyond himself.
He looked at what happened in South Carolina on Saturday. He looked at what was likely to happen in the many states that will vote Tuesday. And Buttigieg recognized that he had no path to the Democratic presidential nomination and that staying in the race would probably help Bernie Sanders, the rival he had branded a dangerous nominee.
So on Sunday he got out. Just like that. No praying for a miracle. No waiting too long. No protracted melodrama or slow-building drum roll of hints. No, the youngest of the Democratic aspirants did the grown-up thing.
I can only imagine how bitter that felt, given how high he had flown. And I can only hope that he and the rest of us never minimize that altitude.
Some other Democrat will carry the party’s hopes in November. Some other Democrat — please, God — will replace Donald Trump in the White House and both dull the memory of him and clean up his mess.
But no other Democrat will be able to claim a more surprising, disarming showing in 2020 than Buttigieg can. After the first two contests, in Iowa and New Hampshire, he had more delegates than anyone. He finished in the top four in all of the first four states to vote.
That was despite the fact that his highest political office has been mayor of South Bend, Indiana, with only about 100,000 people. That was despite the fact that he’s 38 and would have been the youngest person ever elected to the presidency.
That was despite the fact that he’s married to another man. For many Democrats Buttigieg’s sexual orientation made him a trailblazer and was cause for excitement, but for others it made him a risk and was cause to turn away. The degree of success that he nonetheless enjoyed reflected his ability to rise above stereotypes and identity politics and to pull voters up with him.
Buttigieg was the first major openly gay presidential candidate, and the wonder of that was how little it was talked about as his bid progressed. Rush Limbaugh, to whom Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in January, was more deviation than norm when he subsequently derided the possibility that Buttigieg, as the Democratic nominee, would be “kissing his husband onstage next to Mr. Man Donald Trump.”
And Buttigieg was in perfect form when asked during a CNN town hall to respond to that. “The idea of the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Donald Trump lecturing anybody on family values, I mean, sorry, but one thing about my marriage is it’s never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse,” he said. “They want to debate family values, let’s debate family values. I’m ready.” Was he ever.
While some of his critics on the left conducted an offensive debate about whether he was gay enough, he performed an important balancing act, integrating his gayness into his candidacy without letting his candidacy be defined by it, seizing moments to deliver lessons without ever becoming tendentious or tedious, showing the world that being gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender or queer is an essential part of who we LGBTQ people are but not all of who we are.
Buttigieg mentioned one of those lessons Sunday night in South Bend, where he gave a big speech announcing his withdrawal from the presidential race. He said that his campaign had “sent a message to every kid out there wondering if whatever marks them out as different means they are somehow destined to be less than.” They could look at him, he added, “and see that someone who once felt that exact same way can become a leading American presidential candidate with his husband at his side.”
He was talking about the experience of being in a minority and being marginalized — about the sorrow and the fear — and one of the great disappointments of his presidential bid was his inability to build a bridge between himself and others who have had that experience. He was getting better and better at it, though. He was ever more attentive to it — in his last debate, for example, and in his speech Sunday night.
I listened to that speech and realized what most impresses me about him, and it isn’t his intellect per se — the fancy degrees he has, all the languages he speaks — or his crazy poise or the manner in which he handled the novel aspects of his candidacy and persona.
It’s his thoughtfulness. Yes, he got plenty prickly and even somewhat overbearing at moments during the most recent debates, trying to break through as the clock ticked down. But still he wrestled earnestly and eloquently with the meanings of things.
“Politics at its worst is ugly,” he said Sunday night. “But at its best, politics can lift us up. It is not just policymaking. It is moral. It is soul craft.” At his best, Buttigieg demonstrated that.
He has an opportunity over the coming months to demonstrate it further. “I will do everything in my power,” he said. “to make sure we have a new Democratic president come January.”
Mayor Pete, I’m holding you to that. We all are. Because your power is remarkable.

Paul Krugman: Paranoid politics is scarier than any coronavirus

Texto completo: We still don’t know how much damage COVID-19 — the coronavirus disease — will do, but it’s reasonable to be very concerned. After all, it appears to be highly transmissible, and it is probably a lot more lethal than ordinary flu.
But not to worry, say right-wing pundits and news organizations: It’s all a hoax, a conspiracy by the liberal media to make Donald Trump look bad. Administration officials and Trump himself have echoed their claims.
These claims are, of course, crazy. Among other things, COVID-19 is a global phenomenon, with major outbreaks ranging from South Korea to Italy. Are the South Korean and Italian media also part of a conspiracy to get Trump?
This craziness was, however, entirely predictable to anyone who has been following right-wing politics. It’s just the latest battle in a long-running war on truth, on the very idea that there exists an inconvenient objective reality.
In the case of COVID-19 the usual suspects were, in part, engaged in projection. After all, they themselves engaged in a concerted effort to politically weaponize the 2014 Ebola outbreak against Barack Obama, whose response was in reality smart and effective. By the way, in the aftermath of that outbreak, the Obama administration put in place measures to deal with future pandemics — all of which Trump scrapped.
But as I said, virus denial is just the latest battle in a long-term war on truth.
Remember, conservatives have spent decades denying the reality of climate change, insisting that it’s a gigantic hoax perpetrated by a vast international scientific conspiracy. And as the signs of climate catastrophe multiply, from wildfires in Australia to drought in California, climate denial has only strengthened its grip on the GOP. On the eve of the 2018 midterms, a survey found 73% of Republican senators denying the scientific consensus that man-made climate change is happening.
Or consider how many on the right reacted after their dire predictions of hyperinflation under Obama failed to pan out — not by admitting that they were wrong, but by insisting that the numbers were being cooked. And I’m not talking about fringe figures, I’m talking about people conservatives consider leading intellectuals.
Now, this kind of conspiracy theorizing isn’t exclusively the province of the right. You can, for example, see some similar tendencies in Bernie Sanders’ team. It was dismaying to find a senior Sanders adviser declaring that all those disagreeing with proposals for a wealth tax — which, by the way, I support — “are the types of groups and academics that are funded by the powers that be, the establishment, the billionaire class.”
The thing is, while corruption by big money does happen — it’s the main force keeping zombie ideas alive — it doesn’t lie behind every policy dispute. Sometimes serious analysts just disagree. And it’s worrying that some of the Sanders people can’t tell the difference.
But the right is where the paranoid style goes hand in hand with real power, and can do real damage. Indeed, it can be deadly.
This is obvious when it comes to climate change, where conspiracy-theory-fueled denial plays a big role in blocking action, and hence poses an existential threat to civilization.
At first, it wasn’t clear whether right-wing paranoia was also hampering the response to COVID-19. But recent reporting makes it clear that one major reason the U.S. has lagged far behind other countries in testing for the coronavirus — an essential step in containing its spread — was that Trump didn’t want to believe that there was a crisis. After all, recognizing that we face a serious problem might hurt his beloved stock market.
This desire to minimize the danger to the market distorted the whole government response to the outbreak. Some have drawn parallels to the runup to the Iraq War, when the Bush administration’s evident desire to be given a rationale for war skewed intelligence toward seeing nonexistent weapons of mass destruction.
In today’s case, analysis was skewed toward not seeing a threat — and the skew was enabled, in part, by claims that all the evidence that there was, indeed, a threat was a hoax perpetrated by the liberal news media.
And there is little evidence, even now, that the Trump administration is taking the reality of COVID-19 seriously. While the administration is finally asking for additional funds to fight the disease, the sums it has suggested seem grotesquely inadequate.
Trump allies are already denouncing his critics for “politicizing” the outbreak; Donald Trump Jr. has accused Democrats of wanting to see millions die. But it was actually Trump who politicized the virus, by downplaying the danger.
It’s true that Democrats are criticizing Trump’s actions, suggesting that his refusal to accept responsibility for, well, anything is putting America at risk. Last time I checked, however, criticizing America’s leaders was still legitimate.
But that’s the thing about political paranoia: You see even the most normal criticism as part of a sinister conspiracy. And the fact that this kind of paranoia has infected our ruling party is scarier than any virus.

Area stores running short on supplies to combat coronavirus

Texto completo: DAYTON —
Area grocery stores and pharmacies are running low on hand sanitizers, face masks and some cleaning supplies as the demand for these products grow due to concerns about the spread of COVID-19.
On Monday, the Kroger Co. announced it’s limiting the sale of sanitization and cold- and flu-related products as the demand exceeds supply.
“Due to high demand and to support all customers, we will be limiting the number of sanitization, cold and flu related products to 5 each per order,” the Cincinnati-based company said on its website.
“Your order may be modified at time of pickup or delivery.”
The limitation appears to only apply to online Kroger sales, but other brick and mortar operations say the shortage has hit their stores.
Rite Aid, Walmart, Dollar General and CVS Pharmacy were among the retailers that told the Dayton Daily News on Tuesday that their supplies of masks being used to combat the new coronavirus are out or running low.
Rite Aid and CVS store employees in Kettering said they’ve been out of masks for several weeks because their supplier has been shipping a large quantity overseas.
Even smaller retailers like Whitacre’s Pharmacy in Springfield and the Benzer Pharmacy in Yellow Springs said they’ve been out of the masks.
“We just do not have them in stock like everybody else around, they are hard to get from suppliers,” a pharmacy rep from Whitacre’s said.
Clark County Public Information Officer, Michael Cooper, added, “As far as shortage of masks is concerned, our retail stores have been sold out for the last few weeks which is pretty typical for most areas. Our hospitals, public health workers and EMS are not facing a shortage at the moment, but we’re working with large distributors in case we were to have a shortage locally.”
Hospitals are more concerned about a shortage of face masks, which people have also been snatching up despite pleas from health officials. Patient and treatment rooms in hospitals always have a sink and soap to wash hands, says Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association’s head of quality and patient safety. But there are no good alternatives to masks for nurses and doctors.
University of Cincinnati Dr. Sergey Grinshpun has tested the performance of respiratory protective devices against biological agents for nearly three decades. He agrees that not only are the masks being purchased in mass right now are not needed, but may not have the desired effect when purchased.
“When some major outbreak happens such as one with coronavirus or SARS or Ebola, there is a lot of misinformation,” says Grinshpun, also a professor in the UC College of Medicine. “This relates to respiratory protection devices and what device to wear and also what protection level or efficiency you are paying for. People want to have something very light and comfortable, and they usually don’t like military style full-style respiratory systems to carry around.”
Grinshpun says that individuals wearing certified N95 filtering face piece respirators, can screen about 95 percent of airborne particles if fitted correctly. Major workplaces including hospitals do a fit testing so that respirators are properly fitted, but many ordinary citizens have no idea how to properly wear the respirator.
“The important difference is the face mask was not designed to protect a wearer, instead it is a barrier to droplets and spit generated by the wearer, which should protect others,” explained Grinshpun.
Fear of the coronavirus has led people to stock up on hand sanitizer, leaving store shelves empty and online retailers with sky-high prices set by those trying to profit on the rush. More is on the way, although it’s not clear how long it will take retailers to restock.
Sales of hand sanitizers in the U.S. were up 73% in the four weeks ending Feb. 22 compared to the same period a year ago, according to market research firm Nielsen.
The alcohol-based gunk is convenient, but hand sanitizer isn’t the best way to clean your hands. For that, soap and water still reigns supreme, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency recommends first washing hands with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under finger nails before rinsing off.
If you’re not near a sink, hand sanitizer will do. But keep in mind that it doesn’t kill all germs, the CDC says. Read the label and make sure you’re using one that has at least 60% alcohol, the health agency says. After applying it, rub it all over your hands until they’re dry. Another tip: don’t touch your face, since health officials say viruses could enter your body from your eyes, mouth or nose.
Amazon reported on its website that it removed more than 1 million products from a third-party doing business on its marketplace for selling items under false pretenses about the coronavirus.
Walmart broached the subject by repeating what many experts have been saying and issued a statement saying, “There has been a lot of information in the news about face masks, and it is important to understand face masks are not recommended by CDC for general use. The best uses for face masks as identified by CDC are for those who are sick to avoid spreading to others and by health workers and caregivers who are taking care of someone in a close setting.”
There have been no confirmed cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus in Ohio according to the Ohio Dept. of Health as of Tuesday afternoon, and just one case that is being investigated.
The death toll in the United States reached nine as of Tuesday afternoon according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Texto completo: DAYTON —
Area grocery stores and pharmacies are running low on hand sanitizers, face masks and some cleaning supplies as the demand for these products grow due to concerns about the spread of COVID-19.
On Monday, the Kroger Co. announced it’s limiting the sale of sanitization and cold- and flu-related products as the demand exceeds supply.
“Due to high demand and to support all customers, we will be limiting the number of sanitization, cold and flu related products to 5 each per order,” the Cincinnati-based company said on its website.
“Your order may be modified at time of pickup or delivery.”
The limitation appears to only apply to online Kroger sales, but other brick and mortar operations say the shortage has hit their stores.
Rite Aid, Walmart, Dollar General and CVS Pharmacy were among the retailers that told the Dayton Daily News on Tuesday that their supplies of masks being used to combat the new coronavirus are out or running low.
Rite Aid and CVS store employees in Kettering said they’ve been out of masks for several weeks because their supplier has been shipping a large quantity overseas.
Even smaller retailers like Whitacre’s Pharmacy in Springfield and the Benzer Pharmacy in Yellow Springs said they’ve been out of the masks.
“We just do not have them in stock like everybody else around, they are hard to get from suppliers,” a pharmacy rep from Whitacre’s said.
Clark County Public Information Officer, Michael Cooper, added, “As far as shortage of masks is concerned, our retail stores have been sold out for the last few weeks which is pretty typical for most areas. Our hospitals, public health workers and EMS are not facing a shortage at the moment, but we’re working with large distributors in case we were to have a shortage locally.”
Hospitals are more concerned about a shortage of face masks, which people have also been snatching up despite pleas from health officials. Patient and treatment rooms in hospitals always have a sink and soap to wash hands, says Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association’s head of quality and patient safety. But there are no good alternatives to masks for nurses and doctors.
University of Cincinnati Dr. Sergey Grinshpun has tested the performance of respiratory protective devices against biological agents for nearly three decades. He agrees that not only are the masks being purchased in mass right now are not needed, but may not have the desired effect when purchased.
“When some major outbreak happens such as one with coronavirus or SARS or Ebola, there is a lot of misinformation,” says Grinshpun, also a professor in the UC College of Medicine. “This relates to respiratory protection devices and what device to wear and also what protection level or efficiency you are paying for. People want to have something very light and comfortable, and they usually don’t like military style full-style respiratory systems to carry around.”
Grinshpun says that individuals wearing certified N95 filtering face piece respirators, can screen about 95 percent of airborne particles if fitted correctly. Major workplaces including hospitals do a fit testing so that respirators are properly fitted, but many ordinary citizens have no idea how to properly wear the respirator.
“The important difference is the face mask was not designed to protect a wearer, instead it is a barrier to droplets and spit generated by the wearer, which should protect others,” explained Grinshpun.
Fear of the coronavirus has led people to stock up on hand sanitizer, leaving store shelves empty and online retailers with sky-high prices set by those trying to profit on the rush. More is on the way, although it’s not clear how long it will take retailers to restock.

To help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, the CDC recommends the following actions:
• Frequently wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with soapy water. If unavailable, use hand sanitizer.
• Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
• Stay home when you are sick.
• Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Santa Rosa credit union hires good Samaritan fired by US Bank for giving $20 to a struggling customer

Texto completo: Emily James, by all accounts, is uncommonly generous. On Christmas Eve, she paid dearly for it.
A senior customer service officer at a U.S. Bank call center in Portland, Oregon, she was on the phone with a customer in distress.
He’d deposited his paycheck, but the bank put a hold on it. Earlier in the day, he’d been assured the hold would be lifted, and that he’d soon be able to buy gifts for his children. It wasn’t. Stranded at a gas station, his tank empty, he called the bank and spoke to James, who tried to get the hold lifted. Unable to do that, she drove 20 minutes — on her break — and handed him $20.
Instead of celebrating her for that stellar customer service, U.S. Bank fired her, along with the manager who approved the trip, for an unauthorized interaction with a customer.
In a twist reminiscent of “It’s Wonderful Life,” the 33-year-old good Samaritan has landed on her feet — in Santa Rosa. Impressed by her willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty, Community First Credit Union invited James to fly down for a series of interviews. A week later, Community First offered her a job as a training specialist.
“Their attitude was, ‘Hey, we see that this person cares, and that’s the kind of person we want working for us,’ ” said James, who has lived in Portland for the last 25 years.
Community First was impressed by James’ willingness to go above and beyond the call. “This is something we encourage,” said David Williams, the credit union’s marketing chief. “We try to hire people with that sort of helpful DNA.”
How soon does she start?
“As soon as I find a place to live,” James said.
By coincidence, Community First had bestowed its most recent Employee of the Quarter Award on a woman who came to the aid of a distressed customer. An elderly woman walked out of the Lakeport branch, only to discover that her car was stolen. When she returned to the credit union, loan officer Alexandra Wiggs took her by the hand, called the police, helped the woman fill out a police report, then drove her home.
“We gave Alex an award for that,” Williams said. “What Emily did wasn’t that dissimilar” — although the result certainly was. “I thought, I want to meet this woman.”
He’d learned about James while reading a Feb. 1 story by Nicholas Kristof, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the New York Times. After the Oregonian in Portland first told James’ story in January, Kristof wrote a column about her, eviscerating U.S. Bank, and holding it up as an example of “how some companies have lost their souls.”
So comprehensive was his takedown that the bank’s CEO, Andrew Cecere phoned him shortly after his story appeared online. “This is not who we are,” Cecere insisted. Shifting into damage control mode, the bank offered James and her boss their jobs back.
Thanks but no thanks, replied James, who didn’t trust the bank to treat her fairly. She worried about retaliation, “just based on the way they’d talked to me, and treated me.”
Fired with no severance, unable to collect unemployment benefits or qualify for food stamps during the month of January, she sold her plasma, and returned used cans — “anything I could do for extra cash.”
Unable to afford her $2,200-a-month diabetes medication without her company-paid medical insurance, she has simply gone without.
In the wake of Kristof’s column which reached a global audience, she was inundated with messages from well-wishers and some potential employers. “It was overwhelming and humbling,” she recalled.
Early in the courtship, Williams of Community First asked James if she’d be willing to relocate to Santa Rosa. She replied immediately in the affirmative. “The weather sucks here,” she said.
James visited Community First’s offices on Valentine’s Day. “It wasn’t the nervous jitters you get for an interview,” she recalled. “The culture there is great. Everybody was super kind from the get-go.”
The culture of the Santa Rosa credit union contrasts sharply with that of the stockholder-owned banking colossus James had just left. A credit union is a nonprofit cooperative, owned by its members, “the very people who use us,” Williams said. They’re also local by nature. Community First only takes deposits from, and makes loans to, customers “in our five-county footprint.”
James, by all accounts, was a natural fit. When the Community First employees who’d met and interviewed her compared notes, they agreed she was “a credit union person in a banker’s body,” Williams said.
Community First had intended to beef up its training department, “and then Emily fell out of the sky,” he said.
“She’ll be a great asset to our members,” Williams said. “And she can train people to be like her. She can make us better.”
James is eager to get started — as soon as she can find housing for herself and her dependents: Domino, a half-Great Dane rescue “whose legs operate independently from one another — she’s a big doofus but I love her to death”; and the terrier Harley Quinn, her emotional support animal. Both are featured on the Instagram account @DominoHarleyQuinn, “because I am that dog parent.”
Although she knows few people in Sonoma County, and will be leaving many friends behind, James is “more excited than nervous” about the move.
If you let fear govern your decisions, she said, “you’re never going to grow and learn.”
And there is the weather.

Texto completo: James Lipton
LOS ANGELES - James Lipton, an actor-turned-academic who became an unlikely celebrity and got hundreds of master actors and Hollywood luminaries to open up about their craft as the longtime host of "Inside the Actors Studio," died Monday.
Lipton died of bladder cancer at his New York home, his wife, Kedakai Lipton, told the New York Times and the Hollywood Reporter. He was 93.
The Detroit-born Lipton began the Bravo show in 1994 that also served as a class for his students at the Actors Studio Drama School, where he was then dean.
He often said his only requirement for a guest was whether they had something to teach his students. His first guest, Paul Newman, set a standard of stardom for those that would follow, including Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Glenn Close, Steven Spielberg and Barbra Streisand.
"Rest in peace, James Lipton. He was interested in the actor's process, which was so refreshing," Streisand said in a Twitter post.
Lipton was known, and
Often parodied, for his highbrow and sometimes worshipful tone with his subjects, and for his intensive preparation, represented by a stack of blue notecards that held his meticulously researched questions. When Will Ferrell played Lipton on "Saturday Night Live," the stack of cards was nearly a foot thick.

Texto completo: Jack Welch
BOSTON - Jack Welch, who transformed General Electric Co. into a highly profitable multinational conglomerate and parlayed his legendary business acumen into a retirement career as a corporate leadership guru, has died. He was 84.
His death was confirmed Monday by GE. The cause of death was renal failure, his wife, Suzy, told The New York Times.
Welch became one of the nation's most well-known and highly regarded corporate leaders during his two decades as GE's chairman and chief executive, from 1981 to 2001. He personified the so-called "cult of the CEO" during the late-1990s boom, when GE's soaring stock price made it the most valuable company in the world.
A chemical engineer by training, Welch transformed the company from a maker of appliances and light bulbs into an industrial and financial services powerhouse. During his tenure, GE's revenue grew nearly fivefold, and the firm's market capitalization increased 30-fold.
Welch's results-driven management approach and hands-on style were credited with helping GE turn a financial corner, although some of the success came at the expense of thousands of employees who lost their jobs in Welch's relentless efforts to cut costs and rid GE of unprofitable businesses.
Business success and outspokenness brought him wide fame.
In 1999, Fortune magazine named Welch as its "Manager of the Century."
For his first book, "Jack: Straight From the Gut," Welch received a $7.1 million advance. Although released on the very morning of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the book became a best-seller, and led to frequent speaking engagements where he took his candor on stage.
"From the day I joined GE to the day I was named CEO, 20 years later, my bosses cautioned me about my candor," Welch wrote in 'Straight from the Gut.' "I was labeled abrasive and consistently warned my candor would soon get in the way of my career ... and I'm telling you that it was candor that helped make it work."
Welch did not slow down after leaving GE.
He became a senior advisor with private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice in 2001. He also taught a course on business leadership at MIT's Sloan School of Management in 2006. In 2009, Welch founded the Jack Welch Management Institute, an online MBA program that is now part of Strayer University.
While Welch was known for being hypercompetitive, he also stressed giving everyone a fair shake.
In the 2005 book, "Winning," Welch wrote that he would like to be remembered "as a huge advocate of candor and meritocracy, and believing everyone deserves a chance. And I'd like to be remembered for trying to make the case that you can never let yourself be a victim."
Along with Welch's fame came greater scrutiny. Welch found himself defending his retirement compensation. Amid a wave of corporate scandals, details of Welch's GE perks emerged in court papers during his 2002 divorce from his wife of 13 years, Jane Beasley. He received millions of dollars in benefits, including unlimited personal use of GE's planes, office space and financial services.
After the perks became public, Welch reimbursed the company for many of them, and paid for use of aircraft and other services.

Texto completo: By the thousands, an army in knit caps and well-worn "Bernie" T-shirts kept coming down Figueroa Street downtown - past the dejected hoops fans in 76ers jerseys leaving the Staples Center, undaunted by their iPhones beeping alerts about Pete Buttigieg leaving the presidential race or a seeming surge for rival Joe Biden.
By 5 p.m., more than 20,000 of them had filled in the blank spaces on the hard concrete floor of the Los Angeles Convention Center, chanting "We want Bernie!," roaring at the sometimes corny jokes of 94-year-old comedy icon Dick Van Dyke, and making a political statement simply by size of their throng: That anyone else dreaming of the Democratic nomination will have to somehow part this blue Pacific Ocean of Bernie Sanders' voters.
The road to the White House in 2020 is paved with voters like 24-year-old Cynthia Marshall, a digital marketer who moved to North Hollywood five months ago with no savings and $20,000 in college debt. Nonetheless, Marshall - holding a "Unidos con Bernie" sign, at her third Sanders rally - has been donating $3 every month to the Vermont senator's campaign because that's the cheapest button on his website, another drop of water in the candidate's February flood of $46.5 million.
"The candidate who wins in California," Sanders intoned, "has an excellent chance to win the Democratic nomination!" For a 78-year-old democratic socialist who normally scorns TV-type political punditry, Bernie nailed it. A huge - yuuuuge?? - win and delegate haul here in California might turn Biden's Saturday South Carolina landslide from a game-changer into a mere historical footnote.
The politics out here - centered on an affordability crisis of soaring rents and stalled traffic - are a tough fit for former Vice President Biden, whose large win and dominance with African Americans in South Carolina may have come too late to make much difference in a state with 415 pledged delegates, far more than any other. The Delawarean has just one office (in East LA) in the entire state - which was padlocked when a New York Times reporter visited last week - with no presence on TV or anywhere else. One post-South Carolina poll released Sunday did suggest a big enough Biden bounce to win a few delegates in California, but far fewer than Sanders.
The size of the state also poses challenges for Mike Bloomberg - who seems to have spent $50-million-plus here, all for naught - and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is clearly popular in California but struggles against the hipper branding of the Sanders movement. Her volunteers told me high family medical bills are what motivated them to get involved with her campaign; most conceded their friends are torn between Warren and Sanders.
"I have a big belief we have to do something about climate change quick, and I believe Elizabeth Warren is the kind of person to get stuff done," said Sarah Rogers, a 30-year-old Pittsburgh native who lives in Koreatown and writes books and screenplays. "She's got a combination of a strong vision and the know-how of how to get that vision done."
California may give Warren - who was flying here Monday for an 11th-hour rally in East LA - enough delegates to justify a deeper stay in the Democratic race. But no one has worked the Golden State harder than Team Bernie, which claims more than a million voter contacts and even organized marches to early voting polls Saturday in neighborhoods like Venice and East LA.
Among the throng at the LA Convention Center, voters told me that Sanders' lifelong embrace of various forms of socialism - which has terrified leading, more centrist Democrats in key swing states such as Pennsylvania - is a feature for them, not a bug.
"Before it was more taboo to be a socialist, but now it's more mainstream because of Bernie," Andrew Pio, a 27-year-old Orange County government worker from Anaheim, Calif., told me. "Most people, young people, are earning really low wages; you can't really survive off that. I think his $15 minimum wage would help people all over the United States."
Soon Sanders took the stage - framed by huge American and California flags - and promised the sea of supporters that under his presidency, America would see the legalization of marijuana and end cash bail and raids by ICE in heavily Latino neighborhoods. "I will not allow the continued demonization of immigrants," he thundered.
The crowd roared at every vow and the idea that America's marginalized might finally have an advocate 3,000 miles away, in the White House. Then Bernie surrendered the stage to hip-hop legend Chuck D and his somewhat reworked Public Enemy Radio as the 20,000 clenched their fists in a refrain to fight the power, fight the powers that be.

Texto completo: In her junior year at Villanova University, Angelina Lincoln lived across from a student apartment building called Moulden Hall.
Passing by the gray stone residence, she often wondered about its namesake. Never did she imagine someone so unlikely. Nor did she imagine that her postgraduate studies would be consumed by a man who, born to enslaved parents as an indentured servant, decided in 1886 to will his $10,000 farm to the school's Augustinian friars.
In precarious times that saw Villanova forced twice to close its doors, William Moulden would help it survive.
His gift was forged in an "unlikely 30-year friendship between a black man and the priests he came to trust and a university built on that trust," Lincoln wrote in a summary of her master's degree research, titled "The Rooted Project." "At a time when black men were losing ground, when their rights were slipping away and white men turned their backs on them, Moulden found some who did not."
Until Lincoln began digging into the lives of Moulden and his wife, Juliana, nearly everything that university administrators knew about them fit into a blurb on Villanova's website: They were the first known African American Catholics in the area, gave $200 toward construction of the first chapel on campus, and left their estate to the school.
But "she kept finding more and more," said the Rev. Peter Donohue, university president, "... more than anyone else at Villanova knew."
Donohue had assumed that the land Moulden donated was the site of the family's original, mid-19th century log cabin, where the law school stands today. Lincoln, however, discovered that he went on to purchase a three-acre farm two miles away on what is now Lancaster Avenue in Bryn Mawr (occupied, in part, by a Qdoba restaurant).
Of that land, so precious to a freed black man, Moulden wrote in his will: "I give divise and bequeath unto my friend Reverend Francis M. Sheeran O.S.A."
But that is only the end of the story.
Examining university ties to slavery
For the 23-year-old Lincoln, it began with a class assignment from history professor Judith Giesberg, asking students to explore whether Villanova ever had ties to slavery. Such revelations had shaken several other universities, including Georgetown and Dartmouth.
Lincoln could find no links. Instead, she encountered William Moulden. Her research, as follows, started in earnest last summer.
Pennsylvania's Gradual Abolition Act of 1780 set the course for Moulden's life at the moment of his birth in Philadelphia in 1818. His parents had spent years in slavery on a Maryland plantation owned by the father of John Rudolph, a Philadelphia merchant who with his wife, Jane Lloyd Rudolph, bought an estate on what would be known as the Main Line. They called it Belle-Air.
Under the Abolition Act, people who were enslaved remained enslaved, but their children were born as indentured servants, bound as such until age 28. Moulden was one, and went to work at Belle-Air at 15.
In January 1842, with her husband dead and gone, Jane Rudolph sold the property to Augustinian priests, who later that year founded a university there. She asked them to allow Moulden and his new wife - known to have grown up in Radnor, raised by a Quaker woman - to remain on the land as farmers. She also manumitted him, releasing him from servitude, when he turned 26, two years earlier than the law required.
For five years, he and Juliana worked the school's soil. They started a family, which would grow to 13 children, and still squirreled away enough money to buy land down the road.
By 1870, the passage of the Reconstruction Amendments - the 13th, 14th, and 15th - had ended slavery and defined citizenship for all people born in the United States. The Mouldens could ride Philadelphia's street cars with white people, and William could vote. Under the federal Civil Rights Act of 1875, black Americans could sue if denied access to public establishments, such as theaters, restaurants, and hotels.
Rising racial tensions
Yet, as the Reconstruction Era neared its formal close in 1877, when the last government troops would withdraw from the South, simmering white resentment of black progress was beginning to boil.
"After Reconstruction ended, there was a backlash from whites, even in the North," said Lincoln. Moulden was wise enough to "take the temperature" of the times, and feared for his family's safety.
He was justified, Lincoln said. She cited reports by pioneering black newspaper woman Ida B. Wells, who wrote that "between 1884 and 1892, 728 black men were brutally murdered by their white neighbors, often as a result of black economic success and property ownership."
Newspapers in the North, including the New York Times and The Inquirer, fueled tensions merely through the words they used, Lincoln found. In 1886, when a black man named Jack Mingo was lynched in Eatontown, N.J., The Inquirer labeled him "the brute."
In Lower Merion, Moulden was well-aware of what was happening around him.
In 1885, after a white farmer named John Sharpless was murdered, several black men were rounded up and held for questioning. The next year, a black woman, Catherine Taswell, was killed. No one was charged.
Moulden was "no fool," Lincoln said. "He knew his neighbors well enough to be wary of what might happen after he was gone."
So, in 1886, unable to read or write, he asked Sheeran, the school's president, to compose a will leaving his farm to the Augustinians. He used his mark to sign it. But there was a stipulation. By then, all that remained of his family were Juliana and two adult children, William Celestine and Mary. The friars would have to protect them and permit them "to remain upon and occupy the house in which I now reside."
But Juliana preceded him death, in 1888. Two years later, in an article recounting a much-talked-about murder in the area, The Inquirer claimed she had once spread rumors about the crime, and described her as "an ignorant and half-witted negro woman."
Moulden himself died in 1893. When Mary, the last of his progeny, followed in 1898, the Augustinians sold the property and used the proceeds to grow their university.
"Well-timed gifts from friends and relations saved it repeatedly," Lincoln wrote. "Gifts like Moulden's."
Nearly a century later, in 1994, a stone residence was built on West Campus. Its signage said only "Moulden Hall," leaving students such as Angelina Lincoln to wonder.
The work goes on
On a recent day, Lincoln stood in the cemetery of St. Denis Roman Catholic Church in nearby Havertown, deciphering time-worn words on the headstones of William and Juliana and some of their 13 children, the last generation of Mouldens. One had lived a year, another 12, another 16, and so on.
She has scoured archives of the St. Thomas of Villanova monastery and Delaware and Montgomery Counties, and she is far from done.
The Miami native, who earned a bachelor's degree in Spanish and history in 2018, will receive her master's this summer. Both professor Giesberg and president Donohue say they'd like the university to fund an extended stay because, as Giesberg put it, "we haven't told the full story" yet.
Lincoln's thought exactly.
"I want to take the time to do it well," she said. "I want to do the family justice."

I tried to go 24 hours without touching my face. I made it 18 minutes

Texto completo: I've grown quite attached to my face over the years.
My face and I do all the normal things that a person does with a face: Eating, drinking, breathing, looking at stuff. Nothing crazy. Sometimes we whistle.
It's not an especially impressive face, it's true. But it is mine.
And now, amid the scary spread of the coronavirus, my beloved face is off-limits. The simple act of touching your face puts you at much greater risk for contracting the novel coronavirus, doctors say. Putting your filthy fingers near your somewhat less filthy mucus membranes (mouth, eyes, nose) gives the virus — any virus, really — an easy path into your body.
“Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth," a World Health Organization Q&A explains. “From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick."
A recent New York Times headline offered a straightforward prescription:
“Stop Touching Your Face!"
OK, fine. Per doctor's orders, I had already redoubled my efforts on the hand-washing front, lathering up in the men's room every couple hours like I was scrubbing in for surgery. Surely I could give up wiping my mouth, rubbing my eyes, and scratching my nose, too. How hard could it be? I'm not a 4-year-old licking the buttons in the elevator; I'm a grown man in control of my various scratching and rubbing functions.
And if forced to choose between a small chance of dying horribly and walking around all day with something dangling from my right nostril, I'll take the booger every time.
So on Monday, I resolved to quit cold turkey. If I needed to scratch something, I'd commandeer a plastic fork. If I needed some sort of mucus-based service I'd grab a tissue, which probably I should have been doing anyway. If I discovered something wedged between an incisor and a canine, well, I'd cross that bridge when I came to it. And while I do tend to spend a lot of work and personal time with my head in my hands wondering where my youth went, I decided to be less demonstrative about my ennui.
I started at about 3 p.m. and while sitting at my desk, almost immediately caught myself reaching up to brush aside a stray eyebrow hair that had fallen into my field of vision. Then my ear started to itch. Do ears count? I wasn't sure. Probably not the outside of an ear, but I don't think it's smart to dig around in there. I grabbed my plastic fork and did a little light exfoliation near my ear hole.
It turns out not touching your face requires a level of mindfulness that is typically associated with monks and tech CEOs.
Eighteen minutes into my grand experiment in making my own face off-limits, I was absentmindedly clawing at my cheek as if it was the inside of a coffin in which I'd been accidentally buried alive.
Completely unrelated: I've had a low-grade man-cold since roughly November.
How hard is it to stop touching your face? A 2015 study published in the American Journal of Infection Control found that participants put finger to face 23 times an hour, with nearly half of those touches contacting the aforementioned mucus membranes.
Anything you do 23 times an hour is going to pretty tough to quit. You might as well ask me to give up breathing, or checking my phone.
The Internet is replete with ways to make this work, each dumber than the last. Wear gloves. Wear mittens. Sit on your hands. Each of these genius strategies was typed by someone whose fingers were gently caressing a filthy keyboard and then going straight into their mouths.
At this point I gave up, washed my hands again, and then began pawing at my face like a zombie. I threw the soiled ear fork in the trash.
If I end up in quarantine, at least I won't have food in my teeth.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden is campaigning hard to win over Democratic presidential primary voters in 14 states today. And he's also running strongly in the deep state, although his campaign staff seems unsure whether to accept a new high-profile endorsement.
The online awkwardness began on Tuesday afternoon. That's when former FBI Director James Comey tweeted :
Voted in first Dem primary to support party dedicated to restoring values in WH. I agree with @amyklobuchar: We need candidate who cares about all Americans and will restore decency, dignity to the office. There is a reason Trump fears @joebiden and roots for Bernie. #Biden2020
Just 21 minutes later, the Biden campaign's Andrew Bates responded on Twitter :
Yes, customer service? I just received a package that I very much did not order. How can I return it, free of charge?
The Comey FBI was a serial violator of Justice Department regulations and prosecutorial standards. So it was momentarily encouraging to see bipartisan recognition of the problem. But Mr. Bates later added :
I forgot the #1 rule of politics, which is that if you talk about anyone or anything related to 2016, common sense goes out the window. It was meant to be a lighthearted joke - not a rejection. We appreciate the vote of anyone repelled by Donald Trump.
The truth is that any reasonable person should be repelled by a Comey endorsement. And it's not the only one the Biden camp should consider returning.
On Monday Nick Corasaniti and Alexander Burns wrote in the New York Times about the decision of Minnesota's Senator Amy Klobuchar to quit the presidential race and endorse Mr. Biden.
Among those retweeting the Times story was Obama administration Director of Central Intelligence John Brennan, who added his own comment:
Joe Biden is one of the most honest, decent, practical, & experienced individuals with whom I have ever worked. If nominated & elected, he is capable of unifying our country & restoring America's standing around the world.
It's unclear what role if any Mr. Brennan played in the abuses of the Comey-Obama era, but we now know that in 2016 the surveillance tools created to spy on America's enemies were wrongly turned on an associate of the Trump campaign named Carter Page.
In December the Obama-appointed inspector general of the Justice Department reported "significant inaccuracies and omissions" in each of the wiretap applications used to spy on Mr. Page, plus the falsification of evidence.
Specifically, Mr. Page had been helping a U.S. intelligence agency collect information on the Russians. The FBI not only never told the court he was assisting the good guys—the bureau falsely presented some of his helpful activities as evidence he was helping the bad guys.
A rejection of the Comey endorsement would be a sign that Mr. Biden is ready to lead his party toward an accounting of FBI abuses, to ensure that they are never repeated. His party and the country sorely need such leadership.
Just last week, the Journal's Kimberley A. Strassel reported on the effort by congressional Democrats to thwart potential legislative vehicles to reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Ms. Strassel noted that a key part of the strategy is to simply ignore the findings from the Obama-appointed inspector general:
Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff in particular wants to deep-six the report, since to acknowledge it would be to admit that his infamous 2018 "memo" clearing the FBI of FISA abuse was hogwash. Mr. Schiff is so determined to ignore his fiction and the FBI's abuse, the Intelligence Committee hasn't held a single hearing on the biggest intelligence scandal in decades.
There is no better way for Mr. Biden to demonstrate that he sincerely seeks a new bipartisan comity than to condemn the documented abuses of the FBI and reject the Comey endorsement.

Reader Mail
It occurs to me that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren accusing Michael Bloomberg of buying an election is a bit disingenuous. He is using millions of dollars that he earned by building a company to get his message out. Voters can vote for that message or not. Sanders and Warren both plan to use trillions of dollars of other people's money to buy votes with free college, free health care, reparations, etc. Who is trying to buy the election? As the other candidates are learning, all the money spent to get a message out doesn't buy votes if voters don't like the message.

Texto completo: Comedian Jacqueline Novak is coming to Boston with her one-woman show, “Get On Your Knees," a live stand-up routine that explores her sexual coming-of age, her love of literature, and, well, male anatomy.
“In theory, it's about [sex]," said Novak of the show in a January appearance on the Jimmy Fallon Show. “But it's very high brow. It's literary. It's spiritual."
The 16 Boston performances, scheduled for March 31 to April 12, are the first leg of the comedian's months-long tour. After the Boston run, Novak will hit Austin, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Seattle, and London.
“Get On Your Knees" originally debuted in New York last summer, where its off-Broadway run was extended four times.
The Boston performances will be held in the Nancy and Edward Roberts Studio at the Boston Center for the Art's Calderwood Pavilion, a smaller space than Novak's NYC venues.
“We are so excited for Boston audiences to experience this artist," said Erica Lynn Schwartz , the general manager of the Colonial Ambassador for Theatre Group, which is presenting the performance.
Natasha Lyonne , the “Russian Doll" and “Orange Is the New Black" star, is another presenter of the 75-minute show. Written by Novak, the show is directed by John Early and produced by Mike Birbiglia .
Tickets go on sale Friday, March 6, at 10 a.m. Tickets may be purchased online at bostontheatrescene.com

Trump Campaign Files Libel Suit Against Washington Post; Suit follows similar legal action against New York Times, both related to articles referencing the campaign's interactions with Russia

Texto completo: President Trump's re-election campaign filed a libel lawsuit against the Washington Post, accusing the newspaper of publishing "false and defamatory statements" in two opinion pieces published last year that referenced the campaign and Russia.
The lawsuit, which seeks compensatory damages "in the millions of dollars," as well as punitive damages, was filed Tuesday in federal district court in Washington, D.C. It follows a similar suit the campaign filed last week against the New York Times.
The first Post article was headlined "Trump just invited another Russian attack. Mitch McConnell is making one more likely." Published June 13, 2019, it was written by opinion writer Greg Sargent. He cites former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, writing: "Mueller also concluded that Trump and/or his campaign eagerly encouraged, tried to conspire with, and happily profited off of those efforts."
The lawsuit contends that saying the campaign tried to conspire with Russian efforts is a "defamatory claim" and argued that the Mueller report released in April, 2019 "concluded there was no conspiracy between the Campaign and the Russian government."
The second article, published June 20, 2019, was titled "Trump: I can win reelection with just my base," and was by opinion writer Paul Waldman. The lawsuit takes issue with the statement: "who knows what sort of aid Russia and North Korea will give to the Trump campaign, now that he has invited them to offer their assistance?"
The lawsuit says: "There has never been any statement by anyone associated with the Campaign or the administration 'inviting' Russia or North Korea to assist the Campaign in 2019 or beyond. There also has never been any reporting that the Campaign has ever had any contact with North Korea relating to any United States election."
Washington Post spokeswoman Kristine Coratti Kelly said in an emailed statement: "It's disappointing to see the President's campaign committee resorting to these types of tactics and we will vigorously defend this case."
Mr. Mueller's report found contacts between Russia-linked entities and Trump campaign officials. But it didn't establish that anyone affiliated with the GOP presidential campaign knowingly conspired with those efforts, the report said.
The suit was filed on behalf of the campaign by lawyer Charles Harder, who in the same capacity in October 2019 sent a letter to CNN threatening to sue the network over its coverage. CNN dismissed it as a "PR stunt." Mr. Harder had previously sued successfully on behalf of Hulk Hogan against Gawker.com, which ultimately led to the site folding.
For a public figure or organization to prevail in a defamation lawsuit, they must demonstrate not only that the statement is false but that it was made in "reckless disregard" for the truth. Statements of opinion, colorful hyperbole, exaggeration or insults are broadly protected by the First Amendment.
Commentary on political figures—especially officeholders or office-seekers—typically enjoys some of the highest degree of First Amendment protection.
Mr. Trump is likely to face an uphill battle in demonstrating that the Washington Post piece was in fact defamatory, first amendment lawyers say. Theodore Boutrous—a partner with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who also criticized the Trump campaign's lawsuit against the New York Times—called the new lawsuit "truly frivolous."
Mr. Trump has repeatedly clashed with the Washington Post and Amazon.com Inc. founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who bought the paper in 2013. Mr. Trump has blamed Mr. Bezos for unfavorable coverage of his administration in the newspaper. The Post says its editorial decisions are independent.
Amazon is in a court fight with the president over a lucrative Pentagon cloud-computing deal that was awarded to Microsoft over Amazon.
Amazon.com Inc., which argues the president exerted "improper pressure" on the Pentagon to block it from getting the contract, last month asked a judge to allow it to depose Mr. Trump in the company's legal battle to overturn the decision.
After the Amazon motion last month, the Defense Department said it "remains confident in the JEDI award."

Texto completo: Governor Wolf wants to pass this bill that we pay the state police. I don’t care how much it is. I don’t care if it is $2. I don’t care if it is $5. We shouldn’t have to pay. Let them go after the turnpike for what they did. We pay enough with the gas tax and every other type of tax to fix these roads, which are not happening. Otherwise, Mahanoy City should give me my 1% back that they are taking because nothing is being done and I sure could use my $400.
Mahanoy City

I appreciated the write-up on Pennsylvania being an early voting state and don’t disagree the way things are now. But if we really want fair elections, I believe there should be no more caucus voting and every state should have three days of voting the same days, not allowing any early influence. Paper ballots are also a must to avoid corruption and any interference by other countries.

To all you Trump lovers, this guy is a liar, a hater, a divider and a causer of violence. These are all the traits of Satan, so all you Christians voting for Trump, guess who else you are supporting?

President Trump, the Dow has dropped over 1,000 points. What good are you now?

I think some of the Republicans have hit an all-time low. We are dealing with Russia interfering with our elections and now they have a grassroots movement of the Republicans to vote in the Democratic primaries in states where they are allowed and they are going to vote for who they want to run against Trump. How are we supposed to stand a chance when you cheat like that? It is disgusting.

PennDOT, do you have your ears on? Route 61 between Pottsville and the Mount Carbon arch, put jersey barriers in. How many bad accidents do we have to have before you spend a couple dollars to save a life, to save people from ending up in wheelchairs? We have had many horrific accidents there and much suffering.

Women’s Contributions Can’t Be Held To Month

Texto completo: In 1980, President Jimmy Carter proclaimed “Women’s History Week” in March to coincide with International Women’s Day. Seven years later, Congress declared all of March to be “Women’s History Month.” During the past 30 years, schools and communities have highlighted women’s contributions to history in increasingly creative ways.
But Women’s History Month unintentionally reinforces the prevailing idea that when women do something, it is called “women’s history,” and when men do something it is called “history.” Women’s History Month also allows state school boards and curricular committees to feel as though they are including women without doing enough to update textbooks and state standards, undermining the very goals that reformers and historians aimed to achieve with the designation.
The limitations of our current approach are especially glaring in 2020, the year we mark the centennial of the 19th Amendment and witness record numbers of women running for office. People might be familiar with the names of Harriet Tubman, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton or Alice Paul. But they lack a deeper understanding of how women have shaped U.S. history or what U.S. history looks like from the perspective of women.
It is time to integrate women’s stories more fully into our national narratives and civic memories.
In large part, high school textbooks and state curricular standards are to blame for the sidelining of women’s contributions. In 1909, the leading suffrage organization surveyed history and civics textbooks to see how women were represented. The committee chairperson reported textbooks taught students “this world has been made by men and for men.” Despite the landmark contributions of generations of women and of historians, and presidential proclamations to honor women’s history, textbooks and state standards shortchanged women.
More than a century later, in 2017, the National Women’s History Museum issued a report of state curricular standards. Researchers concluded “standards overemphasize women in their domestic roles without placing women’s activities in broader economic, cultural, or political contexts.” The report found textbooks do not reflect current scholarship and just 15 women are named in more than 10 state standards. No Asian American women are included in any state standards.
Furthermore, as a recent New York Times study documented, textbooks vary widely by state. Students in California may learn, for example, that enslaved women were under constant threat of sexual violence from owners and overseers; students in Texas will not. While today’s textbooks include more diverse perspectives than a generation ago, textbooks still generally present our shared national history as a story by and for white men.
Textbooks barely scratch the surface of the broad-based, multiethnic, coast-to-coast campaign for women’s equality that resulted in the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920. Nor do most explain why the 19th Amendment did not enfranchise many women of color or why African American women in the South were not enfranchised until the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
When textbooks describe women’s activism, it generally is in tepid terms. Temperance leaders are depicted as Christian do-gooders who detested drunkenness and ribaldry, not as women who could no longer abide being raped by their drunken husbands and who feared the scourge of syphilis. Suffragists, to the extent they are covered, tend to be described as women who wanted to clean up politics with their womanly goodness - not as individuals who fundamentally understood that bodily autonomy and political autonomy are two sides of the same coin.
Textbooks also overlook the role of unconventional activists like Helen Hamilton Gardener. In March 1920, five months before the ratification of the 19th Amendment, President Woodrow Wilson nominated Gardener to the Civil Service Commission, overseeing nearly 700,000 federal employees. This appointment made Gardener the highest-ranking woman in the federal government and a national symbol of what it meant, finally, for (white) women to be full citizens. Gardener had charmed her way into the White House, converted the president into an ally and helped secure congressional passage of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.
Before becoming the suffragists’ lead negotiator in Washington, Gardener was known as the “Harriet Beecher Stowe of Fallen Women” for her bold campaign to raise the age of sexual consent for girls (in 1890, it was 12 or younger in 38 states).
Long before that, she was run out of Sandusky, Ohio, for having an affair with a married man. Ordinarily, such an offense would have been the end of a young woman’s career. But rather than retreat in shame, she moved to New York, changed her name and spent the rest of her life fighting for women’s rights.
Today, hardly anyone has heard of Gardener. She appears in no textbooks and no streets or buildings bear her name. Her remarkable story reveals just how little we know about women’s contributions and raises the question, what other women have we never heard of?
Women’s History Month was designed to bridge these gaps in knowledge, with the understanding that history has political ramifications in the present. In his proclamation, Jimmy Carter declared “understanding the true history of our country will help us to comprehend the need for full equality under the law for all our people.” He then used the occasion to urge ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.
Few understood the political importance of history better than the suffragists, the first historians of women. Generations of leaders contributed to the six-volume “History of Woman Suffrage,” which they then sent to schools and libraries, hoping to influence how history was taught. Just days after congressional passage of the 19th Amendment, Gardener reached out to the Smithsonian Institution to see about organizing a major exhibit on the women’s rights.
But suffragists like Gardener did not want us to remember their names once a year. They wanted to fundamentally rewrite our nation’s history by centering the experiences and contributions of women. Let us honor their legacy by doing that.

Texto completo: Briefcase
SAN FRANCISCO - IPhone owners could get $25 from Apple after the company agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle claims over intentionally slowing down older phones to preserve older batteries.
Apple and lawyers representing iPhone consumers agreed to a deal stemming from Apple's 2017 admission it was slowing down phone performance in older models to avoid unexpected shutdowns related to battery fatigue.
That admission led to Apple offering discounted battery replacements at $29, but many people claimed they had already spent hundreds of dollars to buy new phones because Apple didn't reveal the cause of the problem. If they had known they could just buy new batteries, they might not have bought new phones, some consumers in the case said.
Apple did not admit wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, the company will pay $310 million to $500 million, including about $93 million to lawyers representing consumers.
Ex-GE chief Welsh dies at age 84
BOSTON - Jack Welch, who transformed General Electric Co. into a highly profitable multinational conglomerate and parlayed his legendary business acumen into a retirement career as a corporate leadership guru, has died. He was 84.
His death was confirmed Monday by GE. The cause of death was renal failure, his wife Suzy told the New York Times.
Welch became one of the nation's most well-known and highly regarded corporate leaders during his two decades as GE's chairman and chief executive from 1981 to 2001. He personified the so-called "cult of the CEO" during the late-1990s boom, when GE's soaring stock price made it the most valuable company in the world.
Welch transformed the company from a maker of appliances and light bulbs into an industrial and financial services powerhouse. During his tenure, GE's firm's market capitalization increased 30-fold.
Idaho Statesman journalists seek union
BOISE - Journalists at a major daily newspaper in Idaho announced plans to unionize on Monday.
All of the eligible newsroom employees at the Idaho Statesman in Boise signed onto the plan to form the Idaho News Guild, according to a prepared statement sent out by the group. They asked the newspaper's owner, McClatchy Co., to voluntarily recognize the union.
"The Statesman's journalists are forming a union with the goal to preserve Idaho news, ensure their ability to tell the community's stories and give staff a seat at the table," the group wrote in the prepared statement.
If McClatchy Co. declines to recognize the union, the group will reach out to the National Labor Relations Board, which will hold a union election for eligible employees sometime in the next several weeks.
Watchdog: Virus will sap world economy
PARIS - A global agency says the spreading new virus could make the world economy shrink this quarter for the first time since the international financial crisis more than a decade ago.
In a special report on the virus' impact, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Monday the world economy is still expected to grow overall this year and rebound next year.
But the OECD lowered its forecasts for global growth in 2020 by half a percentage point, to 2.4%.

Texto completo: James Lipton, who interviewed hundreds of Hollywood celebrities as host of the U.S. cable-television show "Inside the Actors Studio" for two decades, has died. He was 93.
He died Monday at his Manhattan home, according to the New York Times, citing his wife, Kedakai. The cause was bladder cancer.
The founding dean of the Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University in New York, Lipton projected the image of an esteemed professor with a thoughtful, sophisticated manner. With students of his master’s degree program as the audience, he sat down with more than 250 actors, directors and writers, including Robert de Niro, Meryl Streep and Steven Spielberg.
The program debuted on the Bravo cable channel in 1994, when Lipton created it. The conversations, which focused on artistic choices instead of gossip. doubled as school seminars, with his students questioning the guest at the end of the show. He announced in late 2018 that he was leaving the show, which was scheduled to move to the Ovation TV channel.
"Jim Lipton knows everything there is to know about acting and actors," Peter Price, then-president of the National Television Academy, said in announcing Lipton’s Lifetime Achievement Emmy award in 2007. "He loves the craft of acting and has instilled that passion in his screenwriting, acting and producing as well as in his teachings to drama students and his documentation of the life stories of the most successful actors."
Joint Venture Lipton organized the educational venture between the Actors Studio and New York’s New School in the 1990s before shifting the drama program to Pace in 2006. The Actors Studio, created in 1947 as a venue for performers to hone skills between jobs, has been a professional training ground for many Hollywood stars.
Famous for ending his interviews by posing an unchanging list of 10 questions, Lipton asked his subjects to name their most and least favorite word, the sound they love and hate most, and what they would like to hear God say at heaven’s door.
He elicited confessions from some, with actor Jack Lemmon declaring himself an alcoholic during his interview. Others, such as Tom Hanks, Danny Glover and Gene Hackman, sobbed when asked about sensitive moments in their lives.
Paris Bordellos Lipton stunned fans in 2013 while promoting his book "Inside Inside" (2007) when he revealed that he had spent a year procuring customers for prostitutes in Paris’s bordellos immediately after World War II. Describing it as a rite of passage, Lipton said he had run out of money and accepted a friend’s offer to work as her "mec," the French term commonly used. He rejected the word "pimp" to describe the job he performed for an entire brothel, saying the relationship with the women was in no way abusive.
"I did a roaring business," he said in a May 2013 interview with Parade magazine. "The French ‘mecs’ didn’t exploit women. They represented them, like agents."
Born on Sept. 19, 1926, in Detroit, Lipton was the son of Betty Weinberg and Lawrence Lipton. His Polish-born father was a beatnik writer, graphic artist and journalist who left the family when Lipton was 6.
Lipton began to work at age 13 and was a copy boy at the Detroit Times. He spent a year at Wayne State University and served in the Air Force.
Acting Lessons He then enrolled in law studies in New York "because that was as far away from my father’s lunacy that I could imagine," and took drama classes with Stella Adler, who coached Marlon Brando, in the hope that acting work would finance his legal education. Lipton also trained in modern dance and ballet.
Television writing jobs came his way in the mid-1950s, when he worked on the soap opera "The Edge of Night" followed by "Another World" in the 1960s, and "Return to Peyton Place" in the 1970s. He acted in "The Guiding Light," "You Are There" and "Inner Sanctum" during the 1950s.
Lipton, who was honored as a Knight of the Order of Merit in France, was also a television producer. He oversaw the first televised U.S. presidential concert with Jimmy Carter’s inaugural gala, and reached record audiences with Bob Hope birthday specials.
Asked in the Parade interview what he would like to hear God say on arrival at the pearly gates, the atheist Lipton replied: "You see, Jim, you were wrong. I exist. But you may come in anyway."

‘Queen &amp; Slim' a timely, tragic story

Texto completo: New on DVD

The fight for justice takes complicated and unforgiving turns in the top DVD releases for March 3.

"Queen & Slim": After a painfully awkward first (and decidedly last) Tinder date, a young black man and woman (Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith) get pulled over by a hostile white police officer (Sturgill Simpson). As tension escalates in the all-too-familiar scenario, the man shoots and kills the officer in self-defense. Dubbed "the black Bonnie and Clyde," the couple go on the run and become a cultural symbol of the consequences of systemic racism and police brutality.

Kaluuya and Turner-Smith give masterful performances, as both characters' initially diverging philosophies ultimately transform and intertwine. And director Melina Matsoukas and cinematographer Tat Radcliffe present a dreamy, music video-esque aesthetic to the timely and tragic story, wrote Tribune News Service critic Katie Walsh in her review.

"Whipsawing between hope and devastation, ‘Queen & Slim' speaks to this specific cultural moment," Walsh wrote. "It's not with a grounded realism, but with an almost operatic sense of melodrama, in the writing, performances and with Matsoukas' daring cinematic style, where beauty and politics are inextricably intertwined."

"Dark Waters": An attorney who had previously worked on behalf of chemical corporations takes on behemoth DuPont in this expert legal thriller based on a true story.

Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) finds himself in a quandary when a farmer friend of his grandmother's (Bill Camp) comes to him with an eerie issue: His cows are mysteriously dying and he can't figure out why. After poring over decades of Dupont's records, Bilott discovers that PFOA (or C8), a chemical in Teflon, is poisonous to both animals and humans and is causing massive health issues, and he spends years fighting to hold the company accountable.

Ruffalo was inspired to get the rights to the story after reading a 2016 New York Times Magazine story about the ordeal and approached director Todd Haynes to make the film.

"An actor whose presence is always welcome, Ruffalo is splendid at projecting the unusual combination of bred-in-the-bone idealism with mulish stubbornness that made it impossible for Bilott to walk away," wrote Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan in his review. "Seeing ‘Dark Waters' makes you wonder not why more people don't call corporations to account, but why anyone does. And makes us all the more grateful when they do."

"Playmobil: The Movie": A brother and sister end up a part of the Playmobil universe after encountering an exhibit in a toy museum in this computer-animated film.

"2 Graves in the Desert": A man and woman discover they're being held hostage in a truck's trunk. Stars William Baldwin and Michael Madsen.

"Ana": A girl (Dafne Keen) and a car dealer (Andy Garcia) embark on a trip to locate the girl's father.

"The Furies": Kayla (Airlie Dodds) is forced into a game wherein masked men hunt down women.

"The Sonata": A violinist (Freya Tingley) inherits her composer father's estate and discovers a sinister plan.

"Titans: The Complete Second Season": A group of teen heroes continue their fight for good in this DC Universe series based on the Teen Titans team.

Mayor Pete flew sky high

Texto completo: To Pete Buttigieg's many other virtues, add these: He's not delusional, and he can see beyond himself.
He looked at what happened in South Carolina on Saturday. He looked at what was likely to happen in the many states that will vote Tuesday. And Buttigieg recognized that he had no path to the Democratic presidential nomination and that staying in the race would probably help Bernie Sanders, the rival he had branded a dangerous nominee.
So on Sunday he got out. Just like that. No praying for a miracle. No waiting too long. No protracted melodrama or slow-building drumroll of hints. No, the youngest of the Democratic aspirants did the grown-up thing.
I can only imagine how bitter that felt, given how high he had flown. And I can only hope that he and the rest of us never minimize that altitude.
Some other Democrat will carry the party's hopes in November. Some other Democrat -- please, God -- will replace Donald Trump in the White House and both dull the memory of him and clean up his mess.
But no other Democrat will be able to claim a more surprising, disarming showing in 2020 than Buttigieg can. After the first two contests, in Iowa and New Hampshire, he had more delegates than anyone. He finished in the top four in all of the first four states to vote.
That was despite the fact that his highest political office has been mayor of South Bend, Indiana, with only about 100,000 people. That was despite the fact that he's 38 and would have been the youngest person ever elected to the presidency.
That was despite the fact that he's married to another man. For many Democrats Buttigieg's sexual orientation made him a trailblazer and was cause for excitement, but for others it made him a risk and was cause to turn away. The degree of success that he nonetheless enjoyed reflected his ability to rise above stereotypes and identity politics and to pull voters up with him.
Buttigieg was the first major openly gay presidential candidate, and the wonder of that was how little it was talked about as his bid progressed. Rush Limbaugh, to whom Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in January, was more deviation than norm when he subsequently derided the possibility that Buttigieg, as the Democratic nominee, would be "kissing his husband onstage next to Mr. Man Donald Trump."
And Buttigieg was in perfect form when asked during a CNN town hall to respond to that. "The idea of the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Donald Trump lecturing anybody on family values, I mean, sorry, but one thing about my marriage is it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse," he said. "They want to debate family values, let's debate family values. I'm ready." Was he ever.
While some of his critics on the left conducted an offensive debate about whether he was gay enough, he performed an important balancing act, integrating his gayness into his candidacy without letting his candidacy be defined by it, seizing moments to deliver lessons without ever becoming tendentious or tedious, showing the world that being gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender or queer is an essential part of who we LGBTQ people are but not all of who we are.
Buttigieg mentioned one of those lessons Sunday night in South Bend, where he gave a big speech announcing his withdrawal from the presidential race. He said that his campaign had "sent a message to every kid out there wondering if whatever marks them out as different means they are somehow destined to be less than." They could look at him, he added, "and see that someone who once felt that exact same way can become a leading American presidential candidate with his husband at his side."
He was talking about the experience of being in a minority and being marginalized -- about the sorrow and the fear -- and one of the great disappointments of his presidential bid was his inability to build a bridge between himself and others who have had that experience. He was getting better and better at it, though. He was ever more attentive to it -- in his last debate, for example, and in his speech Sunday night.
I listened to that speech and realized what most impresses me about him, and it isn't his intellect per se -- the fancy degrees he has, all the languages he speaks -- or his crazy poise or the manner in which he handled the novel aspects of his candidacy and persona.
It's his thoughtfulness. Yes, he got plenty prickly and even somewhat overbearing at moments during the most recent debates, trying to break through as the clock ticked down. But still he wrestled earnestly and eloquently with the meanings of things.
"Politics at its worst is ugly," he said Sunday night. "But at its best, politics can lift us up. It is not just policymaking. It is moral. It is soul craft." At his best, Buttigieg demonstrated that.
He has an opportunity over the coming months to demonstrate it further. "I will do everything in my power," he said, "to make sure we have a new Democratic president come January."
Mayor Pete, I'm holding you to that. We all are. Because your power is remarkable.

When Polanski wins, #MeToo movement loses

Texto completo: Toxic as it sounds, imagine the inside of convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein's head. Imagine what he's thinking, now that his rampant sexual predation has come to a presumptive close, and with his life's third act plodding along in less glamorous circumstances than the Oscar-winning movie producer surely imagined for himself.
If Weinstein has Roman Polanski on the brain, is he interior-muttering six little words, over and over?
Some guys have all the luck.
On Friday at the Cesar Awards, France's equivalent to our Academy Awards, the 86-year-old Polanski -- convicted decades ago on charges of statutory rape of a 13-year-old in the United States and still a fugitive from justice -- won the best director prize for his latest film, "An Officer and a Spy."
A beautifully crafted historical drama, it concerns the late 19th-century political scandal involving Alsatian French artillery officer Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew, wrongly accused of selling secrets to the Germans. The charge of treason, fed by the glaring anti-Semitism behind the Dreyfus affair, was taken up by novelist Emile Zola. The famous newspaper editorial of the day -- titled "J'Accuse!" -- gives Polanski's docudrama its French release title.
Protests raged outside the Paris auditorium on Friday long before the Cesars began. An activism group called Osez le Feminisme, or "Dare to Be Feminist," viewed the inclusion of Polanski among the nominees, and his film's 12 nominations in all, as a cold rebuke to France's late-starting #MeToo movement. Polanski has been dogged by several accusations of sexual assault across the decades since his 1977 Los Angeles arrest.
"For women who have had the courage to speak out about the abuse they suffered," protest organizer Ursula Le Menn told the press Saturday, "there is an enormous pain seeing this man distinguished."
At the announcement Friday of Polanski's win, several audience members stormed out, notably the star of the superb French drama "Portrait of a Lady on Fire," Adèle Haenel, and the film's writer-director, Celine Sciamma. Sciamma's movie, conspicuously overlooked in many key categories Friday, continues its international success on the art-house circuit, including several Chicago area theaters.
Fearing what he called "a feminist lynching," Polanski and other nominees affiliated with "An Officer and a Spy" declined to attend. They did not, therefore, hear in person Haenel's farewell cries of "Shame!" and "Bravo, pedophilia!"
There are so many issues packed into this single moment. With France playing cultural catch-up with the #MeToo movement, the ongoing, naggingly persistent question regarding what it means to have a known criminal, Polanski, rewarded for his latest screen effort, takes on extra baggage.
From Michael Jackson to Woody Allen, in widely varying degrees of verifiable offense, how much can we separate the behavior, criminal or otherwise, of the artist from the nature and quality of the art?
Like many, Chicago-based filmmaker and University of Illinois-Chicago professor Jennifer Reeder wrestles with the implications of the Polanski win and the Cesar walkouts.
"It's a combination of things," Reeder says. "The protests (at the Cesars) related to a sense that 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' was ignored, by and large. So that's the context for watching a man considered an auteur, with a history of abusing his power, awarded yet again."
On the other hand, she says, "it's important not to ignore the work itself. It's important we look at Polanski's work in a more complicated way. Scrutinize it! Examine it!" If Polanski's film, which currently has no distribution deal in the United States either for theatrical or streaming release, ever becomes legally available, she plans to see it.
Reeder has shown earlier Polanski films in her classes, from "Rosemary's Baby" to "Chinatown." She also devotes classroom time, she says, "to talk about why Roman Polanski doesn't live in this country anymore."
Polanski's recent on-screen incarnation may well be the last time he ever comes off like a hero in the eyes of popular culture. In Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," we catch glimpses of Polanski as he tools around the Hollywood Hills with his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, two timeless, stylish emblems of industry cool in Tarantino's eyes.
At the Venice Film Festival last September, "An Officer and a Spy" received the Silver Lion (second place, effectively) from a jury headed by Argentinian director Lucretia Martel. There, too, the inclusion of Polanski's film in festival competition provoked great controversy. Prior to opening, festival director Alberto Barbera defended the overwhelmingly male-directed feature competition slate as well as the inclusion of Polanski's drama.
"I am convinced," he said during the opening news conference, "that we have to distinguish between the artist and the man."
Not long afterward, jury president Martel countered: "I don't separate the work from the author," adding that she has "recognized a lot of humanity in Polanski's previous films."
Film scholar and historian Kristin Thompson, honorary fellow in University of Wisconsin-Madison's Department of Communication Arts, served on the festival's 2019 Biennale College Cinema sidebar panel (as did I) and, while at the festival, caught the world premiere of Polanski's film.
"I have to say: very well-directed," she says, acknowledging that for countless moviegoers, activists and abuse victims appalled by Polanski's fugitive status, quality remains a non-issue.
Thompson, who runs the sterling film website "Observations on Film Art" with her husband, David Bordwell, says she "completely sympathizes" with the women who walked out at the Cesars Friday. "What bothers me," she adds, "is that a lot of other people besides Polanski worked on Polanski's film. Hundreds of people. I don't see how you can condemn the entire film on the basis of the director. ... (W)ould some protesters go so far as to say that nobody should've taken a job on the film? That nobody should've worked on it? That's going pretty far. And I think we shouldn't go that far in judgment."
The worldwide #MeToo movement hasn't moved at the same rate of speed or enlightenment, country to country, person to person. So many sharp, well-intentioned minds have changed so quickly on so many personal fronts. Kate Winslet worked with Polanski on the 2011 film "Carnage." She co-starred in Woody Allen's 2017 film "Wonder Wheel." Polanski's rap sheet was well known; Allen was a different matter, having been accused (though never charged) of child sexual abuse by his adoptive daughter, Dylan Farrow.
In 2017, Winslet told The New York Times: "Having thought it all through, you put it to one side and just work with the person. Woody Allen is an incredible director. So is Roman Polanski. I had an extraordinary working experience with both of those men, and that's the truth."
Four months later, Winslet recanted, acknowledging an internal reckoning and the "bitter regrets I have at (my) poor decision to work with individuals with whom I wish I had not. Sexual abuse is a crime. It lies with all of us to listen to the smallest of voices."
For Reeder, recently praised by "Parasite" Oscar winner Bong Joon Ho as one of 20 directors worldwide paving the cinematic way forward, the Allen conundrum is easy. "I've never been a big fan of his, so it's easier for me to turn away from his work," she says. As for Polanski, she says, she plans to see "An Officer and a Spy" if it ever becomes available.
"Seeing, critiquing, arguing over that film, and others like it," she says, "is important. But that doesn't mean I'm forgiving. Or forgetting."
"An Officer and a Spy" currently has no U.S. distribution or streaming plans.
"Portrait of a Lady on Fire" continues in limited release in the Chicago area.

Texto completo: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar ended her campaign for president Monday afternoon and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden, as the party's moderate wing has started to unite in a bid to stop Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders from building an insurmountable lead in the race for the Democratic nomination.
Klobuchar made the announcement official at a Biden rally in Dallas, where former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg also made a separate endorsement of the former vice president at a restaurant before the event. Former presidential contender Beto O'Rourke also was expected to announce his backing of Biden.
"If we spend the next four months dividing our party and going at each other, we will spend the next four years watching Donald Trump tear apart this country," Klobuchar said with Biden at her side. "We need to unite our party and our country, and to do it not just with our words, but with our actions. It is up to us, all of us, to put our country back together, to heal this country and then to build something greater.
"I believe we can do this together. And that is why today I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president!"
Klobuchar's departure from the race and endorsement of Biden played out against the cable TV split screen of Sanders holding a huge rally on her home turf in St. Paul, Minnesota. With Klobuchar out of the race, the Vermont senator is now considered a heavy favorite in Minnesota, one of the 15 states and territories to vote on Super Tuesday.
Word of Klobuchar's exit surfaced Monday afternoon, just hours after fellow moderate Buttigieg also ended his campaign with a speech before supporters Sunday night in South Bend. Buttigieg and Klobuchar both had battled fiercely for the votes among more disenchanted Republicans and more moderate Democrats, particularly in a series of testy exchanges in a Las Vegas debate leading up to the Nevada caucuses last month.
Buttigieg delivered a stinging attack against Klobuchar for failing to know the name of Mexico's president in an interview with a Spanish-language network. "Are you trying to say that I'm dumb? Or are you mocking me, here, Pete?" Klobuchar shot back at Buttigieg in one of the more memorable debate moments of the campaign. "I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete."
In the end, both Klobuchar and Buttigieg had a measure of success but were unable to grow their base enough with the most diverse sectors of the party's electorate to contend for the nomination in the long run.
Unlike Buttigieg, who won the Iowa caucuses and finished a close second in New Hampshire, Klobuchar never threatened to win any of the first four states on the nominating calendar. She exits the race after earning seven delegates -- six from New Hampshire and one from Iowa.
In the Iowa race, Klobuchar was hampered in the final days, tethered to the Senate chamber along with colleagues Elizabeth Warren and Sanders for Trump's impeachment trial. With a 12-hour window between trial sessions, she was the only senator to fly back to Iowa to campaign -- making a hastily called and well-attended rally in Sioux City.
Klobuchar surged to a surprisingly strong third-place finish in New Hampshire after a masterful debate performance in the race's final days there. Buttigieg had appeared poised to win his second straight state, but his Minnesota rival's late rise cost him enough votes to finish a close second.
Klobuchar hitched her candidacy to a theory that she would best appeal to moderate voters in key swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that Trump won four years ago. She frequently touted the fact that she convincingly won Republican congressional districts in Minnesota, including in 2018 after Trump had won the same areas two years earlier.
In the end, though, she proved to have limited appeal in the party's crowded moderate lane.
Klobuchar, however, outlasted many candidates who started the race as household names with far more political star power, including fellow Sens. Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker along with former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke. She frequently bragged of running a thrifty campaign while methodically building the number of grassroots donors and polling numbers to qualify for the Democratic debates. Unlike other rivals, she did not miss qualifying for any of them.
By Thanksgiving, Klobuchar started to see her months of stumping in Iowa begin to pay off as she quietly gained momentum in the state. Her constant talk about having actually passed legislation in Washington and having a Midwestern grit to appeal to middle-class and rural voters appealed to many moderates across the state, though some struggled to commit with so many choices in the race.
Klobuchar often talked of toughness, reminding voters that she had announced her candidacy "in a blizzard in the middle of the Mississippi River," as a metaphor of the need to unite the nation. She also frequently flashed a sense of humor on the campaign trail, which she touted as a skill that would be needed to confront -- and at times ridicule -- Trump.
After her surprisingly strong finish in New Hampshire, Klobuchar struggled to get support among black and Latino voters in Nevada and South Carolina. She also had far fewer resources than other top contenders, which left her scrambling to build staffs in those two states late in the race.
Still, the daughter of a former Minneapolis newspaper columnist proved adept at winning editorial board endorsements, including from the Houston Chronicle, Seattle Times and New Hampshire Union Leader. In the final days before the Iowa caucuses, she won a joint endorsement from The New York Times, along with Warren, and one from the Quad-City Times, a prominent paper in Iowa.
"You know what?" Klobuchar said in the race's final days as she unloaded a punchline true to her Midwestern roots. "The New York Times only covers the one city -- the Quad-City Times covers four!"

Look out for Russian vote interference, experts say

Texto completo: LANSING – With the March 10 primary one week away and Michigan seen as a battleground state in November, voters and election officials should be on guard for Russian and other foreign interference, experts say.
Threats range, they say, from false information posted online about when and how to vote, to "fake news" Facebook posts intended to increase division and reduce voter turnout, to actual attacks on voter databases and other election-related infrastructure.
But they say, residents should be mindful that one of our greatest vulnerabilities is ourselves.
Ben Nimmo, an international Internet sleuth whose work helped Facebook and other social media platforms ban thousands of accounts that spread disinformation during the 2016 election campaign, said it is the hyperpolarized nature of the U.S. political scene that makes the country more vulnerable to disinformation campaigns, which are increasingly difficult to detect.
"Disinformation operations tend to target anger and fear," said Nimmo, who is based in Scotland as director of investigations for the social network analysis firm Graphika.
"If you see a post on social media that makes you angry or afraid, take a step back and ask, 'Why is someone trying to manipulate me?'"
Nimmo, a founder of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which seeks to expose and explain online disinformation, said if there were no American Internet trolls, there could be no Russian trolls operating in the U.S., since Russian trolls pose as American trolls to exert influence on social media.
"Russian trolls did not create American trolls and they did not create the hyperpartisan atmosphere in the U.S.," he said.
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson encourages residents "to follow our social media and use our website to ensure they have accurate information about voting and voter registration," said Jake Rollow, a spokesman for Benson.
"We also direct voters to their local election clerks, as they often have the best local information," Rollow said. "Finally, when we are contacted about public misinformation — whether spread intentionally or not — we take action to have it corrected immediately."
Russian interests are not alone in spreading election-related disinformation on both sides of the political spectrum, but only Russia was identified by U.S. national intelligence agencies as having interfered in the 2016 election in an effort to help Republican Donald Trump and hurt Democrat Hillary Clinton. In 2018, a federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian intelligence agents and three Russian entities, accusing them of operating Internet "troll farms" in an attempt to sow divisions and influence the election through social media.
According to the New York Times and other media reports, intelligence officials told House Intelligence Committee members in February that a similar effort is underway in 2020, aimed at helping Trump get reelected.
John Hultquist, who tracks cyber espionage threats for government and private clients as director of intelligence analysis for FireEye, a California-based cyber threat company, said there has been relatively little election-related activity with links to Russia so far in the primary and caucus season. But he would expect such activity to ramp up as November approaches, he said.
"It's important to remember that these actions are attempts to undermine our democratic process by making it appear illegitimate," said Hultquist. "It's important to talk about this stuff, but it's important we don't do their job for them.
"Part of the intent here is to make us question everything, and we have to be very careful" only to make such connections when there is evidence to back it up, he said.
Nimmo said the last documented incident of Russian interference in the 2020 election cycle was October 2019, when Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, removed about 50 mostly Instragram accounts linked to Russia, which had names including @michigan_black_community.
Part of the Russian disinformation effort in 2016 targeted black voters in an an attempt to reduce turnout for Clinton.
A report produced in 2018 for the Senate Intelligence Committee said that Russian messaging targeted at black voters, who tend to vote Democratic, stressed "that the best way to advance the cause of the African American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead."
Nimmo said Russian operatives have a track record of focusing on swing states, which include Michigan. Since October, "not to say it's not happening, but we don't have proof," he said. It would make sense for any interference efforts to be concentrated closer to the November general election, rather than the primary elections, to maximize the impact, he said.
The Internet Research Agency, the online propaganda arm of the Russian government, is making greater efforts to cover its tracks, including use of U.S. servers, rather than ones based overseas, Nimmo said. At the same time, Facebook and other platforms are trying much harder to catch any foreign interference efforts, he said.
In 2016, a Twitter account was set up as the unofficial account of the Tennessee Republican Party and was registered with a Russian cellphone number, he said. That would be very unlikely to happen in 2020, either on the Russian end or by the U.S. social media platform in allowing the registration.
With the verified activity in October 2019, the Russian-backed trolls were mostly copying and pasting content created by Americans, he said. This makes detection more difficult because one of the ways to flag Russian accounts was by the use of broken English language in content they created themselves.
The accounts taken down in October 2019 each had between 2,500 and 5,000 followers, he said. That's an order of magnitude below what the 2016 accounts had, he said.
"If you're only copying and pasting other people's words, you don't have your own personality," and it is more difficult to attract followers, he said.
Hultquist said another major element of Russian interference from 2016 that so far has not been seen in the U.S. in 2020 is the hacking, theft and dissemination of emails and other documents, as happened in 2016 with internal records from the Democratic National Committee.
There is some evidence, Hultquist said, that Russian-backed agents attempted a hack on Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian-based energy company that employed as a board member Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a Democratic candidate for president. It's not clear whether the hack was successful, but if it was, it is possible records stolen in that attack could be released later in the election season, timed to have maximum impact, he said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, plus state election officials and a range of voter rights groups, say they are monitoring and working to combat any disinformation efforts, as well as any possible attacks on election infrastructure.
Michigan follows best practices by using paper ballots and tabulators that are not connected to the Internet until voting is finished and unofficial results are recorded on paper, he said. Benson created a panel of experts to review the election system and appointed the state's first election security expert, Rollow said.
Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, criticized Congress for not approving more funding and action to combat the foreign threat.
"We know that (in 2016) Russia took aim at black voters in particular," and tried to "promote racial discord," Clarke said. "There is great urgency to this matter. The threat is very real."
Rollow also said Benson will be "issuing guidance" to local clerks later this week on how to prepare for other contingencies, such as power outages affecting voting precincts on Election Day.
Asked whether there had been strong or concerted efforts recently to hack into Michigan's voter database, Rollow said: "We would not speak to this with respect to Michigan specifically."

We're aiding election interference

Texto completo: Based on the tone of Tuesday's Democratic debate, you'd think the Kremlin has already determined the outcome of the presidential election. Former Vice President Joe Biden said Russians are "engaged now, as I speak, in interfering in our election." Billionaire Tom Steyer said there is "an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now." Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg charged that Russia was backing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to ensure a Trump victory.
Clearly, the Russia scaremongering is in full swing. Last week's intelligence testimony that the Kremlin is backing President Donald Trump made headline news. Another report emerged alleging Moscow is backing Sanders. Biden claimed that Bernie-backing Russian bots have been attacking him on Facebook. And Hillary Clinton told a foreign audience that "Russians are back in our cyber systems," and that "anyone who tries to deny it" is living in a "sad dreamworld."
Moscow no doubt is up to something, seeking to create chaos and discredit democracy. So are other malign actors. But it is safe to say the greatest practical effect Russia will have is serving as a narrative platform for Americans to generate increasingly strident headlines, tweets and sound bites discrediting the election. This will happen whether Russian President Vladimir Putin lifts a finger or not.
First, let's acknowledge that Moscow's attempts to undermine American democracy did not start in 2016, or even back in the 1980s when Sanders was there on his honeymoon. Interference in foreign politics has been a fixture of the Kremlin's foreign strategy for 100years. These efforts have had no discernible impact on American politics, other than occasionally to provide talking points for left-wing radicals.
There is no reason to suspect Russia will improve its record in shaping American elections. The Mueller report detailed the efforts of Kremlin-linked activists to interfere in the 2016 election, but it did not conclude that these crude propaganda efforts influenced the outcome whatsoever. We should balance our legitimate concern that the Russians are trying to sway the electorate with the knowledge that they are not very good at it.
Even so, technology has made these influence operations easier to execute. Social media has empowered superficial and emotional messaging regardless of the source. And Americans hardly need Moscow to push divisive ideas. Any glance at Twitter reveals how bitter our politics has become, whether traffic is driven organically by memelords or paid for by Bloomberg.
Yet the Russian interference narrative has become entrenched.
When intelligence community election expert Shelby Pierson speculated to the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door meeting that Russia was trying to help President Trump get reelected, it quickly leaked, became a front-page story in The New York Times and precipitated the usual outrage. It took a few days for the less dramatic truth to catch up — that there was no evidence for the "misleading" supposition the Kremlin is pro-Trump; at best Russia may have a "preference" for a "deal-maker."
It is not clear how Russia would benefit from a Trump second term anyway, since the first one has not worked out well for them. President Trump has imposed sanctions on Russia, expelled Russian diplomats, sent arms to Ukraine, sold Patriot missiles to Poland, undercut Russia's natural gas markets in Europe, pursued nuclear modernization while not rushing to renew the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and even killed hundreds of Russian mercenaries in Syria.
Those who accuse the president of being a Kremlin asset should seriously rethink their premises.
It is also a mistake to blame only Russia for bot campaigns and other forms of election interference. Any foreign government with a grudge against America could be at it. Iran has already tried to hack into the Trump reelection campaign. China may also be involved in seeking to influence the U.S. election; it was recently accused of election meddling in Cambodia and Indonesia.
When incidents take place leaving behind evidence of well-known Russian cyberespionage groups like Fancy Bear, it could well be hackers from other countries trying to cover their tracks. Even Americans could be exploiting the climate of Russophobia to try to hack the election and escape undetected.
The United States should remain aware that malign groups, both foreign and domestic, will seek to exploit the increasingly shrill information domain to tilt the election playing field one way or the other. Forewarned is forearmed.
Nonetheless, Americans should not make it easy for them. We play into the hands of these groups by overreacting to the latest shiny stimulus thrown into the media ecosystem. In that sense, the real problem is much bigger than the Russians; the problem is us.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – For Democrats in 2020, the goal has never been more clear: Find a candidate who can defeat President Donald Trump in November.
But who will help them reach that goal? That's much murkier.
After a February mired by Iowa's caucus debacle and division among moderates, the Democratic candidates scramble toward the meat of the presidential primary – Super Tuesday – in desperate need of some clarity.
On Tuesday, 14 states and one U.S. territory will vote, awarding 1,357 delegates. More delegates will be doled out on Super Tuesday than on any other date of the Democratic race. Candidates will have a chance to separate themselves from the still-crowded pack.
To win the nomination on the first ballot at the party's convention, a Democrat must win a majority of the pledged delegates – at least 1,991 of the 3,979.
Super Tuesday results should give Ohio Democrats a better picture of their presidential race, which has been muddied despite 10 debates, millions spent in advertisements and 20 candidates dropping out.
That's important because Ohio's Election Day is two weeks later: March 17. On that day, 577 delegates will be up for grabs in Ohio (136 delegates), Arizona (67), Florida (219) and Illinois (155) – a kind of Super Tuesday 2.0.
It has been difficult to pin down what Ohio Democrats want in a nominee so far. Delegate selection was well-attended by supporters of several candidates. Polls have been few and far between. Endorsements have been scattered.
What could March 3 tell Ohio voters about the state of the race?
Super Tuesday voters could feel the Bern Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is leading the delegate pack – so far.
With 58 delegates and two first-place victories in February, Sanders has benefited from moderates' indecision. His farther-left lane is occupied by only Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is trailing him in both delegates and polls.
But can Sanders win Midwestern states like Ohio?
Sanders lost the 2016 Democratic primary in Ohio to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 56.1% to 43.1%. But he won states such as Michigan and Wisconsin that could be big prizes in 2020.
Super Tuesday won't tell Ohio voters much about candidates' electability in the Midwest. The only state up for grabs is Minnesota, which candidate Amy Klobuchar represents as a U.S. senator. Michigan votes on March 10.
Sanders' early victories have surprised, and in some cases, shaken the Democratic Party. Some Democrats have even reached out to Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown as an alternative to a brokered convention, the New York Times reported.
Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley, who endorsed former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, told The Enquirer that he's "very concerned" that a Sanders bid would be too polarizing.
"They're in disbelief. They can't believe he's winning," said Brian Garry, a Sanders delegate and advocate for the homeless, who lives in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Clifton. Garry offered some advice to fellow Democrats: "Wake up and smell the coffee, because Bernie Sanders does unite people."
Sanders' focus on healthcare access, climate change, a higher minimum wage and college affordability have forced fellow Democratic candidates to grapple with the issues as well, Garry said. "Bernie has pretty much single-handedly transformed the Democratic platform."
Republicans say Sanders has transformed the party's platform into something that's too far left for the average Ohioan.
"Primary voters are feeling the Bern, but it's down-ticket Democrats who are starting to feel burned," the Republican State Leadership Committee, which is focused on electing Republicans to state legislatures, said after Sanders won New Hampshire and Nevada. Ohio Republicans are hoping to hold onto supermajorities in the state House and Senate.
And don't expect Warren to cede the progressive lane either. She said during a CNN Town Hall event that he would take her fight all the way to the convention floor.
"She's a tough, smart fighter, which resonates with Democrats eager to beat Trump, especially in Ohio where his trail of empty promises is so evident," said Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld, a Warren delegate.
Squeezed in the middle Former Vice President Joe Biden separated himself from the pack Saturday with a decisive victory in South Carolina. Biden won 48.4% of the votes while second-place finisher Sander trailed at 19.9%.
After the February races, Biden has 54 delegates. Of the remaining candidates, Warren has won eight and Klobuchar has won seven.
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who skipped the February elections, is starting his campaign in earnest now. Super Tuesday will be a key test of whether his more than $450 million-plus investment in advertising has paid off.
Each of these candidates is vying to be the alternative to Sanders' democratic socialist approach. Recent history supports these moderates' pitch: former Democratic presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were more centrist candidates.
"I don't think Bernie Sanders means we can't win Ohio," said Brian Hester, Butler County Democratic Party chairman and a Biden delegate. "The path for Joe Biden is a lot stronger."
Biden backers, including Rep. Jessica Miranda, D-Forest Park, point to the former vice president's work on the Violence Against Women Act and Affordable Healthcare Act as evidence of Biden's record working for Ohioans.
"Joe Biden is ready to be the champion Ohio needs in the White House," said Miranda, who is facing a tough re-election bid in a suburban Hamilton County district. "Not only that, but he's also our best option to defeat Donald Trump and support down-ballot Democrats in the fall."
Winnowing the field The moderate lane is too crowded for everyone to succeed. Super Tuesday could be a wake-up call to those without the money or support to continue. Buttigieg and former hedge-fund executive Tom Steyer dropped out of the race over the weekend after finishing fourth and third, respectively, in South Carolina.
Whoever remains after Super Tuesday will have a tight turnaround between Super Tuesday and Super Tuesday 2.0. Campaigns will have to decide how to divide staff, resources and candidates' time between Ohio and other key states like Arizona and Florida.
Some candidates already have field offices of staff and volunteers in Ohio, such as Warren and Bloomberg. Biden's campaign used Ohio surrogates to campaign over the weekend. Sanders can rely on some volunteer infrastructure from 2016.
Early voting is already underway in Ohio, but it appears many Democrats are waiting to see how the race shakes out. In the first five days of voting, 8,741 Democrats and 8,418 Republicans cast ballots in person or through the mail, according to the Ohio Secretary of State's Office.
Don't be surprised if Trump shows up in Ohio before March 17 as well. No Republican is challenging him on the Ohio ballot, but the president has made it clear that the state is key to his re-election bid.

Texto completo: Afghan women have been working to build peace for decades. We have spent years fighting for basic rights and, over the past year, for a seat at the table in talks between the United States and the Taliban. We are not reassured by the agreement signed Saturday by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban's Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.
This is a critical moment for our country. The window of opportunity to ensure that all Afghans are protected in the next phase of the peace talks is narrow. Despite the significant progress made in women's political participation in Afghanistan, Afghan women still face huge obstacles.
Afghan women and representatives from other minority groups should have been at the table for the talks that led to this agreement, but we were not.
Saturday's agreement lays the groundwork for talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. We were not surprised to read recently that while Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani is tired of bloodshed and war, he opposes preconditions to these talks. Instead of guaranteeing to protect the provisions in the Afghan Constitution that grant women equality, he suggested in a New York Times op-ed that this issue can be resolved through "consensus among Afghans."
This is doublespeak for reopening peace negotiations on the legal rights that Afghanistan's women have secured through years of blood, sweat and tears.
Afghan women are desperate for an end to the violence and a durable peace, but we fear that negotiators will trade away our rights for a deal.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – For Democrats in 2020, the goal has never been more clear: Find a candidate who can defeat President Donald Trump in November.
But who will help them reach that goal? That's much murkier.
After a February mired by Iowa's caucus debacle and division among moderates, the Democratic candidates scramble toward the meat of the presidential primary – Super Tuesday – in desperate need of some clarity. Some of that direction came before Super Tuesday in the form of three candidates dropping out.
Today, 14 states and one U.S. territory will vote, awarding 1,357 delegates. More delegates will be doled out on Super Tuesday than on any other date of the Democratic race. Candidates will have a chance to separate themselves from the still-crowded pack.

Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley, who endorsed former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, told The Enquirer that he's "very concerned" that a Sanders bid would be too polarizing.
"They're in disbelief. They can't believe he's winning," said Brian Garry, a Sanders delegate and advocate for the homeless, who lives in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Clifton. Garry offered some advice to fellow Democrats: "Wake up and smell the coffee, because Bernie Sanders does unite people."
Sanders' focus on healthcare access, climate change, a higher minimum wage and college affordability have forced fellow Democratic candidates to grapple with the issues as well, Garry said. "Bernie has pretty much single-handedly transformed the Democratic platform."
Republicans say Sanders has transformed the party's platform into something that's too far left for the average Ohioan.
"Primary voters are feeling the Bern, but it's down-ticket Democrats who are starting to feel burned," the Republican State Leadership Committee, which is focused on electing Republicans to state legislatures, said after Sanders won New Hampshire and Nevada. Ohio Republicans are hoping to hold onto supermajorities in the state House and Senate.
And don't expect Warren to cede the progressive lane either. She said during a CNN Town Hall event that he would take her fight all the way to the convention floor.
"She's a tough, smart fighter, which resonates with Democrats eager to beat Trump, especially in Ohio where his trail of empty promises is so evident," said Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld, a Warren delegate.
Squeezed in the middle Former Vice President Joe Biden separated himself from the pack Saturday with a decisive victory in South Carolina. Biden won 48.4% of the votes while second-place finisher Sander trailed at 19.9%.
After the February races, Biden has 54 delegates. Of the remaining candidates, Warren has won eight and Klobuchar has won seven.
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who skipped the February elections, is starting his campaign in earnest now. Super Tuesday will be a key test of whether his more than $450 million-plus investment in advertising has paid off.
Each of these candidates is vying to be the alternative to Sanders' democratic socialist approach. Recent history supports these moderates' pitch: former Democratic presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were more centrist candidates.
"I don't think Bernie Sanders means we can't win Ohio," said Brian Hester, Butler County Democratic Party chairman and a Biden delegate. "The path for Joe Biden is a lot stronger."
Biden backers, including Rep. Jessica Miranda, D-Forest Park, point to the former vice president's work on the Violence Against Women Act and Affordable Healthcare Act as evidence of Biden's record working for Ohioans.
"Joe Biden is ready to be the champion Ohio needs in the White House," said Miranda, who is facing a tough re-election bid in a suburban Hamilton County district. "Not only that, but he's also our best option to defeat Donald Trump and support down-ballot Democrats in the fall."
Winnowing the field The moderate lane is too crowded for everyone to succeed. Super Tuesday could be a wake-up call to those without the money or support to continue. Buttigieg and former hedge-fund executive Tom Steyer dropped out of the race over the weekend after finishing fourth and third, respectively, in South Carolina.
Whoever remains after Super Tuesday will have a tight turnaround between Super Tuesday and Super Tuesday 2.0. Campaigns will have to decide how to divide staff, resources and candidates' time between Ohio and other key states like Arizona and Florida.
Some candidates already have field offices of staff and volunteers in Ohio, such as Warren and Bloomberg. Biden's campaign used Ohio surrogates to campaign over the weekend. Sanders can rely on some volunteer infrastructure from 2016.
Early voting is already underway in Ohio, but it appears many Democrats are waiting to see how the race shakes out. In the first five days of voting, 8,741 Democrats and 8,418 Republicans cast ballots in person or through the mail, according to the Ohio Secretary of State's Office.
Don't be surprised if Trump shows up in Ohio before March 17 as well. No Republican is challenging him on the Ohio ballot, but the president has made it clear that the state is key to his re-election bid.

Texto completo: Atari. Magnavox. Intellivision.
Each evokes memories of the golden age of video games, which brought the first wave of consoles you could connect to your home television.
But there's an oft-forgotten person from that era whose contributions to the industry still resonate today: a black engineer named Jerry Lawson.
Lawson oversaw the creation of the Channel F, the first video game console with interchangeable game cartridges – something the first Atari and Magnavox Odyssey systems did not use. Those initial consoles had a selection of games hardwired into the console itself. (The Magnavox Odyssey, released in 1972, also used game "cards," that were printed circuit boards, but did not contain game data as the subsequent cartridges did.)
But Lawson, an engineer and designer at Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp., led a team at the Silicon Valley semiconductor maker charged with creating a game system using Fairchild's F8 microprocessor and storing games on cartridges.
"A lot of people in the industry swore that a microprocessor couldn't be used in video games and I knew better," Lawson said during a speech at the 2005 Classic Gaming Expo in San Francisco posted on YouTube.
The Fairchild Video Entertainment System, later named the Channel F (for "Fun"), which began selling in 1976, had games such as hockey, tennis, blackjack and a maze game that foreshadowed Pac-Man.
Before Atari, there was Channel F The console beat the Atari 2600 to market by one year. But Atari's name recognition and marketing heft basically pushed the Channel F into video game history obscurity. The system would sell about 250,000 units while the Atari 2600, which would get hits such as "Space Invaders" and "Asteroids," would go on to sell about 30 million units.
Regardless, the Channel F established the concept of a console that could play an unlimited number of games, the foundation for today's global video game market, which is projected to surpass $160 billion in 2020, according to research firm Newzoo.
Lawson, who died in 2011 at the age of 70 due to complications of diabetes, "literally created an industry that is bigger than the movie industry," said John William Templeton, executive producer of curriculum and content for ReUNION: Education-Arts-Heritage, which creates programming for schools.
How Lawson got into games A groundbreaker as one of the few African American engineers in the industry at the time, Lawson grew up in Queens, New York. He was a lifelong inventor who attended college but did not earn a college degree, according to his obituary in The New York Times. As a teen, he made money by repairing televisions.
After he moved to the Bay Area and was working at Fairchild, Lawson belonged to a home inventors club that included Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak; the pair would go on to found Apple. Lawson also built his own coin-operated arcade game called "Demolition Derby" in his garage, which led the company to ask him to focus on games, according to an interview in 2009 with Vintage Computing and Gaming.
When he left Fairchild, Lawson founded his own video game company, Videosoft, which created games for the Atari 2600 and made some of the first 3D games. But he closed the company during the video game crash of the mid-1980s.
Lawson got some recognition before he died. He was included in the 2009 documentary, "Freedom Riders of the Cutting Edge," produced by Templeton, who had served as editor of the San Jose Business Journal from 1987 to 1989.
Soon after that, Templeton mentioned Lawson to Joseph Saulter, chairman of the International Game Developers Association's diversity advisory board. "I just said to him, 'Well, you know the person who did the first video game console was black.' He just literally stopped in his tracks," Templeton said. "I just interviewed him I can bring him over and have him speak to folks."
As a result, Lawson was invited to a Blacks in Gaming gathering at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in 2011. "The most important part of it was that there were maybe 70 or so black developers there listening to him," Templeton said. "It was just extremely emotional for them because for their entire lives, their professional lives, they had been feeling like outsiders and, then they (could say), 'Hey, wait a minute, somebody who looks like me started the whole thing'."
Gordon Bellamy, who at the time was the IGDA's executive director, recalled how the event helped younger African Americans working in video games embrace "our reality, to learn and value and celebrate the very history of how our careers were built on (Lawson's legacy)," he said.
In the early '90s, Bellamy was one of the few African Americans working in video games and he rose to become a lead designer on Electronic Arts' John Madden Football franchise. "We are a continuation of a history," said Bellamy, who seven years later got an IGDA lifetime achievement award named after Lawson.
Meeting Lawson, he said, "was great and obviously for me resonant. I think for him it was his first time seeing his legacy live on not only in the recognition of his work but in all of us existing in the craft."
"As I reflect on it, I was an engineer myself coming out of school," said Bellamy, who is currently a visiting scholar at the University of Southern California and president of Gay Gaming Professionals. "I am just so thankful for his contributions that afforded me my career."
His place in video game history An exhibit of Lawson's handiwork is on permanent display at The World Video Game Hall of Fame at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York. There, you can see the Channel F game system and some of Videosoft's games.
The museum has Lawson's papers in its archive, too. Lawson and the Channel F game system are also included in "A History of Video Games in 64 Objects," a book published by the museum in 2018.
Among the museum's missions: bringing to light the contributions of minorities and women in the video game industry. Lawson's contributions counter a lack of representation of black game developers in the industry, said Jeremy Saucier, an assistant vice president for interpretation and electronic games at the museum.
"The major figures often tend to be white men," Saucier said. "We really want to get the history right and tell a more inclusive history than the meta-narrative that we have stuck with in the past."
The creation of the Channel F system by Lawsons's team at Fairchild was "an achievement (that) ends up completely changing what was at the time a really burgeoning video game industry," he said. "It laid that groundwork for the business model of the industry, the razor blade model, of (putting) a console in the hand of consumers for a low profit or loss and make much higher profits on all these individual games."
Violence in today's video games As he aged, Lawson became upset with how video games glorified violence. "Most of the games that are out now – I'm appalled by them," he told Vintage Computing and Gaming. "They're all scenario games considered with shooting somebody and killing somebody. To me, a game should be something like a skill you should develop – if you play this game, you walk away with something of value. That's what a game is to me."
Lawson's story is told almost daily still. Templeton co-produced (with William Hammons II) another documentary, "A Great Day in Gaming: the Gerald Anderson Lawson Story" in 2011 and it is shown in schools that participate in the ReUNION network.
As he works with children in Brooklyn and Queens, Templeton says he often evokes Lawson's career, "as an example of how they can be creators and not just consumers."

What could Ohio Dems learn about the field?

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – For Democrats in 2020, the goal has never been more clear: Find a candidate who can defeat President Donald Trump in November.
But who will help them reach that goal? That's much murkier.
After a February mired by Iowa's caucus debacle and division among moderates, the Democratic candidates scramble toward the meat of the presidential primary – Super Tuesday – in desperate need of some clarity.
On Tuesday, 14 states and one U.S. territory will vote, awarding 1,357 delegates. More delegates will be doled out on Super Tuesday than on any other date of the Democratic race. Candidates will have a chance to separate themselves from the still-crowded pack.
To win the nomination on the first ballot at the party's convention, a Democrat must win a majority of the pledged delegates – at least 1,991 of the 3,979.
Super Tuesday results should give Ohio Democrats a better picture of their presidential race, which has been muddied despite 10 debates, millions spent in advertisements and 20 candidates dropping out.
That's important because Ohio's Election Day is two weeks later: March 17. On that day, 577 delegates will be up for grabs in Ohio (136 delegates), Arizona (67), Florida (219) and Illinois (155) – a kind of Super Tuesday 2.0.
It has been difficult to pin down what Ohio Democrats want in a nominee so far. Delegate selection was well-attended by supporters of several candidates. Polls have been few and far between. Endorsements have been scattered.
What could March 3 tell Ohio voters about the state of the race?
Super Tuesday voters could feel the Bern Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is leading the delegate pack – so far.
With 58 delegates and two first-place victories in February, Sanders has benefited from moderates' indecision. His farther-left lane is occupied by only Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is trailing him in both delegates and polls.
But can Sanders win Midwestern states like Ohio?
Sanders lost the 2016 Democratic primary in Ohio to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 56.1% to 43.1%. But he won states such as Michigan and Wisconsin that could be big prizes in 2020.
Super Tuesday won't tell Ohio voters much about candidates' electability in the Midwest. The only state up for grabs is Minnesota, which candidate Amy Klobuchar represents as a U.S. senator. Michigan votes on March 10.
Sanders' early victories have surprised, and in some cases, shaken the Democratic Party. Some Democrats have even reached out to Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown as an alternative to a brokered convention, the New York Times reported.
Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley, who endorsed former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, told The Enquirer that he's "very concerned" that a Sanders bid would be too polarizing.
"They're in disbelief. They can't believe he's winning," said Brian Garry, a Sanders delegate and advocate for the homeless, who lives in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Clifton. Garry offered some advice to fellow Democrats: "Wake up and smell the coffee, because Bernie Sanders does unite people."
Sanders' focus on healthcare access, climate change, a higher minimum wage and college affordability have forced fellow Democratic candidates to grapple with the issues as well, Garry said. "Bernie has pretty much single-handedly transformed the Democratic platform." Republicans say Sanders has transformed the party's platform into something that's too far left for the average Ohioan.
"Primary voters are feeling the Bern, but it's down-ticket Democrats who are starting to feel burned," the Republican State Leadership Committee, which is focused on electing Republicans to state legislatures, said after Sanders won New Hampshire and Nevada. Ohio Republicans are hoping to hold onto supermajorities in the state House and Senate.

Don't be surprised if Trump shows up in Ohio before March 17 as well. No Republican is challenging him on the Ohio ballot, but the president has made it clear that the state is key to his re-election bid.

Ex-CEO expanded GE's scope, reach

Texto completo: Jack Welch, who built General Electric into an industrial and financial powerhouse and became known for an aggressive management style, has died. He was 84.
The cause of death was renal failure, his wife, Suzy Welch, told The New York Times.
Welch, who was chairman and CEO of GE from 1981 to 2001, presided over a huge increase in the company's stock and operations.
Named "Manager of the Century" by Fortune in 1999, Welch became known for his willingness to make big bets, slash jobs and sell businesses. He also published best-selling business books including "Winning" and "Jack: Straight From the Gut" and began a second career as a corporate leadership guru.
"If you grew up in business in the '90s, early 2000s, Jack Welch had a huge impact on the way you approach business," said Timothy Hubbard, assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business, who studies CEOs.
Welch left an imprint on business strategy and corporate governance that "you see ripple through companies even today," Hubbard said. "I still refer students to his book."
The year before Welch became CEO, GE posted about $27 billion in revenue. In his last full year as CEO, the company had nearly $130 billion in revenue, having recently achieved the title as the most valuable company in the world. Its total market capitalization climbed from $14 billion to $410 billion.
Welch joined GE as a chemical engineer in 1960 after earning degrees from the University of Massachusetts and the University of Illinois.
He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the company's youngest vice president in 1972 and earning the title of vice chairman in 1979. He soon succeeded Reginald Jones, becoming the company's eighth chairman and CEO.
Welch shook up the company, laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. That earned him the unwanted nickname "Neutron Jack," after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact. Welch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile.
During his reign, GE also acquired companies such as RCA, which then owned NBC, and investment bank Kidder Peabody.
Welch's results-driven management approach and hands-on style were credited with helping GE turn a financial corner.
"He definitely had a strategy where the lowest-performing employees were filtered out of the company, and this is one area that a lot of people didn't like," Hubbard said. "A number of companies adopted that type of strategy."
He went by the motto "fix it, close it or sell it," which he said he got from management consultant Peter Drucker.
While Welch is credited with building GE into a massive company, transforming it from a maker of appliances and light bulbs into an industrial and financial services powerhouse, he also made mistakes along the way.
For example, the company's GE Capital division grew too large under his wing, Hubbard said, and the company is still trying to excise that part of the business from its balance sheet.
Along with Welch's fame came greater scrutiny. Welch found himself defending his retirement compensation from GE. Amid a wave of corporate scandals, details of Welch's GE perks emerged in court papers amid his divorce from his wife of 13 years, Jane Beasley, in 2002. He received millions of dollars in benefits, including unlimited personal use of GE's planes, office space and financial services.
After the perks became public, Welch reimbursed the company for many of them and paid for the use of aircraft and other services.
Despite his reputation for being willing to let people go, Welch described his management philosophy as betting on the right people.
"I think strategy, execution and people all go together, and if you don't get the people right, the strategy doesn't matter. And if you don't get the people right, you won't get the execution. So you're dead," he said.
"Today is a sad day for the entire GE family," GE Chairman and CEO Larry Culp said in a statement. "Jack was larger than life and the heart of GE for half a century. He reshaped the face of our company and the business world."

Texto completo: James Lipton, the multi-talented familiar face who hosted "Inside the Actors Studio," has died at the age of 93, Ovation, the network that airs the show, confirmed in a statement.
In addition to his role at the helm of the long-running series, Lipton was a prolific writer and producer. Born in Detroit, Lipton rose to the level of celebrity when he began hosting the series that also served as a class for his students at the Actors Studio, where he was dean.
"We celebrate and honor the great legacy of James Lipton. James is beloved around the world for his passion, insight, and dedication to the craft of acting. With 'Inside the Actors Studio,' James has created a long-lasting impact on the acting world. Ovation mourns his loss and offers deepest condolences to his family, friends and fans," Ovation said.
As an actor, Lipton appeared most recently in the reboot of "Arrested Development, per IMDb.
His wife, Kedakai Mercedes Lipton, told The New York Times and The Hollywood Reporter he died of bladder cancer. USA TODAY has reached out to Lipton's rep for comment.
"Inside the Actors Studio" aired for more than 20 years on Bravo, premiering in 1994. Lipton interviewed Hollywood icons including Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Sally Field and Julia Roberts.
Lipton said his favorite guest on the show was Bradley Cooper, because he was a former student.
"The night that one of my students has achieved so much that he or she comes back and sits down in that chair would be the night that I have waited for since we started this thing," Lipton told Larry King in 2016. "It turned out to be Bradley Cooper."
When the show announced in 2019 it would move to Ovation, Lipton departed.
"It's very gratifying to see the legacy of 'Inside the Actors Studio' being carried forward for a new generation to appreciate and enjoy," Lipton told The Hollywood Reporter. "I made a vow early on that we would not deal in gossip – only in craft, and Ovation, as a network dedicated to the arts, will continue that tradition with the next seasons of the series."
His early acting roles included playing Dr. Dick Grant in "The Guiding Light" in 1953 and Michelangelo in "You Are There" that year. Yet he found more success as a writer, eventually becoming head writer on "Guiding Light." He also worked on more than 400 episodes on the '70s series "The Doctors."
Bravo mainstay Andy Cohen took to Twitter to mourn Lipton, writing: "(Lipton) was a warm, meticulous man with a great appreciation of the arts and wicked sense of humor. He was the face of Bravo who delivered us one-of-a-kind interviews with a breadth of superstars. He really cared about what he did. If you got booked on his show, it meant you'd made it, and had the talent to back it up. What a good guy. James Lipton will be missed."
Frances Berwick, president, NBCU Lifestyle Networks, said in a statement sent to USA TODAY: "James Lipton was a titan of the film and entertainment industry and had a profound influence on so many. I had the pleasure of working with Jim for 20 years on Bravo's first original series, his pride and joy 'Inside the Actors Studio.' We all enjoyed and respected his fierce passion, contributions to the craft, comprehensive research and his ability to bring the most intimate interviews ever conducted with A-list actors across generations."
Lipton's time in the limelight was not totally free of controversy. He memorably raised eyebrows when revealed in a 2013 interview with Parade that he was a pimp in in 1950s.
"It was only a few years after the war," he said in the 2013 interview. "Paris was different then, still poor. Men couldn't get jobs and, in the male chauvinist Paris of that time, the women couldn't get work at all. It was perfectly respectable for them to go into le milieu."

That digital textbook? Your college has billed you for it

Texto completo: Colleges are increasingly assigning digital books and study tools instead of paper textbooks. But one electronic option in particular has come under criticism from some student advocates.
That model is called inclusive access, in which colleges have contracts with education publishers to provide required digital texts and study tools at a discount.
Then, colleges automatically bill students when they enroll, as part of their tuition. Colleges began adopting these digital programs over the past decade in response to expensive increases in textbook prices.
Now, courses at hundreds of colleges offer inclusive access programs.
The benefit, publishers say, is that all students are able to use required textbooks and tools when they begin taking a class, at a more affordable cost. Research by both student advocates and campus bookstores has shown that students sometimes skip buying required materials - often because of cost, but also because they think they won't actually need the materials.
Federal rules allow colleges to automatically bill students for course materials if the colleges meet certain requirements, like an agreement with a publisher to charge below-market prices or give students the choice to opt out of the purchase.
But skeptical student advocates say the benefits of some programs can be murky.
Discounts can be hard to quantify because the original price of the materials is unclear, according to a report released last week by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, an advocacy group, which examined dozens of contracts between publishers and more than 30 two- and four-year public colleges.
Also, some contracts allow publishers to reduce the discounts if too few students participate. In some cases, quotas to maintain lower pricing are as high as 90% of students taking a course.
"The idea of discounts sounds good on its face, but the contracts aren't living up to the hype," said Kaitlyn Vitez, higher education campaign director for the education fund and the author of the report.
Further, the report found, it's not always obvious how students can opt out of the billing if they want to search elsewhere.
"Students should always have a choice of how to pay," said Nick Sengstaken, a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is a member of the student government and an advocate for textbook affordability.
Pearson, the dominant education publisher in the United States, has inclusive access agreements with about 900 institutions, said Nik Osborne, the company's senior vice president of strategy and business operations.
Not all courses offer the option. Typically, a professor or department elects to participate for a specific class, he said. Students must be allowed to opt out, he said, but relatively few do because the cost is low.
The company recently announced plans to shift away from traditional textbooks toward more affordable digital options. Students can buy an electronic textbook for about $40, and a package that includes extra digital tools for about $60 to $80.
Students in the company's inclusive access program pay less. The cost can be up to 70% cheaper than what a student would pay for a new textbook, Pearson says.
"We believe strongly that digital is a better experience for students," Osborne said, but print options remain available for students who want them. Pearson rents hard-copy textbooks for about $60 apiece.
Osborne and a spokeswoman for two other big education publishers, McGraw-Hill and Cengage, stressed that colleges and universities billed their students for inclusive access programs and that it was up to them to clearly communicate steps for opting out.

'We do all the dirty work for you' Love houseplants but need help? There's now a stylist for that.

Texto completo: Growing up in California, Orion Tait used to watch his father's weekend housekeeping routine.
"Sunday was loud music - Neil Young - and my dad going around watering the plants," Tait recalled. "He had a deck of plants growing everywhere. It was a ritual."
Tait, a creative director and partner at Buck, a production company, tried to carry on that tradition as an adult in his Brooklyn home, complete with the loud rock. But he and his wife, Amy Won, were too busy to care for their houseplants. They never got around to repotting them. Fungus gnats colonized.
"I was, like, this is New York City," Tait said. "There's got to be someone we can hire."
That someone was Lisa Muñoz. For $2,000, Muñoz will come fill your house with plants and make it look beautiful. You can spend more than $2,000, but you cannot spend less; that's the minimum fee charged by her Brooklyn-based firm, Leaf and June.
That covers the design, plants, potting, delivery of plants and a detailed care guide, Muñoz said. "You don't have to call an Uber XL to transport your big tree home," she said. "We do all the dirty work for you."
If Muñoz, 38, sounds practiced at selling her services, it's because her job title - interior plant designer - usually requires explanation. It's an emerging career; she has been doing it for six years.
Nurseries and flower shops have long provided professional plant care for offices and homes. Muñoz offers such maintenance services to her clients too.
But her real role is in performing the job that a fashion stylist or art consultant might - to make aesthetic choices and sound investments on someone's behalf. Just ... about plants.
The fascination with houseplants has begun to spawn all manner of specialists.
After he began posting photos of his Baltimore home to Instagram three years ago, and talking about the 200 plants that fill the lush rooms, Hilton Carter became a bit of a celebrity. He published a book, "Wild at Home: How to Style and Care for Beautiful Plants," and, he says, created a new occupation.
"I'm not going to lie to you - I believe I was the first person to ever say I was a plant stylist," said Carter, 40, who worked at an ad agency before dedicating himself to houseplants. "I just ran with it. That's awesome that it's now a job title."
These days, Carter is too busy with his other plant gigs (he has a new book coming out this spring, "Wild Interiors," with a promotional tour to follow) to do much styling, he said.
Maryah Greene, who runs the one-woman firm Greene Piece, bills herself as New York City's "Plant Doctor & Stylist." She is the fiddle-leaf-fig whisperer for the rest of us: She charges a flat hourly rate of between $125 and $175. Her clients are largely renters who want to introduce a little greenery into their lives but don't know a pothos plant from a bird of paradise, much less how to not kill them.
"A lot of what I do I like to think of as confidence boosting," said Greene, 24, who has plant-styled for more than a year and has met with about 50 clients so far.
The confidence they crave requires counsel: Will a monstera be happy by the radiator? Can sunshine-loving cactuses thrive in a light-starved apartment? What's the best pot to show off the pink and white leaves of hoya carnosa?
More plant money,
more plant problems
One wonders why a plant stylist is needed in the first place. The library is still free.
Yet in the age of the gig economy, where freelancers and consultants exist to fulfill every life need, and hiring out a task can be preferable to learning how to do it yourself, houseplant decisions are just another thing to outsource.
The plant stylists say most people's ability to properly choose and care for houseplants is woeful, even as the reported desire to live among them is high.
"One of the biggest questions I get from clients is, 'What plant can I get that would be good with no light?' " Muñoz said. "No light? That's actually not possible."
John Fraser, a chef, hired Muñoz to rescue his neglected houseplants, which "were on death's door," and to create a potted greenscape on the balcony of his apartment. "I wanted someone who could give me the answers that you probably learn over time," he said. "Because of travel and restaurant stuff, I'm not the best caretaker."
Meeting with a plant stylist is "a really intimate service," Greene said, and thus caters to the still would-be plant parent. "I can't provide you with the right plants unless I know who you are, what your work schedule is like, your history with plants."
No doctorate required
A four-year degree in horticulture or botany isn't necessary to style plants. Greene was earning her master's in education and literacy and hanging around plant shops when she realized she could make money from her hobby.
In 2013, Muñoz earned her certificate in horticulture from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and began working part time at plant shops to further educate herself. Her business was born in 2014.
Muñoz recently installed 115 potted plants in Buck's large, light-filled offices overlooking the Brooklyn waterfront, at the behest of Tait and his partners. Soon after, she said, the company asked for a proposal to add more plants.
"I think people are really just wanting things that make them happy. And things that are alive ... ," Muñoz said, trailing off.
She considered her curious role. "I mean, have you ever heard of plants making people mad?"

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is planning to attend a global health conference in Orlando on Monday - if the event isn't canceled due to coronavirus fears.
Trump, who was already scheduled to be in Central Florida that night for a fundraiser, will attend the HIMSS20 Global Health Conference & Exhibition at the Orange County Convention Center, a conference spokeswoman said. The visit was first reported by Bloomberg News.
The conference, its website states, will bring together 45,000 health-information technology professionals and others from 90 countries, and calls itself "the can't-miss health information and technology event of the year, where professionals throughout the global health ecosystem connect for the education, innovation and collaboration they need to reimagine health and wellness for everyone, everywhere."
The five-day conference was still scheduled as of Monday to go on as scheduled, HIMSS spokeswoman Karen Groppe said, despite some exhibitors pulling out due to corporate travel policies amid the coronavirus outbreak.
"We all work in health care, we know what we're facing," Groppe said. "But we really do want to come to Orlando. And Orlando wants us to come to Orlando."
So far in Orlando, a Workday event at an unspecified location originally scheduled for this week was the only major conference to have been canceled.
The planned visit comes as the Trump administration is dealing with outbreaks of coronavirus in states ranging from Washington to Rhode Island, and a day after Florida announced its first two confirmed cases of coronavirus.
Trump, who called the outbreak a "hoax" at a rally in South Carolina last week, just before the first person in the U.S. died of the virus in Washington state, named Vice President Pence as the point person for coronavirus in his administration.
Trump also has a $100,000-per-couple fundraiser scheduled for March 9 in the Orlando area. The campaign event is listed as being hosted by Diane and Bob Dello Russo of Longwood, along with Lee Chira, Mary Demetree, Bill Heavener, Allan Keene, Mark Modarres and Lori Sommers.
The Dello Russos were listed as hosts for a July 2018 Ron DeSantis campaign fundraiser at the Alaqua Country Club in Longwood headlined by Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. That event also listed indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas as a host. DeSantis later turned over Parnas' and Igor Fruman's $50,000 contribution to the federal government.
Bob Dello Russo is the founder of Del-Air Heating & Air Conditioning & Refrigeration, Chira is the owner of LCA Development, Demetree is the owner of Demetree Real Estate Services, Heavener is co-chairman and CEO of Full Sail University, Keene is the owner of the Keewin Real Property Company, and Modarres is CEO of MMM Capital.
A $100,000 donation gets couples access to a roundtable, photo and reception with the president. Raising or donating $35,000 gets a photo and access to the reception and $11,200 for the reception alone.

What could Ohio Dems learn about presidential field?

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – For Democrats in 2020, the goal has never been more clear: Find a candidate who can defeat President Donald Trump in November.
But who will help them reach that goal? That's much murkier.
After a February mired by Iowa's caucus debacle and division among moderates, the Democratic candidates scramble toward the meat of the presidential primary – Super Tuesday – in desperate need of some clarity.
On Tuesday, 14 states and one U.S. territory will vote, awarding 1,357 delegates. More delegates will be doled out on Super Tuesday than on any other date of the Democratic race. Candidates will have a chance to separate themselves from the still-crowded pack.
To win the nomination on the first ballot at the party's convention, a Democrat must win a majority of the pledged delegates – at least 1,991 of the 3,979.
Super Tuesday results should give Ohio Democrats a better picture of their presidential race, which has been muddied despite 10 debates, millions spent in advertisements and 20 candidates dropping out.
That's important because Ohio's Election Day is two weeks later: March 17. On that day, 577 delegates will be up for grabs in Ohio (136 delegates), Arizona (67), Florida (219) and Illinois (155) – a kind of Super Tuesday 2.0.
It has been difficult to pin down what Ohio Democrats want in a nominee so far. Delegate selection was well-attended by supporters of several candidates. Polls have been few and far between. Endorsements have been scattered.
What could March 3 tell Ohio voters about the state of the race?
Super Tuesday voters could feel the Bern Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is leading the delegate pack – so far.
With 58 delegates and two first-place victories in February, Sanders has benefited from moderates' indecision. His farther-left lane is occupied by only Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is trailing him in both delegates and polls.
But can Sanders win Midwestern states like Ohio?
Sanders lost the 2016 Democratic primary in Ohio to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 56.1% to 43.1%. But he won states such as Michigan and Wisconsin that could be big prizes in 2020.
Super Tuesday won't tell Ohio voters much about candidates' electability in the Midwest. The only state up for grabs is Minnesota, which candidate Amy Klobuchar represents as a U.S. senator. Michigan votes on March 10.
Sanders' early victories have surprised, and in some cases, shaken the Democratic Party. Some Democrats have even reached out to Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown as an alternative to a brokered convention, the New York Times reported.
Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley, who endorsed former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, told The Enquirer that he's "very concerned" that a Sanders bid would be too polarizing.
"They're in disbelief. They can't believe he's winning," said Brian Garry, a Sanders delegate and advocate for the homeless, who lives in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Clifton. Garry offered some advice to fellow Democrats: "Wake up and smell the coffee, because Bernie Sanders does unite people."
Sanders' focus on healthcare access, climate change, a higher minimum wage and college affordability have forced fellow Democratic candidates to grapple with the issues as well, Garry said. "Bernie has pretty much single-handedly transformed the Democratic platform."
Republicans say Sanders has transformed the party's platform into something that's too far left for the average Ohioan.
"Primary voters are feeling the Bern, but it's down-ticket Democrats who are starting to feel burned," the Republican State Leadership Committee, which is focused on electing Republicans to state legislatures, said after Sanders won New Hampshire and Nevada. Ohio Republicans are hoping to hold onto supermajorities in the state House and Senate.
And don't expect Warren to cede the progressive lane either. She said during a CNN Town Hall event that he would take her fight all the way to the convention floor.
"She's a tough, smart fighter, which resonates with Democrats eager to beat Trump, especially in Ohio where his trail of empty promises is so evident," said Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld, a Warren delegate.
Squeezed in the middle Former Vice President Joe Biden separated himself from the pack Saturday with a decisive victory in South Carolina. Biden won 48.4% of the votes while second-place finisher Sander trailed at 19.9%.
After the February races, Biden has 54 delegates. Of the remaining candidates, Warren has won eight and Klobuchar has won seven.
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who skipped the February elections, is starting his campaign in earnest now. Super Tuesday will be a key test of whether his more than $450 million-plus investment in advertising has paid off.
Each of these candidates is vying to be the alternative to Sanders' democratic socialist approach. Recent history supports these moderates' pitch: former Democratic presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were more centrist candidates.
"I don't think Bernie Sanders means we can't win Ohio," said Brian Hester, Butler County Democratic Party chairman and a Biden delegate. "The path for Joe Biden is a lot stronger."
Biden backers, including Rep. Jessica Miranda, D-Forest Park, point to the former vice president's work on the Violence Against Women Act and Affordable Healthcare Act as evidence of Biden's record working for Ohioans.
"Joe Biden is ready to be the champion Ohio needs in the White House," said Miranda, who is facing a tough re-election bid in a suburban Hamilton County district. "Not only that, but he's also our best option to defeat Donald Trump and support down-ballot Democrats in the fall."
Winnowing the field The moderate lane is too crowded for everyone to succeed. Super Tuesday could be a wake-up call to those without the money or support to continue. Buttigieg and former hedge-fund executive Tom Steyer dropped out of the race over the weekend after finishing fourth and third, respectively, in South Carolina.
Whoever remains after Super Tuesday will have a tight turnaround between Super Tuesday and Super Tuesday 2.0. Campaigns will have to decide how to divide staff, resources and candidates' time between Ohio and other key states like Arizona and Florida.
Some candidates already have field offices of staff and volunteers in Ohio, such as Warren and Bloomberg. Biden's campaign used Ohio surrogates to campaign over the weekend. Sanders can rely on some volunteer infrastructure from 2016.
Early voting is already underway in Ohio, but it appears many Democrats are waiting to see how the race shakes out. In the first five days of voting, 8,741 Democrats and 8,418 Republicans cast ballots in person or through the mail, according to the Ohio Secretary of State's Office.
Don't be surprised if Trump shows up in Ohio before March 17 as well. No Republican is challenging him on the Ohio ballot, but the president has made it clear that the state is key to his re-election bid.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – For Democrats in 2020, the goal has never been more clear: Find a candidate who can defeat President Donald Trump in November.
But who will help them reach that goal? That's much murkier.
After a February mired by Iowa's caucus debacle and division among moderates, the Democratic candidates scramble toward the meat of the presidential primary – Super Tuesday – in desperate need of some clarity.
On Tuesday, 14 states and one U.S. territory will vote, awarding 1,357 delegates. More delegates will be doled out on Super Tuesday than on any other date of the Democratic race. Candidates will have a chance to separate themselves from the still-crowded pack.
To win the nomination on the first ballot at the party's convention, a Democrat must win a majority of the pledged delegates – at least 1,991 of the 3,979.
Super Tuesday results should give Ohio Democrats a better picture of their presidential race, which has been muddied despite 10 debates, millions spent in advertisements and 20 candidates dropping out.
That's important because Ohio's Election Day is two weeks later: March 17. On that day, 577 delegates will be up for grabs in Ohio (136 delegates), Arizona (67), Florida (219) and Illinois (155) – a kind of Super Tuesday 2.0.
It has been difficult to pin down what Ohio Democrats want in a nominee so far. Delegate selection was well-attended by supporters of several candidates. Polls have been few and far between. Endorsements have been scattered.
What could March 3 tell Ohio voters about the state of the race?
Super Tuesday voters could feel the Bern Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is leading the delegate pack – so far.
With 58 delegates and two first-place victories in February, Sanders has benefited from moderates' indecision. His farther-left lane is occupied by only Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is trailing him in both delegates and polls.
But can Sanders win Midwestern states like Ohio?
Sanders lost the 2016 Democratic primary in Ohio to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 56.1% to 43.1%. But he won states such as Michigan and Wisconsin that could be big prizes in 2020.
Super Tuesday won't tell Ohio voters much about candidates' electability in the Midwest. The only state up for grabs is Minnesota, which candidate Amy Klobuchar represents as a U.S. senator. Michigan votes on March 10.

Texto completo: now using tobacco
I know I speak for many grandparents like me across Maine when I say I’m deeply concerned about our youth becoming addicted to tobacco products.
Big Tobacco has targeted kids with aggressive marketing and flavored products — and it has worked. In 2019, more than 6 million kids reported currently using a tobacco product and more than 1 in 4 high school students reported currently using e-cigarettes. Just last week, the New York Times reported that the tobacco industry is being sued for placing ads on kid-friendly websites and TV channels in order to entice them into trying their products.
This disgusting behavior is nothing new for the tobacco industry, which has a decades long history of doing everything it can to bring in new customers. A critical piece of Big Tobacco’s strategy is pushing flavored products; menthol flavoring in cigarettes masks the harshness of smoke, and flavors in e-cigarettes and other tobacco products attract kids while addicting them to nicotine.
That’s why I’m joining with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and calling on Congressman Jared Golden, D-2nd District, to support the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act to stop Big Tobacco from addicting a new generation of customers to their products. This bill would prohibit all flavored tobacco products and save kids from a lifetime of nicotine addiction.
Let’s act now to protect our kids’ futures.

Texto completo: BRADENTON, Fla. - At least for now, it will be business as usual for the Pirates for spring training.
The team said in a statement Monday that there are no plans to alter operations despite two people in Florida testing positive for COVID-19, the new coronavirus, as announced by Gov. Ron DeSantis Sunday. One of the patients lives in Manatee County, where the Pirates make their spring home.
"The safety of our fans, players, and staff is paramount," the statement said. "We continue to monitor the situation very closely and are working with our expert partners at AHN and Highmark, as well as with MLB, to ensure we are up to date on any developments and are actively considering the appropriate precautions.
"It is too early in the fact-finding process regarding the reported case in Manatee County to comment on any potential impacts on our operations. We encourage everyone to listen to and rely upon the advice and guidance of the public health experts."
There have been 88 cases of coronavirus that have been identified in the U.S., according to the New York Times. Minor cases of the virus, also known as COVID-19, can cause flu-like symptoms. Over 3,000 people globally have died from severe cases.
The Pirates played Toronto Monday in Dunedin and are off Tuesday.
They'll return to action Wednesday for split-squad games with half the team staying in Bradenton for a game against the Atlanta Braves. The other half is going to Clearwater, Fla., for a game against the Philadelphia Phillies.

FROM THE RIGHT: Russians are coming (again) as Dems resurface tired ploy

Texto completo: The Russians are like the devil. Each gets blamed (or credited) with more than they are responsible for.
Intelligence officials recently went to Capitol Hill where, according to The Hill, "they briefed the House Intelligence Committee about Russia interfering in the presidential race in an effort to get Trump re-elected." The initial presumption was that Russian President Vladimir Putin favors Trump's re-election. Why would he when he has someone more closely associated with his ideology than Trump? That would be the self-described Democratic Socialist, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
But wait. Following closely on this unspecific leak to (where else?) The New York Times, we now hear that Russia wants Sanders as the next president. Perhaps it's out of gratitude because he and his wife honeymooned in the Soviet Union. Ah, nostalgia.
The intelligence briefing was classified, but as with charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, no details have emerged that prove the Russian "collusion" narrative. Other than disinformation campaigns on social media (and plenty of disinformation has and will continue to be generated here at home through mainstream media) we have still not heard any specifics on how Russia managed to change a single vote in 2016, or how they supposedly intend to do so this time around. Upon hearing of the intelligence briefing, Putin's press secretary told Russian state-run media, "This is another in a series of paranoid reports, and we regret to say that their number will grow as the election approaches. They certainly have nothing to do with the truth."
The reason Democrats are again raising the prospect of Russian interference is to undermine the credibility of this year's election should Trump win again, as seems increasingly likely. Democrats have been unable to stomach, not only his 2016 election, but also his economic successes. They fear their party will lose what remaining but dwindling appeal it might still enjoy. That's why in the debates among Democratic presidential candidates one hears of an America that isn't recognizable to most citizens. For them, America is a bad country, a place of racism, sexism, inequality and misery only they can fix, though previous Democratic presidents who have made similar diagnoses of America's "faults" have done nothing to repair the damage to which they have arguably contributed. Trump appears to have stolen their issues and they have no fallback position.
As for the credibility of American intelligence, consider their record during George W. Bush's administration, beginning with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which were never found, resulting in the unnecessary war that followed.
This Russian interference claim seems like an invitation for the House to conduct even more investigations and possibly new articles of impeachment after the election, assuming Democrats maintain their House majority. A recent Gallup poll shows record high approval (49 percent) of the president's policies.
Democrats have always needed a boogeyman to run against. Recall "The Gingrich who stole Christmas" line disparaging then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich on a Time magazine cover in the 1990s.
Russia has become the default boogeyman of the left. That is what makes Bernie Sanders the ideal candidate for Russia and the other socialist-communist states he has praised, because in his heart he is at one with them.

Texto completo: The photographer Kiana Hayeri documented mothers inside an Afghan prison. Here's what it was like.
"I accept this imprisonment. I was not able to live another day with him, so this is what happened to me."
-- Parisa, an inmate at Herat Women's Prison
[In Her Words is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox .]
The Iranian-Canadian photographer Kiana Hayeri spent close to two weeks getting to know some of the 119 inmates at Herat Women's Prison in Afghanistan. She photographed them for The New York Times Magazine, along with their children, some of whom had never seen life beyond the prison's 15-foot walls.
There was no interpreter. (Hayeri speaks Dari, a dialect of Farsi, which is her first language. Dari is one of the two main languages spoken in Afghanistan.) And even the guards after a day or two left the photographer to her own devices.
What we see in Hayeri's photo essay is quite simple: women going about their daily lives. Here is a woman bathing her young daughter in a plastic tub. Here is a woman suited up to play volleyball. And here, a woman blows bubbles for a gaggle of children. It looks almost homey.
But it's dark, too.
The subjects of Hayeri's story are inmates who've murdered their husbands. For them it was the only way out of an abusive marriage in a country where domestic abuse is so commonplace nearly 90 percent of women experience it in some form in their lifetime, according to a 2008 study from the United States Institute of Peace.
Their stories are harrowing. Yet the photos are beautiful. And the juxtaposition of the two ... well, it bore some investigation.
I asked Hayeri to share insights from her experiences getting to know the women and shooting the piece. The project certainly wasn't what she expected.
You chanced upon the Herat Women's Prison while you were doing a separate piece for Harper's on single mothers in Afghanistan. Tell me how that happened.
While reporting the story on single mothers (a concept that exists and yet has no word to describe it, neither in Dari nor Pashto), I learned of children living with their mothers inside prisons because they didn't have anyone outside to take care of them.
I was very keen to see it for myself. The day I visited the prison, I was sent in with a male escort, which made it difficult to work. But as I was leaving, the prison manager whispered in my ear to come back alone after lunch so that I could work without the male escort.
When I went back, after half an hour, she left me as well and I was able to wander around on my own. I was fascinated by the structure of the prison, the decoration, the lives of the inmates and the extent of the access I was given.
Once I was on my own, women came forward to speak, sharing their stories and making radical and, at times, dirty jokes. It was there that I met a woman who had murdered her husband. This woman who had an aggressive tone, said, "I've lost my children, I've lost my dignity, and I've murdered my husband, do you think I have anything else to lose?"
That really struck me and stayed with me.
The photos of the prison reveal a place that's surprisingly ... normal. Mothers watch their children at play, they chat, they share meals. Was this what you were expecting?
Not at all. I had only scratched the surface when I first visited the prison in 2016, so I knew how things looked, but when I went back for this story and got a chance to spend time and embed myself with the women, that was a very different experience. Life was so normal. I struggled at times to see the place as a prison, and not a dormitory.
Tell me something about prison life that isn't captured in your photos.
The smell is not something I want to remember. The smell of each room was different, depending on the level of hygiene, but it was always heavy, damp and unpleasant.
Also, the fights that occasionally broke out between inmates. I knew they were happening, I could see signs of them every time I returned: the wounds, scratches, a wrapped-up wrist, inmates who'd been moved from one wing to another. But it never happened in front of me or my camera.
Let's talk about your process. To what extent did the prison let you participate in daily life? Were you able to spend some time there?
Like any story, time buys you trust, and trust buys you intimacy and access. My first days were shorter and more limited. I took fewer photos and just participated in the activities, mostly chit-chatting about random things with my camera on my lap, or watching TV. One time, I played volleyball with them as well. I had a female guard following me for the first two days, which I was told was for my own safety.
But with time, I made friends with the inmates and guards, gained their trust, and I was able to move around freely.
Eventually some of the inmates, not even my direct subjects, started watching after me and my gear, which was very sweet. They also made sure I was fed, and offered me tea or water. It was a luxury to have as much time as I wanted for this story. In total, I spent about two weeks inside the prison -- although I was never permitted to stay overnight -- over three separate trips to Herat.
Of course, Herat Women's Prison is just one of many women's prisons in Afghanistan. How does it stack up against others that you know of?
Herat Women's Prison is a very well-kept one, relatively speaking. It's organized, clean, not too corrupt, and the feel of it is more like a community. This is not the case with most other prisons across Afghanistan.
As you were documenting life in the prison, what moments of hope did you witness? And what of despair?
Every time Foroozan [one of the subjects] talked about her children and how successful they have become, her face glowed in a way that no photo can illustrate. It gave her 16-year sentence a meaning. Her son made it to Germany on-foot after he was released from a juvenile corrections center (he was incarcerated from 12 to 14 years of age, after he told the police he helped his mother to beat his father to death), and he is doing well in boarding school. Her two daughters are also doing well in school while living in an orphanage; the youngest has even received a scholarship.
On my last day, actually in my final hour in the prison, one of the young inmates, barely 20, learned that her father had died and she couldn't go to his burial. The girl dropped on her knees and collapsed in Foroozan's arms. I still hear her shriek and weep every time I look at my photos from that moment. It was heartbreaking.
What else is happening

Texto completo: Why were they dying after "successful" operations? He discovered the cause and came up with a remedy: intravenous nutrition -- a technique that has saved millions of lives.
As a 7-year-old, Stanley J. Dudrick was so impressed with the compassionate care that his mother received when she had a life-threatening fever that he decided right then and there to become a doctor.
But as a young resident in the early 1960s, he began to have misgivings about becoming a surgeon when three patients who had undergone operations that were technically successful nonetheless died in the hospital.
Rather than change specialties or even abandon his chosen career, however, Dr. Dudrick decided to devote himself to discovering what caused their deaths.
He eventually did, finding the answer to be deceptively simple. But more than that, he perfected a treatment -- one that has been credited with saving the lives of millions of premature infants as well as those of adults with a wide range of ailments, including cancer; severe bowel, kidney and liver diseases; and burns.
The cause of the three deaths that had so motivated him, he concluded, was severe malnutrition. The patients had been unable to eat or to absorb enough nutrients to sustain life.
Malnutrition had often gone unrecognized as a direct or contributing cause of death because death certificates typically cited an underlying disease, like cancer or liver failure.
By the late 1960s, experimenting first on beagle puppies, Dr. Dudrick developed a treatment called total parenteral nutrition, or TPN, which bypasses the intestinal tract when a patient cannot receive food or fluids by mouth and instead injects nutrients -- liquid carbohydrates, electrolytes, fats, minerals, proteins and vitamins -- directly into the circulatory system through a vein.
Dr. Dudrick, who never patented any of his techniques, wishing them to be universally available, died on Jan. 18 at his home in Eaton, N.H. He was 84. The cause was complications of a number of medical conditions, including kidney failure, his sister, Irene Brown, said.
"He was the developer, largely single-handedly, of total parenteral nutrition, a technique now taken for granted but a long-awaited pipe dream" when Dr. Dudrick began his research in the 1960s, said Dr. Steven J. Scheinman, president and dean of the Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine in Scranton, Pa. That intravenous technique, he said, "has saved the lives of tens of millions of people across the world."
Dr. Scheinman ranked Dr. Dudrick with Joseph Lister and Ignaz Semmelweis, who pioneered antiseptic medical procedures; William T.G. Morton, who popularized anesthesia during surgery; and Alexander Fleming, who is credited with the discovery of penicillin.
Dr. Dudrick went on to hold senior administrative posts at Geisinger, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Texas at Houston and Yale.
He was in his 20s, working as a surgical resident, when he encountered the unexplained deaths at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. Consulting with his mentor, Dr. Jonathan Rhoads, Dr. Dudrick often conducted research after midnight, when his shift was over, as he searched for a deterrent.
He initially used the TPN technique to keep the puppies alive from six weeks old until adulthood. Then he successfully treated six adults.
In 1967, he used the intravenous method on a three-and-a-half-pound newborn girl with a small bowel that was almost completely blocked. By feeding nutrients through a vein, his medical team increased the child's weight to six and a half pounds over six weeks, and she developed for a year as if her gastrointestinal system was functioning normally.
Dr. Dudrick said his first adult emergency case was a 52-year-old woman who, at 5-foot-2, had dropped to 49 pounds after stomach surgery. She was fed intravenously, starting at 500 calories a day, gradually reaching 3,000.
"In two months, she was up to 79 pounds, and a month later she was sent home eating normally and weighing 100 pounds," Dr. Dudrick recalled in an interview with The New York Times in 1977. "She's been between 104 and 110 ever since. A true nutritional save. And nutrition was all the treatment she got -- no medicine and no fancy operation."
The intravenous delivery of concentrated nutrients proved successful over time in stimulating and restoring normal bodily functions, including the immune systems of patients with malignant growths.
The technique has not only increased the chances of survival after operations; it has also spared many patients surgery -- often because a diagnosis of malnutrition had not been contemplated and nutrition was not considered a remedy.
"It's senseless to pay $ 200 to $ 300 a day for intensive care and then not pay the extra $ 50 to $ 100 for nutrition," Dr. Dudrick told The Times. "It's like buying a Mercedes without any wheels on it."
Stanley John Dudrick was born on April 9, 1935, in Nanticoke, Pa., a grandson of Polish immigrants. His father, also named Stanley, was a coal miner. His mother, Stephanie (Jachimczak) Dudrick, worked in silk and cigar factories.
He earned a bachelor of science degree in biology in 1957 from Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., and his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (now the Perelman School of Medicine).
In 1972, he became the founding chairman of the department of surgery at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. He joined the Yale School of Medicine faculty as a surgery professor in 1994 and was named a professor of surgery at Geisinger in 2012.
Dr. Dudrick was the first president and founder of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, and was instrumental in the founding of the Oley Foundation, a support group for TPN patients.
In addition to his sister, Ms. Brown, he is survived by his wife, Theresa (Keen) Dudrick; their daughters, Susan Burkholder, Carolyn Henry, Holly Dudrick and Anne Dudrick; their sons, Paul, a surgeon, and Stanley; 16 grandchildren; five great-grandchildren; and a brother, Daniel.

Texto completo: Chris Matthews, the longtime host of MSNBC's political show "Hardball," announced he is retiring from the broadcast after coming under fire over controversial remarks he made to a guest.
Matthews told viewers of his resignation at the top of his broadcast, saying it was time for a new generation to take over. He also apologized for inappropriate comments he made to women that clearly factored in the decision to have him leave the program he has anchored since 1997.
His abrupt exit, effective Monday, was a blow to NBC News, which already had taken heavy criticism over its handling of sexual harassment issues involving other prominent media figures.

"I decided tonight will be my last 'Hardball,' so let me tell you why," Matthews said on the air. "The younger generations out there are ready to take the reins. We see them in politics and the media and fighting for their causes. They are improving the workplace. We're talking here about better standards than we grew up with, fair standards. A lot of it has to do with how we talk to each other, compliments on a woman's appearance that some men, including me, might have once incorrectly thought were OK -- were never OK. Not then and certainly not today, and for making such comments in the past, I'm sorry."
After he read the statement, the program went to commercial break and Matthews was gone. Visibly stunned MSNBC political analyst Steve Kornacki took over the broadcast.
Matthews, 74, was recently cited in a GQ.com story in which the author, Laura Bassett, said the anchor made inappropriate flirtatious remarks to her before she went on the air. Bassett first wrote about the incident that allegedly occurred in 2016, but did not mention Matthews by name.
Bassett revisited the matter after Matthews' aggressive questioning of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts following NBC's primary debate on Feb. 19.
NBC News has acknowledged that there has been one financial settlement paid to a former female employee who complained about Matthews' behavior. Matthews received a stern reprimand over the matter, which involved inappropriate comments he made to the woman in 1999.
Matthews had been in discussions with NBC News executives about retirement perhaps at the end of the current presidential campaign. But the recent controversies expedited those plans and he agreed his appearance at the start of Monday's "Hardball" would be his last.
The veteran broadcaster has been under fire in recent weeks because of the Bassett story and comments he has made on the air during MSNBC's political coverage. He also recently had to apologize on the air to Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont after comparing his victory in the Nevada caucuses to France falling to the Nazis in 1940.
Matthews is well liked within NBC News. But according to people familiar with the discussions about his departure who were not authorized to comment, there were growing concerns over his on-air comments, which have tended to fall out of sync with current cultural norms. While he could get away with such gaffes in a previous era, social media has been unforgiving.
Many women who were offended by his remarks about female politicians -- especially 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton -- have called for his firing. Bassett said after her first piece ran about offensive remarks Matthews made to her, many "Hardball" guests and NBC News employees recounted having similar experiences with him.
The network's handling of sexual harassment issues has come under scrutiny. Former "Today" co-host Matt Lauer was fired in November 2017 for inappropriate sexual behavior with a co-worker who later accused him of rape. Ronan Farrow's book "Catch and Kill" alleged NBC News executives were long aware of Lauer's actions but ignored them because he worked on the company's morning show cash cow. (The network denied Farrow's accusations.)
NBC News President Noah Oppenheim has also received heat over his handling of Farrow's reporting on the sexual assault and harassment claims made against film mogul Harvey Weinstein. Oppenheim allowed Farrow to take his reporting to the New Yorker after he was unable to get any accusers to speak on the record. Farrow won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, shared with New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey.
Weinstein was convicted last week of a criminal sex act in the first degree and rape in the third degree.
A former White House staffer during the Carter administration, Matthews brought a political insider's knowledge to his program, with historically well-informed, if sometimes blustery, questions of his guests.

Re "Sick workers, sick system," column, Feb. 29
Michael Hiltzik is exactly correct: We have a sick system of healthcare in the United States, and not mandating employee sick days makes the problem worse with the coronavirus outbreak. Insurance companies make our decisions for us, deciding which procedures are covered and which are not, and on the necessity of a diagnostic procedure to possibly prevent further complications and advanced disease.

And they charge extravagant prices for this "luxury."
Healthcare needs to be in the hands of a neutral third party that does not have a profit motive. And the system needs to be simplified. Worst of all, millions of people in the United States cannot afford healthcare -- now that is the crying, stinking shame of this country.
Chet Chebegia

::
Hiltzik writes: "About a third of all American workers have no right to sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In service industries -- where employees must report to workplaces to get paid and are most likely to come in contact with the public -- more than half have no sick leave."
It's colossal stupidity, having a service-based economy and not ensuring healthcare, paid time off, job security and a guaranteed minimum wage for those service workers.
That's why my husband and I, former longtime financial service and technology sector workers, are voting for Sen. Bernie Sanders.
If you do not ask for something, you do not get it. It's long past time that our representatives in government demanded workplace conditions conducive to the well-being of all.

Marketing whiz pre-Trader Joe's
Re "Founded Trader Joe's chain," obituary, March 2
In 1966, I was 18 years old and working as a cashier at a tiny store called Pronto Market in Pacific Palisades. The few wines we carried mostly collected dust.
One day the boss handed out packages containing a "Wine Appreciation Correspondence Course" to each of the three employees. "You have three weeks to read it, take the test and get your certificate," he said. "Your goal is to demystify wine purchasing decisions for our customers and to sell them a lot of wine."
Adjacent to the single cash register, we cleared away some shelf space for a stock of modestly priced wines. The eclectic and varied collection was a true test for our newly acquired knowledge -- and knowledge is all we had, because at 18 years old, we were legally able to sell wine but not drink it.
With enthusiasm, familiarity with our regular clientele and brazen salesmanship, we would study each customer's groceries as they were rung up and then confidently suggest a wine pairing. Our sales were astonishing.
Within a year, the boss opened a new store devoted exclusively to wine and affordable gourmet food items. The boss was Joe Coulombe, and he called the new store Trader Joe's.
College taught me engineering, and Joe taught me salesmanship. Thank you, Joe.
Don Ciaffardini
Long Beach
::
Coulombe's vision of marketing to a "person who got a Fulbright scholarship, went to Europe for a couple of years and developed a taste for something other than Velveeta by way of cheese, something more than ordinary beer by way of alcoholic beverages and something other than Folgers by way of coffee," may have been more successful than he realized.
When I was on a Fulbright in Wales in 1990-91, my roommates and I often found ourselves sitting around the kitchen bemoaning the lack of a Trader Joe's in Aberystwyth.
And yes, I still shop at Trader Joe's, and I'm still overeducated and underpaid.
Leslie Jones
Los Angeles
::
Your obituary deserves praise for describing Coulombe's inspiring story, especially about his keen sense of customer base and penchant for promoting employees within the ranks and paying them well.
What is not mentioned is that most of the employees are less well-paid, part-time workers who go on to those good full-time positions only after they demonstrate their value and loyalty to the company.
This weeding process better explains why the company never has to hire outside managers de novo.

Who's teaching the PE class?
Re "Fixing the physical fitness test," editorial, Feb. 27
The L.A. Times editorial board is right to point out that state Department of Education should look beyond the tests and look at the physical fitness programs for public school students.
Right now, elementary students in the Los Angeles Unified School District (and I assume others) are not required to have their physical fitness lessons taught by a certified physical education teacher. Instead the schools rely on elementary school teachers, with no training in PE, to teach children how to pitch a baseball or dribble a basketball.
For children with parents who are skilled in physical fitness, developing certain abilities may not be an issue. But if children are not gaining these experiences at home, it's no wonder that by the time they get to middle school, they have decided that these activities are not valuable to them.
By all means, we should incorporate more noncompetitive activities into PE, but these activities should start when children are young and still developing their interests and skills -- and they should be taught by qualified PE teachers.
Beth Holloway
Woodland Hills
::
I agree the Department of Education should be taking a "much deeper look at physical fitness programs and not just focusing on the tests." I administered these tests to thousands of students during my 30-plus years as a middle school PE teacher.
It is my hope that the Department of Education, school boards and local district administrators can learn something from Kobe Bryant -- that the journey is more important than the destination.
Being active every day, encouraging physical activity in all parts of the school curriculum and striving to be the best you can be are just as important as the results of your work.

Free WikiLeaks' Julian Assange
Re "Judge rejects request from Assange to sit near lawyers," Feb. 28
It is bad enough that the Trump administration is seeking to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from Britain to face up to 175 years in prison for allegedly violating the infamous Espionage Act of 1917 for publishing information that exposed U.S. violations of international law in Iraq and elsewhere, just like the New York Times and Washington Post published the Pentagon Papers.
But now the extradition judge in London has refused to allow Assange to sit with his lawyers at counsel table to assist in his own defense. Instead, he remains in the dock in the rear of the courtroom behind thick glass with poor acoustics, under medication to deal with the consequences of prolonged confinement, visibly struggling to understand what is going on.
This heaps serious due process and human rights violations on top of the dangerous threat to freedom of the press posed by the entire unwarranted prosecution.
U.S. and British authorities should be ashamed of themselves. Assange should be released immediately.

Grow up, geezers
Re " 'Geezers'? Really?" Mailbag, Feb. 29
First, Virginia Heffernan is quite simply an outstanding op-ed columnist. Second, political correctness has run amok. There are bigger things to worry about.
Besides, she has a point. Three of the Democratic candidates are geezers, meaning old -- too old, if you ask me. Of course many old people are smarter than they were when they were 40, 50, even 60, but they are almost never as quick or flexible or have the necessary stamina for what is arguably the hardest job in the world.
We need an upper age limit for the presidency.

Re "Gator Tales in the City: Are They Fact or Fiction?" (news article, Feb. 26):
Kudos for your bright compendium on the gators of New York. I submit an addition.
As an official in 2003 with the New York City Police Department, I witnessed N.Y.P.D. emergency service officers first sedate and then extract a fully grown Bengal tiger from a Harlem apartment.
The tiger, Ming, received all the attention. Al, a 5-foot-4 alligator, was carried, jaws taped, soon thereafter from the same apartment, to little acclaim.

Texto completo: The investment firm Sherborne Investors said James E. Staley's previous relationship with the financier disqualified him as a director of the British bank.
An activist hedge fund that has repeatedly criticized Barclays called on the British bank's board on Monday to withdraw its support for its chief executive, James E. Staley, over his ties to the financier Jeffrey Epstein.
In a public letter, the investment firm, Sherborne Investors -- which says it is now the biggest single shareholder in Barclays -- said renominating Mr. Staley as a director was "extremely ill advised."
The call by Sherborne is the latest point of pressure on Mr. Staley for his yearslong relationship with Mr. Epstein, who killed himself in August after facing new allegations of sex trafficking of underage girls.
Last month, Barclays disclosed that British banking regulators had been examining how Mr. Staley described his business ties to Mr. Epstein, which dated back to Mr. Staley's role as the head of JPMorgan's private banking business.
Sherborne argued that articles by The New York Times and other publications detailing the business relationship between the two men should disqualify Mr. Staley from Barclays' board.
"A board that tolerates such conduct, whether occurring in the present or in the past, is also an enabler of that act," Sherborne wrote in the letter. "Any shareholder that votes for a director in these circumstances would also be an enabler."
Mr. Staley has said he had no contact with Mr. Epstein after becoming the chief executive of Barclays in 2015. Barclays said in a statement last month that it believed Mr. Staley had been "sufficiently transparent with the company" about his ties to the financier, and that its board retained full confidence in him.
Sherborne has agitated for change at Barclays in recent years, arguing that Mr. Staley's strategy for the bank is flawed, and last year unsuccessfully campaigned for a seat on the bank's board.

Ulay, 76, a Boundary-Pushing Performance Artist

Texto completo: He made his name during a 12-year creative and romantic partnership with Marina Abramovic.
Ulay, the performance artist whose provocative collaborations with Marina Abramovic often led them to push each other to extremes, died on Monday at his home in Ljubljana, Slovenia. He was 76.
The cause was unknown, a spokeswoman for the Richard Saltoun Gallery, which represented him, said. Ulay had long suffered from cancer of the lymphatic system, she added.
Ulay, whose real name was Frank Uwe Laysiepen, and Ms. Abramovic were also romantic partners, from 1976 to 1988.
The pair's work, while often dangerous, was designed at times to show audiences the intensity of their bond. In "Rest Energy," from 1980, they faced each other, a bow and arrow between them. Ms. Abramovic held the bow while Ulay leaned back, pulling the arrow taut and aiming it at her chest. One slip could have caused Ulay to fire the arrow straight into her.
In "Light/Dark," they slapped each other repeatedly, and in "Breathing In/Breathing Out," they blocked their nostrils with cigarette filters, then locked mouths, sharing each other's breath until they passed out.
In "Nightsea Crossing," the couple sat at a table for seven hours at a stretch, not moving and barely blinking. That work had come about after the couple had spent a year living together in the Australian Outback, Ms. Abramovic told The New York Times in 1986. It was an attempt to bring the spiritual contemplation possible in the desert into a city, she said.
In Ulay's final work with Ms. Abramovic, "The Lovers," each of them walked more than 1,000 miles from different ends of the Great Wall of China until they met. The work had been conceived to culminate in the couple's marriage, but by then they were estranged, and it was used to mark their separation instead.
They did not speak to each other again for some 20 years.
Frank Uwe Laysiepen was born on Nov. 30, 1943, in Solingen, Germany. He trained as a photographer and worked as a consultant for Polaroid. He used Polaroid photography early in his art career, experimenting with depictions of his identity, sometimes by cross-dressing.
Renown came after he had met Ms. Abramovic while living in Amsterdam in 1975. They immediately considered themselves soul mates, even discovering that they shared the same birthday, Ms. Abramovic wrote in "Walk Through Walls" (2016), her autobiography.
Ulay tended to Ms. Abramovic's wounds after she cut a star into her stomach as part of a performance, and soon afterward they decided to work together rather than as individuals, according to "The Story of Marina Abramovic & Ulay," a 2017 film.
After they broke up, Ulay continued making his own work, and returned to using Polaroid cameras.
In 2010, he had a public reunion with Ms. Abramovic when he sat down opposite her and took her outstretched hands during "The Artist Is Present," a marathon performance at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in which she sat in the museum daily and looked into the eyes of individual museumgoers.
A video clip of their meeting, set to sentimental music, has been viewed more than 17 million times on YouTube. "It was a very touching moment," Ulay told The Guardian in 2016.
"I never rehearse performances," he said in the same interview. "It's about spontaneity -- no rules, no time limits, no substitution."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
His survivors include his wife, Lena, and three children.
In 2015, Ulay sued Ms. Abramovic, claiming that she had failed to give him credit for works and that she had not paid him properly. In 2016, a Dutch court ordered Ms. Abramovic to pay Ulay €250,000 (the equivalent of about $ 280,000) in royalties as well as costs.
The two later put aside their differences, at least enough to take part in the 2017 film. "It is with great sadness I learned about my friend and former partner Ulay's death today," Ms. Abramovic wrote on Instagram on Monday.
Ulay is scheduled to have a major solo retrospective at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam from November to April 2021.

Death of Horse Renews Debate Over Carriages In Central Park

Texto completo: As video of the incident at Central Park spread on social media, several elected officials called for an investigation.
The large brown horse stumbled multiple times in Central Park on Saturday before collapsing onto the pavement. It lay on the ground for minutes, apparently unable to stand, as multiple men trussed its legs together and hauled it into a trailer.
Some hours later, the animal, a 12-year-old mare named Aisha, was euthanized, according to officials and a carriage industry group.
By the next day, the disturbing footage of her collapse and news of her death had spread on social media, prompting an outcry online and renewing calls by some to put an end to New York City's carriage-horse trade, which has for years been a political flash point.
The next day, dozens of people attended a protest staged by the animal rights group, NYCLASS, which first posted the video online and has long sought to pull carriage horses from New York City.
"We have a duty and responsibility to do all we can to end the abuse of these horses, however we can," said NYCLASS's executive director, Edita Birnkrant, in an interview on Monday.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter on Sunday that the Police Department's Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad was looking into Aisha's death. He described the footage as "painful," adding that it "says so much about a persistent problem."
Several elected officials, including the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, and the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, have also called for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident.
Ms. Birnkrant said she first heard about Aisha's collapse on Saturday from several pedicab operators stationed near Central Park. As she and others went to the park, they collected video footage.
In one video that Ms. Birnkrant provided to The Times, a carriage driver can be seen blowing smoke into Aisha's face until the horse flips over on the ground. No veterinarian was called to the park as a number of carriage drivers tried to move Aisha into the trailer, she added.
"It was just horrific watching her being brutalized because they were so desperate to get her into this trailer," Ms. Birnkrant said. "And it was not being done in a humane way."
Christina Hansen, a spokeswoman for Historic Horse-Drawn Carriages of Central Park, which represents the carriage horse industry, said in a statement that the horse was moved "following large animal rescue protocols."
In her statement, Ms. Hansen said that Aisha "showed sudden signs of distress" at around 12:30 p.m. on Saturday. The horse had completed one ride that day and had been waiting at a stand in the park, Ms. Hansen said.
After the trailer arrived, Aisha was taken to a stable, where the horse's regular veterinarian treated her within an hour of the incident, Ms. Hansen said. Results of tests to determine Aisha's cause of death were still pending.
"Medical emergencies can happen to the healthiest horses, receiving the best, highly regulated care," Ms. Hansen said.
A spokesman for the city's health department, which oversees working horses, said the agency had responded to reports of Aisha's collapse and monitored the situation, and that the horse "did not respond to treatment and was humanely euthanized."
Including Aisha, three carriage horses have died so far this year, according to the health department, two of them euthanized after contracting colic.
Ms. Birnkrant said Aisha's death was representative of what she called a low standard of care for the city's carriage horses.
"Just like anyone else, any other living being having a medical emergency, whether they live or die, depends on the care given immediately after," she said. "There was not a qualified vet on the scene; there were unqualified people trying to get her into a trailer."
The videos reopened the debate over the city's carriage-horse industry, which animal-rights activists have long called inhumane and abusive. Supporters have said the horses are treated humanely and that the carriages are a romantic link to New York City's past that provides jobs and appeals to tourists.
While campaigning in 2013 to become mayor, Mr. de Blasio vowed to ban the horse-drawn carriages on his first day in office. But in the face of opposition from drivers and their allies -- the horses have remained popular with New Yorkers -- he scaled back.
In 2018, Mr. de Blasio's administration restricted the carriages from picking up passengers outside of the park. Last year, the City Council passed a bill to prevent carriage horses from working on hot or humid days.
Ms. Birnkrant and her organization have not given up on an eventual ban for the practice. But in the face of a difficult political reality, they are calling for more reforms, including a policy that would require dashboard cameras on horse carriages so that officials could better monitor the horse's conditions.
"If we can achieve a ban, that would be fantastic," Ms. Birnkrant said. "In the meantime, we're going to fight every battle to end the cruelty that has been happening."

Texto completo: The panel condemned tactics they said the Syrian government and its allies were still using in the northwest province of Idlib.
GENEVA -- United Nations investigators said on Monday that Russia had committed war crimes in Syria by carrying out indiscriminate airstrikes on civilian targets in 2019, condemning tactics they said the Syrian government and its allies were still using in the northwest province of Idlib.
The investigators also said that Syrian rebels allied with Turkey had carried out war crimes during the invasion of Kurdish areas in northern Syria, and that Al Qaeda-linked rebels had inflicted scores of civilian casualties in rocket attacks on government-held areas.
Their accusations were made in the latest report of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria, the Geneva-based panel that has been monitoring the nearly decade-old conflict in Syria.
The investigators said Russian aircraft had carried out a "double tap" attack on a market last July 22, killing at least 43 civilians, and an airstrike on a camp for displaced civilians in August that killed at least 20 people.
In both airstrikes, "the Russian Air Force did not direct the attacks at a specific military objective, amounting to the war crime of launching indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas," the three-person panel said, citing eyewitness accounts, video footage and intercepted communications with pilots conducting the strikes.
The findings of the commission, which will present its report to the United Nations Human Rights Council next week, provided an authoritative and independent assessment of Russian conduct in the Syria conflict that corroborated reporting by human rights groups and media, including The New York Times.
There was no immediate Russian response to the commission's findings. Russia has repeatedly denied accusations that its forces have indiscriminately attacked civilians.
The report focused on events between July and January but members of the panel made clear they believe pro-government forces have continued to commit war crimes in the offensive underway in northwestern Syria, which has driven nearly a million people from homes toward the Turkish border of Idlib.
The panel said the offensive had been punctuated by intensive bombardment inflicting "unprecedented levels of suffering and pain."
Besides attacks on civilian targets, which are protected under international law, the commission also observed a "crime of intentionally terrorizing the population" in order to force civilians to move.
"We are seeing that picture emerging very clearly, for example, in Idlib," Hanny Megally, a member of the panel, told reporters in Geneva.
The commission said Turkey should investigate whether it was responsible for an airstrike in October on a convoy of vehicles carrying around 400 people days after a Turkish military assault on Kurdish areas of northern Syria. The attack killed 11 people and wounded 74, and although Turkey has denied any involvement, human rights groups attributed the strike to Turkish aircraft.
The commission said it was continuing to investigate the incident.
It said it believed a Syrian rebel force allied with Turkey, the Syrian National Army, had committed the war crimes of murder and pillage, citing the killings of the Syrian Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf and her driver, who were dragged from their vehicle and executed.
Turkish commanders could bear criminal responsibility for those deaths if the fighters responsible were found to have been under their effective command and control, the panel said.

Texto completo: Readers react to a column by David Brooks titled "No, Not Sanders, Not Ever."
To the Editor:
Re "No, Not Sanders, Not Ever," by David Brooks (column, Feb. 28):
I'm the quintessential traditional liberal whom David Brooks talks about. I am committed to the system that Mr. Brooks says Bernie Sanders wants to tear down. But while Mr. Sanders isn't my first, or even third, choice among the Democratic candidates, I won't hesitate to vote for him should he become the nominee -- and, if he has a lick of sense, neither should Mr. Brooks.
Mr. Sanders may have bizarrely charitable views about the policies of some cruel authoritarians such as Fidel Castro. But let's be clear about what really matters: Mr. Sanders is not himself an authoritarian and would not govern like one. I have no doubt that Mr. Sanders believes in the rule of law; that he would not use the power of the state against political enemies; and that he would not demean and degrade institutions such as the press, the courts, the Justice Department and the diplomatic corps. Nor is Mr. Sanders cruel.
In all of those things, Mr. Sanders is the antithesis of the man currently in the White House. If you want to preserve constitutional democracy, David Brooks, think again.
Carl T. Bogus
Bristol, R.I.
The writer is a professor of law at Roger Williams University.
To the Editor:
I'm grateful to David Brooks for crystallizing my thinking about the Democratic primary. Like so many Americans, and certainly many of my friends, I've wavered between throwing my lot in with the moderates -- Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar or Mike Bloomberg -- and taking a gamble with the more impassioned but riskier candidacies of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. But Mr. Brooks made clear that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders shouldn't be spoken of in the same breath.
Sure, they share many of the same ideas, but Ms. Warren is a progressive pragmatist who has worked within the system to get things done, including her signal achievement, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Sanders is a left-wing populist, as extreme and uncompromising in his way as President Trump is in his. The time is short for Ms. Warren to drive home this message herself.
Wayne J. Guglielmo
Mahwah, N.J.
To the Editor:
I feel that I must urge The New York Times to quit laying into Bernie Sanders. I am somewhat undecided about my wishes for the Democratic nomination, but the nonstop negative articles about Mr. Sanders are getting to me.
David Brooks has now joined the fray. What is this about? Do you fear that Mr. Sanders will single-handedly turn this country away from capitalism? No chance.
I am really tired of it. Quit, please. We are heading toward another Hillary Clinton debacle. And if that happens The Times will be partly to blame for the disaster that will befall this country.
Jean Christensen
Louisville, Ky.
To the Editor:
I know David Brooks is a conservative, and that's just fine. But he is also an influencer, and his suggestion that he could not pull the lever for Bernie Sanders, even if it appears that a vote for anyone else is a vote for Donald Trump, seems incredibly irresponsible to me. If, as Mr. Brooks states, Mr. Trump's moral rot threatens our nation, can he honestly believe that Bernie Sanders is an equal threat?
If the only two choices that we have are Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, I truly believe that we must vote for the lesser of two evils and trust that our system of checks and balances will work as intended.

Texto completo: Bill de Blasio, months after a failed White House bid, has made moves that could help Chirlane McCray be elected to a post in Brooklyn.
The sounds from the Super Bowl telecast echoed through the ballroom of Gracie Mansion, as the 100 or so guests, including many donors, mingled with Mayor Bill de Blasio.
The private party, organized and paid for by Mr. de Blasio's state and federal political action committees, was billed as an informal affair, but attendees said it had the feel of a meet-and-greet event ahead of another possible campaign.
Only the candidate in question appeared not to be the mayor, according to three guests, but his wife, Chirlane McCray.
A few months earlier, Mr. de Blasio had been holding himself as a potential leader of the free world, enthusiastically pursuing a campaign for president. He traveled the country, made national television appearances and got into the early Democratic primary debates before dropping out in September.
Now it seems that Mr. de Blasio has his eye on a different sort of presidency, the largely powerless presidency of the borough of Brooklyn -- for his wife.
Since late last year, Mr. de Blasio has been making moves that could help smooth the way for a run by Ms. McCray for Brooklyn borough president, should she decide to go forward with it.
The mayor has been urging those with political power in Brooklyn to keep an open mind about Ms. McCray as a candidate. He has taken meetings at Gracie Mansion and spoken with influential union leaders in recent weeks, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.
A prominent political figure described a conversation with Mr. de Blasio last month about Ms. McCray as a candidate. Another said the mayor asked him to discuss her plans with her.
Ms. McCray's interest seems clear: She confirmed in a television interview on WPIX on Wednesday that she was "thinking" about a run for borough president, and Mr. de Blasio, in a separate interview on "Good Day New York" said his wife had a "serious interest" in the office.
The mayor's behind-the-scenes maneuvering has returned him to a much less glamorous place than the bright lights of the 2020 campaign: the back rooms of Brooklyn politics, with its ethnic rivalries and parochial real estate concerns.
It is a world that the Democratic mayor, the leader of the nation's largest city who must leave office in two years because of term limits, might well have left behind.
Yet rather than unburden himself, Mr. de Blasio appears to have embraced the return to his deal-making roots in Brooklyn, according to interviews with more than a dozen city officials, union representatives and political donors, who requested anonymity to avoid angering the still-powerful mayor.
In December, Mr. de Blasio met for more than four hours at Gracie Mansion with Frank Carone, a lawyer and influential figure in the Brooklyn Democratic Party, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. They also spoke by phone afterward about the possibility that Ms. McCray would become a candidate.
Earlier this year, one of Mr. de Blasio's top officials -- who had left city government to become a senior adviser on his presidential run -- began working for the Brooklyn Democratic Party, whose support would be critical to Ms. McCray. That official, Jon Paul Lupo, is also the current treasurer of Mr. de Blasio's defunct presidential campaign.
During the mayor's State of the City speech in January, his wife appeared in a gauzy video that some in the audience described as campaign-style.
Then came the launch of a new podcast -- "Thrive with Chirlane McCray" -- a show created in partnership with a nonprofit cultural organization, BRIC, that is focused on bringing free cultural programming to Brooklyn. In the first episode, Ms. McCray spoke with her son, Dante, who asked her questions about her personal biography.
Brooklyn would also be the first borough to benefit from a newly announced $ 40 million program for first-time parents, Ms. McCray announced last month.
The Super Bowl party fell amid those moves and included local real estate developers and business figures from Brooklyn along with members of Mr. de Blasio's administration.
An emailed invitation to the party, a copy of which was shared with The New York Times, came from the fund-raiser and the former treasurer of the mayor's presidential campaign, Michael Giaccio. It went to some of the same people who gave money to Mr. de Blasio's presidential run.
"This was really the B or C team. These were not major players," said one attendee, who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door event. "There wasn't much food. It was all greasy."
As Ms. McCray moved through the crowd before the game, conversation turned to her likely run.
"Stay tuned!" she told two donors from the real estate industry who asked about when she would be announcing a run, according to a person briefed on the exchange.
Her potential entrance would immediately upend the race, Brooklyn political observers said.
"She's a game-changer because of who she is and what she's established working for her husband," said the Rev. A.R. Bernard of the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn.
While the borough president has little formal power other than a role in the city's land-use process and some control over funds for local capital projects, the $ 179,000 position is often seen as a steppingstone to higher office. The current Brooklyn borough president, Eric L. Adams, is running for mayor.
Two City Council members, Robert E. Cornegy Jr. and Antonio Reynoso, have already entered the race; both have been actively campaigning.
Asked about the Super Bowl party, Freddi Goldstein, Mr. de Blasio's press secretary, directed questions to Mr. Lupo.
"The mayor hosted a Super Bowl party in his home and invited many people who support Fairness PAC's progressive goals," Mr. Lupo said. "No one paid to attend or was asked to contribute to Fairness PAC or other political efforts, and in fact many attendees are not donors."
While government officials are generally prohibited from using city buildings for political campaign activity, Ms. Goldstein said that the event did not run afoul of any city rules and that the mayor did not seek guidance from the city's Conflicts of Interest Board.
"The Mayor does not need C.O.I.B. approval to host private events at his home," she said in an email. "The PAC paid." (Mr. Lupo later clarified that funds for the event came from both the mayor's state committee, N.Y. Fairness PAC, and its federal counterpart, Fairness PAC.)
Still, the use of Gracie Mansion to host donors struck some as an inappropriate.
"Gracie Mansion is the official residence of the mayor of New York City. It should not be used for donor cultivation events," said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a nonpartisan good government group. "If the mayor wants to have a Super Bowl where he invites donors, then pay to have it at a bar."
Two people with connections to City Hall played downplayed Ms. McCray's role and said that it was not unusual for Mr. de Blasio to host donors at the mansion. The Super Bowl party attracted more guests this year than a similar event last year, they said, because some invitations went out three days before the game instead of two.

Texto completo: The new rule could effectively force 60 Chinese citizens to leave the United States in a tit-for-tat campaign between Washington and Beijing that has caught journalists in the crossfire.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Monday limited to 100 the number of Chinese citizens who may work in the United States for five state-controlled Chinese news organizations. The decision is expected to escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing in a diplomatic feud that has caught journalists in the crossfire.
The State Department insisted that it was not expelling Chinese journalists, a step that Beijing took last month against three Wall Street Journal reporters -- the first time foreign correspondents had been ordered to leave China since 1998.
But the new limits could, in effect, force Chinese citizens to leave if their visas allowing them to work in the United States are tied to the news organizations that must now choose which employees will remain on assignment in the United States.
In a statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would not restrict the content of what the five organizations report -- a contrast to what he described as increased surveillance, harassment and intimidation of foreign journalists in China.
"Our goal is reciprocity," Mr. Pompeo said. "As we have done in other areas of the U.S.-China relationship, we seek to establish a long-overdue level playing field. It is our hope that this action will spur Beijing to adopt a more fair and reciprocal approach to U.S. and other foreign press in China."
It was the latest in the tit-for-tat statecraft that has become a hallmark of the strategic rivalry between the United States and China, encompassing trade, military and cybersecurity confrontations, tensions over human rights and the coronavirus epidemic.
In an episode last fall, the Trump administration expelled two Chinese officials who trespassed on an important military base in Virginia, evading the authorities until fire trucks blocked their car. People close to China's embassy in Washington described it as an accident by officials who got lost while sightseeing.
The restriction announced on Monday applies only to Chinese citizens working at five news organizations that the State Department deemed propaganda outlets controlled by the government in Beijing. It requires the five organizations -- Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily and People's Daily -- to limit the number of Chinese employees in the United States to 100, collectively. More than half -- 59 -- have been allocated to Xinhua, China's official news agency.
Currently, about 160 Chinese citizens work in the United States for those news outlets, meaning that 60 must either leave by the time the new policy takes effect on March 13 or ensure they have a visa that will allow them to stay.
Senior State Department officials said the five organizations would have broad authority to decide who on staff -- whether journalists, managers or other employees -- would remain. The officials said the move was not a result of any specific information or content that the five organizations have published or broadcast.
Instead, two senior State Department officials said, the new limits seek to punish Beijing for what they described as systematic stifling of press freedoms against foreign reporters in China. The two officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity as required under State Department protocol. Separately, a senior official said the Trump administration might soon limit how long the media visas allow Chinese journalists to stay in the United States.
The State Department officials would not discuss what steps China might take in retaliation.
Beyond the expulsions of the Journal reporters, the Chinese government has repeatedly allowed the visas of foreign correspondents whose work is perceived as unfriendly to lapse, forcing them to leave the country.
A report released Monday by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China pointed to another Wall Street Journal journalist who in the past year was in effect forced to leave. He had written about potential ties between organized crime and a cousin of President Xi Jinping of China.
The report said that in at least five other cases, the Chinese government had similarly declined to renew resident journalists' long-term visas. Reporters formerly from Al Jazeera English and The Guardian confirmed to The New York Times that the government had declined to grant them new visas, without explanation, ending for all intents and purposes their careers as journalists in China.
The journalists report, titled "Control, Halt, Delete: Reporting in China Under Threat of Expulsion," also focused on what it characterized as a ramped-up practice of issuing truncated long-term visas -- ones that must be renewed after a short period in an onerous process that also implicates visa-holders' family members in the country. The report called this a means of harassing journalists and sending the not-so-subtle message that the Chinese government was displeased with their reporting, whether it concerned Mr. Xi, protests in Hong Kong or the treatment of ethnic minorities.
In all, the report concluded, at least a dozen correspondents received visas for six months or less in 2019, compared with five the year before. The standard length for a long-term journalist visa in China, known as a J-1, is one year.
"Chinese authorities are using visas as weapons against the foreign press like never before, expanding their deployment of a longtime intimidation tactic as working conditions for foreign journalists in China severely deteriorated in 2019," said the report, which was based on a survey of more than 100 journalists in China from 25 countries.
Frédéric Lemaître, a China-based correspondent for the French newspaper Le Monde, said he was on his second consecutive three-month visa after he wrote a series about Mr. Xi. Mr. Lemaître said an official in the press office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had told him, "You are our guest, and in China, guests must respect the host."
About 100 American journalists are currently working in China for U.S. and other foreign news organizations, State Department officials said. By comparison, the United States issued 425 media visas to Chinese journalists and their families in 2019 alone.
While China's Foreign Ministry formally oversees foreign journalists, accreditation decisions appear to involve other arms of the government, including security and propaganda agencies. The decision to expel the Journal reporters was unlikely to have been made solely by the ministry.
China expelled the Journal reporters the day after the State Department declared that it would officially treat the five Chinese news agencies as foreign government functionaries and therefore subject to similar rules and restrictions as diplomats stationed in the United States.
In announcing the expulsions, a Foreign Ministry spokesman cited a controversial headline to an opinion article in the Journal from last month that had referred to China as the "Real Sick Man of Asia." The article criticized China's response to the coronavirus outbreak.

Texto completo: Readers react to a column by David Brooks titled "No, Not Sanders, Not Ever." Also: An abhorrent immigration rule; alligators (and other animals) in New York.
To the Editor:
Re "No, Not Sanders, Not Ever," by David Brooks (column, Feb. 28):
I'm the quintessential traditional liberal whom David Brooks talks about. I am committed to the system that Mr. Brooks says Bernie Sanders wants to tear down. But while Mr. Sanders isn't my first, or even third, choice among the Democratic candidates, I won't hesitate to vote for him should he become the nominee -- and, if he has a lick of sense, neither should Mr. Brooks.
Mr. Sanders may have bizarrely charitable views about the policies of some cruel authoritarians such as Fidel Castro. But let's be clear about what really matters: Mr. Sanders is not himself an authoritarian and would not govern like one.
I have no doubt that Mr. Sanders believes in the rule of law; that he would not use the power of the state against political enemies; and that he would not demean and degrade institutions such as the press, the courts, the Justice Department and the diplomatic corps. Nor is Mr. Sanders cruel.
In all of those things, Mr. Sanders is the antithesis of the man currently in the White House. If you want to preserve constitutional democracy, David Brooks, think again.

To the Editor:
I'm grateful to David Brooks for crystallizing my thinking about the Democratic primary. Like so many Americans, and certainly many of my friends, I've wavered between throwing my lot in with the moderates -- Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar or Mike Bloomberg -- and taking a gamble with the more impassioned but riskier candidacies of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. But Mr. Brooks made clear that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders shouldn't be spoken of in the same breath.
Sure, they share many of the same ideas, but Ms. Warren is a progressive pragmatist who has worked within the system to get things done, including her signal achievement, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Sanders is a left-wing populist, as extreme and uncompromising in his way as President Trump is in his. The time is short for Ms. Warren to drive home this message herself.
Wayne J. Guglielmo
Mahwah, N.J.
To the Editor:
I feel that I must urge The New York Times to quit laying into Bernie Sanders. I am somewhat undecided about my wishes for the Democratic nomination, but the nonstop negative articles about Mr. Sanders are getting to me.
David Brooks has now joined the fray. What is this about? Do you fear that Mr. Sanders will single-handedly turn this country away from capitalism? No chance.
I am really tired of it. Quit, please. We are heading toward another Hillary Clinton debacle. And if that happens The Times will be partly to blame for the disaster that will befall this country.
Jean Christensen
Louisville, Ky.
To the Editor:
I know David Brooks is a conservative, and that's just fine. But he is also an influencer, and his suggestion that he could not pull the lever for Bernie Sanders, even if it appears that a vote for anyone else is a vote for Donald Trump, seems incredibly irresponsible to me. If, as Mr. Brooks states, Mr. Trump's moral rot threatens our nation, can he honestly believe that Bernie Sanders is an equal threat?
If the only two choices that we have are Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, I truly believe that we must vote for the lesser of two evils and trust that our system of checks and balances will work as intended.

Another Setback for Immigrants
To the Editor:
"Immigrants and the Wealth Test" by Catherine S. Ramírez (Op-Ed, Feb. 26), about the government's new policy "to deny permanent legal status to legal immigrants considered likely to become a public charge," beautifully describes what many of us have been feeling. The administration's changes to the "public charge" rule are abhorrent and antithetical to the America we experience living in New York.
Compounding the administration's draconian changes to this rule is the crackdown on the refugees at our southern border, disproportionately high-poverty immigrants of color. Since its inception, the Trump administration has been working diligently to preserve an America that benefits only the white and wealthy.
Donald Trump, the son and grandson of immigrants, is not the first president to use the "public charge" provision to carry out an anti-immigrant agenda. President Herbert Hoover made changes to the same provision in the 1930s, with the intent of blocking the many Jews attempting to flee Europe. As a direct result, countless Jews were left with no viable path to America as Hitler rose to power.
We must call out such practices and demand that our country welcome all immigrants.

A New York Alligator Story
To the Editor:
Re "Gator Tales in the City: Are They Fact or Fiction?" (news article, Feb. 26):
Kudos for your bright compendium on the gators of New York. I submit an addition.
As an official in 2003 with the New York City Police Department, I witnessed N.Y.P.D. emergency service officers first sedate and then extract a fully grown Bengal tiger from a Harlem apartment.
The tiger, Ming, received all the attention. Al, a 5-foot-4 alligator, was carried, jaws taped, soon thereafter from the same apartment, to little acclaim.

Texto completo: Judy Sheindlin's hit courtroom television program will stop taping new episodes, but in an apparent challenge to CBS, she said she was starting a new show, "Judy Justice."
For 24 seasons, "Judge" Judy Sheindlin has reigned as the stern, hallowed matriarch of what has become the most watched courtroom in daytime television.
But this coming 25th season of "Judge Judy," Ms. Sheindlin said, may very well be her last. In an appearance on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" airing on Monday, she said that CBS would be airing reruns after the coming season ends next year. She also raised the possibility that she would compete with "Judge Judy" with a new show.
In a statement to The New York Times on Monday, Ms. Sheindlin suggested that her breakup with CBS was not necessarily a smooth one.
"CBS has been a fine partner for 20-plus years," Ms. Sheindlin, 77, said in a statement to The New York Times. "They have decided to monetize their 'Judge Judy' library of reruns. I wish them good luck with their experiment."
Ms. Sheindlin, a former criminal and family court judge in New York City, is the highest-paid television host in the country, reportedly earning $ 47 million a year. For the last 10 seasons, "Judge Judy" has been No. 1 in first-run syndication, according to CBS Television Distribution. In 2017, Ms. Sheindlin sold CBS the rights to her show's library for a reported $ 95 million.
It was unclear whether CBS, which declined to comment, had failed to agree on a new contract with Ms. Sheindlin, or if it simply decided it did not need more new episodes now that it owned the library.
In her interview with Ms. DeGeneres, Ms. Sheindlin seemed to place the onus on CBS, with whom she said she has had a "successful" 25-year relationship.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"CBS, I think, sort of felt they wanted to optimally utilize the repeats of my program, because now they have 25 years of reruns," she said in a clip released by "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" on Monday morning.
"But I'm not tired," she added, "so 'Judy Justice' will be coming out a year later."
Ms. Sheindlin didn't elaborate on where her new show would air, but she implied that it wouldn't be on CBS.
She is betting that, for her fans, there is no such thing as too much judicial Judy.
"The following couple of years, you should be able to catch all the reruns that CBS has sold to the stations that are currently carrying 'Judy,"' she said. "And 'Judy Justice' will be going elsewhere. Isn't that fun?"

Known Coronavirus Cases in U.S. Hit 100. (Some May Go Undetected.)

Texto completo: More than 100 patients with the illness have been treated in 15 states, according to a Times database. Those numbers are growing quickly.
CHICAGO -- The number of known coronavirus cases in the United States spiked over the weekend and into Monday, with dozens of new diagnoses bringing the total of confirmations to 103.
Public health officials reported that the virus was spreading among people with no history of overseas travel. Schools closed. Governors declared states of emergency.
The New York Times has been tracking every case in the United States for more than a month and maintaining a database using information from federal, state and local officials to keep an accurate count.
The number of patients treated in the United States remains a small fraction of those diagnosed overseas, where thousands of people have died and tens of thousands have been infected. Most states have not had any confirmed cases.
But as concern about a broader outbreak spreads, here is what is known about the current cases.
There's unexplained spread on the West Coast.
For weeks, nearly all the coronavirus cases in the United States could be directly connected to overseas travel or to close personal contact with someone who had recently returned from a trip. In recent days, that has started to change.
Health officials in California, Oregon and Washington State have all reported incidents of the virus turning up in people with no high-risk travel history, suggesting that it could be spreading undetected within the United States.
The toll has been especially severe at a nursing home in suburban Seattle.
Six people have died in Washington State.
The first coronavirus deaths in the United States were reported over the weekend in King County, Wash., which includes Seattle.
The first fatality, announced Saturday, was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions. The second, announced Sunday, was a man in his 70s who was a resident of the nursing home in Kirkland, Wash., where several cases have been identified.
On Monday, officials in Washington announced that four more people, including three nursing home residents, had died from the coronavirus. Other residents of that facility were hospitalized in critical condition.
Patients have been treated in 15 states.
While coronavirus has been diagnosed on both coasts and in the Midwest, it has mostly been concentrated in just a handful of states.
Combined, California and Washington account for 60 of the cases. Those patients include a mix of people who contracted the illness locally, traveled in China or were passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which docked in Japan after an outbreak on board. Doctors in Nebraska, where there is a hospital unit specializing in biocontainment, have treated 13 coronavirus patients, all of them former Diamond Princess passengers.
Health officials in Illinois, Florida, Georgia, Oregon, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have all reported multiple cases of coronavirus. And individual patients, all of whom had a high-risk travel history, have been treated in Arizona, New Hampshire, New York, Utah and Wisconsin.
Nearly half of U.S. patients were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
Forty-three Americans who spent time aboard the ship, where the virus spread among passengers and crew members, were evacuated and treated in the United States.
Those patients, who were flown out of Japan on two U.S. government flights, have received care at hospitals in California, Nebraska, Texas, Utah and Washington State.
Dr. Matt Willis, the public health officer in Marin County, Calif., said one Diamond Princess passenger who tested positive was being monitored at a hospital there. The patient, Dr. Willis said, was "not sick at all" and eager to return home.
"We're just sort of waiting to see what plays out as the body fights the virus," Dr. Willis said. "And potentially it could be weeks. And that's tying up a precious hospital bed for a long time."
The vast majority of patients traveled overseas.
Though more and more unexplained cases have been identified, most people with coronavirus in the United States recently spent time in a country with a larger outbreak.
A woman in Washington State who traveled to South Korea was diagnosed late last week. On Sunday, the first diagnosis in New York was announced, involving a woman who had traveled in Iran.
And over the weekend, health officials in Rhode Island said two people, including a teenager, who had returned from a school trip to Italy were diagnosed with coronavirus. Others who went on that trip were being held out of class, and the school was closed for deep cleaning.
Several patients have already recovered.
Many people with coronavirus experience only minor symptoms, and some of the first patients in the United States have already recovered and returned to daily life. Those people include a man in Washington State, two people from China who were diagnosed while traveling in California, and a married couple in the Chicago area.
"They have now had multiple rounds of negative testing for the virus and are clinically well," Dr. Allison Arwady, the county public health commissioner in Chicago, said last month as the couple was released from isolation. "They do not need to wear masks, and neither does anyone interacting with them. They have been cleared."

A Drug Study's Abrupt End Sets Volunteers Adrift

Texto completo: A participant might commit months or years to a drug trial, only to see it vanish overnight.
On March 21, 2019, the staff at the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia was scrambling to learn more about an early-morning announcement: Two pharmaceutical companies, Biogen and Eisai, would discontinue their clinical trial of a drug intended to slow the progression of early Alzheimer's disease.
A "futility analysis" had shown that aducanumab, being studied in more than 3,200 people worldwide, would not prove effective. It was yet another disheartening result; after decades of drug research, one medication after another -- hundreds of them -- had failed to prevent, arrest or cure Alzheimer's.
The Penn researchers wanted to be the ones to break the bad news to the 18 participants they had recruited.
"When this effort you contributed months and years to is ending, that's something you want to hear from people you trust," said Emily Largent, a bioethicist and researcher there.
But the Penn staff was too late to inform John Poritsky, a participant with early-onset Alzheimer's, and his wife, Debra Morris. The news had already begun circulating online.
"My friend had sent me a text, 'Did you hear that this study is ending?"' said Dr. Morris, an English professor at the Pennsylvania College of Technology. "I was horrified. Floored. I couldn't believe it."
For nearly a year, they had regularly traveled three hours from their home in Williamsport, Pa., to Philadelphia, where Dr. Poritsky had undergone extensive testing and received monthly infusions without knowing whether he was receiving the drug or a placebo.
"I'd built up a lot of hope," said Dr. Poritsky, 61, a retired English professor. He wasn't surprised to have developed Alzheimer's; his father, grandfather and great-uncle all had the disease. But he had hardly expected a diagnosis before he turned 60.
This drug study, a Phase 3 trial, had allowed him to think not only that he might benefit personally, but that he could help advance science. "I thought, I can be part of something that can cure or arrest this illness," he said. When the plug was suddenly pulled, "I was just devastated."
This scenario occurs with distressing frequency. Most Alzheimer's drug trials are sponsored by publicly held pharmaceutical companies, which must follow federal Securities and Exchange Commission regulations when they disclose information that affects stock prices.
Alerting patients or investigators before notifying shareholders would violate the companies' legal obligations. So they often issue early-morning news releases.
Years ago, most patients probably learned about discontinued trials from researchers and staff whom they had come to know. (The last Alzheimer's medication to receive F.D.A. approval was Namenda, in 2003.)
But with social media and 24-hour digital reporting, plus keen public interest in Alzheimer's drugs, "this has become fast-moving news in a way it wasn't before," Dr. Largent said.
So by the time researchers are able to make phone calls, their patients often have already seen the announcements on Facebook or fielded calls from worried friends.
"It's akin to a trauma, the news that's devastating and the surprising, out-of-the-blue way you learn it," said Dr. Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician who co-directs the Penn Memory Center.
For Phil Gutis, 58, a former New York Times reporter diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's, "it was a kick in the stomach." Like Dr. Poritsky, he was enrolled in the aducanumab trial, and had learned of its termination from a friend's text. "There should be a better way," he said.
Internationally, the Alzheimer's Association calculates that clinical trials now underway for dementia treatments -- drugs, dietary programs, devices and other interventions -- aim to enroll more than 56,000 people.
Drug trials for Alzheimer's disease are often a particularly arduous commitment.
"These are not simple protocols," said Dr. Sharon Cohen, a neurologist and principal investigator at the Toronto Memory Program, which had enrolled 29 participants in the aducanumab trial. "The visits are long. They are frequent. There is in-depth testing. Blood draws. M.R.I. scans that may recur. PET scans. There may be spinal taps. And the study partner" -- a family member or friend -- "has to attend many of these as well."
Why agree to all that, especially when researchers pointedly explain that the experimental drug may not help and could actually harm patients? Moreover, in a typical double-blind study, half the participants won't even get the drug but will instead receive a placebo.
Researchers and patients describe a mix of motives: desperation, altruism, trust in the investigators and sponsors.
"I thought I was doing this for future generations," Mr. Gutis said. But as he learned more about aducanumab, "there was definitely optimism that this possibly could help me."
Participants also come to value their deepening relationships with the study staff, who know so much about the disease and take such an interest in their condition. "It was almost familial," Dr. Poritsky said.
"We were part of a community and a structure, and it was gone," Dr. Morris said.
The aducanumab study also took an unexpected and uncommon turn. Seven months after ending the trial, Biogen and Esai announced (in another early-morning news release) that a reanalysis, using additional data, indicated that at high doses the drug appeared to reduce cognitive decline after all.
They plan to resume an open-label trial (without a placebo) in March and to seek F.D.A. approval. The development was encouraging, but left study participants feeling especially whipsawed.
In a recent editorial in JAMA Neurology, Drs. Karlawish and Largent argued for a more communicative approach. "We're trying to change the culture of the way we run clinical trials in Alzheimer's research," Dr. Karlawish said in an interview.
Lobbying the S.E.C. to change its regulations would be "infeasible," he acknowledged. But the informed consent process, the researchers wrote, should prepare participants for the possibility of an abrupt end to the trial.
Participants could opt to receive the pharmaceutical company's news release, or a letter, as soon as it is issued, "so you don't feel like you're the last one to know," Dr. Largent said.
The researchers urged companies to share details of what a given study revealed; even failed experiments provide useful information. "It's an important way of demonstrating respect for their contributions," Dr. Largent said.
Finally, study sites should provide support after trials end, by checking on the well-being of participants and referring them to counseling or support groups as needed.
Some of those suggestions may take hold. The Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Aging say they plan to meet with drug manufacturers to discuss improving communication with research participants.
The Toronto Memory Center has gone a step further. In 2018 it hosted a lunch for participants and partners after a discontinued trial; the event included a presentation of the results, "to show them what their efforts had led to," Dr. Cohen said. She described the participants as "medical heroes, taking risks to benefit themselves and others."
Last year, at another lunch, the center presented several participants with citizen-scientist awards.
Despite the disappointments, participants often remain eager to join other trials. When aducanumab testing resumes, both Mr. Gutis (who learned that he had been receiving the drug rather than a placebo, and thought it had helped him) and Dr. Poritsky (who thought so too, but had received a placebo) plan to re-enroll.
They will moderate their expectations this time, however.
"You volunteer to be a lab rat," Mr. Gutis said. "But the rat doesn't have high hopes."
