When Karen Killilea was born in 1940, she was three months premature and weighed less than two pounds. She spent her first nine months in a neonatal intensive care unit.
When she finally returned to the family home in Rye, New York, her parents noticed that her limbs were especially stiff, she never rolled over in her crib and she didn’t reach for toys that were dangled in front of her. Babies born so early rarely survived in those days. The doctors told Karen’s parents to institutionalize her and get on with their lives.
That was the last thing that James and Marie Killilea (pronounced KILL-ill-ee) would do. Far from forgetting about Karen, they scoured the United States and Canada for medical specialists who could help her. They saw more than 20, all of whom said that Karen’s case was hopeless. One told them that in China, a child like Karen would be left on a mountaintop to die.
They finally found a doctor in Baltimore who recognized Karen’s intelligence, saw that she was aware of her surroundings and determined that she had cerebral palsy. With tireless dedication, her family spent at least two hours every day for the next 10 years helping Karen move her limbs back and forth, and eventually she triumphed over her prognosis.
By her early teenage years, she was walking with crutches, swimming, typing and going to school.
And she lived to be 80.
She died on Oct. 30 in Port Chester, New York, in Westchester County, just north of New York City. Her sister Kristin Viltz said the cause was a respiratory condition that led to heart failure.
Marie Killilea told the world about her daughter in two bestselling books, which were among the first to describe in detail the challenges of living with a severe physical disability and were an inspiration to many families in similar circumstances.
The first, “Karen” (1952), showed how she and her family had worked to overcome the odds against her.
Among the glowing reviews for “Karen,” which was translated into several languages, was this from Saturday Review: “Extraordinary is the word to be used first, last and repeatedly about this book. Anyone who meets Karen, even on paper, will postpone resigning from the human race.”
The sequel, “With Love From Karen” (1963), followed Karen into young adulthood. Marie Killilea also wrote “Wren” (1981), a version of “Karen” for children.
Karen Killilea worked for four decades as the receptionist at the Trinity Retreat House in Larchmont, New York. She traveled to Italy twice, meeting semi-privately both times with Pope Paul VI.
She was determined to show that her disability had not limited her. Among the activities she pursued was conducting obedience training for dogs. She had a special affection for Newfoundlands, which were much larger than Karen, who was barely four feet tall and weighed only 65 pounds.
“She was the most fiercely independent person you could imagine,” Viltz, her sister, said in a phone interview.
She never considered herself “handicapped,” her sister said, instead calling herself “permanently inconvenienced.”
Karen Ann Killilea was born on Aug. 18, 1940, in Rye. Her father was an executive with the New York TelephoneCo.; her mother was a homemaker.
Karen attended the Academy of Our Lady of Good Counsel Elementary School in nearby White Plains. With the support of her older sister, Marie, who was a few grades ahead of her at the same school, Karen earned good marks and graduated from the eighth grade in 1959. She attended the academy’s high school partway through the 10th grade but stopped after Marie left for college.
“Karen was a legend,” said Sister Laura Donovan, a former principal of the high school, who was also a student there, a few years behind Karen.
“The way I heard it, this young woman had great courage and determination,” Donovan said in a phone interview. “She came to a non-handicap-accessible school, and I never heard anyone say she ever wanted special treatment.”
As Karen’s parents began lobbying in Albany for the rights of the disabled, they met many other parents of children with disabilities who were desperate for information and eager to share their own experiences. This led to the formation of what is now called Cerebral Palsy of Westchester. Marie Killilea later founded, with other parents and volunteers, the organization that became known as the United Cerebral Palsy Association.
By the time her parents died (her mother in 1991, her father in 1994), Killilea was living independently, first in a rental apartment in New Rochelle and then in a condo she bought in Larchmont.
In addition to her sisters, Kristin Viltz and Marie Killilea Irish, her survivors include a brother, Rory Killilea.
After the books appeared, Karen and Marie Killilea were inundated with mail from all over the world and answered at least 15,000 letters. Some were addressed simply to “Karen, U.S.A.,” and still arrived.
Many wrote to thank the family for telling their story and to say that it had inspired them to become nurses, or physical or occupational therapists. Some readers even appeared on the family’s front porch, so eager were they to meet this “miracle child,” as her mother called her, and tell of their own situations.
In later years, readers joined online discussions about her. Many, noting that the book “Karen” was about Karen and not by her, longed to hear her own account in her own voice.
But she valued her privacy deeply and never gave interviews or wrote her own book. She turned down almost all invitations to speak, including one from her old school to address the students, Donovan said.
Still, her voice emerged to some extent in her mother’s second book. After Karen had experienced the freedom that came with using a wheelchair and decided she preferred it to hobbling around on crutches, which she found to be painful, her mother quoted her as saying:
“No more will I be a drab, slow little sparrow that hops around with his head down. I’ll be free, really free. I’ll be an eagle with my face to the sun.”

Texto completo: The New York Times on Friday repudiated its prominent 2018 podcast titled "Caliphate" that featured an alleged Islamic State executioner and will reassign Rukmini Callimachi, the reporter who led the series.
In a lengthy editor's note, the Times wrote that it had made a mistake to focus extensively in the series on a Canadian who identified himself as Abu Huzayfah and claims to have killed people in Syria as a member of Islamic State.
That person was later identified as Shehroze Chaudhry. In September, the Times noted on Friday, Mr. Chaudhry was arrested by Canadian police and charged with perpetrating a terrorist hoax. Efforts to reach Nader R. Hasan, an attorney for Mr. Chaudhry, were unsuccessful. Mr. Hasan told the Times that Mr. Chaudhry would oppose the hoax charge.
The "Caliphate" series is one of the newspaper's best-known podcasts, winning a 2018 Peabody Award in the radio/podcast category for what jurors cited as "a wonderful example of what longform audio reporting can and should sound like." A spokesperson for the Peabody Awards wasn't immediately available for comment.
On Friday afternoon, the Peabody organization said the Times would return its 2018 Peabody Award for "Caliphate" following its internal review. A spokeswoman for the Times confirmed the decision.
Separately, the Overseas Press Club of America said on its website that it has rescinded its 2018 Lowell Thomas Award for "Caliphate," citing conclusions raised by the Times's internal review. The spokeswoman for the Times declined comment.
Ms. Callimachi, who joined the Times in March 2014, was considered the paper's leading Islamic State reporter.
In a Twitter posting, Ms. Callimachi, 47 years old, apologized to listeners for "what we got wrong" and said she was committed to doing better. "Thinking of the colleagues and the newsroom I let down is gutting," she wrote.
The Times spokeswoman said Ms. Callimachi wasn't available for comment.
Dean Baquet, the Times's executive editor, told NPR journalist David Folkenflik that Ms. Callimachi will be given a new assignment. "I do not see how Rukmini could go back to covering terrorism after one of the highest- profile stories of terrorism is getting knocked down in this way," said Mr. Baquet.
The podcast isn't being removed from the New York Times website, said a spokeswoman for the paper. She said the investigation is now complete.
She added that corrections have now been appended to two earlier articles that Ms. Callimachi wrote unrelated to the "Caliphate" podcast, one from 2014 and one from 2019 .
In its "Caliphate" editor's note, the Times wrote that "Canadian officials say they believe that Mr. Chaudhry's account of supposed terrorist activity is completely fabricated. The hoax charge led The Times to investigate what Canadian officials had discovered, and to re-examine Mr. Chaudhry's account and the earlier efforts to determine its validity."
Writing that the "Caliphate" episodes featuring Mr. Chaudhry didn't meet its accuracy standards, the Times said that an editor more experienced with the subject matter should have been involved with the storytelling process.
The editor's note, which resulted from a lengthy internal review of the podcast, said the podcast shouldn't have featured Mr. Chaudhry as a central character.
In an interview posted Friday on The Daily, a New York Times podcast, Mr. Baquet said the Times got the story wrong. An internal investigation couldn't find any independent evidence that Mr. Chaudhry had been an ISIS executioner in Syria, he said. As a result, Mr. Baquet concluded the Times couldn't stand behind the reporting.
"This failing isn't about any one reporter," said Mr. Baquet. "This was an institutional failing."
The Times made specific mistakes, he said. "We didn't listen hard enough to the stuff that challenged the story," he said. "This was not deceit or fraud by the institution."
There will always be murkiness when writing about the subject of ISIS, he added, but that is why the Times needed to be more cautious. The Times, he said, failed to provide enough scrutiny at the upper levels of the newsroom to an ambitious piece of journalism, for which he blamed himself and his top deputies. "I didn't personally pay enough attention to this one," he said.

New York Times Says ‘Caliphate’ Podcast Fell Short of Standards

After an internal review that took more than two months, The New York Times has determined that “Caliphate,” its award-winning 2018 podcast, did not meet the standards for Times journalism.
The 12-part audio documentary featuring Rukmini Callimachi, a Times correspondent who has frequently reported from conflict zones, sought to shed light on the Islamic State terrorist group. The Times found that “Caliphate” gave too much credence to the false or exaggerated accounts of one of its main subjects, Shehroze Chaudhry, a resident of Canada who claimed to have taken part in Islamic State executions.
Dean Baquet, executive editor of The Times, said the blame fell on the newsroom’s leaders, including himself.
“When The New York Times does deep, big, ambitious journalism in any format, we put it to a tremendous amount of scrutiny at the upper levels of the newsroom,” he said in a podcast interview posted by The Times on Friday.
“We did not do that in this case,” he continued. “And I think that I or somebody else should have provided that same kind of scrutiny, because it was a big, ambitious piece of journalism. And I did not provide that kind of scrutiny, nor did my top deputies with deep experience in examining investigative reporting.”
The Times started its review of “Caliphate” after Canadian authorities arrested Chaudhry on Sept. 25 and charged him with perpetrating a terrorist hoax. In an editors’ note Friday, The Times said its investigation had “found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the ‘Caliphate’ podcast. As a result, The Times has concluded that the episodes of ‘Caliphate’ that presented Mr. Chaudhry’s claims did not meet our standards for accuracy.”
The editors’ note described two main problems: The Times’ failure to assign an editor well versed in terrorism to keep a close watch on the series; and the “Caliphate” team’s lack of skepticism and rigor in its reporting on Chaudhry.
“From the outset, ‘Caliphate’ should have had the regular participation of an editor experienced in the subject matter,” the note said. “In addition, The Times should have pressed harder to verify Mr. Chaudhry’s claims before deciding to place so much emphasis on one individual’s account.”
Every episode of “Caliphate” now begins with a correction read by Michael Barbaro, the host of The Daily podcast, who tells listeners that the chapters on Chaudhry “did not meet our standards for accuracy.” A new installment, “An Examination of ‘Caliphate,’” has also been added. It includes the interview with Baquet, conducted by Barbaro, that was released Friday. In the interview, Baquet raised the possibility that Chaudhry had “duped” The Times, but said the news organization was at fault.
“Look, there was a well-known reporter involved in it — Rukmini Callimachi,” he said. “But this failing isn’t about any one reporter. I think this was an institutional failing.”
The Times reviewed “Caliphate” in two separate investigations. Dean E. Murphy, an associate managing editor for investigations, headed a group that examined how the series was reported, edited and fact-checked, and reviewed past articles by Callimachi. Mark Mazzetti, an investigative correspondent with an expertise in intelligence, led a team of reporters who looked into Chaudhry. On Friday the Times published an article by the Mazzetti-led team, which provided a depiction of Chaudhry that contrasted sharply with the man who was central to “Caliphate,” describing him as “a fabulist who spun jihadist tales about killing.”
Baquet said in the interview with Barbaro that “the reporting team couldn’t find any independent evidence to back up his story of being an ISIS executioner in Syria,” using an alternative name for the Islamic State. He added, “I think this guy, we now believe, was a con artist, who made up most if not all that he told us.”
Since the start of the review process, Callimachi’s byline has not appeared in The Times. Baquet said in an interview for this article that Callimachi will stay on at the paper. “She’s going to take on a new beat, and she and I are discussing possibilities,” he said. “I think it’s hard to continue covering terrorism after what happened with this story. But I think she’s a fine reporter.” Her last published work was a series of articles on the killing of Breonna Taylor. As a result of the internal investigation, The Times added editors’ notes describing problems with two articles by Callimachi in 2014 and 2019.
In a Twitter statement Friday, Callimachi, who declined to comment for this article, said, “To our listeners, I apologize for what we missed and what we got wrong. We are correcting the record and I commit to doing better in the future.”
“Caliphate” was something new for The Times — a venture into narrative audio that came as part of a recent emphasis on multimedia journalism. It was a creation of the Times audio department, which has grown quickly since it was started in 2016. In its review, The Times found that journalists working in audio had less oversight from upper-level editors than reporters who work for the newspaper itself.
“We do a lot of things we didn’t do before,” Baquet said in the interview for this article. “We don’t just produce long-form newspaper stories. I don’t think we have built a system to give that kind of support to some of the bigger things we do.” He added, “For the most part we’ve gotten everything right. But I think this fell through the cracks, because it was a different way of telling stories than The New York Times is used to. We didn’t have a system in place to manage that, to help the audio team manage that.”
Like other shows of its kind, “Caliphate” had suspenseful moments and a moody score. It also had a pair of likable hosts in Callimachi, the winner of major journalism awards for her reporting on terrorism and Islamic extremism, and Andy Mills, an audio producer and reporter.
The series was the brainchild of Lisa Tobin, executive producer of Times audio; Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor; and Mills, according to two people with knowledge of the podcast. The first installment came out on April 19, 2018, as part of an episode of The Daily. The first words of “Caliphate” were an exchange between Callimachi and Chaudhry taken from a 2016 interview recorded in Canada.
“How does ISIS prepare you to kill people?” Callimachi asked.
Chaudhry, who said he had assumed the name Abu Huzayfah as a member of the Islamic State, replied haltingly, saying, “We had dolls to practice on.” In later installments, he said he took part in lashings, as well as the killings of two people, describing the executions in grisly detail.
His apparent confession created a firestorm in Canada. Politicians asked why a supposed Islamic State executioner was living quietly within the nation’s borders. Upon his Sept. 25 arrest, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police charged Chaudhry under a law usually applied to people who make false terroristic threats.
The hoax charge cast doubt on “Caliphate,” but The Times was initially supportive. “The uncertainty about Abu Huzayfah’s story is central to every episode of ‘Caliphate’ that featured him,” a Times spokeswoman said in a Sept. 26 statement. Days later, The Times announced that it would review the series, which had been a popular and critical success in 2018, hitting No. 1 on Apple’s list of most downloaded podcasts and later winning an Overseas Press Club prize and a Peabody Award.
There had been warning signs during — and even before — the months when “Caliphate” episodes came out each Thursday. In a 2017 interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., Chaudhry gave an account of his time with the Islamic State that differed greatly from what he had told Callimachi. In that CBC interview, he said he had “witnessed violence on a scale he could never have imagined,” but did not say he had taken part.
In another interview, published on the CBC website May 11, 2018, Chaudhry recanted his confession. When asked why he had told The Times that he had participated in atrocities, he said, “I was being childish. I was describing what I saw and, basically, I was close enough to think it was me.”
Behind the scenes at The Times, as was previously reported by the paper’s media columnist, Ben Smith, high-level editors had raised concerns about “Caliphate” before it was released.
In March 2018, after reviewing draft scripts, Michael Slackman, the paper’s assistant managing editor in charge of international coverage, called members of the “Caliphate” team into a meeting with Matthew Purdy, a deputy managing editor, and Dolnick. Slackman and Purdy said that parts of the series seemed to rely too much on Chaudhry’s uncorroborated accounts. They told the reporters and editors to pause the project until they had done more reporting.
The “Caliphate” team decided to add an episode on the discrepancies in Chaudhry’s account. It was released May 24, 2018, under the title “Chapter Six: Paper Trail.” In it, Callimachi said she had gone over her notes and documents with fresh eyes and noticed stamps in Chaudhry’s passport suggesting he had misled her concerning his whereabouts at certain times. “It was at that point that I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach,” she said in the episode.
Narrative journalism can be perilous, said Ann Marie Lipinski, a former editor-in-chief of The Chicago Tribune who has run the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard since 2011. “That’s a certain kind of storytelling that is much valued and does have this built-in entertainment quality,” she said. “But you can never sacrifice the reporting to that.”
In his interview with Barbaro, Baquet said that “a really good piece of journalism not only chews on the stuff that supports the story — it chews on the stuff that refutes the story.”
“And in the end,” he continued, “good journalism comes from some sort of internal debate over whether or not the stuff that supports the story is more powerful than the stuff that refutes the story. I think this is one of those cases where I think we just didn’t listen hard enough to the stuff that challenged the story. And to the signs that maybe our story wasn’t as strong as we thought it was.”

JERUSALEM — Liberals were confounded. The right-wing incumbent’s blue-collar base was sticking by him, cheering as he weaponized identity politics, attacked democratic institutions and appeared to place his own interests ahead of the nation’s.
A familiar set of facts, to say the least. But the liberals in question were Israeli, the incumbent was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the working-class voters were Israeli Jews with roots in North Africa and the Middle East.
A Tel Aviv University sociologist named Nissim Mizrachi who spent years studying those voters and grappling with their rejection of liberalism thought he understood why.
The problem was not, he said, as some liberals contend, that Jews of Mediterranean origin, or Mizrahim, were confused about what was best for them. They weren’t suffering from Stockholm syndrome or “false consciousness.”
What liberals failed to see, the professor asserted, was that working-class Mizrahim were consciously spurning liberalism for a reason: what they see as the endgame of the liberal worldview is not a world they wish to inhabit.
“It’s really hard for liberals to imagine that their message, their vision itself, poses a threat to the core identity of other people,” Mizrachi, 58, said in an interview.
His description of liberalism’s blind spots, published in the newspaper Haaretz a year ago, shook the Israeli left like an ideological bunker-busting bomb, and could hold lessons for another deeply polarized society in the West.
The parallels between Mizrahi voters in Israel and Trump voters in the United States are impossible to miss, Mizrachi said.
Both see themselves as their countries’ most patriotic citizens, and demonize the left and its allies in the news media, academia and other liberal redoubts as traitorous enemies. Both, he said, feel disdained by those elites, who dismiss their views as racist, ignorant or unwittingly self-defeating.
“You keep ridiculing us and presenting us as undemocratic and dangerous,” he said, articulating the nonliberal view. “But we are the people. Who are you?’”
Mizrachi, as his surname suggests, is a product of the Mizrahi working class himself: His mother, who moved to Israel from Iraq as a teenager, met his father at an institute for the blind (both had lost their eyesight, from trachoma, at age 2). The couple raised their son and his two sisters on a shoestring in Kiryat Hayovel, a poverty-stricken and overwhelmingly right-wing Jerusalem neighborhood of Mizrahi immigrants.
When a teacher said that young Nissim was bright, and should perhaps attend vocational school to become a handyman, he said, his mother responded tartly that her son would study and grow up to earn enough “to hire your son.”
Drawn to higher education, his outlook took a leftward turn in the United States while on a Fulbright Scholarship to the University of Michigan, where he earned a doctorate in 1998, and later at Harvard. He met other young Mizrahi scholars, still a rarity in the Israeli academy, which was dominated by Jews of Eastern European origin, and experienced something of a political awakening as a liberal and a Mizrahi.
Returning to Israel, he became an activist on Mizrahi education and human rights.
There seemed to be ample reason for Mizrahim, long treated as second-class citizens, to be drawn to liberal promises of equality and social justice. Yet, nothing he said could budge even members of his own family from their right-wing leanings.
In 2011, after hearing a visiting lecturer from Europe extol human rights as the “international moral language,” Mizrachi had an aha moment.
If such liberal ideas were so universal, he asked, why, in Israel, “had they failed to reach the hearts and minds of working-class people?”
He recalled demonstrations where liberal activists called for coexistence with the Palestinians and spoke of prosecuting both Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters on war-crimes charges — an expression of shared humanity that he said liberals found “morally sublime” but which had onlooking Mizrahi taxi drivers boiling over with rage.
“The resistance is physical,” he said. “They become so violent, as if you are threatening their personal property, or about to rape their daughter. And if we don’t understand why they are so upset, we don’t understand anything.”
For the Mizrahi working class, he said, the liberal vision of peace with the Palestinians, of breaking down barriers and prejudices between peoples, imperils their own sense of identity and belonging as Jews in a Jewish state. To them, the nation’s borders, walls and segregated Jewish and Arab communities are not just reassuring but essential for coexistence.
The way they see it, he said, is “if the liberals get their version of peace, it’s a threat to my way of living.”
That sense of belonging, he concluded, defeated every attempt by the left to make inroads with working-class Mizrahim.
In addition to feeling scorned by the liberal elite, he said, Mizrahim and Trump voters also share a perception that solving the world’s or the Middle East’s problems — whether by welcoming immigrants and striking trade deals that send jobs overseas, or by rushing to give a bitter enemy a state next door — too often comes at their expense. Charity must begin at home.
Some critics on the left have accused Mizrachi of glossing over serious issues of racism, sexism and homophobia.
Menachem Mautner, a law professor who is both a critic and adherent of Israeli liberalism, said that Mizrachi’s portrayal of the Mizrahi worldview was overly “rosy.” But he said it would be a mistake to dismiss Mizrachi’s conclusions.
“We need to internalize them and to take them seriously,” he said.
Mizrachi, who is married to an ophthalmologist and has three daughters, has some influential allies in Israeli politics, among them Tehila Friedman, a centrist lawmaker.
Friedman, who as an Orthodox Jew and a feminist said she had ample experience mediating between traditional and liberal values, said the most common complaint about Mizrachi was that he had legitimized discrimination, especially anti-Arab bias, among Mizrahim.
“That’s a big problem,” she said. “That’s always a problem with seeing the world in circles — first my family, then my tribe, then my people, then other people.’ But that’s the way most of us live.”
Mizrachi, she said, is “trying to give respect to those sets of values, which deserve respect.”
Understanding the other side is a prerequisite to bridging the political gulf, Mizrachi said. When he was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, a student confided that she was having horrible fights with her mother, a Trump voter. He urged her to try to set aside her anger and interrogate her mother as if she were a research subject.
It helped, he said.
“The other side’s concerns are not mine, but they should be, because I care about him or her,” he said. “We share something in common here. We are sharing this land and this nation. It sounds horrible, but he or she needs to become part of us. Because they are part of us.”
To that extent, Democratic relief over Trump’s defeat obscures a serious risk, he said.
He recalled how Israeli liberals, driven from power in 1977, celebrated their comeback in 1999 when Ehud Barak of the Labor Party ended Netanyahu’s first term. Triumphant, the left did not bother to reach out. It went right back to marginalizing Netanyahu’s right-wing base.
But Barak did not last two years, his successors have all been right-wingers, and Labor today is effectively defunct.
“This is the lesson maybe for you,” Mizrachi said. “OK, you won the election, fine. But don’t forget that red America is still there.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
He described the killings in lurid detail — how he shot one man in the head and stabbed another in the heart before hanging the corpse on a cross.
He spoke at length about joining the religious police of the Islamic State in Syria, and being trucked to a terrorist training session on attacking the West, including North America, his homeland.
He recounted how Islamic State commanders displayed maps and color-coded instructions, showing recruits like him how to strike major Western targets, get into restricted areas, kill people and attain martyrdom.
They envisioned “something as spectacular as 9/11,” he said. “They wanted to outdo al-Qaida, make their mark.”
But Shehroze Chaudhry, the central figure in the 2018 podcast “Caliphate,” by The New York Times, was a fabulist who spun jihadi tales about killing for the Islamic State in Syria, Canadian and U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials contend.
Chaudhry, they say, was not a terrorist, almost certainly never went to Syria and concocted gruesome stories about being an Islamic State executioner as part of a Walter Mitty-like escape from his more mundane life in a Toronto suburb and in Lahore, Pakistan, where he spent years living with his grandparents.
Chaudhry’s elaborate accounts, told to The Times and other news outlets, caused a political uproar in Canada. The award-winning “Caliphate” series broadcast his claims of killing for the Islamic State to millions of listeners, fueling outrage that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government had allowed a terrorist to live freely in suburban Toronto despite the crimes Chaudhry had so openly confessed to committing in Syria.
Now, Chaudhry’s public declarations have put him in legal jeopardy. In September, Canadian authorities charged Chaudhry with perpetrating a terrorist hoax, a criminal charge that could bring up to five years in prison if he is convicted.
Tracking the thousands of fighters who have traveled from across the world to fight with the Islamic State is a sprawling, often murky, undertaking. Before “Caliphate” aired, two U.S. officials told The Times that Chaudhry had, in fact, joined the Islamic State and crossed into Syria. And some of the people who know and have counseled Chaudhry say they have no doubt that he holds extremist, jihadi views.
But Canadian law enforcement officials, who conducted an almost four-year investigation into Chaudhry, say their examination of his travel and financial records, social media posts, statements to police and other intelligence make them confident that he did not enter Syria or join the Islamic State, much less commit the grievous crimes he described.
U.S. officials interviewed for this article support the conclusion that Chaudhry, who turns 26 on Saturday, was never a terrorist threat. It is difficult to say with absolute certainty that he never entered Syria, they warn.
But even if he did, they contend, it would have been for a brief period — in which he claimed to have joined the Islamic State, received religious and weapons training, gone on patrols, meted out punishment, carried out executions and participated in secret discussions about plotting high-profile attacks against the West.
“Hoaxes can generate fear within our communities and create the illusion there is a potential threat to Canadians, while we have determined otherwise,” Superintendent Christopher deGale, head of the national security team that conducted the investigation, said in a statement about the case.
The “Caliphate” series raised questions about some of Chaudhry’s assertions and devoted an episode of the podcast to them. After the Canadians charged Chaudhry with a hoax, The Times examined his case again, taking a fresh look at social media posts, photographs, travel records, academic transcripts and other potential evidence that could shed light on his contention that he had joined, and killed for, the Islamic State in Syria.
The review established a timeline of his movements, which did not rule out the possibility that Chaudhry went to Syria within a narrow window of a few weeks. But it also identified a history of misrepresentations by Chaudhry — including using pictures of fighters in Syria that were available on the internet and passing them off as his own to portray himself as an Islamic State member — that casts ample doubt on his claims. Indeed, the review found no independent corroboration of Chaudhry’s participation in the atrocities he claims to have committed in the “Caliphate” podcast.
As a result of the review, The Times on Friday published an editors’ note that the podcast was “not sufficiently rigorous” and that the episodes presenting Chaudhry’s claims did not meet its standards.
‘His Real Life Is a Bit Dull’
Today, Chaudhry spends much of his time in Big Grill, his family’s shawarma and kebab shop in a sprawling and busy strip mall in Oakville, a suburb outside of Toronto.
On a recent afternoon, Chaudhry was applying toppings and wrapping up takeout orders as a steady stream of customers made their way into the restaurant. A brightly lit picture of a shawarma rotisserie sat in the window, alongside a note offering free meals to people left hungry by the coronavirus pandemic.
“He’s bored,” said Amarnath Amarasingam, an assistant professor at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, who has been counseling Chaudhry for more than three years and believes his account of joining the Islamic State in Syria. “His real life is a bit dull.”
Chaudhry declined to comment, but his lawyer, Nader R. Hasan, said that his client would dispute the hoax charge. Under the law, prosecutors not only need to show that Chaudhry lied, but that he also intended to frighten the public into thinking that terrorists were about to cause “death, bodily harm” or significant property damage.
“Mr. Chaudhry has been charged with a very serious criminal offense of which he is not guilty,” Hasan wrote in an email to The Times, without specifying how he would contest the charge.
Legal experts say Chaudhry’s defense will probably challenge the second requirement of the hoax charge — that he intended to sow fear.
Cultivating a Persona
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the national police force and other security agencies began investigating Chaudhry in late 2016, after he posted on social media that he had “been to the battlefield” in Syria for “a bit less than a year” and shared pictures online to cultivate his image as an Islamic State warrior.
Even at the time, Chaudhry’s social media claims offered little evidence. His postings, compiled by researchers, showed photographs of silhouetted fighters holding assault rifles in a jagged, rocky landscape. Chaudhry described the rugged setting as his “humble abode.”
But far from proving Chaudhry’s jihadi bona fides, at least one of the pictures was a brazen copy of widely available news photography, The Times’ examination found. The original image had been taken months earlier by a photographer for the official Russian news agency, Tass, and had been distributed by Getty Images, one of the world’s biggest suppliers of photographs.
Other images Chaudhry provided as evidence that he had gone to Syria — specifically, snapshots he said he had taken of armed men at the beach, whom he described as his “fellow fighters” — also proved to be identical to photographs that had been posted on Twitter years before by Syrian anti-war activists, The Times’ examination found. And as with other images, Chaudhry misrepresented — or perhaps didn’t actually know — where, and sometimes when, they had been taken.
Canadian officials did not say exactly when they became convinced that Chaudhry had fabricated large parts of his story, but they insist it didn’t take very long to figure out. Ralph Goodale, the Canadian public safety minister in 2015-19, said he had information suggesting that Chaudhry’s accounts of joining the Islamic State in Syria were false when The Times broadcast “Caliphate” in 2018. Still, Goodale said he was unable to declare that publicly at the time because the police investigation was underway.
“I had reason to suspect this individual was not what he pretended to be,” Goodale, who is no longer in politics, said in an email.
Despite the many holes in Chaudhry’s story, confusing and sometimes contradictory intelligence reports circulated about him for years, offering a glimpse into the daunting challenge officials face in identifying the thousands of foreign fighters who streamed into Syria to join the Islamic State.
One Canadian official, who was not involved in the criminal investigation, recently described a 2017 intelligence report that said Chaudhry — who went by the name Abu Huzayfah — had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State. But the report, according to the official, said that Chaudhry had done little of consequence in the country and left not long after he arrived.
Beyond that, a senior Iraqi intelligence official recently said that a source had identified Chaudhry in a photograph and called him an Islamic State combatant in Iraq and Syria who had also been imprisoned in Syria, muddying the waters even more.
But after examining the evidence they collected, Canadian officials now say they are confident that Chaudhry never went to Syria, and they do not expect him to argue at trial that his claims of being an Islamic State executioner are even partly true.
‘You Can’t Just Sit Back’
Chaudhry moved to Canada from Pakistan with his family when he was less than 2 years old, according to his uncle, and grew up in Burlington, a suburb southwest of Toronto. In a university enrollment form in Pakistan, Chaudhry stated that he graduated from a Burlington high school in 2012. His father opened the family restaurant in nearby Oakville.
After high school, Chaudhry traveled to South Africa in 2012 and enrolled in a madrasa, an Islamic school, in a town just south of Johannesburg. Photographs that Chaudhry provided, which The Times recently verified as having been taken at the madrasa, showed the school, its dorms and him with other students there.
But he didn’t settle at the madrasa, according to his uncle, Muhammad Usman. Chaudhry moved to Pakistan to live with his maternal grandparents, with whom he was close. By the end of 2012, he was enrolled in an environmental science course at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of Lahore, the school’s records show.
He spent the next 3 1/2 years living in Lahore in a middle-class district, returning to Canada during school holidays, according to his family and passport records.
“He used to go to university regularly,” his grandfather Shakil Ahmed told The Times in 2018. “I used to pick him up and drop him at the bus stop. I used to collect him from the bus stop on a motorbike,” he said at the time. Ahmed has since died.
At the campus where Chaudhry studied, students in both Western and traditional Pakistani dress mingle freely. Unlike at another famous university in Lahore, the University of the Punjab, where Islamist groups keep a tight check on male and female interactions, the University of Lahore’s atmosphere is relatively relaxed and casual.
His uncle, Usman, said Chaudhry had shown some attraction to militant culture, but suggested it was more role-playing than anything serious. “He just got attracted to those types because he wanted to be a true Muslim,” he said. “He used to get very excited,” he added, by wearing garments in “Taliban style.”
Chaudhry said in the “Caliphate” podcast that the brutal civil war in Syria, which began in 2011, woke him to the plight of Muslims around the globe and spurred him to action. “You can’t just sit back and, you know, watch the world burn,” he said.
At first, he told The Times that he had flown to Turkey from Pakistan and crossed into Syria on foot, sneaking through a hole in a border fence to join the Islamic State in February 2014. He described his duties with the religious police force, patrolling the streets to enforce the group’s harsh interpretation of Islam and meting out brutal punishment on local residents, sometimes with a metal-studded belt.
He said he remained in Syria through July 2014, and was there when the Islamic State’s leader at the time, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared the territory a caliphate, claiming to revive the Muslim theocracy that ended with the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Chaudhry described the celebrations inside Islamic State-controlled territory at that triumphal moment, but said he left Syria after that, having grown disillusioned with the group and the killings he had been ordered to carry out. So he fled, he said, slipping back across the Turkish border and making his way back to Pakistan.
But suspicions arose when The Times, while reporting “Caliphate,” found no stamps for Turkey in his Canadian passport and determined that his Pakistani passport had long expired. Records show he had actually flown from Lahore to Toronto in February 2014, returned to Lahore later that same month, and then flown back to Toronto again in July 2014 — during the period he said he was in Syria.
Confrontation, and a Changed Story
Before “Caliphate” was broadcast, The Times confronted Chaudhry with some of the inconsistencies in his account. He then changed his story, claiming that he had traveled to Syria well after the declaration of the caliphate — sometime “after September 2014,” he ultimately said in the “Caliphate” podcast.
But even that version of events is called into question by his university records, which suggest that he went to school that fall and appear to leave little time for him to have gone to Syria.
The records show a middling student who got into trouble when he failed to pay his bus fees and who pestered the university over his biology grades. But his transcript shows that he was awarded grades for the 2014 fall term, which ended in January 2015.
Then, weeks later, records show, he submitted a handwritten note to the university in March 2015, requesting time off from his studies; his family said he had had a motorbike accident in Lahore. His Canadian passport says he left Pakistan a few weeks later, and Facebook posts by Chaudhry, documented by a Canadian journalist before they were taken down, suggested that he was back in Canada in April and May.
Overlooked Inconsistencies
Chaudhry told The Times before “Caliphate” went on the air about one of his supposed emirs, or commanders, inside Syria. The emir had been the subject of an article in a Swedish publication.
The journalist who wrote the article helped The Times interview the emir for the “Caliphate” podcast. In the interview, the emir said he recognized, with some uncertainty, Chaudhry’s face from photographs that The Times had provided.
But the emir’s account challenged several of Chaudhry’s central assertions. The emir described himself as a commander in a different city from the one where Chaudhry claimed to have been stationed. He rejected the notion that Chaudhry had ever served under him. And he said that Chaudhry most likely had a military role, undercutting a principal element of Chaudhry’s story — that he was a religious police officer, not a battlefield soldier. Some of these inconsistencies were not included in the “Caliphate” podcast.
Later, the emir sent a short voice message of a second Islamic State official who claimed to remember Chaudhry. The Times never interviewed the person directly, yet included his assertions in “Caliphate.” And, as noted in the podcast, The Times did not independently verify the identities of these supposed officials or vet the accuracy of their accounts.
Beyond that, the “Caliphate” podcast said the second Islamic State official seemed to have inside information about Chaudhry — specifically, that he was Canadian — that had not been given to him in advance. But in its later review, The Times found that Chaudhry’s nationality had already been provided to the emir during his interview for the “Caliphate.” The emir then contacted the second official to see if he recognized Chaudhry.
When Chaudhry’s social media posts grabbed the attention of Canadian police in 2016, catching people who had gone abroad to join the Islamic State and charging them under terrorism laws was a big priority for authorities. For the mounted police, Chaudhry’s social media postings held the promise that they could bring a case against a Canadian citizen.
Officials said the first steps of the investigation used the digital fingerprints from Chaudhry’s trove of online activity, travel data and other information from several countries to determine if he had, in fact, entered Syria through Turkey or Iraq — the two most common entry points for foreign fighters going to Syria to join the Islamic State.
As the investigation continued, Chaudhry settled back into his life in Burlington. Before “Caliphate” aired, he told The Times that he had resumed his studies at a Canadian university. But Canadian officials say their investigation found no evidence that he was a student in Canada.
‘He’s Created a Fantasy’
Police and others have made attempts to shake Chaudhry from his radical views. Those people include Mubin Shaikh, known in Canada for his work as a paid police informant inside a group known as the Toronto 18. Its members had plotted an elaborate wave of terror attacks in Canada.
Shaikh, who now acts as a deradicalization guide, said he got to know Chaudhry but parted ways with him because he believed that Chaudhry would not renounce his views. He believes the stories Chaudhry told were “fantasies.”
“He’s an ISIS supporter, a hundred percent,” Shaikh said, using an alternative name for the Islamic State. “So it looks like he’s created a fantasy for himself. I can see how this happens. You’re consuming this ISIS stuff day in and day out. You have no life, no friends, no real anything.”
But Amarasingam, the professor who has been counseling Chaudhry, rejects the idea that the young man is an impostor. “You would have to be some sort of a sociopath to literally invent a story like this in your head, have all the details in place and then tell hundreds of people about it for months at a time, or dozens of people, and just kind of carry on like that,” Amarasingam said. “This seems insane to me.”
He says he remains in touch with Chaudhry and has spoken with him since his arrest. “He was upset that his name was public and his face was public, because now it’s going to prove difficult to get a job or prove difficult when he’s in a relationship,” Amarasingam said. “I think he’s definitely pro-jihadist, probably a bit pro-ISIS, even though he’s critical of them. He still talks very nostalgically in a weird way about the people he knew there.”
In May, after a special national security unit led by the mounted police investigated whether Chaudhry had gone to Syria in an attempt to join or assist the Islamic State — crimes in Canada — authorities decided to pursue the hoax charge, officials say.
On Sept. 25, they say, police arrived at the Chaudhry family’s rented home. Minutes later, Chaudhry was put in a car, where he was informed that he was being arrested under a terrorism hoax section of Canada’s criminal law.
He was allowed to go back into his house, without any other conditions. His lawyer would not describe Chaudhry’s legal strategy in the case, other than to say that “he intends to vigorously defend himself.”

In the 1940s, Clarice Lispector, barely out of college, rocked the Brazilian literary establishment with the publication of her debut novel, “Perto do Coração Selvagem” (“Near to the Wild Heart”). Critics lauded the jagged unpredictability of the book, which charted the stream-of-consciousness reflections of a young female protagonist determined to live freely in a world ordered by men.
The novel’s publication marked the beginning of a long public fascination with its author, particularly because she was a woman in Brazil’s male-dominated literary world. Even her name drew attention: Though she had lived in Brazil since infancy, she carried her surname from her birthplace, a hamlet in the Soviet Union. One influential critic called the name “strange and even unpleasant.” Others surmised that it was a pseudonym. And though Portuguese was her first language, a partial speech defect that flattened her R’s added an extra layer of mystery.
But nothing was more compelling about Clarice, as she came to be known among fans, than her words. She would publish eight more novels, 85 short stories, five books for children and countless letters and newspaper columns, cementing her reputation in Brazil and abroad as a writer of great, if cryptic, power.
“Lispector pushes Portuguese (and language itself, I would argue), to its limits,” Magdalena Edwards, the Chilean-born scholar and translator, wrote in an email. “She writes about people who are questioning themselves, their world, existence as such, and her use of language reflects this process.”
Lispector and her characters — women “on the verge of exaltation, greatness, dissolution, spiritual ecstasy,” the translator Katrina Dodson noted in a 2018 essay for The Believer magazine — have taken their place in the 20th-century Latin American literary canon and continue to enrapture new readers. And part of what draws them is at the heart of the question, Who is Clarice Lispector?
If the story of how Chaya Pinkhasovna Lispector, the daughter of poor Jewish immigrants, became Clarice, the glamorous and mysterious literary sensation, is worthy of a book, it is one she refused to write; she repeatedly deflected questions about her past in the few interviews she granted and bent the facts in the few autobiographical columns she wrote.
In one column, Lispector recalled visiting the Sphinx while on a trip to Egypt during World War II, writing: “I didn’t decipher her. But she didn’t decipher me either. She accepted me, I accepted her. Each one with her own mystery.”
She was born on Dec. 10, 1920, in Chechelnyk, in the Soviet Union (now part of western Ukraine), the youngest of three daughters of Mania and Pinkhas Lispector. Her family fled the anti-Semitic pogroms that spread across Eastern Europe after World War I and landed in Brazil, where Mania became Marieta, Pinkhas became Pedro and Chaya became Clarice.
Clarice’s childhood was marked by poverty and sorrow. When she was 10, her mother died of an unknown illness, and her father struggled to keep his family fed and clothed, moving them first to the coastal city of Recife and then to Rio de Janeiro in 1935.
By then, Clarice had started writing stories. She later reflected in a column that she was more interested in “sensation” than plot; one of her tales was “a story that never ended.” She submitted her writings to the children’s page of Recife’s main newspaper but all were rejected.
As a teenager she was transfixed by the novels of Dostoyevsky, Hermann Hesse and the Brazilian modernist Monteiro Lobato. In college — she was admitted to the University of Brazil’s law school after scoring fourth place on the national exam — she began to read the work of the Jewish mystical philosopher Baruch Spinoza, who became a lifelong influence.
Her first short story, “O Triunfo” (“Triumph”), was published in Pan magazine in 1940, the same year her father died of complications of a routine gall bladder surgery.
“Near to the Wild Heart” (1943), which is peppered with long Spinoza quotations, was an immediate sensation, winning prizes and drawing comparisons to James Joyce — an author Lispector had not yet read — and other modernists. In a newspaper review, the poet Lêdo Ivo called the book “the greatest novel a woman has ever written in the Portuguese language.” “Hurricane Clarice,” declared the writer Francisco de Assis Barbosa on reading the book.
Amid the attention Lispector left Brazil, having graduated from law school in 1944 and marrying a classmate, Maury Gurgel Valente, who became a diplomat. She spent the next 15 years moving across Europe and to Washington with him. The couple had two sons, Pedro and Paulo.
Far from Brazil, Lispector fell into obscurity, though she continued to write, producing the linguistically complex novels “O Lustre” (“The Chandelier)” in 1946 and “A Cidade Sitiada” (“The Besieged City”) in 1949.
She and her husband separated in 1959, and she returned to Rio de Janeiro, where she rented an apartment in the chic seaside neighborhood of Leme and took up writing newspaper columns, occasionally under pseudonyms. Helen Palmer, for instance, offered cosmetic and life advice. (Lispector was secretly paid by Pond’s, the American beauty brand, according to Benjamin Moser, whose 2009 biography of Lispector, “Why This World,” spurred a new round of English translations and fascination with her work outside Brazil.)
Lispector soon returned to fame under her own name. Her collection of short stories, “Laços de Familia” (“Family Ties”), published in 1960, was a bestseller in Brazil. The 1961 novel “A Maça No Escuro” (“Apple in the Dark”) , which was told from the point of view of a man who had just killed his wife, was translated into English by the renowned Gregory Rabassa and published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1967.
Rabassa recalled in a memoir that Lispector “looked like Marlene Dietrich and wrote like Virginia Woolf”— a comment Lispector found sexist, though it was echoed by many of her male critics and admirers.
“I don’t like when they say that I have an affinity with Virginia Woolf,” Lispector wrote in one column, adding that she had encountered Woolf’s work only after her own first novel was published. “I don’t want to forgive her for committing suicide. The terrible duty is to go to the end.”
A burst of creativity followed in her later years, including what is considered her masterpiece, “O Paixao Segundo G.H.” (“The Passion According to G.H.”), published in 1964. In the novel, a nameless woman recounts entering her maid’s empty bedroom, where she finds little more than a mysterious drawing and a single cockroach.
“It’s changed everything I’ve written since reading it,” Idra Novey, who translated the book for New Directions in 2012, said in a phone interview. “I felt this urgency to continue the questions that drive that novel, having seen them in the deepest way as a translator.”
A fire in Lispector’s apartment in 1966 nearly killed her, and an increased dependence on sleeping pills made her behavior increasingly erratic. She denounced the press for portraying her as eccentric — as a “sacred monster,” as she put it. And yet she helped secure that reputation when she accepted an invitation in 1975 to appear at the First World Congress of Sorcery in Colombia.
“Be careful with Clarice,” the Brazilian author Otto Lara Resende wrote in a letter to Claire Varin, a French Canadian researcher who began writing about Lispector in the 1980s. “It’s not literature. It’s witchcraft.”
Still, she continued to receive admiring letters from readers across Brazil.
“When I don’t write,” Lispector told an interviewer in her sole television appearance, in 1977, “I am dead.” When the interviewer proposed that the author could be reborn in a new book, Lispector demurred, saying: “For the moment I’m dead. I’m speaking from my tomb.”
Later that year, she suffered a hemorrhage and was said to have confronted a nurse in a Rio de Janeiro hospital, yelling, “You killed my character!” She died on Dec. 9, 1977, at 56.
When she was about 42, Lispector went to Warsaw — the closest she had come to her birthplace since her infancy. She recounted the trip in a newspaper column nearly a decade later. As she stood alone on a balcony, “a large black forest movingly pointed the way to Ukraine,” she wrote. “I felt the plea. But I belong to Brazil.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Donald J. Trump will exit the White House as a private citizen next month perched atop a pile of campaign cash unheard-of for an outgoing president, and with few legal limits on how he can spend it.
Deflated by a loss he has yet to acknowledge, Trump has cushioned the blow by coaxing huge sums of money from his loyal supporters — often under dubious pretenses — raising roughly $250 million since Election Day along with the national party.
More than $60 million of that sum has gone to a new political action committee, according to people familiar with the matter, which Trump will control after he leaves office. Those funds, which far exceed what previous outgoing presidents had at their disposal, provide him with tremendous flexibility for his post-presidential ambitions: He could use the money to quell rebel factions within the party, reward loyalists, fund his travels and rallies, hire staff, pay legal bills and even lay the groundwork for a far-from-certain 2024 run.
The postelection blitz of fundraising has cemented Trump’s position as an unrivaled force and the preeminent fundraiser of the Republican Party, even in defeat. His largest single day for online donations actually came after Election Day — raising almost $750,000 per hour Nov. 6. So did his second-biggest day. And his third.
“Right now, he is the Republican Party,” said John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster who worked on Trump’s reelection campaign. “The party knows that virtually every dollar they’ve raised in the last four years, it’s because of Donald Trump.”
Trump has long acted with few inhibitions when it comes to spending other people’s money, and he has spent millions of campaign dollars on his own family businesses in the last five years. But new records show an even more intricate intermingling of Trump’s political and familial interests than was previously known.
Lara Trump, Trump’s daughter-in-law and a senior campaign adviser, served on the board — and was named on drafts of the incorporation papers — of a limited liability company through which the Trump political operation spent more than $700 million since 2019, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.
The arrangement has never been disclosed. One of the other board members and signatories in the draft papers of the LLC, American Made Media Consultants, was John Pence, the nephew of Vice President Mike Pence and a senior Trump adviser. The LLC has been criticized for purposefully obscuring the ultimate destination of hundreds of millions of dollars of spending.
Lara Trump and John Pence were originally listed as president and vice president on the incorporation papers, documents reviewed by the Times showed. Sean Dollman, the campaign chief financial officer, was the AMMC treasurer.
“Lara Trump and John Pence resigned from the AMMC board in October 2019 to focus solely on their campaign activities; however, there was never any ethical or legal reason why they could not serve on the board in the first place,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesperson for Trump. “John and Lara were not compensated by AMMC for their service as board members.” Murtaugh also said the two were not compensated for other positions they were listed as holding.
For Trump, the quarter-billion dollars he and the party raised over six weeks is enough to pay off all of his remaining campaign bills and to fund his fruitless legal challenges and still leave tens of millions of dollars.
Trump’s plans, however, remain extremely fluid. His refusal to accept Joe Biden’s victory has stunted internal political planning, aides say, with some advisers in his shrinking circle of confidants hesitant to even approach him about setting a course of action for 2021 and beyond.
Those who have spoken with Trump say he appears shrunken, and over his job; this detachment is reflected in a Twitter feed that remains stubbornly more focused on unfounded allegations of fraud than on the death toll from the raging pandemic.
Trump has talked about running again in 2024 — but he also may not. He has created this new PAC, but a different political entity could still be in the works, people involved in the discussions said. Talk of counterprogramming Biden’s inauguration with a splashy event or an announcement of his own is currently on hold.
Trump had been tentatively planning to go to Georgia on Saturday, according to a senior Republican official, to support the two Republicans in Senate runoff races there. But he is still angry at the state’s Republican governor and secretary of state for accepting the election result and simply doesn’t want to make the trip. There is some discussion about him going after the Christmas holiday, but it’s not clear he will be in a more magnanimous mood by then.
But even as he displays indifference toward the Georgia races, the Trump political apparatus has taken advantage of the grassroots energy and excitement over the two runoffs to juice its own fundraising. Email and text solicitations have pitched Trump supporters to give to a “Georgia Election Fund,” even though no funds go directly to either Republican senator on the ballot, irritating some Senate GOP strategists.
Instead, the fine print shows 75% of the donations to the Georgia fund go to Trump’s new PAC, called Save America, with 25% to the Republican National Committee.
After weeks of shouting “FRAUD” to supporters in emails and asking them to back an “Election Defense Fund” (which also sent 75% of donations to his new PAC), the Trump operation has subtly shifted its tone and focus, returning to more sustainable preelection themes, like hawking signed hats and opposing socialism.
Trump and the RNC did spend about $15 million combined in legal costs and other spending related to disputing the election between Oct. 15 and Nov. 23, according to federal records.
Besides a $3 million payment to Wisconsin to fund a partial recount in the state, Trump’s largest recount-related payment did not go to attorney fees but to American Made Media Consultants, the Trump-linked LLC on which Lara Trump was listed an original signatory. The firm received $2.2 million Nov. 12 in two payments labeled “SMS advertising,” better known as text messaging.
American Made Media Consultants was the subject of a complaint to the Federal Election Commission earlier this year that accused it of “laundering” funds to obscure the ultimate beneficiary of Trump campaign spending. Federal records show the firm had more than $700 million in funds flow through it since 2019. The vast majority of funds were spent before Lara Trump resigned from the board.
For a sense of scale of just how much money Donald Trump will have at his disposal, the new Trump PAC’s $60 million-plus haul — and counting — is about as much money as he spent to win his party’s presidential nomination in 2016.
Some campaign finance experts have speculated that Trump might try to use the excess of cash in his new PAC, formally known as a leadership PAC, to pay for his own personal future legal quagmires as he faces investigations once he leaves office. (A senior Trump adviser said they don’t expect the money to be used for personal legal needs.)
“A leadership PAC is a slush fund,” said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, a group that supports increased political transparency. “There are very, very, very few limits on what he can’t spend money on.”
In the last five years, Trump has never shied from spending hundreds of thousands of dollars from his contributors on his private businesses, a practice he could continue or expand while out of office.
Just since mid-October, the Trump Victory Committee, a joint account operated with the RNC, has paid more than $710,000 to the Trump Hotel Collection, while his reelection account has continued to pay more than $37,000 per month to rent space in Trump Tower.
It is not clear where his post-presidential operation will be based or who will run it, although several advisers expect it will be in Florida, where he is planning to move.
But as a former president, Trump will be allocated a certain amount of taxpayer money for staff and office space for life after leaving the White House, and he is beginning to have discussions about which aides from the West Wing will accompany him.
His senior political advisers — Bill Stepien, Justin Clark and Jason Miller, among others — are among those who may stay involved with him politically.
While Trump’s post-presidency remains largely shapeless, he has demonstrated his desire to exert his control on national politics, especially among Republicans.
He has already endorsed Ronna McDaniel, a close ally, to serve another term as chair of the RNC. He has floated primary challenges to Republicans, such as Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, who have crossed him by rejecting his baseless theories of election fraud. He has even asked aides how he can retain control of the party if he isn’t a candidate.
One person close to Trump said that he has sounded less certain about declaring he’s running in 2024 than he had just two weeks ago. That uncertainty is causing anxiety for a number of advisers and aides to the president, some of whom might join other campaigns but are stuck in limbo until Trump makes up his mind. Announcing for president would trigger tighter rules on Trump’s political spending and added financial disclosures, including of Trump’s personal finances, that simply operating a PAC would not.
Trump’s future ambitions have also created a cloud over who exactly will control some of the most valuable assets from the 2020 campaign, including Trump’s lengthy list of supporters from whom he has raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Both the RNC and Trump are entitled to some of this valuable voter data, and efforts at “decoupling” the data are underway but expected to last months.
The RNC has typically stayed out of presidential primaries, but no former president in the modern era has seriously considered running again after losing reelection, putting the party apparatus in uncharted territory. His embrace of McDaniel as an ally in running the party could further complicate matters.
“There’s no bully pulpit as large as the presidency, but nevertheless, President Trump is likely to play a significant role in the future of the Republican Party,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. “It’s very difficult to imagine him following the same pattern as George W. Bush, Barack Obama and other presidents have followed in keeping their mouths shut and letting the new president try to govern.”

Tariffs, Traffic and Red Tape. What a ‘No-Deal’ Brexit Could Mean for Britain.

LONDON — In recent days, negotiators have seemed tantalizingly close to striking a post-Brexit trade deal between Britain and the European Union. But time is running out, with just two weeks until the Dec. 31 deadline when Britain withdraws from the EU’s economic zone, the single market and customs union.
That could mean heavy new taxes on traded goods, gridlocked ports and some types of food disappearing from British supermarket shelves, as well as conflict over fishing rights.
The trading arrangement between the two sides would default to World Trade Organization rules, and deliver a huge hit to businesses on both sides of the English Channel, but particularly in Britain. Here’s why the negotiators talk about a “moment of truth” in the efforts to avoid a chaotic final chapter to the Brexit saga.
Q: How bad could "no deal" be?
A: Quite bad. Britain has spent decades integrating its economy with continental Europe, and companies import and export goods freely without paying taxes — known as tariffs. That would change if a trade deal was not reached, with tariffs applied to a range of goods crossing the border. Cars, for example, would attract tariffs of 10%. Farmers could be hit, too. The average tariff on lamb meat is 48% — threatening some exporters with ruin, and dairy items would be subject to tariffs of about 35% .
The other big risk is of extra bureaucracy clogging ports. Some of this is inevitable on Jan. 1 — with or without a trade deal — because checks will increase, and traders will have to complete millions of customs declarations they did not have to before. But no deal would worsen this and, if ports jam on one side of the English Channel, trucks get stranded on both. Under what the government calls a “reasonable worst-case scenario,” up to 7,000 vehicles could stack up on the motorways with delays of up to two days. In Kent, in southern England, a 27-acre site is being built to handle idling trucks, and other contingency plans include one to deploy portable toilets for stranded drivers.
Q: OK, so it’s bad news if you are a farmer, automaker or truck driver, but what about other people?
A: About a quarter of all food eaten in Britain is produced in the EU, and disruption would come at a time when, because it’s winter, fruit and vegetable imports are high. Food prices would likely rise, and one supermarket chain has estimated that tariffs could increase overall British food bills by 3% to 5%. There could also be shortages of some, mostly perishable, products. The supply of others could be hit, too, including some medicines, though the government says it has contingency plans to use a variety of different ports and also fly supplies in, including COVID-19 vaccines.
Q: Surely all this would hurt the Europeans, too?
A: That’s correct, and Britain would raise money in tariffs because it imports more goods than it exports to the EU. (In 2019, it recorded an overall trade deficit with the bloc of 79 billion pounds, or about $105 billion.) The problem is that the EU is Britain’s biggest trade partner and accounts for 43% of its exports. No one single EU nation would be hurt so badly by no deal, with the exception of Ireland. One official estimate suggests that the lack of a trade deal would take an extra 2% off Britain’s economic output and drive up inflation, unemployment and public borrowing.
Q: Would the planes keep flying?
A: A basic agreement to keep planes flying and the Channel Tunnel train running is likely. The European Commission has announced contingency plans to maintain aviation safety arrangements to avoid grounding aircraft, and to keep road freight and passenger transit links open for six months. This would have to be reciprocal, however, and European road freight rules come with some “fair competition” conditions that Britain might not accept. The EU side has also proposed keeping fishing rights the same for a year, with European boats allowed to keep plying British waters, although Britain has rejected that idea.
Q: Speaking of fishing, what would the situation be there?
A: A big mess. With no agreement in place, French, Dutch and Belgian boats would lose access to British waters, where they have fished for decades (or in some cases centuries). That could lead to confrontations at sea, and Britain has put four naval vessels on standby to protect its waters. But there could be big problems for British fish exporters selling into the lucrative continental market, and French fishing vessels could disrupt trade by blockading ports.
Q: Any other problems?
A: Plenty. There would be less cooperation on security and data sharing, and Britain would lose its current swift access to European databases on criminal records and fingerprints. Nor would Britain be likely to get much cooperation over the rules under which its financial services industry can trade on the continent. And there would be no prospect of Britons keeping free health care in the EU or enjoying student exchange programs. But the rights of European citizens already in Britain to stay (and vice versa) are guaranteed under a Brexit withdrawal agreement. The agreement also set rules to avoid a hard border in Ireland and Britain has dropped a threat to break parts of this treaty.
Q: Having looked over the no-deal abyss, can negotiators reach an agreement?
A: Though most of the issues have been resolved, there is no certainty that an agreement will be struck before the deadline. But, given the issues at stake, analysts do not see no deal as a durable solution. Britain is the smaller party in this trade negotiation, but its economy is large and it is right on the doorstep of the EU. At some point, the two sides will have to reach agreements not just on trade but on everything from fisheries to financial services. The question is whether this happens before or after a New Year Brexit crisis.

The pandemic has been a boon to retail alcohol sales of all kinds. Beer sales are up, as are those of wine and vodka. Even the lowly vermouth — the anonymous mixer that blends with the name-brand spirits in martinis and Manhattans — has seen a spike in business as consumers substitute drinking at home for visits to local bars or restaurants.
What has also changed in the pandemic is consumers’ choice of libations: They’re drinking more expensive bottles.
“A trend we see is an accelerated rate of buying premium brands,” said Danelle Kosmal, vice president of beverages and alcohol at research firm Nielsen. “Consumers are trading up and spending more, and it’s a trend that’s been accelerated since the pandemic started.”
Sales of wines, for instance, dipped in the first quarter, before the pandemic. But they are now selling at a brisk rate, making up for the slower months, according to SipSource, which collects data from wine and spirits distributors. And sales of premium wines during the post-pandemic period have grown more than other categories.
“The higher end wines are doing better than the lower end wines,” said Peter Mondavi Jr., a third-generation owner of the Charles Krug winery in Napa Valley. “People are buying and consuming them. It’s rather amazing in this environment.”
He said that in previous economic contractions, particularly when unemployment was high, his winery had seen the opposite.
“During a traditional recession, which this is not, people do buy down,” Mondavi said. “They abandon the higher-end category. Whatever price they’re customarily buying at, they go down to the next rung or two on price. This is not a traditional recession. Those who have the money are still buying up.”
The difference this time is that the people who are still employed are not spending money elsewhere. They’re not traveling and not going out to dinner. Instead, they’re looking to buy something that will make yet another dinner at home more interesting. And because they’re not paying the markups that bars and restaurants usually charge, they can afford higher quality bottles.
“People who are still working have more disposable income because they can’t stop at happy hour, they can’t go to expensive restaurants, and they can’t travel, so they’re more likely to splurge when they buy their next bottle of wine,” Kosmal said. “A bottle of wine can cost half the amount at home from what it is in a restaurant.”
But are people drinking more overall? That’s not clear. They’re certainly drinking more at home. “At the end of February, 14.8% of all wine volume was sold through a restaurant or a bar,” said Dale Stratton, an analyst at SipSource. “By the end of this year, that number is likely to be about 7%. That 14.8% number is normally a wildly solid number.”
Kosmal at Nielsen said that sales volume would be higher if people were drinking as much as they did when restaurants and bars were open. She calculated that sales would have to increase by 22% in retail channels to match the amount from when people were going out to eat and drink.
Only spirits — led by vodka — have surpassed their pre-pandemic volume, with overall retail sales up 24% since March. Retail sales of wine are up 16.6% since the lockdown and 13.4% for beer.
As part of the trend toward buying more premium wines and spirits, consumers’ interest in learning more about these products, particularly fine wine, has increased, said Austin Walsh, vice president of Cult Wines North America, which advises on fine wine investments.
“Throughout these difficult months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in demand for education,” he said. “People are exploring their passions more. They have more time on their hands.”
That interest plays into the move by several top California vineyards to release older vintages from their own wine cellars this year.
These library, or cave, releases are a relatively new way for vineyards to show skeptical collectors, and high-end drinkers, that their wines age well, a claim that they have been making for years but that hasn’t been as readily accepted as it is in Bordeaux, which has centuries of winemaking behind it.
And buying an older California vintage — instead of pulling it out of your wine cellar at home — does not cost that much more than a newer vintage. Quintessa, a winery in Napa Valley, is selling its first “decade release” this year, at $250 a bottle. The cost of a 2017 bottle from this year’s new release — it takes three years for its wines to be ready — is $200.
“There’s a lot of speculation about the potentiality of California wines to age,” said Rodrigo Soto, estate director at Quintessa. “When you prove it and do something like we’re doing, with a decade release, we’re saying we did it, and we want to show it to you.”
It’s also a way for wine lovers to catch up on older vintages.
Charles Krug, among the oldest wineries in America, has been owned by a branch of the Mondavi family since the 1940s and has a vast collection of Vintage Select cabernets to rerelease, Mondavi said.
“We’re in a unique position where we can dig deep,” he said. The first library release was in 2018 to mark the family’s 75 years of owning the vineyard; it contained cabernets from 1974, 1991 and 2003 and cost $1,000. In comparison, this year’s vintage select costs $125.
The Far Niente winery has taken a more open approach to its cave collection. Every January, it announces what past vintages are still available. This year, it offered wines from 2011 to 2017, priced from $200 to $255.
Soto, of Quintessa, said the winery planned to release the current vintage as well as rerelease one from 2011.
“It was considered a very bad vintage, initially, because it rained so much that year,” he said. “You taste the wine today, and a lot of the elements that are rare to find in normal vintages in Napa are there. That only shows we know very little.”
What do buyers of these library wines do with them? Jim Blasingame, a small-business consultant and radio host in Florence, Alabama, has about 1,000 bottles of wine in his cellar. He joined Charles Krug’s library club about eight years ago and has often bought multiple three-bottle sets in a year. The prices have ranged from $800 to $1,000 per set.
“A few years ago, I got a ’79, an ’89 and a ’99 cabernet,” Blasingame said. “I drink some of it, but I give some of it to my customers. I like to send them something they might not get otherwise.”
Brian Devine, a former chief executive of Petco, said he had been collecting French and California wines since the 1970s, when he worked for Toys R Us in Northern California. His personal collection includes more than 10,000 bottles, with a mix of French wines from Bordeaux and Burgundy, as well as top California cabernets and pinot noirs.
He said he buys older wines at auction and through trusted wine retailers. But several years ago, he gained access to a group of vineyard owners in France and can now buy wine directly from the château.
“If the châteaus are offering wine that I don’t have, I’ll pay a little more to know that it’s sat in their cellar all these years,” Devine said.
The library offerings from West Coast wineries are a way for them to show that their wine can age well, too.
“Bordeaux wine has centuries of proof,” Walsh said. “People have been drinking these wines for hundreds of years, and we have a track record.”
But wine lovers need to be careful in their purchases. “With COVID, the market for rare wine has gone way up,” said David Parker, chief executive of Benchmark Wine Group, which specializes in old and rare wines. “Cabernets as a group have gone up probably faster than any others during the pandemic.”
But that surge should also give buyers pause, he said. “Just because it’s old doesn’t mean it’s good.”
Overpaying for a not-so-special wine would be just one more 2020 indignity.

As Stimulus Deal Takes Shape, Dispute Over Fed's Powers Is a Sticking Point

President-elect Joe Biden pushed back Friday on a Republican effort to use an emerging stimulus deal to bar the Federal Reserve from restarting a series of pandemic relief programs, weighing in on a last-minute dispute that was hampering final agreement on the $900 billion package.
The proposal, which would bar the central bank from reviving emergency lending efforts that expire at year’s end and potentially limit its ability to fight future financial crises, emerged Friday as perhaps the thorniest point of contention holding up the stimulus agreement. It could take away some of the Fed’s power as a “lender of last resort,” and curtail Biden’s latitude in dealing with the continuing economic fallout from the pandemic.
In a statement, Brian Deese, whom Biden has selected to chair the National Economic Council, argued that the measure “could put our future financial stability at risk.”
“The package should not include unnecessary provisions that would hamper the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve’s ability to fight economic crises,” Deese said. “As we navigate through an unprecedented economic crisis, it is in the interests of the American people to maintain the Fed’s ability to respond quickly and forcefully.”
With Congress running out of time to cement a stimulus compromise and avoid a government shutdown Friday, negotiators continued to work to find a resolution, although their wrangling could bleed into the weekend. Even if they were able to finalize the deal, a brief government shutdown was still possible if they failed to secure agreement on a temporary spending bill to keep the government funded past midnight while they drew up legislation and moved it to a vote.
Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, R-Pa., who was spearheading the effort to rein in the Fed, dismissed the Democrats’ criticism, arguing in a statement that his proposal “affects a very narrow universe of lending facilities and is emphatically not a broad overhaul of the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authority.”
A senior Democratic aide said that an agreement had been in sight before Toomey moved to insert a measure to bar a future Treasury secretary from restarting Fed emergency loan programs. The programs have kept credit flowing to medium-sized businesses, state and local governments and corporations amid the pandemic. Concern centered on the breadth of Toomey’s proposal: It would prohibit both those programs and any “similar” one, which could curb the Fed’s future ability to keep credit flowing to states and businesses.
The plan under discussion would provide a dose of badly needed relief after months of stalled negotiations and amid a national public health crisis that has killed more than 307,000 people.
That includes a new round of stimulus payments, probably $600, to American adults; a temporary infusion of enhanced federal jobless aid of around $300 per week; and rental and food assistance. It would also revive a loan program for struggling small businesses and provide funding for schools, hospitals and the distribution of the vaccine.

‘Misinformation’ and the 2020 vote

Resumen: Looking at reporting and discussion of the 2020 presidential campaign, has any word been misused as often as "misinformation"? "Majorities of those who say they were exposed to misinformation this election year believe they were exposed to it on social media and cable TV news," the study says. Forty-four percent of Democrats said "misinformation" came from cable TV news — by that, they mostly meant Fox News — while a larger number, 77%, of Republicans pointed to cable TV as the source of "misinformation."

Texto completo: Looking at reporting and discussion of the 2020 presidential campaign, has any word been misused as often as "misinformation"? In much political debate, it was used to mean "information I don’t like," rather than something that was provably false. That confusion extends to a new survey of American attitudes done by Gallup and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The survey questioned 2,752 respondents and was conducted in mid-November.
Gallup found that 64% of Americans believe they were subjected to more "misinformation" in the 2020 campaign than in earlier campaigns. That number included 52% of Democrats, 66% of independents and 79% of Republicans. "Majorities of those who say they were exposed to misinformation this election year believe they were exposed to it on social media and cable TV news," the study says.
"This finding is in light of the fact that major internet companies handled misinformation differently in the run-up to the election and afterward by enacting measures to label false information — something they largely did not do before this year."
The surveyors found some common ground between the political parties but also major differences. Start with where people believe "misinformation" is coming from. Gallup asked, "Where do you think you were exposed to misinformation about the election this year?" Everyone — Democrats, independents, Republicans — pointed to Facebook. But Facebook was mostly an aggregator of other media reports. And there were big differences between the parties about the original sources of "misinformation."
Forty-four percent of Democrats said "misinformation" came from cable TV news — by that, they mostly meant Fox News — while a larger number, 77%, of Republicans pointed to cable TV as the source of "misinformation." By that, they meant CNN and MSNBC. When it comes to traditional broadcast news — ABC/CBS/NBC — only 21% of Democrats saw that as a source of "misinformation," while 81% of Republicans did. That’s a big difference.
And then there were the national newspapers. Only 10% of Democrats pointed to the big papers — The New York Times and The Washington Post — as sources of "misinformation," while 57% of Republicans did.
The results are clear: Democrats believe "misinformation" is coming from the deepest recesses of Facebook and Twitter, with an assist from Fox News, while Republicans believe it is coming from ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, The Washington Post and The New York Times.
There’s more. Remember how Facebook and Twitter clamped down on the Hunter Biden laptop story? Twitter even shut down the New York Post’s account. What about that? Was that "misinformation"? It appears the Biden material that was published was accurate, even though Democrats and their allies in the media did not want to see it.
Gallup’s question related to internet censorship produced the most striking party disparity in the entire poll.
The first problem was the question: "Do you think major internet companies went too far, were about right, or did not go far enough in trying to prevent the spread of false information about the election on their websites and apps?" The problem here was the phrase "false information." Were the emails on the Hunter Biden laptop "false information"? Certainly not the parts that were verified by some recipients and are currently the subject of a federal criminal investigation. So it is entirely reasonable to think that the big social media companies clamped down on accurate information in the Hunter Biden case.
Nevertheless, in response to Gallup’s question, just 2% of Democrats said the social media companies went too far, while 66% of Republicans said they went too far. That is a huge, huge difference. On the other end, 60% of Democrats said the companies did not go far enough, while just 23% of Republicans said they did not go far enough.
Those two numbers undoubtedly reflect different things. Democrats would have been happy had there never been any mention of Hunter Biden at all — that’s their idea of "misinformation." But Republicans have seen four years of false reports about President Trump colluding with Russia, about him being a Russian asset, about a pee tape and a dossier and much, much more. They’ve seen "misinformation" in all of those news sources — ABC/CBS/CNN/MSNBC/NBC/WashingtonPost/NewYorkTimes — that Democrats trust. The new poll tells us a little about American attitudes toward the media and "misinformation." But it tells us a lot about Republicans and Democrats and their dramatically divergent conceptions of what "misinformation" is.

The results are clear: Democrats believe "misinformation" is coming from the deepest recesses of Facebook and Twitter, with an assist from Fox News, while Republicans believe it is coming from ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, The Washington Post and The New York Times.
There’s more. Remember how Facebook and Twitter clamped down on the Hunter Biden laptop story? Twitter even shut down the New York Post’s account. What about that? Was that "misinformation"? It appears the Biden material that was published was accurate, even though Democrats and their allies in the media did not want to see it.
Gallup’s question related to internet censorship produced the most striking party disparity in the entire poll.
The first problem was the question: "Do you think major internet companies went too far, were about right, or did not go far enough in trying to prevent the spread of false information about the election on their websites and apps?" The problem here was the phrase "false information." Were the emails on the Hunter Biden laptop "false information"? Certainly not the parts that were verified by some recipients and are currently the subject of a federal criminal investigation. So it is entirely reasonable to think that the big social media companies clamped down on accurate information in the Hunter Biden case.
Nevertheless, in response to Gallup’s question, just 2% of Democrats said the social media companies went too far, while 66% of Republicans said they went too far. That is a huge, huge difference. On the other end, 60% of Democrats said the companies did not go far enough, while just 23% of Republicans said they did not go far enough.
Those two numbers undoubtedly reflect different things. Democrats would have been happy had there never been any mention of Hunter Biden at all — that’s their idea of "misinformation." But Republicans have seen four years of false reports about President Trump colluding with Russia, about him being a Russian asset, about a pee tape and a dossier and much, much more. They’ve seen "misinformation" in all of those news sources — ABC/CBS/CNN/MSNBC/NBC/WashingtonPost/NewYorkTimes — that Democrats trust. The new poll tells us a little about American attitudes toward the media and "misinformation." But it tells us a lot about Republicans and Democrats and their dramatically divergent conceptions of what "misinformation" is.

‘Misinformation’ and the vote

Resumen: Looking at reporting and discussion of the 2020 presidential campaign, has any word been misused as often as "misinformation"? "Majorities of those who say they were exposed to misinformation this election year believe they were exposed to it on social media and cable TV news," the study says. Forty-four percent of Democrats said "misinformation" came from cable TV news — by that, they mostly meant Fox News — while a larger number, 77%, of Republicans pointed to cable TV as the source of "misinformation."

Texto completo: Looking at reporting and discussion of the 2020 presidential campaign, has any word been misused as often as "misinformation"? In much political debate, it was used to mean "information I don’t like," rather than something that was provably false. That confusion extends to a new survey of American attitudes done by Gallup and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The survey questioned 2,752 respondents and was conducted in mid-November.
Gallup found that 64% of Americans believe they were subjected to more "misinformation" in the 2020 campaign than in earlier campaigns. That number included 52% of Democrats, 66% of independents and 79% of Republicans. "Majorities of those who say they were exposed to misinformation this election year believe they were exposed to it on social media and cable TV news," the study says.
"This finding is in light of the fact that major internet companies handled misinformation differently in the run-up to the election and afterward by enacting measures to label false information — something they largely did not do before this year."
The surveyors found some common ground between the political parties but also major differences. Start with where people believe "misinformation" is coming from. Gallup asked, "Where do you think you were exposed to misinformation about the election this year?" Everyone — Democrats, independents, Republicans — pointed to Facebook. But Facebook was mostly an aggregator of other media reports. And there were big differences between the parties about the original sources of "misinformation."
Forty-four percent of Democrats said "misinformation" came from cable TV news — by that, they mostly meant Fox News — while a larger number, 77%, of Republicans pointed to cable TV as the source of "misinformation." By that, they meant CNN and MSNBC. When it comes to traditional broadcast news — ABC/CBS/NBC — only 21% of Democrats saw that as a source of "misinformation," while 81% of Republicans did. That’s a big difference.
And then there were the national newspapers. Only 10% of Democrats pointed to the big papers — The New York Times and The Washington Post — as sources of "misinformation," while 57% of Republicans did.

Texto completo: Few authors have had a better shake at the movies than John le Carré, whose sophisticated novels of Cold War atmosphere, moral ambiguities and wryly observed backroom machinations have long attracted talented filmmakers and leading actors.
While Alec Guinness' definitive performance as George Smiley in the BBC miniseries versions of "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" (1979) and "Smiley's People" (1982) are currently not available to stream in the U.S., there's still a range of quality le Carré adaptations to sample over a half-century stretch.
Some go inside the not-so-fashionable lives of British agents while others follow outsiders -- a bureaucrat, a hotel manager, an actress -- as they're brought into new worlds of intrigue and danger. These seven films and two miniseries give the flavor of le Carré's uniquely jaundiced take on the spy thriller genre.

'The Spy Who Came in From the Cold' (1965)
The first le Carré adaptation in any medium set the tone for the others that followed, establishing the spy game not as a life of glamour and adventure, but as a world blanketed by paranoia and suspicion, populated by world-weary men with inscrutable motives. Photographed in a perpetually gloomy black-and-white, the film casts Richard Burton as a British agent who works an elaborate ruse in the wake of an operative's shooting death by East German troops. Showing outward appearances of displeasure with his station, including a fake demotion to desk duty in London, he makes himself the target of East German agents, who believe, falsely, they have a defector to turn.
Stream it on Amazon Prime. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.

'The Deadly Affair' (1967)
Based on le Carré's first novel "Call for the Dead," Sidney Lumet's thriller doesn't articulate the international intrigue of the author's work as well as later adaptations, but it's notable for how thoroughly it undercuts any fantastical notions of what it's like to be a spy. Though rights issues kept the studio from using the name George Smiley, James Mason plays the same character as a dreary cuckold whose wife (Harriet Andersson) hates him and whose job satisfaction is hitting rock bottom. When a former Communist seems to kill himself the day after their pleasant meeting in a park, he suspects foul play, turning his attention to the late man's widow (Simone Signoret), who doesn't appear to be telling him the truth. Quincy Jones did the lively score.
Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.

'The Russia House' (1990)
From the beginning, le Carré adaptations have always been an implicit rebuke to the James Bond series, which may have been part of their appeal to ex-Bonds like Sean Connery, who were given opportunities to summon gravitas that 007 didn't require. Connery doesn't play a spy by trade in "The Russia House" but an expatriate British book publisher who's brought in by British intelligence to investigate three notebooks containing Russian military secrets. The cast is loaded with character actors like J.T. Walsh, John Mahoney, Klaus Maria Brandauer and a particularly witty James Fox, but it is Connery's romantic chemistry with Michelle Pfeiffer, as a Russian feeding him information, that sets the film apart.
Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV and Vudu.

'The Tailor of Panama' (2001)
A year before ending his own run as James Bond, Pierce Brosnan allowed himself and the series to be subtly lampooned in "The Tailor of Panama," which supplies him with the same double entendres and ostentatious good looks, but undercuts his suave image to comical effect. Banished to Panama City for womanizing and other indulgences, Brosnan's British agent finds himself at home in a "Casablanca without heroes," where he's supposed to keep the Panama Canal from falling into the wrong hands, but winds up deep in the city's corruption. With a half-lovable scoundrel for a hero, director John Boorman levels a sharp critique of British and American intervention in other countries.
Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.

'The Constant Gardener' (2005)
For his follow-up to "City of God," his electric treatment of organized crime in a Rio de Janeiro favela, director Fernando Meirelles looks again at the disadvantaged, but from the perspective of a midlevel British bureaucrat investigating Big Pharma's exploitation of poor people in Africa. The flashback structure of "The Constant Gardener" covers the before and after of an activist (Rachel Weisz) found murdered in remote Kenya. Her husband (Ralph Fiennes), who works for the British High Commission, initially accepts the official explanation for her death, but as he pokes into the cases further, he uncovers a plot by a pharmaceutical company to test an experimental drug on Africans at free treatment centers. The film is at once a widower's rumination of a difficult marriage and an angry critique of first-world schemes in third-world nations.
Stream it on Peacock. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.

'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' (2011)
In the role of George Smiley, the le Carré protagonist immortalized on-screen by Alec Guinness, Gary Oldman gives a performance so thoroughly internalized that he nearly disappears into the film's beige, smoky backdrops. As the film opens in the early 1970s, Smiley has spent a lifetime in British intelligence, but the death of a mentor (John Hurt) leads him into semiretirement. He soon reemerges as part of an effort to uncover a Soviet mole within MI6, which offers him a shot at redemption and a chance to summon his expertise at stamping out subtle threats in his midst. This version of "Tinker, Tailor" has some trouble condensing its labyrinthine plot, but as a mood piece, it captures le Carré's essence perfectly.
Stream it on Netflix. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.

'A Most Wanted Man' (2014)
With his last leading role before his death in 2014, Philip Seymour Hoffman carries an existential heaviness common to le Carré heroes who bring the tragic mistakes of the past into a dangerous new job. That heaviness is certainly not leavened by director Anton Corbijn, who follows up the Ian Curtis biopic "Control" and the spy thriller "The American" with another grim story, this one connected to the threat of Islamic terrorism. Working to overcome a botched operation in Beirut, Hoffman's German agent tries to recruit Muslim double agents in Hamburg to expose a moderate professor he suspects is laundering money to fund a terrorist operation. His mission is to make the world a safer place, but he worries that he's doing deeper harm.
Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.

'The Night Manager' (2016)
For this six-part series, written by the playwright and screenwriter David Farr and directed by Susanne Bier, le Carré's 1993 novel about the intrigue surrounding a luxurious hotel in Cairo has been updated to the year 2011, as protests raged against Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. Tom Hiddleston stars as a hotel manager who coolly reassures panicked guests seeking the next plane out of the country, but his access to the "worst man in the world," an arms dealer played by Hugh Laurie, brings him into a plot to infiltrate his inner circle. Adding to a triumvirate of excellent lead performances -- all three won Emmys -- Olivia Colman is the coolheaded task-force chief who serves as the manager's handler.
Stream it on Amazon Prime. Buy it on Apple TV and Vudu.

'The Little Drummer Girl' (2018)
A director known for the glossy exuberance of "Oldboy" and "The Handmaiden," Park Chan-wook seemed like a counterintuitive choice to unpack the internalized spy craft of a le Carré miniseries. But Park also specializes in the smooth orchestration of complicated plots and his stylistic brio pays off in both the show's cosmopolitan flair and its tense set pieces.
On the cusp of her breakthrough in "Midsommar" and "Little Women" the following year, Florence Pugh is terrific as a British actress in the late '70s who's recruited by a Mossad agent (Michael Shannon) to disrupt a Palestinian terrorist organization. It's the role of a lifetime, but it thrusts her into a world of danger and moral compromise.
Stream it on Sundance Now. Buy it on Apple TV, Amazon and Google Play.

Texto completo: Two Republican state lawmakers have condemned the use of "The 1619 Project" in an Arizona school district.
Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, and Rep. John Fillmore, R-Apache Junction, wrote in a statement that they are concerned that the Balsz School District plans to bring lessons from "The 1619 Project" to the classroom.
The project is a Pulitzer Prize-winning initiative from the New York Times that contextualizes America's founding and history by examining the impacts of slavery on the nation.
The lawmakers also condemned an effort by Arizona State University's Center for the Study of Race and Democracy to bring the project to other schools.
Earlier this month, Balsz Superintendent Arleen Kennedy told The Arizona Republic that the project would help present a more honest view of American history.
"This is the reality of what America is," she said. "And whenever you say that, people automatically go to the negative, and say, 'Well, you're calling America bad.' What we're doing is we're trying to put context to what it means to be American, make no bones about it."
Finchem and Fillmore also wrote letters to Kennedy and Arizona State University President Michael Crow.
District officials and a spokesperson for Crow did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Their letters call the project "dangerously anti-capitalist and pessimistic."
The lawmakers' statements questioned the historical veracity of the project but did not point out specific passages or portions found to be inaccurate. Their letters include a link to an opinion piece by The New York Post's editorial board criticizing the project.
Some historians have criticized parts of the project, questioning accuracy. Chief among the complaints is the assertion that the American Revolution was fought, in part, to protect the institution of slavery. The editor-in-chief of the New York Times Magazine defended the project, and that assertion, in an opinion piece.
"I am happy to respond to any assertion that is in that so-called curriculum that the school board and the university might think factual," Finchem wrote in the statement.

Charlie Warzel: I can’t stop watching vaccine videos

Texto completo: All I seem to want to do these days is stare mindlessly at health care workers and the elderly getting stuck in the arm with a needle.
Over the last week I’ve watched countless videos of men and women shoveling dry ice into packages. I’ve gawked at footage of masked individuals hauling boxes with fork lifts. I have become well acquainted with stock video of vial sorting and refrigeration systems. I’ve even watched mundane footage of FedEx planes touching down in the middle of the night at LAX simply because of the precious cargo they contain. Oh, and there’s also some good jokes. Despite a lifelong squeamishness toward syringes, I am addicted to coronavirus vaccine rollout content.
Across social media, I’ve seen testimonials of people who are also transfixed. On Twitter, a few people responded to me that they’ve found themselves getting surprisingly emotional at the sight of a governor signing for a vaccine delivery or nurses getting the shot.
I was a bit mystified by my infatuation until I realized that the vaccine videos are similar to another internet phenomenon: the unboxing video.
For roughly the last decade, unboxing videos have dominated platforms like YouTube, minting moderate fortunes for dedicated vloggers who simply record themselves — frequently from first-person perspective, showing only their hands — meticulously peeling back packaging and narrating what’s inside different boxes. The genre is versatile. Gadget unboxing is popular. Fashion influencers do it all the time with clothes or cosmetics. But unboxing videos are especially popular among small children who can’t seem to get enough of watching others soothingly open toys. (A video titled “Play Doh Sparkle Princess Ariel Elsa Anna Disney Frozen MagiClip Glitter Glider Dolls” uploaded in 2014 has nearly 600 million views on YouTube.)
Children are so drawn to the videos — which also function as algorithmic catnip on YouTube — that the unboxing genre has sparked plenty of confusion and consternation among parents. In 2014, the author Mireille Silcoff wrote in The Times Magazine that her child’s “obsession with these videos suggested to me some kind of deep neurological massaging, as if my child’s developing brain had a keyhole opening that lay in wait only for a faceless woman with a South American accent and brightly manicured nails removing letter-shaped Play-Doh molds from their packaging.”
Neurological massaging begins to describe the sensation that the vaccine “unboxing” videos provide nearly ten months into a pandemic that has killed over 300,000 Americans. The appeal isn’t hard to understand. Seeing the vaccine out in the world is the purest expression of hope — a signal that help is on the way and that our long global nightmare might be entering its final act.
But there’s something else there, too. There’s a transfixing quality to the videos of health care workers or politicians opening the cold storage packages of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. I’ve watched some of them multiple times, despite the fact that they are, in essence, boring.
“Unboxing videos, ultimately, are aspirational — they represent what people wish they had,” Caroline Knorr, parenting editor for Common Sense Media told Quartz’s Annabelle Timsit in 2018. There’s a vicarious joy with maybe just a hint of envy involved in observing. To watch a video of a gloved worker unpack vials of a lifesaving inoculation is to imagine having that wealth at your disposal, able to dish out to all your loved ones or anyone you’re worried about.
News organizations understand all this instinctively. Cable news segments about the vaccine almost all show footage of the vaccine being moved around the country with granular logistical details about the rollout, all of which seem to underscore that, yes, this is happening . Local news channels have their own spin on unboxing videos. “Vaccine delivery unboxing at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center,” is the title of one video by the Portland Press Herald. There are other clips from Iowa, Minnesota and my home state of Montana.
There’s likely another motivation behind the footage — one intended for those skeptical of or hesitant to take the vaccine. Those who’ve investigated the allure of unboxing videos argue that they appeal to consumers who might be wary of a new product. When an influencer unboxes a gadget or toy or new cosmetic, they are (often, quite literally) tearing through the company’s marketing gloss to reveal the real product. “It’s all very well saying that a laptop is amazing but I’m actually showing that laptop, and as a result I can be trusted a bit more,” the YouTuber behind the gadget reviewing account, Geek Street said in a 2018 interview about the unboxing phenomenon. Google, which owns YouTube, reported in 2014 that “62 percent of people who view unboxing videos do so when researching a particular product” to buy.
If unboxing videos are a Consumer Reports-esque way of building trust, then it makes sense that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo staged his own unboxing video of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine earlier this month. For six minutes he channeled his inner YouTuber pulling apart and explaining the GPS tracking device and thermal monitors that help keep tabs on each package. He took out individual vials to show how each box can hold roughly 5,000 doses. The entire spectacle was intended “just to show you how real it is,” he said.
But for those of us eager to get stabbed and safely join the immunity herd, there’s no marketing happening, here. As Silcoff wrote in 2014, “these videos seem to come from a more snake-brained place.” Describing her own journey down the unboxing rabbit hole, she suggested that “the root of these videos’ gargantuan success could lie solely in the fact that it feels good to take the plastic off something unused.”
But just because it tickles the lizard brain doesn’t mean there isn’t something deeper, too. Watching the vaccine show up at hospitals or end its journey via rapid deposit into a fleshy patch of upper arm, I feel hope for the first time in a while. Unboxing, at its most elemental, has a hopeful quality to it. It’s exciting, new and full of possibility. Watching the beginning of the end of the pandemic, I am, for the first time, allowing myself to imagine those possibilities — and how good it will feel when we can finally take the plastic off our lives.

Texto completo: I was speaking recently to Matt Dunne, founder of the Center on Rural Innovation, which promotes digital economic development in small-town America, and he was telling me about a Vermont community near his home with a great public library: “You could drive by on any Sunday and the parking lot would be full,” he said. “There was just one problem: The library was closed on Sundays.”
The parking lot was full of cars with kids doing their homework and adults doing their office work — using the wireless connectivity spilling out of the empty building because their rural homes lacked high-speed broadband. Alas, stories abound of rural Americans going to Subway sandwich shops and Dairy Queens in search of free Wi-Fi.
And that is why I want to talk today about Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
Harris is too smart and energetic to be just the vice president, a position with few official responsibilities. I’d love to see President-elect Joe Biden give her a more important job: his de facto secretary of rural development, in charge of closing the opportunity gap, the connectivity gap, the learning gap, the startup gap — and the anger and alienation gap — between rural America and the rest of the country.
President Donald Trump feasted off those gaps in our last two presidential elections to dominate Democrats in rural America. Putting Harris in charge of fixing them would be a real statement by the Biden team.
It would provide a vision for American renewal and signal that Democrats were no longer going to cede rural America to Republicans but were instead going to seize it from them. And it would make Harris a super-relevant vice president from Day 1.
Democrats must not kid themselves. Biden won this election by narrowly winning the suburbs and urban centers in key battleground states, where just enough people decided that they wanted to “de-Trump” the White House but not “defund” the police.
That is, a lot of suburban voters rejected Trump personally but also rejected far-left Democratic ideas that had percolated up in the past few years. Democrats won the presidency but took a beating from those same suburban voters in many statehouse, U.S. House and U.S. Senate races.
If Democrats go into 2022 — let alone 2024 — appealing only on the cities and suburbs, they’re crazy. They will be highly vulnerable if the GOP is led by a smarter, less offensive populist than Donald Trump.
Most important, lifting rural America is the right thing to do for all of America and fulfills Biden’s vision of a nation that “grows together” in every way.
That concept remains in the DNA of the Democratic Party, which in my home state, Minnesota, is still known as the “DFL” — the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. The party needs to reconstitute that coalition.
“One way to do that is by reconnecting with its populist roots — when it really was a party focused on the empowerment of workers and farmers and ordinary citizens,” argued Harvard’s Michael Sandel, author of “The Tyranny of Merit: What’s Become of the Common Good?” “Trump gave populism a bad name. Democrats should provide an alternative to Trump’s xenophobic, plutocratic populism by showing how populism can be a source of civic activism, engagement and renewal across urban and rural America.”
That should be Harris’ mission, and it’s one worthy of a vice president. And it starts in rural America.
“I fear the word ‘rural’ connotes a geography that is not my problem,” Beth Ford, president of Land O’Lakes, the influential farmer-owned cooperative headquartered in Minnesota, said to me. But, in fact, spreading connectivity and technology to rural America “is an American issue, an American competitiveness issue and an American national security issue,” she argued.
Persistent “underinvestment in rural America will leave us less secure and less prosperous as a nation” — and less competitive with China, which is rapidly connecting its rural heartland, Ford said. “Some 35% of farmers lack enough bandwidth to run the equipment on their farms, ensure their kids get a good education and that Grandma has access to telemedicine.”
What should a Biden-Harris rural strategy look like? It would start with showing up regularly. “Showing up” and “just listening to people” with respect goes a long way in rural America, Emily Larson, the mayor of Duluth, Minnesota, told me. Actually, nothing earns more respect than listening to people respectfully.
“Rural areas have their own social networks,” Larson said, but they’re different from the metropolitan ones. “Here, people will show up for you in the middle of the night, but they don’t post about it on Facebook.”
On policy specifics, the Biden-Harris team should commit that in four years every rural community in America will have access to broadband — the basic infrastructure needed for an inclusive modern economy.
Dunne suggests a new federal loan program that would offer 50-year, no-interest loans to communities and co-ops (and ease regulations) so rural public-private coalitions can build broadband networks with a minimum 100 megabits per second of speed for downloading and uploading all kinds of remote learning tools, work tools and telehealth tools. Rep. James Clyburn has already won passage of a bill in the House with a similar approach.
Traveling with Dunne last year to Red Wing, Minnesota, to see how gigabit networks can support high-tech startups and traditional farmers, I wrote about a couple of inventors we met who had created a robotic rooster that patrols the poultry house for dead birds and tills the bedding, but with an unexpected byproduct: The birds exercise more and gain weight faster, because they are constantly running away from or pecking at the robot.
While these “Poultry Patrol” robots work autonomously 80% of the time, said Dunne, “there are significant periods when they need to be remotely operated and receive coding updates from afar, which is only possible with very fast broadband.”
But while better connectivity is necessary, it’s not sufficient. “We also need to ensure investment in digital skills training in rural communities and incentives for tech companies to hire remote workers in small towns,” added Dunne. “Today rural America represents 15% of the nation’s workforce, but only 5% of digital economy jobs of the future. But the pandemic has opened people’s eyes to the idea that digital economy jobs can be created anywhere.”
Kamala Harris is a natural for that task. Who better to bridge Silicon Valley and the rural valleys of America?
She is also a natural bridge builder to a more inclusive American heartland, because rural America is not white America. According to a report by the Urban Institute, “1 in 5 Americans lives in rural communities, and more than one in five (22%) rural residents are people of color.” I wrote last year about Willmar, Minnesota, a town that was all white back in the 1950s and today is nearly half Hispanic, Somali, Asian and Native American.
In Minnesota, small towns like Willmar that can manage inclusion and diversity are the ones now thriving, because they can attract new labor and homebuyers when so many of the young white adults have left for the big cities.
Harris will soon be the first woman, the first Black and the first Indian American vice president, which certainly resonates with a lot of urban voters. However, if she could make herself the person in the Biden cabinet who always shows up FIRST to listen in rural America and the FIRST to appreciate its concerns and the FIRST to make sure its concerns are addressed, she and the Democrats could make themselves competitive in a lot more rural counties.
Even if it is just 10 or 15% more competitive, it might be enough to deprive today’s deeply warped Trump-led GOP from taking back the White House or the House in the next four years — and maybe force it back to sanity. The Republican Party needs shock therapy, and nothing would shock this GOP more than losing its automatic hold on rural America.

Texto completo: Imagine this scene, which is a common experience for Black people:
You are receiving a service for which tipping is a customary practice. Maybe you’re taking a cab or receiving a beauty treatment; maybe having a drink at a bar or eating at a restaurant.
Your service provider is not Black. The service is poor. Your server is not at all attentive. You wait for things far longer than you believe you should or far longer than you believe others in the space are waiting.
Then comes the check, and you stare at the tip tray, and the internal debate rages.
Studies have shown that two things are true: Black people on average tip less, and servers on average provide Black people inferior service, in part because of the perception that they will tip less anyway. There has always seemed, to me, to be a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem here.
Nevertheless, you as the person who has just received the poor service finds yourself in the middle of this war of perception with only two options, both unappealing: You can tip well anyway in an attempt to fight the perception that Black people are poor tippers. (This, after all, could possibly make the service experience a little better for the next Black person.) Or you can leave an average tip — or no tip at all — in accordance with the poor service you have received, yet risk cementing, in the server’s mind, the perception of Black people poorly tipping.
None of this is fair of course. It shifts the burden of the servers’ biases onto the innocent recipient of the service. The victim of prejudgments assuming the responsibility of mollifying the persons prejudging.
And yet, that is the very same position that Black people — and other people of color, religious minorities and women — are often forced into or are asked to assume. This is particularly the case when the people who vote for politicians who would harm our humanity (or severely restrict our ability to pursue a life of equality) find themselves on the losing end of an election.
There is always so much talk of unity and coming together, of healing wounds and repairing divisions. We then have to have some version of the tip debate: Do we prove to them that we can rise above their attempt to harm us or do we behave in a way that is consummate with the harm they tried to inflict?
There is a legitimate argument to be made that a spiral of recriminations will always descend into a hole of collective harm. Still, there must also be an acknowledgment that the prejudiced were trying to harm you and that, but for a few hundred thousand votes in the right states, they would have succeeded in exacting that harm.
There has to be some acknowledgment that children were taken from their parents, some locked in cages, and that many may never be reunited with their parents again.
We have to acknowledge that Trump was a racist — something proven over and over again by his own words and actions — and that he still received a record number of votes for a sitting president anyway.
We have to acknowledge that he bragged about sexually assaulting women, had scores of women accuse him of sexual misconduct and was revealed to have paid off at least two women for their silence about alleged affairs.
We have to acknowledge that he has disparaged Mexicans, Muslims, Haitians and African nations.
These things happened. These people who supported him mostly knew these things happened. In many cases they heard Trump say them live on television or tweet them from his Twitter account.
And yet, his supporters still supported him. Many of them still do, even after his refutation of democracy. Many believe Trump’s lie that he actually won the election that he lost.
Joe Biden, as he has always said, is seeking to be a unifying president, to be the president of the people who didn’t vote for him as well as the ones who did. I want to have that same optimistic spirit, but I must admit that my attempts at it may falter.
I don’t want to be the person who holds a grudge, but I also don’t want to be the person who ignores a lesson. The act of remembering that so many Americans were willing to continue the harm to me and others and to the country itself isn’t spiteful but wise.
Next month Joe Biden will be sworn in, and the next chapter of America will begin. I plan to meet that day with the glow of optimism on my face, but I refuse to vanquish the shadow of remembrance falling behind me.

This year in sports was about fans tuning out athlete activism

Texto completo: The New York Times is trying to emphasize that this year in sports was all about social justice activism. But there is another important fact that can’t be separated from the political push: There were no fans.
The first New York Times piece is a recap of the year in sports, which claims that "this was the year of the bubble and of players forcefully demanding racial justice.” The piece runs through the list of pointless symbolic stands that athletes took, from soccer players putting “Black Lives Matter” on their jerseys to NBA players putting “Black Lives Matter” on their jerseys.
The second is an essay by Harvey Araton titled “A Year When Even Sports Wasn’t an Escape.” Araton similarly praises the mostly useless symbolic stands of athletes, hilariously claiming that the most risky was the notably left-wing WNBA campaigning against Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in Georgia.
The two pieces ignore the biggest problem with this year of activism, which is what effect, if any, it had on fans. After all, fans were banned from most games this season, and television ratings are down for sports across the board, thanks in part to the odd scheduling in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
But activism also played a role here. NBA ratings had already tanked in 2019 before the pandemic thanks to the political hypocrisy of players, and the effect was likely felt by the NFL, MLB, and NHL as they pandered to the activist class. When fans were allowed at games, they booed soccer players for protesting during the national anthem. Even the NFL’s opening night saw Kansas City Chiefs fans, in their first game since winning the Super Bowl, boo a faux show of unity.
It turns out that sports fans just want to watch sports without being lectured by millionaire athletes about how they are the problem. It turns out that people did, in fact, want an escape from the whole global pandemic that threw millions of people into unemployment and confined them to their homes for nine months (and counting).
While coaches, players, and their media allies all continue to push social justice politics in lockstep, fans have tuned them out. Their protests and sloganeering have predictably done nothing to solve the problems they allege have plagued the country. As the media continues to fawn over the bravery it takes to repeat corporate-approved talking points, no one at home is listening.

A compendium of ideas for the new administration

Texto completo: Upon winning the presidential election, it is customary for the president-elect to recruit the members of the cabinet as well as the heads of key federal programs and to publicize an agenda for the first hundred days after being sworn in. This agenda indicates the issues that are most important for the new administration.
With America ravaged by COVTD-19 because of Donald Trump's incompetence, Joe Biden is forced as a new president to focus primarily on developing a strategy to mitigate the pandemic's damage. So the New York Times has asked "top experts" to suggest the one idea that could "make the country a better place."
A review of the suggestions indicates that there is no single idea that can correct all of the nation's problems. It might be helpful for those interested in social change to review some of the proposed ideas by category:
Internet related
Marcelo Claure, the CEO of Soft-Bank Group International, would arrange for every American child to have access to an internet-enabled device as well as reliable internet access service. He points out that a study by the Pew Research Center in 2018 found a great gap in the internet access of children from low-income families. This deficiency puts those students academically behind.
John B. King Jr., the CEO of The Education Trust, points out that not only is internet access limited for the poor, but the unavailability of adequate training in technology retards the usefulness when access is available to the children of families with limited income. Distance learning was not always an option for these youngsters under COVTD-19 conditions.
Prithwiraj Choudhury, a professor at Harvard Business School, suggests that remote work induced by pandemic dangers ought to become an accepted strategy to induce people to move to areas that might not have a robust job market to influence new residents.
Investment ideas
Robert E Smith, CEO of Vista Equity Partners, and the wealthiest Black American, suggests that business entities contribute 2% of their annual profit to end systemic racism and to provide capital for Blacks to attain personal solvency, and to develop Black businesses to eliminate the racial wealth gap.
William Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, would provide every American with a cash boon, such as $6,750 at birth. This sum would be carefully invested to enable every citizen to retire as a millionaire.
Education Policy
Kwame Owu-su-Kesse and Geoffrey Canada, executives of the Harlem Children's Zone, emphasize that quality of life in the neighborhood is equally as important as the quality of pedagogy in schools.
Oren Cass, CEO of American Compass, insists that attainment of an academic degree is so persistently promoted, that many students who are better suited for other careers end up as college dropouts with substantial loans to pay. Other career opportunities should be emphasized.
Moral social change
Heidi Heitkamp, a former U.S. senator from North Dakota, wants the U.S. government to comply with its treaties with Native Americans and create objective accountability for all federal services and compliance due Native Americans.
Gun purchase background checks
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut wants to be certain all gun purchasers are investigated, as one measure to reduce the nation's 100 gunshot deaths per day.
Conclusion
President Joe Biden will have a number of issues to pursue after he has stemmed the growth of COVTD-19. The New York Times has provided information on what concerns some prominent Americans.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
BERLIN — After years of hand-wringing about its place in German history, strife over the provenance of its objects and delays in its construction, the Humboldt Forum, an attraction in central Berlin conceived as Germany’s equivalent to the Louvre or the British Museum, finally opened with a ceremony on Wednesday.
At least, in theory.
Although the event was billed as an official inauguration of the $825 million building, it remains closed to visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic. The “opening” was a digital one, a modest livestreamed tour of the exhibition spaces with short statements by curators and other leading figures from the project. The building is likely to remain closed until infection numbers are low enough for the city to reopen cultural institutions, hopefully early next year.
Monika Grütters, the German culture minister, said in a speech during the ceremony that the Humboldt Forum “deserved more than a digital opening. It deserved a party, with an audience and a festive program.”
It was an anticlimactic start for one of Europe’s most expensive and ambitious cultural undertakings.
Housed in a newly reconstructed Baroque palace, the Humboldt Forum will eventually showcase thousands of ethnological artifacts, including Mayan sculptures and wooden boats from the South Pacific, many of which were acquired during the colonial era. It will also include exhibits of Asian art and items from Berlin’s history.
Initially scheduled to be finished in 2019, but delayed when construction overran, the museum is now meant to open in segments over the next two years. The first phase, finished this week, includes outdoor spaces and the lobby, as well as exhibitions about the history of the site.
Even as it was inaugurated, 18 years after its initial conception, its leaders were still struggling to overcome skepticism and drum up enthusiasm among the German public.
Critics have decried the reconstructed palace as a politically fraught eyesore, and activists have claimed that the museum’s leadership has not done enough to probe the provenance of some of its exhibits.
Many Berliners’ resistance to the project stems from the new building itself. The original Berliner Schloss, or Berlin Palace, was built by the royal Hohenzollern dynasty, starting in the 15th century. The palace was demolished in 1950 by the East German government, which erected its Parliament in its place. After German reunification, lawmakers voted to tear down that building and construct a facsimile of the original schloss — a decision many still see as an erasure of East Germany’s history.
Designed by the Italian architect Franco Stella, the new building incorporates modern elements — sleek interiors and one minimalist outer facade — into the Baroque design of the original palace. Initial reviews of the building in the past week have not been kind: An article in Die Zeit, a weekly newspaper, compared it to an “insurance office” and Der Spiegel, a newsmagazine, noted tartly that its interiors looked “easy to clean.”
The opening has also taken place against the backdrop of news reports that problems with the building’s construction were more serious than previously known, drawing comparisons to Berlin’s infamous airport, which opened this fall after countless technical setbacks, nine years behind schedule.
A November article in the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported that, among other flaws, the Humboldt Forum’s doors had been built too small to bring in cases for some exhibits and that malfunctioning air-conditioning had potentially put delicate artifacts in danger.
In a letter to the newspaper, the museum refuted both claims and argued that the article contained “gross untruths.”
Hartmut Dorgerloh, the Humboldt Forum’s director, said in an interview that any comparison to Berlin’s disastrous airport project was unfair, adding that negative news reports were partly down to “Berlin bashing,” a tendency by outlets from outside the city, such as the Munich-based Süddeutsche Zeitung, to denigrate the capital.
“There were problems, but they are controllable,” he said.
Hartmut Ebbing, a lawmaker who sits on the Humboldt Forum’s board of trustees, said in an interview before the opening on Wednesday that the “leadership of the Forum is very lucky” that the coronavirus had interfered with its plans to open the building to the public. Otherwise, he said, it wouldn’t have been ready.
Dorgerloh conceded that the building had some defects, but he said hiccups were to be expected. The building was ready to welcome visitors, he added, even if they were not allowed to enter.
He denied that artifacts had ever been in danger and said that the air-conditioning was working well, except for in one area, where it was being fixed.
During a tour of the building last week, Dorgerloh showed off the rooms that will be accessible once Berlin’s coronavirus measures are relaxed. They included one containing a large-scale film projection about the history of the site, and an archaeological exhibition amid the building’s foundations, featuring the large holes left by explosives during the original palace’s demolition.
Standing in a fourth-floor passageway that connects several galleries, Dorgerloh pointed to two objects that had been juxtaposed to reflect the museum’s willingness to interrogate itself.
One was a sculpture of King Friedrich I, the monarch who oversaw the earliest colonial ventures by Prussia, the kingdom that later became the bedrock of the united Germany. The other was a towering sculpture by the Switzerland-based artist Kang Sunkoo, of a black flag, flying at half-staff, “as a reminder of the crimes of colonialism,” Dorgerloh said.
The museum has worked to address criticism from anti-colonial activists, announcing collaborations with some artifacts’ communities of origin and convening a team of international advisers.
That commitment already faces its first test. Last week, Nigeria’s ambassador to Germany, Yusuf Tuggar, officially requested the return of the so-called Benin Bronzes, spectacular sculptures meant to be shown in the Humboldt Forum that were looted by British troops from an area that is now Nigeria. Dorgerloh has said that the decision will be up to another organization, the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which oversees that part of the collection.
The projects’ supporters are convinced that the Humboldt Forum will win visitors over once they see it firsthand. Wolfgang Thierse, a former lawmaker with the center-left Social Democrats who was one of the Humboldt Forum’s early boosters, said in an interview that public debates, like the one about the museum’s relationship to colonialism, were a “natural part of a vibrant project.”
But he also said that resistance to the Humboldt Forum stemmed from the horrors of the Nazi regime, which had bred skepticism toward “patriotism, big statements and big projects.” Although Germany has a responsibility to look back on its terrible crimes, he said, “we also have the right to open ourselves up to world culture.”

WASHINGTON — At 8 a.m. Friday, Vice President Mike Pence will roll up his sleeve to receive the coronavirus vaccine, a televised symbol of reassurance for vaccine skeptics worried about its dangers. President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to receive his injection on camera next week.
Notably absent from any planned public proceedings is President Donald Trump, who has said relatively little about the vaccine that may be seen as a singular achievement and has made it clear that he is not scheduled to take it himself.
The vaccine may provide a ray of hope at a time when the surging coronavirus is regularly killing around 3,000 Americans a day. But the message on the virus from the Trump administration’s highest officials remains muddled and often contradictory as they continue to toggle between facing reality and trying to dictate an alternate one.
Pence, who will receive his first vaccine shot and encourage Americans to follow suit almost six months to the day after he published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal titled “There Isn’t a Coronavirus ‘Second Wave,’” hosted a holiday party at his residence this week where guests mingled in an outdoor tent and posed for pictures without masks, according to attendees.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was forced into quarantine after being exposed to someone who had tested positive for the coronavirus after hosting a string of large, indoor holiday parties at the State Department and attending a private party Saturday to watch the annual Army-Navy football game.
Only one unofficial adviser in the president’s circle has performed a public mea culpa for his earlier disregard of public health guidelines: Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, who on Wednesday released a television ad urging Americans who do not wear a mask to learn from his own harrowing medical experience and wear one.
The president, who recovered from his own bout with the virus after being treated with experimental drugs at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, is described by aides and allies as preoccupied with the election results he still refuses to accept and has shown no interest in participating in any kind of public health message.
Even in private conversations, they said, Trump rarely even brings up the vaccine that the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, described this week as a “medical miracle” that the president, “as the innovator,” deserved credit for.
Instead, Trump has been focused on his efforts to overturn the election results and consumed by his anger at Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who this week finally congratulated Biden on his victory and said that “the Electoral College has spoken.” And he remains frustrated that the vaccine was not available before Election Day, people who have spoken to him said.
But the president is also aware that a large part of his political base is made up of supporters who refuse to wear masks and so-called anti-vaxxers suspicious of the COVID-19 vaccine. After months of positioning himself in opposition to public health experts, people familiar with his thinking said, Trump feels on some level as if he does not want to be seen as caving in the end to the advice of the same people he has disparaged.
Some supporters with large online followings have even criticized him in recent days for promoting the vaccine at all. “You know, Trump, probably 80% of your base does not want that vaccine,” DeAnna Lorraine, a QAnon conspiracy theorist with a large following on InfoWars, said on her program last week. “I don’t care who takes it. I don’t care if Jesus takes it. I’m not taking the vaccine.”
As Trump hesitates, lawmakers and Supreme Court justices are expected to begin receiving vaccines in the coming days, although the doses will be limited. Dr. Brian Monahan, the Capitol physician, wrote to lawmakers Thursday that he had been notified by the National Security Council that his office would receive a “specific number” of doses to “provide for continuity-of-government operations.” He told lawmakers they could begin scheduling appointments to be vaccinated and suggested eventually some “continuity-essential staff members” could also receive doses.
“My recommendation to you is absolutely unequivocal: There is no reason why you should defer receiving this vaccine,” Monahan wrote. “The benefit far exceeds any small risk.”
Monahan began notifying lawmakers who were eligible for vaccines, and McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated they would be among the first vaccinated.
Public health officials said they were pleased that the vice president was going to be vaccinated in public, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams, despite the president’s own lack of interest in sending a similar public health message.
“It’s the right thing to do,” said Dr. Vinay Gupta, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Washington. “The question is why don’t they do it together, 6 feet apart? It would be really powerful for the president, who has gotten exceptional treatment, to say that even in spite of getting the best care, it’s important that I get this vaccine.”
Trump’s decision, so far, to not get vaccinated, Gupta said, risked undermining any confidence that Pence might instill among skeptics who take their cues from the president alone.
“The fact that he is not getting it makes one wonder if he’s worried,” Gupta said. He also said the muddled messages from the administration — hailing the vaccine while hosting holiday parties — risked “giving false reassurances to the American people that the vaccine is here and vigilance is no longer required.”
White House officials have said Trump does not need to get vaccinated because he still has the protective effects of the monoclonal antibody cocktail that was used to treat him for the virus in October. But Gupta said that that was a misinterpretation of the results and that there was “no scientific reason not to get vaccinated.”
The first lady, Melania Trump, who tested positive for the virus in October and credited her recovery to a regimen of “vitamins and healthy food,” also has no plans to receive the vaccine in public. A spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, declined to say whether Melania Trump would get vaccinated.
Donald Trump said Sunday that he would delay a plan for senior White House staff members to receive the coronavirus vaccine in the coming days, hours after The New York Times reported that the administration was planning to rapidly distribute the vaccine to its staff.
“I am not scheduled to take the vaccine,” Trump added, “but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time.”
But many White House officials are eager to receive the vaccine, even as the president has made it clear he wants them to wait.
Doctors from Walter Reed this week set up vaccine stations inside the Indian Treaty Room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. There, they began vaccinating staff considered critical to the functioning of government: That included Secret Service members, some medical staff and some other support staff who work near Trump.
But Trump made it clear he does not like the optics of West Wing aides receiving the vaccine, and the White House declined to detail who exactly was receiving it. The number of doses they had received, an official said, was classified.
“His priority is front-line workers, those in long-term care facilities, and he wants to make sure that the vulnerable get access first,” McEnany said this week. When it came to staff working in the West Wing, she added, “it will be a very limited group of people who have access to it, initially.”
Pence declined to get the vaccine on the first day it was available to him, despite pressure from aides who wanted him to do so quickly, publicly — and before Biden held his own public event. Pence, people familiar with his thinking said, was concerned about the optics of jumping the line when he wanted the administration to receive credit for the distribution of an effective vaccine to front-line medical workers without any distractions.
Instead, Pence chose to delay his own vaccination until Friday, when his office has asked all of the television networks to carry him live.

In a Big Year for Video Games, These Players Are Shifting the Culture

It should come as no surprise that 2020 was a monumental year for the video game industry. While other business sectors saw revenues shrink and storefronts close, gaming companies have profited over these many months when millions of people have been spending more time at home.
Some of those people were always gamers, but the year has also drawn a new crop of players. Streaming platforms like Twitch, previously reserved for competitive gamers and fans, grew to host chess grandmasters and politicians making campaign stops. Sellers on Amazon and other online marketplaces began listing the Nintendo Switch, released in 2017, at jacked-up prices in the early months of the pandemic to match an unexpected surge in interest. And now, demand for the new consoles released by Sony and Microsoft has made them nearly impossible to buy (unless you want to pay a premium).
The year also delivered several blockbuster titles and surprise hits. “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” became a virtual social hub. “Cyberpunk 2077,” long hyped as the game of the decade, arrived with bugs and less flash than anticipated; many players have since demanded refunds from its maker, CD Projekt Red. Meanwhile, the PlayStation hit “The Last of Us Part II,” which centers on queer women (including the game’s main character, Ellie) and features a transgender character, broke sales records for Sony, selling over 4 million copies in its first three days.
But less remarked upon are the gains that individuals — players, designers, voice actors and activists, many of them women — have made in the gaming world.
Increasing Visibility and Accessibility
Emilia Schatz, a designer at the studio Naughty Dog, was one of the leads in creating the world of “The Last of Us Part II.” In all her work, she aims to expand players’ minds and empathy.
“Among storytelling mediums, games especially excel at their ability to immerse the audience in the identity of the protagonist and the problems facing the world they live in,” she said.
“For players immersed as a protagonist who is a different sex, has a different skin tone, or just a different perspective from themselves, if that portrayal is authentic and human, there is a real opportunity for empathy and understanding,” she continued.
In “The Last of Us Part II,” Schatz said, depicting queer and transgender people in roles often filled by cisgender male characters was important to her, although she anticipated criticism. “As a trans person myself, I’ve built up armor based on how I know some people can treat people such as me,” she said. “I expect nothing different for the characters I help bring to life.”
“The Last of Us Part II” was also praised by many in the disabled gaming community for its vast suite of accessibility options designed to make the game more approachable for players with limited eyesight, those who are deaf or hard of hearing, and those who have limited mobility.
As more games take steps to welcome disabled players, and more adaptive controllers allow people to play games regardless of their disability, more people are creating space for themselves in gaming culture.
Nyree Stevens, a quadriplegic gamer and a member of the Quad Gods, a team of quadriplegic players, said that even complex games like “Fortnite,” which require rapid, intricate inputs to switch between functions like building and shooting while moving and aiming at enemies, are accessible to her thanks to a special controller.
“My equipment is called the QuadStick, which I use by mouth being I have no function in my arms, and it has different pieces that you might have to either sip in order to move or pump in order to do something,” she said. “It’s pretty exciting because I would never have thought I’d be able to play a game using my mouth.”
For now, though, most players still assume that the other avatars they encounter in games like Fortnite are being played by nondisabled people. “I know certain people that, playing the games, they would never think that a person with a disability is behind the character that’s winning,” Stevens said.
Challenging the System
Even more than blockbusters, indie games have sought to address inequities in gaming. Rosa Carbo-Mascarell, a game designer in London, created “A Woman Goes to a Private Industry Party” based on her experience with networking in the games industry. She made the title during one of gaming’s #MeToo waves, in an effort to call attention to the fact that sexism in the industry is a systemic problem, not one that can be solved by ousting a few high-profile abusers.
“It’s the everyday misogyny that hurts the most,” Carbo-Mascarell said. “Every sexist remark or awkward comment cuts like a tiny daily paper cut until eventually we leave the industry hurt and sore. That’s what I wanted to show with my game.”
Gamers are also leading organized labor efforts within the industry, especially as studios face increasing scrutiny for the practice of crunch — extended stretches of mandatory overtime as games approach release.
Sarah Elmaleh participated in a nearly 300-day strike among voice actors in the video game industry as the SAG-AFTRA union pressed for better compensation and working conditions. “I think both sides came out of it with a shared desire for a more harmonious and open-channel way of moving forward,” she said.
Last May, she noted, more than 150 employees at Riot Games participated in a walkout to protest the studio’s use of forced arbitration and what some employees argued was a sexist company culture. “It feels like the attitude toward and interest in unions has shifted dramatically post-actor strike, as well as from some persistent labor coverage from games journalists,” Elmaleh said.
Taking Up Space
Others are making an impact on gaming culture simply by putting themselves in the public eye as players and competitors. Kishonna Gray, the author of “Intersectional Tech: Black Users in Digital Gaming,” has studied how women, particularly Black women, make use of platforms like Twitch, and the challenges they face when doing so.
“Many women say they have to wear revealing clothing to maximize their followers. Some say they have to modify their content but guys don’t see their contributions in gaming as valuable,” she said. “On the flip side, many women remark at the autonomy and power they have to control their own content.”
She noted, however, that “streaming platforms still privilege white men.” And even those women who don’t take up livestreaming with an eye toward political change often find that their presence in that cultural space takes on a political dimension whether they want it to or not.
“While Black women may not set out to be involved in activism,” Gray said, “some of them say that the existence of their bodies in spaces not constructed for them automatically makes them activists because their presence is changing the space.”
Benita Novshadian has been involved in competitive gaming for over 15 years. “The esports scene for women right now is the biggest it has ever been,” she said.
Novshadian said that the opportunities for women to compete in her games of choice, the 1999 shooter “Counter-Strike” and its 2012 iteration, “Global Offensive,” have increased since she started playing.
“We used to have one tournament a year that all the women looked forward to competing in,” she said. “Now, there are about four to six tournaments held a year for women to compete, with much larger prize pools.” She also credits Riot Games for holding all-women tournaments with large prize pools for its new competitive shooter “Valorant.”
With support for female competitors like this from some of the biggest power players in esports, Novshadian is hopeful for a future in which her gender will be largely seen as incidental. “Throughout the years, I have learned that not only do I want to be one of the greatest female esports athletes,” she said, “I want to be a great competitor regardless of gender.”

LONDON — Merck Mercuriadis was sitting in a small office at Abbey Road Studios, pecking away at a vegan breakfast bowl and calmly laying out his plan to dismantle the part of the music business he loves most.
A longtime record executive and artist manager who counts Guns N’ Roses and Elton John among his former clients, Mercuriadis has become the industry’s most polarizing figure by storming the ramparts of the music publishing world — the lucrative side of the business that handles the licensing and royalties of songwriting catalogs.
“The traditional music publishing model,” Mercuriadis said, in the steady tone of a general planning out his big offensive, “is something that I want to destroy.”
Whole swaths of the music business, like touring, shut down in 2020, but music publishing has had a stunning bull market. The action has all been in catalogs: bundles of songwriting copyrights that, if popular and long-lasting enough, can collect steady, predictable streams of income. Thanks to plentiful investment coffers, rosy projections about online streaming and, less happily, the need of many artists to raise cash during the pandemic, there has been a flurry of deals this year, often at staggering prices. Stevie Nicks sold a majority share in her catalog for $80 million. Bob Dylan signed away his entire corpus of more than 600 copyrights for a sum estimated at $300 million to $400 million.
The company that has driven the most transactions and done so the fastest is Hipgnosis Songs Fund, which Mercuriadis introduced into the London Stock Exchange in July 2018. In just 2 1/2 years, Hipgnosis has spent about $1.7 billion scooping up the rights to more than 57,000 songs from an enviable list of writers. Hipgnosis owns, in full or in part, 108 songs by hip-hop producer Timbaland; 188 by Jack Antonoff, a collaborator of Taylor Swift; 197 by Debbie Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie; 814 by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan; 315 by Mark Ronson; and 1,068 by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics.
But to hear Mercuriadis tell it, the business structure that has sustained the publishing market — and the livelihoods of songwriters — for more than a century is fundamentally broken and needs to be rebuilt.
“People look at songs as being inanimate objects; I don’t,” he said. “I think that they’re the great energy that makes the world go ’round, and I think that they deserve to be managed with the same level of responsibility that human beings do.”
In a series of interviews with The New York Times this year, Mercuriadis shared his plan for Hipgnosis, which is inseparable from his critique of the music publishing establishment. The big publishers — which are all divisions of the major record conglomerates — own far too much material to exploit it all properly, he said. Sony/ATV, for example, has nearly 5 million songs in its portfolio. (Among them are two of the industry’s ultimate trophies: the Beatles and Motown songbooks.) The term publisher, Mercuriadis has said, is “a euphemism for someone that collects your money but doesn’t really add value to the song.”
In its place, he posits a bold but somewhat vague plan called “song management,” in which leaner companies look after smaller collections of high-value hits, and each track is held to a profit-and-loss analysis to ensure its value is maximized. Hipgnosis, he said, will eventually have no more than around 150,000 titles.
Mercuriadis’ pitch and the big bucks Hipgnosis has paid have gotten the industry’s attention. And in headline numbers, Hipgnosis is off to a successful start. Its latest financial results, published this month, reported that the “fair value” of its catalog, as determined by an independent reviewer, rose 10% from April to September.
Hipgnosis’ growing collection means that its songs are everywhere. It recently acquired a slice of “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” Mariah Carey’s inescapable holiday standard; and the new season of Netflix’s hit show “The Crown” uses four songs from the Hipgnosis portfolio.
But Mercuriadis has drawn a backlash from the establishment he has provoked. They question whether Hipgnosis can ever earn back the sums it is paying and whether “song management” is any different from what other music publishers do every day.
“One thing that Merck is doing really well is persuading people with deep pockets that music publishing is a simple business which others are doing badly,” said Jane Dyball, the former chief executive of the Music Publishers Association, a trade group in Britain. “In reality it’s not a simple business.”
Even his critics, however, acknowledge that Mercuriadis has raised the temperature of the business and that by paying top dollar to buy out songwriters’ work, Hipgnosis may be driving a fundamental change in the industry. (In the publishing world, though, the other guy’s deals are never as golden as one’s own.)
“He’s stirred the bottom of the barrel,” said Larry Mestel, founder of Primary Wave Music, whose portfolio includes Nicks, Bob Marley, Burt Bacharach and Smokey Robinson. “Merck has been getting a lot of splash because he’s closing a lot of high-multiple deals, but he’s not closing the quality we’re closing.”
In person, Mercuriadis, 57, comes across as less a corporate raider than a colossally ambitious music nerd, with a clean-shaven head and an ever-present black Prada jacket. He grew up in a small town in Nova Scotia and tells of record-buying pilgrimages to Halifax. Hipgnosis Songs Fund is named after Hipgnosis, the British design firm whose high-concept album cover art for Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and others redefined rock marketing.
Mercuriadis, who skipped college to work for the Virgin Records label in Toronto, spent much of his career at Sanctuary, a label and management company that went on a buying spree of its own before its share price collapsed and the company was sold to Universal Music in 2007. Mercuriadis, who rose to become Sanctuary’s chief executive, blames its demise on the broader crisis of the post-Napster music industry.
At Sanctuary, Mercuriadis built a reputation as a shrewd industry player and a vigorous advocate for talent. His fanboy charm gives him an advantage with artists and songwriters, who have often been conditioned not to sell.
“He’s always been bonkers-obsessed about songs,” said Stewart, who has known Mercuriadis for three decades. “He can recite lyrics to the most obscure B-side of a Eurythmics song. He can actually mumble them. Well, he’s not a great singer.”
Harry likened Mercuriadis to the “real music men” of the old-school industry. “This was their life; they did it because the music inspired them,” she said. “I got that feeling about Merck as well, which is really important for a person like me.”
Hipgnosis, like other publishers, fills its portfolio with both old and new songs. It has 73 songs by Starrah, for example, who has written for Rihanna and Camila Cabello, along with 917 recorded tracks by Barry Manilow.
Mercuriadis, who is the founder of Hipgnosis as well as the chief executive of its affiliated investment adviser, makes a persuasive case for songwriting copyrights being undervalued assets.
Streaming, which helped turn around the moribund fortunes of the 21st-century music industry, has also cemented a pop production model in which few stars write their own material. Instead, they are furnished with songs by a network of writers and producers — yet industry formulas generally split streaming royalties in a way that pays performing artists around five times more than songwriters.
“We are now in a paradigm where 90% of artists that are being signed are reliant on songwriters to help deliver hits,” Mercuriadis said. “And yet the songwriter is now the low man or woman on the totem pole when it comes to getting paid.”
By building a portfolio of top songs and gaining the endorsement of major writers — who may have given up their rights but were paid handsomely for them — Mercuriadis believes he can gain leverage to “change where the songwriter sits in the economic equation.”
Mercuriadis’ pitch to investors is that the royalty streams of proven hits are a more stable investment than gold or oil, given the inelastic demand for music — a premise that has largely held up during the pandemic.
“Music has been able to prove itself out this year as being uncorrelated to the overall marketplace,” said Nari Matsuura, a partner at Massarsky Consulting, which estimates the value of music catalogs on behalf of investors and publishers, including Hipgnosis. “Investors are increasingly attracted to music since other industries are under turmoil.”
A confluence of factors, including low interest rates and high stock prices, has made music royalties appealing to institutional investors like pension funds and university endowments, which tend to favor safe and steady growth. Hipgnosis, which pays an annual dividend of about 7 cents per share, counts the Church of England among its major investors.
When publishing catalogs are sold, the price is usually set as a multiple of their annual earnings. Lately, those multiples have been skyrocketing. According to Massarsky data, a decade ago most catalogs were trading at multiples of nine or 10. By 2018, collections of “standards” — popular songs from before 2000 — were going for an average of 13.5 times earnings. In 2019, the multiple grew to 16. This year, it is 17.5.
Hipgnosis has disclosed that its average multiple is 14.76, although Mercuriadis said that for some “important” catalogs, it had paid multiples as high as 22. Hipgnosis’ competitors accuse it of driving up prices; Mercuriadis said his deals are guided by thorough price analyses and portrays other players’ complaints as sour grapes. “The only ones that say I overpay,” he said, “are the ones whose access I have killed.”
Nile Rodgers of Chic, who is on Hipgnosis’ advisory board and is managed by Mercuriadis, dismissed the very idea of overpaying for music that is timeless. “You can never pay too much because the life of hit songs is forever,” he said in an interview.
“At some point in time you’ll be in black ink no matter what,” he added. “It just depends on how you structure your business.”
Rising prices for catalogs also means bigger rewards for writers who sell, a temptation being hotly debated behind the scenes.
The music industry has a troubled history of artists’ selling their copyrights and losing control of their treasures. Stories like that of Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, whose father sold the group’s songwriting catalog in 1969 for $700,000 — a pittance in hindsight — still haunt many artists and their advisers.
“My whole training has been: Don’t sell out. Keep the money,” said one veteran manager. “I was brought up thinking that everybody sold out cheap.”
From its earliest days, the music publishing business has been portrayed as a “river of nickels,” bringing in a few cents in royalties here, a few more there. But for valuable, long-lasting copyrights, which tend to be recorded over and over again — think of the many versions of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” — those nickels add up to millions.
Successful singer-songwriters tend to view their catalogs as their most valuable asset. Hipgnosis has pushed the envelope in seeking to buy out those assets entirely.
The publishing business splits the income and ownership of songs between a writer and a publisher.
A writer is typically paid half of a song’s earnings; the rest of it — and the ownership of its copyright — may be divided between writer and publisher, or either party might own it outright. In most cases, a publisher retains control and administers the use of the song.
For most of its deals, Hipgnosis buys 100% of a songwriter’s control, including the copyrights. Those deals were once rare, but lately they have become more common. Dylan’s recent sale, for example, gave Universal total ownership of his work.
For many writers, the sums now being offered have changed the calculus of whether to sell.
“It’s almost like a stock-trading business; you can say hold onto a stock, but sometimes the price is really at its peak,” said Dion Wilson, the producer and writer known as No I.D., who has worked with Kanye West, Jay-Z and many others and in August signed a deal giving Hipgnosis control over his share of 273 songs.
Still, many artists complain that they have no choice but to consider selling their most prized asset because of the loss of touring income in the pandemic and anemic royalty rates from streaming services.
“We’ve been forcibly retired,” said David Crosby, who added that he is in active negotiations to sell his publishing rights. “I don’t have savings, and I don’t have any retirement program. But I did have my publishing. It’s the only option that’s open to me to take care of myself and my family.”
Mercuriadis sees his deals as a recognition of the value of songwriters’ work and a source of empowerment for them.
“I wanted to be able to do something,” he said, “that would contribute to having the music industry recognize that the songwriter and the producer are really the star of the show.”

Texto completo: The statement:
Senator David Perdue profited from the pandemic, while he downplayed the risk  undermined doctors and scientists  compared coronavirus to the common flu.
Jon Ossoff in ad released in October.
What we found:&
The eyes of the nation are on Georgia, where David Perdue, a one-term Republican, is locked in one of two high-stakes runoffs to determine which party narrowly controls the U.S. Senate. As the campaign proceeded through the fall and polls showed a tightening race, his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff ramped up his attacks on Perdue for some stock trades that were made early in the year, just as the possible impact of the coronavirus coming into focus.
Perdue, one of the wealthier members of the U.S. Senate, has repeatedly said he has done nothing wrong. He also has said his stock trades are handled by independent advisers and without his input, although recent news reports by The New York Times and other news outlets indicate the senator has provided those advisers guidance, at least to some degree.
It is illegal to use nonpublic information gained as a company insider or member of Congress to make investment decisions.
Perdue, through his campaign staff, says federal agents have looked at his recent stock trading and found no wrongdoing.
In late January, the first confirmed case of COVID- 19 was reported near Seattle on Jan. 20. Four days later, select members of Congress met behind closed doors for a coronavirus briefing. Perdue was not at that meeting, according to his campaign.
During this period,&Reuters reported daily updates were being presented to members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on the worldwide spread of the virus. Perdue is not a member of that committee.
Still, his stock trades, between late January and mid-February, numbered nearly 100 and were well above his average. This included up to $245,000 in stock purchases in Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant thats been racing to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, and up to $185,000 in stock of DuPont De Nemours, makers of personal protective equipment used to avoid exposure to the virus. In addition, he sold $165,000 in stocks for Caesar Entertainment, a major player in the casino industry thats been hard-hit by the pandemic.
According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, his stock portfolio swelled in value by about $500,000 from December 2019 to April 2020, even though not all his trades appeared to capitalize on the pandemic. For example, he also made new investments in Disney and Delta Airlines, two companies that have not fared well in the pandemic, and&sold stock in two now much-in-demand companies, Kroger grocery store chain and Proctor & Gamble, the maker of Mr.
Clean, Comet, Swiffer and other top cleaning brands.
The senators re-election campaign says that the Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee cleared him.
The proof his camp offers is an excerpt from a June 16 letter in which Deborah Sue Mayer, the Senate Ethics Committees chief counsel, wrote that the panel did not find evidence that your actions violated federal law, Senate Rules, or standards of conduct and considered the matter closed, the AJC reported.
The campaign has not responded to repeated requests by The AJC for the entire letter.
PolitiFact reported that Perdue campaign spokesman John Burke said Ossoffs claims had been debunked. PolitiFact also said last week that Perdues Nov. 30 campaign ad isnt accurate.
For one thing, there&has been no public disclosure that the Senate Ethics committee investigated Perdue at all, PolitiFact reported. Perdues ad also say he was exonerated.
Federal law enforcement agencies generally decide to prosecute or not, rather than exonerate, the Politi- Fact report said.
The Senate Ethics committee seldom finds fault in members of the U.S.
Senate, the AJC reported.
An analysis of the committees publicly available annual reports from 2007 through 2019 shows it received 1,189 complaints of alleged violations. Not one resulted in a disciplinary sanction, records show, the AJC report said.
Last month, The New York Times reported that Perdue and other lawmakers were investigated by the Justice Department for possible insider trading related to investments they made early in the coronavirus spread. Investigators, according to the Times, found that an executive with Atlanta-based financial technology company Cardlytics had mistakenly sent an email in January to Perdue, a former company board member, that vaguely referenced coming changes to the company.
The Times reported that Perdue told one of his investment advisers, shortly after receiving the email, to sell $1 million worth of stock in Cardlytics, or about 20 percent of his holdings in the company  suggesting the senator could be more closely involved in his stock trades than previously indicated.
Perdues campaign says there is no contradiction.
He had no control over how most stocks he held in individual companies was managed, a campaign strategist said.
Ossoff, who finished second to Perdue in the November general election, has said the stock trades are evidence that the Republican is a crook, though the senator has not been convicted of any crime. He also has called for reform measures requiring all members of Congress to place their stocks in blind trusts.
In his Oct. 2 ad, Ossoff accuses Perdue of downplaying the potential harm from the virus, comparing it to the common flu and saying, Weve had ordinary flu seasons with more deaths. Perdue did make those statements.
But other parts of Perdues record also shows he did understand the gravity of the situation. In a public service announcement he made in late March, he said: First of all, I know this virus is causing a lot of concern, and rightfully so. Let me assure you of this: the worlds best public health officials are right here in Georgia at the CDC. Theyre working around the clock to help contain this virus and to develop a vaccine.

Well into her 80s, wood sculptor and basket maker Dorothy Gill Barnes was always on the hunt for raw material. In her case, that meant trees.
If she received a tip about a construction site or landscaping project in the suburb of Columbus, Ohio, where she lived, she’d hop on her rusty bike and dart to the scene. If she heard buzzing chain saws as she approached, that was a promising sign, because a newly fallen oak or maple tree might be waiting for her. Soon, she’d return with her station wagon.
Barnes was especially known for making imaginative sculptures from bark, which in her hands seemed as malleable as clay. From strips of mulberry tree bark, she produced an intricate vase. To make a stout bowl, she folded hunks of poplar bark. She once wove a basket on a loom with lichen.
She also created sculptures from wood, like a hollowed-out oak tree she encased with apple suckers and a work featuring branches of cherry and paulownia linked together like a necklace with glass and wire.
“The things that I like to do most in my artwork are outdoors,” Barnes said in a video for her 2016 exhibition at the Center for Art in Wood in Philadelphia. That could involve harvesting from a tree, say, that wanted “to share its bark with me.”
Barnes was also known for her raised drawings in bark, known as “dendroglyphs,” which she created by carving patterns into trees and returning years later to lift away what had formed in the scarred wood. She once waited 14 years to harvest one of her marked trees.
“She let the wood speak to her,” her daughter, Juliet Barnes, said. “She was inspired by what the bark was doing naturally, and then she would think of ways to manipulate it. It was an organic process. She was reverent and respectful of her materials.”
Barnes died Nov. 23 at a hospital in Columbus. She was 93. The cause was complications of COVID-19, her daughter said.
Dorothy Ellen Gill was born May 30, 1927, in Strawberry Point, Iowa, the third of four sisters. Her father, Gorda, owned a furniture store and funeral parlor. Her mother, Dorothy (Moninger) Gill, was a homemaker.
As a girl, Dorothy found solace in nature. She liked studying the flow of rivers and streams. She collected stones of all sizes. With her youngest sister, she played in an asparagus bed in their backyard, hiding her toys beneath the dirt.
Barnes attended the University of Iowa in the 1940s and received both a bachelor's degree and an master's in art education. While teaching at Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, she met a music teacher and composer named Marshall Barnes. They married in 1952, settled in Worthington, Ohio, and raised a family.
In her 40s, Barnes discovered the work of a basket maker named Dwight Stump, who used white oak wood, and she was captivated by the idea of harvesting materials from nature. She began making small nontraditional baskets before moving on to more large-scale work that incorporated wire, stone and glass. She collected wood across Ohio: shagbark hickory in Knox County, white pine in Athens, maidenhair fern stems in the Hocking Hills.
Barnes’ work is in permanent collections at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York and the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. She taught extensively and hosted workshops at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine and the Penland School of Craft in North Carolina.
In addition to her daughter, Barnes is survived by three sons, Ted, Gordon and David; a sister, Mary Teschner; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 2006.
Barnes’ final sculpture is currently growing underneath a small mulberry grove in her backyard.
When she planted the trees more than a decade ago, she buried square blocks nearby so that the roots would eventually grasp them and grow into some unfathomable form.
“They’re still there,” her daughter said. “Someday we’ll unearth it and find out what happened.”

Name: Theo Germaine
Age: 28
Hometown: Murphysboro, Illinois.
Now lives: A two-bedroom apartment in Chicago with his partner and three Balinese cats.
Claim to fame: Germaine is a breakout star from “The Politician,” Ryan Murphy’s comedy drama for Netflix. Germaine, who identifies as trans nonbinary, also stars in the Showtime series “Work in Progress,” a dark comedy with queer and trans characters at its center. “I feel very appreciative,” said Germaine (who prefers "he" pronouns) about his newfound fame. “But it can feel like a piece of yourself has been sold to the public that you will never get back.”
Big break: After studying acting at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Germaine starred in a couple of web series for OTV/Open Television, a nonprofit in Chicago that supports programming by queer and other marginalized groups. He was dog sitting and working at The Wormhole Coffee, a 1980s-style coffeehouse, when his agent called about the gender-inclusive role of a scheming high schooler in “The Politician.” He was barely scraping by. The role “really just changed everything,” Germaine said. “It made my life go from zero to 100 in a week.”
Latest project: Germaine has a part in the HBO Max docuseries “Equal,” which honors influential LGBTQ figures. He portrays Jack Starr, a pianist and bootlegger who lived in Montana and was arrested numerous times during the 1920s for dressing in men’s attire. Germaine empathized with the character. “When I was a toddler, I threw fits obsessively unless I was able to pick my own clothes out,” he said.
Next thing: With television productions on hold because of the pandemic, including Season 2 of “Work in Progress,” Germaine is spending his extra time writing screenplays and developing television scripts, including a sci-fi series and a horror film with a diverse and inclusive cast.
Circus escape: For reasons he can’t explain, Germaine said he knew he was transgender at age 3, but it wasn’t until after high school that he met anyone he could identify with. During that confusing time, he found refuge by daydreaming about being in the circus and learning to walk in stilts and breathe fire. Under the big top, he said, “it felt like nobody had gender.”

Valerie Louie saved our beloved Uncle Mort from a life of abuse. Then she became a pandemic casualty. Her death is being mourned by households with four-pawed members across San Francisco and the Bay Area.
Louie spent two decades rescuing dogs like Uncle Mort from shelters and finding them homes like ours anxious to have a new best friend. Her specialty was rescuing the truly abandoned and broken pup, the abused, the blind, the deaf and the long in tooth.
The day she dropped off the sad-eyed mutt I’d identified at one of her shelter events, the little guy promptly deposited a poop on our dining room carpet.
“It’s just a little one,” Louie said. She had a generous smile and the patience of a member of the clergy.
Louie, who died of COVID-19 Nov. 25 after two weeks in an intensive care unit, didn’t just save rescue dogs. She saved people too. She was a nurse and worked for 32 years at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California, starting in the emergency department. Her last position was coordinator of advanced life support.
She was a single mother. She leaves behind her son, Andrew Louie, 21, who lived with her and also was infected with the coronavirus in late October. He has since recovered.
Louie died at the Mission-Bernal campus of California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, the city where she was born and raised. She was 60. Her legacy lives.
“I cannot fathom how many dogs she saved — probably thousands,” her son said, echoing a figure estimated by fellow volunteers. She farmed out the canines to families after retrieving them from shelters, including so-called kill shelters in central California where many dogs get bred, adopted and abandoned.
Friends said she had a particular knack as matchmaker between dog and family. She would keep a mental log of the people seeking rescue dogs, and when the right fit came along, she would call with the good news.
Some dogs she kept — like Ida, a French bulldog found in the mountains of China in 2012. The person who found the dog, abandoned and blind after it had been used for breeding, discovered Louie on the internet through an organization called Rocket Dog Rescue that she worked with at the time. Louie arranged to have the dog flown to San Francisco, her son said.
“She was a powerhouse,” said Meg McAdam, a close friend who also rescues dogs and works at Oakland Animal Services, “and a San Francisco institution.”
During the pandemic, Louie rescued some 80 dogs, finding them at shelters and farming them out to homes, according to McAdam.
Tributes have poured in to a GoFundMe site McAdam set up to help support Louie’s son.
“Valerie gave us our sweet Boomer,” one grateful mourner wrote. “I have prayed for her every day since we heard the news.”
“Valerie gave us our Reggie.”
“She helped us immensely with our Zito.”
I can testify too. I first saw Uncle Mort, a tortured little soul, in the back of Louie’s Toyota RAV4 in early 2018. It was just another Saturday for Valerie, taking dogs to an adoption event at a mall on the southern edge of San Francisco.
I had lurked at the event on the prior two weekends, that must-have-dog feeling rising inside me. My wife, Meredith, long reticent because of her husband-won’t-take-care-of-dog feeling, had seemed to be softening to the idea.
The huddled creature was part longhaired Chihuahua mutt, part depressive. He was 3 years old, and much of his life had been spent locked outside because the man of the house didn’t like his vibe, Louie told me.
I told her that I would like to give the dog a try but had to do some convincing on the home front. She got it immediately. She had done it hundreds of times — the veritable trial run for the family on the fence about bringing in a new member with fur and a troubled past.
I signed the papers, and a few days later, Louie dropped him off and assessed the fit. She looked around approvingly while the dog deposited his opening gambit on our carpet. His given name was Franco. That did not fit.
Franco sounded like a Spanish dictator. The weathered soul in our house, while only 3 years old, looked more like an ancient member of the British Parliament. We christened him Uncle Mort. That had been the name of a character in a comic strip I had written for a decade; dog and comic-strip character looked strikingly alike.
The new name fit all the more when we witnessed his early behavior, which entailed looking nervous when awake but mostly sleeping with an outsize snore that sounded like your great-uncle after Thanksgiving dinner, passed out on the couch.
We called a dog trainer to come see if Mort might learn to love and be loved. The trainer was dubious. “He’ll be a good dog, but don’t get your hopes up that he’ll be the family dog you imagined. He’s had a rough go.”
We got our hopes up. We were rewarded.
Uncle Mort has become the most loving and beloved creature in our house, some days exceeding the children in both respects. My wife is his “person,” and when she returns home from an absence, no matter how brief, he goes bananas as if he has just discovered the ocean.
Now Meredith calls Uncle Mort her “forever puppy.” Such is the state of Mort’s relaxation these days that he regularly lies in various positions of seemingly impossible geometry and vulnerability, all four limbs in the air so that he may be petted around the chest and neck and ears in the manner to which he has become accustomed.
Uncle Mort — or simply “good boy” — became the veritable dog in the window we always dreamed we’d take home, and so it really hit our household when we learned that Louie was in the ICU.
Hers is a typical COVID-19 tragedy. It’s not clear how she contracted the disease, and it took her on a fatal roller-coaster ride.
On Oct. 29, she texted McAdam, her close friend, “I’ve not been this sick in forever. I can’t break the fever.”
On Nov. 2, she texted, “I’m sleeping days away. I’m losing pockets of time.”
On Nov. 11, a friend went to Louie's house to check up on her and found her in dire straits. She was transported to the hospital and promptly intubated.
Louie’s son is taking college classes, studying to be a nurse, and recently picked up his mom’s role and helped find homes for the last three dogs that she had committed to place.
One was Blitz, a gray terrier mix who is deaf. Then there’s Bronco, a long-haired dachshund, and Tavish, a one-eyed pug.
“That was a real Valerie dog,” McAdam said. “Those are the dogs she rescued."
At Highland Hospital, where she worked, her loss was felt deeply too. Michelle Hepburn, director of emergency services and trauma at Alameda Health Systems, which operates Highland, adopted Bella, a pit bull puppy, with the help of Louie.
“Her passion for caring both for people and fur babies was evident in every waking moment,” Hepburn said.

Bill Offers New College Sports Model: Cut Athletes in on the Profits

If would be one thing to suggest that Trevor Lawrence, the dynamic Clemson quarterback, be paid $173,000 this season. But what about the long snapper at Bowling Green? And it would raise few eyebrows to say that Luka Garza, the University of Iowa basketball star, should be paid $115,600. But what about the backup point guard at Portland State?
As the NCAA’s amateurism model — the one that has turned college sports into a billion-dollar industry — has been increasingly under assault in courtrooms and legislative halls, Sen. Cory Booker on Thursday produced the most ambitious swing at it yet. He put forth a multipronged bill with a provocative element: It would give every athlete in a handful of revenue-generating sports a share of profits.
The proposal, called the College Athletes Bill of Rights, would also provide lifetime scholarships, government oversight of health and safety standards, public reporting of booster donations, unrestricted transfers and create a commission with subpoena power to ensure compliance.
The bill stems not only from Booker’s experience as a former football player at Stanford, he said, but also from conversations he has had in recent months with college players, which he said have centered on the racial inequities of an unpaid, largely Black workforce generating millions for largely white coaches and administrators.
“There’s this stratospheric wealth being created,” said Booker, whose bill is being introduced four days after Auburn decided to fire its football coach, Gus Malzahn, at a cost of more than $21 million. “But the people — quite literally in the fields — who are creating that wealth are seeing little to no share of it.”
Framing the issue as one of social injustice — or, more starkly, as akin to a slave system — is nothing new for athlete activists. But that description is carrying greater currency at a time when institutions across the country are being scrutinized for systemic racism.
The coming year may provide a tipping point for the NCAA, which Wednesday convinced the Supreme Court to take up a lower-court ruling that said the organization violated antitrust laws by putting restrictions on educational benefits that colleges could provide athletes. Five states have already passed legislation (and more than 20 others have proposed bills) that would allow athletes to cash in on their fame, and at least four other bills related to the issue have been introduced in Congress.
That three bills — by Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, a former Ohio State receiver — have been put forth by Republicans is a sign that this issue may generate bipartisan attention.
Booker’s bill, which is being co-sponsored by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, has drawn only Democratic support thus far, with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois signing on. But Booker said that he has found an empathetic ear with Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Judiciary Committee chairman, who along with the Commerce Committee headed by Wicker, has held hearings this year on athletes’ ability to make money off the use of their name, image and likeness.
Those hearings have come at the urging of the NCAA, which has been lobbying for legislation that would provide it an antitrust exemption. The goal of the NCAA’s lobbying is to supersede state legislation, like laws passed in California and Florida, that aims to limit a college’s ability to prohibit athletes from being compensated for their skills while, say, a computer whiz or a music prodigy faces no such restrictions.
The 61-page bill proposed by Booker addresses more than paychecks. It would set health standards that range from concussion protocols to how sexual assault cases should be investigated. It would set up a fund to help cover the costs of injuries that may linger long after an athlete’s career is over, and it would regulate sports agents. It would require colleges to reduce coach and administrator salaries and rein in other costs before dropping sports.
And it would establish a nine-member commission, appointed by the president, with at least five former college athletes, with the power to investigate and fine universities as much as to $250,000 for violating its provisions and ban individuals from working in college athletics.
“This is a belt-and-suspenders approach to enforcement,” said Blumenthal, a former Connecticut attorney general. “There will be no winks and nods here. We are writing a good law, and it will have teeth.”
The most ambitious — and likely the most contentious — provision would require colleges to share the profits they make with the athletes who generate them. In sports where revenues exceed the cost of scholarships across an entire division — at the moment that would be athletes who play football, men’s and women’s basketball, and baseball — the profits generated in each sport would be shared equally with the scholarship players.
Using data supplied by universities to the Department of Education, Booker said that would mean payments of $173,000 a year to football players, $115,600 to men’s basketball players, $19,050 to women’s basketball players and $8,670 to baseball players who are on full scholarship. Those figures pale in comparison to coaches’ salaries. Fifty head football coaches, for example, earned at least $3 million this year, according to a USA Today database. At Ohio State, four assistant coaches earned at least $1 million.
If the bill is tilted toward the athletes, Booker said, that is because it is the only bill so far to be crafted from the athletes’ perspective, though it notably avoids any mention of whether athletes should be considered employees. Booker’s bill will not be addressed in the Senate’s current session, but he said he would reintroduce it when the new one begins in January.
The starting point on eventual legislation — if it is closer to Booker’s proposal or Wicker’s bill — will be influenced heavily by the remaining two Senate races in Georgia on Jan. 5. If Republicans hold on to at least one of the two seats, Wicker will retain his seat as committee chairman. If not, then Democrats will control the Judiciary Committee on which Booker and Blumenthal both sit, and the Commerce Committee of which Blumenthal is a member.
“If we’re in the majority, it puts us in a much better position to get this done,” Booker said.

Takashi Oka, a journalist who illuminated a rising Japan for American readers during a long career at The Christian Science Monitor and as the first Japanese-born Tokyo bureau chief for The New York Times, died Dec. 2 at his home in New York City. He was 96.
His daughters, Megumi and Sakuya Oka, confirmed his death.
In six decades as a journalist, Oka spent many years as a foreign correspondent, reporting from countries around the world in both war and peace and interviewing leaders like Emperor Hirohito and Margaret Thatcher.
But much of his professional career traced the postwar history of Japan. He began as a young interpreter at the Tokyo war crimes trials; continued, in many ways, as an interpreter of Japan itself for Americans as a correspondent for The Monitor and The Times; launched a Japanese version of Newsweek; and later left journalism to represent one of Japan’s political parties in Washington.
Still energetic later in life, he went on to earn a doctorate at 84.
Oka started his journalism career as a correspondent for The Monitor in Hong Kong in 1959, having just earned a degree from Harvard. His work took him to Moscow and to Vietnam to cover the war. He then joined The Times in 1968 as Tokyo bureau chief, and was the first in that role to have been born in Japan. (The second was Norimitsu Onishi, in 2003.)
Oka won praise from both colleagues and readers for penetrating the stereotypes that often clouded American reporting on Japan, presenting a clear-eyed picture of the nation that was transforming itself from a war-ravaged ruin into an economic power that challenged U.S. dominance.
Takashi Oka was born in Tokyo on Oct. 21, 1924, and was raised to be bilingual; he learned English from his mother, Fumi Yamada, who had grown up the daughter of a diplomat in the United States and Canada. His father, Masakazu Oka, was the head of record company RCA Victor Japan.
Having attended international schools from a young age, Oka dreamed of going to college in the United States. But with the onset of World War II, he was conscripted to work on a farm and later in a munitions factory.
After the war, his facility with English helped him get a job with the legal department of the American occupying authority, and in 1946, at 21, he became the youngest interpreter at the war crimes tribunal, assigned to translate for Hideki Tojo, the imperial army general and prime minister who was ultimately convicted of war crimes and hanged in 1948.
A lifelong Christian Scientist who later became an American citizen, Oka joined The Christian Science Monitor in Boston in 1954 after completing a master’s program in regional studies at Harvard University.
After leaving The Times in 1971, he worked for The Monitor on and off until the early 1990s, remaining a contributor until 2010. He was one of the first American reporters to enter China after the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1979.
He was later named editor-in-chief of the Japanese version of Newsweek magazine, which was introduced in 1986, published by a Japanese book and encyclopedia company, TBS-Britannica, with oversight by Newsweek.
After leaving journalism, he became a representative of Japan’s Liberal Party in Washington for three years, beginning in 1999.
At the age of 84, he capped off his career with a doctorate in political science from Oxford University, where he wrote a dissertation on Japanese politics.
In addition to his daughters Megumi and Sakuya, he is survived by his wife, Hiro Oka, whom he had met in New York City and married in 1956; and four grandchildren.
Susan Chira, a former Times correspondent and editor who headed the paper’s Tokyo bureau in the 1980s, said Oka was “one of the wisest and kindest of that era and a mentor to both Japanese and American journalists.”
He expressed some of his wisdom in a 1991 report on U.S. news coverage of Japan. “Don’t rush to conclusions,” he was quoted as advising fellow journalists. “Be tactful. If you are new to Japan, you will be overwhelmingly aware of the differences with the U.S. But these differences are less important once you go below the surface.”

WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden will nominate Michael S. Regan, secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, according to three people on the Biden transition team.
Regan became Biden’s top choice only in recent days, two people familiar with the selection process said. The front-runner had for several weeks been Mary D. Nichols, California’s air quality regulator, but she faced significant criticism from liberal groups who accused her of not doing enough to address issues of environmental racism in her state.
Biden also has been under pressure to make his Cabinet choices more racially diverse. If confirmed, Regan is expected to bring a strong focus on racial equity to the agency.
“It signals that the Biden administration is serious about getting the EPA back to its core mission to protect the environment and public health as well as ensure strong, meaningful steps are taken to advance environmental justice issues,” said Brian Buzby, executive director of the North Carolina Conservation Network, a coalition of environmental groups.
Biden has vowed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and along the way eliminate fossil fuel emissions from the power sector by 2035. If the Senate remains under Republican control and resistant to passing climate legislation, it will fall largely to the EPA to enact regulations that can curb planet-warming pollution from power plants, automobiles and oil and gas sites.
A longtime air quality specialist at the EPA working under both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, Regan later worked for the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group. In 2017, Roy Cooper, a Democrat, defeated Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, in North Carolina and tapped Regan to lead the state environmental agency.
There he replaced Donald R. van der Vaart, a Trump administration ally who has questioned the established science of climate change and fought Obama-era rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and championed a pro-business agenda of deregulation in North Carolina.
Supporters of Regan said he improved low morale and emphasized the role of science at the department. Several called it an obvious parallel to what he would be expected to do at the EPA, where Andrew Wheeler, President Donald Trump’s administrator and a former coal lobbyist, has discouraged the agency from working on climate change, and independent auditors have identified a “culture at the top” of political interference in science.
“It’s eerie how it has mirrored what happened to EPA,” said Dan Crawford, director of government relations at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, who called the choice of Regan to lead the federal agency “refreshing.”
Van der Vaart in an interview called Regan a “nice guy” but said the Department of Environmental Quality under his leadership had made poor decisions, including in a settlement with Duke Energy over the cleanup of coal ash that he argued could lead to rate hikes for customers.
He pushed back on the notion that morale took a hit under his leadership. Regarding climate change policy, van der Vaart said, under Regan’s leadership “precious little has been done in any event, so I’m not sure where the improvement was specifically on that issue.”
The selection of Regan is in many ways a conventional choice. Democratic presidents have a history of poaching EPA leaders from state environmental agencies. Both Gina McCarthy and Lisa Jackson, who both ran the agency under President Barack Obama, had been the heads of state environmental agencies — McCarthy in Connecticut and Jackson in New Jersey.
But Regan’s name only first surfaced Sunday after weeks of speculation that Nichols of California had a lock on the job.
Nichols, a champion of aggressive regulation, would have faced fierce opposition from Republicans, something for which the Biden team was prepared. But, several people close to the transition said, Biden was caught off guard by intense criticism of Nichols from liberals who argued that the cap-and-trade policies she helped design for California allowed industry to continue to pollute, disproportionately harming poor communities.
In Regan, people close to the Biden transition said, the president-elect hopes to find a candidate who has not made many enemies on the left or the right and who can also move quickly to map out an aggressive agenda.
He has been a key figure in helping Cooper carry out his pledge to achieve carbon neutrality in North Carolina by 2050 and oversees the state’s climate change interagency council, a working group of state agencies set up to meet that goal. In September, Regan outlined a plan that included cutting the power sector’s emissions to 70% below 2005 levels in the next decade and significantly ramping up clean-energy development.
And in January, Regan’s agency struck a far-reaching settlement agreement with Duke Energy and environmental groups to require the utility to dispose of more than 76 million tons of submerged coal ash in lined landfills. It will be the nation’s largest coal ash excavation.

Harold Budd, a composer and pianist known for the preternatural spaciousness and melancholy calm of his music, and for his collaborations with art-pop artists like Brian Eno and Cocteau Twins, died Dec. 8 in a hospital in Arcadia, California. He was 84.
The cause was complications of COVID-19, which he contracted at a short-term rehabilitation facility while undergoing therapy after suffering a stroke Nov. 11, his manager, Steve Takaki, said in an email.
Born in Los Angeles, Budd grew up close to the Mojave Desert, a likely inspiration for the sparsity and vastness his music could evoke. Engaged initially by free jazz, John Cage’s avant-garde innovations and early minimalism, he broke with all of those styles to create a signature sound that centered on the piano, soft-pedaled, sustained and suspended in a corona of reverberation and drone.
That sound, which Budd began to develop in 1972, found its initial fruition on “The Pavilion of Dreams,” a 1978 album produced and released by Eno. In 1980, Budd and Eno jointly created “Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror,” a watershed work for both artists, not least for its feeling of unhurried, organic spontaneity. For their next collaboration, “The Pearl,” released in 1984, they brought in a second credited producer, Daniel Lanois.
“I just want to say one thing again clearly right now: I owe Eno everything,” Budd proclaimed in a 2016 interview with L.A. Record, a music publication. Recording with Eno in London had “opened up another world for me that I didn’t know existed,” he said, “and suddenly I was a part of it.”
Budd would go on to work with other artists active in popular music, including Andy Partridge of XTC and John Foxx, a founder of Ultravox. A collaboration with Scottish trio Cocteau Twins, whose music shared with Budd’s a quality of esoteric reverie, produced the 1986 album “The Moon and the Melodies.” An enduring bond with Robin Guthrie, the Cocteau Twins guitarist and songwriter, resulted in several film scores and duo albums. The latest, “Another Flower,” was recorded in 2013 but released this month.
Budd announced his retirement from music in 2004, but within a few years he was working again, with fresh vitality and variety. “Bandits of Stature,” issued in 2012, comprised 14 succinct pieces for string quartet. By 2018, Budd was collaborating with chamber groups in concerts that amounted to career retrospectives, including a high-profile appearance at the 2019 Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tennessee.
When Budd died, Takaki wrote in an email, he had recently completed 19 new string quartets. Some had been recorded this year. Others have yet to be performed. Preparations to transcribe and edit Budd’s solo piano music and chamber works for publication began during the summer, and will continue.
Harold Montgomery Budd was born May 24, 1936, to Harold Budd, who worked in the textile industry, and Dorothy (McNeill) Budd, a homemaker. His father died when he was 13, resulting in financial hardship that prompted the family to move to Victorville, on the edge of the Mojave Desert.
An early interest in jazz led Budd to take up the drums. He played nightclub dates in Los Angeles while working days at Northrop Corp., the aircraft manufacturer, to support his family, and later attended Los Angeles Community College. Drafted into the Army, Budd performed in a band with saxophonist Albert Ayler, who would later achieve renown as a free-jazz firebrand.
On his return to civilian life, Budd enrolled at California State University, Northridge, where he studied with Gerald Strang, a protégé of the formidable modernist Arnold Schoenberg, earning his bachelor’s degree in 1962.
Awarded a scholarship to study composition with Ingolf Dahl at the University of Southern California, Budd discovered a foundational inspiration in painter Mark Rothko, whose canvases he described as “brilliant blasts of color that simply engulfed you,” according to a biographical essay on his website. Informed by the jury to whom he presented his master’s thesis that a 1966 orchestral homage titled “Rothko” was too rhythmically difficult to perform, he proved his critics wrong, he said, earning his master’s degree in composition that year.
John Cage exerted an influence, although less for his music than for his ideas and his courage in forging a career outside of the academy. Works like “Magnus Colorado” (1969) and the 24-hour “Lirio” (1971) involved reverberant gongs and controlled lighting, fusing Budd’s compositional ideas with his interests in visual art and installation. For “The Oak of the Golden Dream” (1970), Budd used the Buchla Box, an early synthesizer, to pair an unwavering bass drone with an incantatory treble melody, in a manner reminiscent of Terry Riley’s early works.
Gripped by a growing sense of sterility in the classical avant-garde while teaching composition at the California Institute of the Arts from 1970 to 1976, Budd retreated from public work; privately, he explored the unambiguous melodic simplicity he found in medieval and Renaissance music.
His composition “Madrigals of the Rose Angel” (1972) marked the birth of his mature style. A recording of the piece reached Eno, whose own thinking about music, listening and atmosphere was coalescing into what he would term “ambient” music — one of many labels, including “New Age,” that Budd resisted. “I just have utterly no interest in that sort of thing,” he said of such categorizing in a 2014 interview with The Guardian.
Despite the break with past work, some essence of Budd’s early influences remained. “The Pavilion of Dreams” featured alto saxophonist Marion Brown, a colleague of John Coltrane. It included the hymn “Let Us Go Into the House of the Lord,” in an arrangement inspired by that of the Coltrane acolyte Pharoah Sanders, and “Butterfly Sunday,” a reworking of Coltrane’s “After the Rain.” Other collaborators on the album included the English experimental composers Michael Nyman and Gavin Bryars.
From that point, and especially after “Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirrors,” Budd charted a course that rarely wavered yet accommodated abundant variety and discovery. He performed alone and with groups, recorded with poets and wrote poetry of his own, and made two albums of improvisations with video artist Jane Maru.
Budd is survived by two sons, Matthew and Terrence, from his first marriage, to Paula Katzman; and by another son, Hugo, from his marriage to Ellen Wirth, who died in 2012. Budd’s brother and stepsister died before him. He lived in South Pasadena, California.
Throughout his career, Budd maintained an extraordinarily coherent vision. “There’s a whole world fraught with possibilities in consonant music,” he told The New York Times in a 1987 interview. “In Beethoven, a consonant chord had a function, but in my music the focus has shifted to consonance as a thing in itself,” he continued. “I hear an absolute whole life in consonant chords.”

Texto completo: The claim: A meme purportedly quotes Thomas Jefferson and Donald Trump about the press
Since 1787, the concept of a free press has been enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution, which bars any law from "abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."
Now, some have taken to Facebook to share a meme created by Left Action contrasting quotes from President Thomas Jefferson and President Donald Trump on the subject.
To Jefferson, the meme attributes the quote, "When the speech condemns a free press, you are hearing the words of a tyrant."
To Trump, the meme attributes the quote, "The press is the enemy of the American people."
John Hlinko, the founder of Left Action, told USA TODAY that he removed the meme after he found out it contained a fake quote from Jefferson. But shared versions of that Left Action meme still exist on social media.
The alleged Jefferson quote has also appeared on Facebook by itself in other memes. The users who posted the memes have not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.
Fact check: Trump was Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2016; Biden and Harris honored in 2020
Thomas Jefferson believed in a free press, but quote is fabricated
The quote the meme attributes to Jefferson is not a bonafide remark from the Founding Father.
The Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia – a website maintained by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation – includes the line on its list of "spurious quotations."
"This quotation has not been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson," the website reads. "Its earliest known appearance to date is a meme generated in late February 2017."
However, it is true that Jefferson was a staunch believer in the importance of a free press. His papers in the Library of Congress and National Archives include multiple quotes on the subject.
In 1786, for example, he wrote, "Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost."
In 1804, he also wrote, "Our first object should therefore be to leave open to him all the avenues to truth. The most effectual hitherto found is the freedom of the press."
Fact check: Fake anti-Christmas quote attributed to Kamala Harris began as satire
Donald Trump called 'FAKE NEWS ... the enemy of the American people' but the meme misquotes him
The quote the meme attributes to Trump is also inaccurate.
It is similar to a line that he wrote in on Twitter on Feb. 17, 2017.
"The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!" he wrote.
The quote in the meme substitutes the "the press" for the word "it."
But speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 24, 2017, Trump clarified that he only uses the label of "enemy of the people" for "fake news," not all media outlets, per the New York Times.
“A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people, and they are – they are the enemy of the people,” he said. “They’re very dishonest people."
"In covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people – the fake news," he added. "They dropped off the word ‘fake.' And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy. They take the word ‘fake’ out."
Though the meme includes a misquote, Trump has repeatedly used the phrase "enemy of the people" to refer to large swaths of the press.
"Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems ..." he wrote on Twitter in July 2018.
More: Report: Trump's attacks on the press 'dangerously undermined truth and consensus'
Our rating: False
Based on our research, a meme that claims to quote Thomas Jefferson and Donald Trump about the press is FALSE. The quote attributed to Jefferson is not real, though it is true that he was a staunch believer in the freedom of the press. The quote attributed to Trump is a misquote. It is similar to a line he wrote on Twitter in February 2017, but inaccurate. Trump has said that he only refers to the "fake news" as the "enemy of the people," not all media outlets.

NEW YORK — It’s a New York City nightmare: a midweek nor’easter that promised to dump a foot of snow before the morning commute, snarling traffic, shutting down airports and commuter train lines, slowing subways and forcing parents to somehow work around small children thrilled by a day off from school.
But this is 2020. The snow day began nine months ago. And in the sort of reversal that could only happen in this pandemic era, a heavy snowstorm is, to many, a most welcome change, something new to look at from the windows that New Yorkers have lived behind since March.
There is no commute to snarl this year, because for many New Yorkers, there is no office to go to. Boys and girls being stuck at home is not called a snow day anymore; it’s Thursday. The perennial frustrations of a winter storm — the disruption, the hassle in getting where you need to go — are absent, just as movie theaters and concerts and friends are.
Of course, to essential workers and city agencies, the storm was still a storm, packing the potential for major problems. The police stepped up their outreach to the homeless population to get people off the streets. The Fire Department undertook its standard storm preparations, staffing extra battalion chiefs in some of the city’s more remote locations, like the Rockaways and Staten Island. Snowplows were turning out with smaller than normal crews, in an effort toward social distancing.
Transit officials braced for slowdowns. “It is going to be a tough storm,” said Patrick J. Foye, chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority. “If you can stay home, please do.”
Restaurant workers, coming off the halt of indoor dining on Monday and some outdoor dining ahead of the storm on Wednesday, braced for the first stretch without any business since the spring. Taxi drivers, food vendors — everyone who makes a living in the street — stood to face a loss made greater by the months that came before.
Other businesses found themselves busy on Wednesday. New Yorkers have grown accustomed to empty store shelves, but at a Dick’s Sporting Goods store in Staten Island, the aisles weren’t empty of hand sanitizer or Clorox wipes or toilet paper. No, the store had sold out, quite suddenly, of sleds.
“This morning,” a worker said. “We don’t have any left.”
To anticipate and lean into something fun — to see a colossal storm approaching and think “sled” — felt almost indulgent. Mothers and fathers planned to mute their office notifications before ducking outside with sons and daughters, finding fresh, white hills normally out of reach on a work day.
Daniel Lugo and his daughter, Frida, 6, tried two hardware stores in Brooklyn’s Windsor Terrace neighborhood on Wednesday, finally finding what they were after — a long blue sled — on Prospect Avenue. “Our last one,” a worker said.
“Oh, yes!” came the shouted reply — and not from young Frida. “It actually feels good,” Lugo said, his glasses fogging above his mask. Normally, he’d be taking a subway to Manhattan, but now, “I commute in my socks,” he said. “I’ll take half a day, take this one out sledding — I’m actually excited.”
He’ll take Frida out, but he’ll have to wait until school ends for the day. In the upside-down year that is 2020, the once-a-century asterisk, it was New York’s public schoolchildren who suffered a great loss on Thursday, without a day off. The city suggested this week that remote learning would quite likely make snow days a thing of the past, perhaps for good.
The result was a role reversal in which grown men exalted over sleds and children sounded more like the grown-ups in the room. Emma Abdullah, in fourth grade in Washington Heights, described her upcoming Thursday: “I definitely want to go sledding, but I have a lot of work. I’m just going to stay inside and do remote work, and when the snow comes, I’ll maybe go sledding.”
It could be easy to forget for a moment that hardware stores also sell things that are not sleds. There were brisk sales of rock salt. “Fifty bags,” said Abdul Alasaid at Continental Hardware in Forest Hills, Queens. His employee, Paul Dahnpaul, interrupted: “Seventy-five.” And a lot of shovels.
In Morningside Heights, a babysitter in Riverside Park tried in vain to stop her 6-year-old charge from pulling down his mask to catch snowflakes on his tongue. Nearby, Alex Tsang, 46 , an architect, walked with his 4-year-old son, the boy muffled to his eyeballs.
“We’ve been sheltering in place for so long,” Tsang said.
In Bennett Park in Washington Heights, Tali Adler, 30, a rabbi, said she was looking forward to enjoying the snow with her 4-month-old daughter. “For me, it is a very helpful reminder that some things are still normal, no matter what’s going on in life,” she said. “I’m pretty thrilled about it.”
Elsewhere in Washington Heights, Craig Peden, 55, who works in information technology, sought to appear indifferent about the snow — “nonplused,” he said. But his wife, Lauren, 60, called him out: “He’s got his cross-country skis at the ready!”
Others felt genuine annoyance at what seemed like the year’s latest affront. “Now I have to worry about getting COVID and slipping and falling,” said Barbara Gleason, a professor at City College, slowly making her way through the snowy parking lot during a grocery run at Met Food in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.
Sabrina Padro, a transit employee in Ridgewood, Queens, loaded two shovels into her shopping cart at Target — one for her, and one for her neighbor who couldn’t find any at Home Depot.
“We’ll get through it,” she said. “It’s a distraction.”

MELBOURNE, Australia — The sudden lockdown this summer of nine public housing towers in Melbourne that left 3,000 people without adequate food and medication and access to fresh air during the city’s second coronavirus wave breached human rights laws, an investigation found.
The report, released on Thursday by the ombudsman in the state of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, said that the residents had been effectively placed under house arrest for 14 days in July without warning. It deprived them of essential supports, as well as access to activities like outdoor exercise, the report said.
The lockdown was not “compatible with residents’ human rights, including their right to humane treatment when deprived of liberty,” Deborah Glass, the Victorian ombudsman, wrote. The report recommended the state government apologize publicly to tower residents, as well as improve relationships and procedures at similarly high-risk accommodations in the city so that they might be better prepared for future outbreaks.
Though Australia has won global praise for successfully slowing the spread of the coronavirus in the country, the report was a scathing rebuke of state officials’ decision to apply stringent measures to the public housing residents, who said they felt trapped and traumatized and suspected discrimination. Several described it as a “nightmare.”
“We grew up here; we were born here,” one resident, who was not identified by his real name in the report, told investigators. “It felt like, ‘Are we in a safe place anymore, or not?’” he added. “We felt unworthy.”
The report was also a reminder that such measures were rarely applied equitably and have come at great cost to those who are economically disadvantaged. Many of the towers’ residents are minorities or immigrants. Some residents noted that police officers had swarmed around the towers, making it difficult to leave.
Speaking of the towers’ residents, the report noted: “Some had endured civil wars and dictatorships before settling in Australia, some even surviving torture at the hands of their former State. For them, the overwhelming police presence was particularly traumatic.”
When a second wave threatened to upend Australia’s progress in quashing the pandemic, the Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, enforced what would become one of the strictest and longest lockdowns in the world. It lasted 111 days, frustrating already exhausted and winter-weary Melburnians and earning him both vitriol and support from the public.
Andrews said that the government had no choice and that its actions were based on the best public health advice.
“There is no rule book for this, nobody in Victoria has done this before,” he said at a news conference in Melbourne on Thursday. “We took the steps that the experts said were necessary to save lives.”
Investigators found that although the state’s acting chief health officer had signed the order approving the lockdown, she was unaware of the government’s plans to put it into effect so suddenly. The report said that she was given only 15 minutes to consider the terms of several documents and their human rights implications before the details of the lockdown were made public.
“We may be tempted, during a crisis, to view human rights as expendable in the pursuit of saving human lives,” the report warned. “This thinking can lead to dangerous territory.”
Ebyon Hassan, 32, who lives in one of the towers in the suburb of North Melbourne and lost her father to the coronavirus in late July, said of the report, “It’s no surprise that human rights have been breached.”
She and other residents said that they had been extremely disappointed by the lack of government services in the lockdown’s aftermath.
“Everyone is just trying to heal and recover,” she added. “An apology is the least they could do.”
Australian officials have hoped that their handling of the virus would allow for a “COVID-normal” Christmas. The state of Victoria, which by late November had effectively eliminated the coronavirus for a second time, has now gone 48 days without any new, locally transmitted cases.
But on Wednesday and Thursday, in a sign of the virus’ persistence, a cluster of 17 new cases emerged in the northern beaches of Sydney, Australia’s largest city, bringing to an end the city’s two-week streak without having any new, locally transmitted infections and forcing the closing of some care homes.
Despite the findings of the report, the Victorian state government maintained that its actions had been “integral” in helping to slow the spread of the disease.
The authorities “at all times acted lawfully and within the applicable legislative framework,” Richard Wynne, the minister for planning and housing, said in a statement released on Thursday.
“We make no apologies for saving lives,” he added.

Some Health Care Workers Are Getting the Vaccine. Others Aren’t. Who Decides?

Dr. Biron Baker runs a family medicine clinic in Bismarck, North Dakota. Every day patients walk through the door, and any number of them could be sick with the coronavirus. Baker treats them anyway, doing the best he can with his small staff to keep from getting sick.
But as the nation’s daily death counts from the coronavirus shatters previous records and the vaccine rolls out for front-line health workers across the country this week, Baker and his staff are so far not among those scheduled to receive it — and they do not know when their turn will come.
They have been given no information about the vaccine, he said, adding that he had tried several times to call state officials for an answer but with no luck. “No email, no fax announcement, nothing at all,” he said.
The vaccine is perhaps the only bright spot as the coronavirus continues its rampage around the country and new data shows a jobless crisis far worse than in other recessions. Still, in the scramble to vaccinate millions of health workers, difficult choices about who comes first — and who must wait — have started to surface. So far, the effort is concentrated in hospitals. Workers treating COVID-19 patients in intensive care units and in emergency departments have in recent days been beaming symbols of the virus’ demise.
But there are roughly 21 million health care workers in the United States, making up one of the country’s largest industries, and vaccinating everybody in the first wave would be impossible. That has left entire categories of workers — people who are also at risk for infection — wondering about their place in line.
“There’s a lot of nervous buzz and questioning going on,” said Arthur Caplan, a bioethics professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.
There are broad gray areas, he said: primary care doctors in areas with high infection rates, workers who handle bodies, firefighters who respond to 911 calls, dentists, pathologists who handle coronavirus samples in labs, hospice workers, chaplains.
“Right now, they are asking, ‘Where am I in all of this?’ That’s turned into quite a behind-the-scenes tussle.”
These are hard choices and will become even harder as the vaccine becomes more widely available for the general public and states begin wrestling with the question of who is an essential worker.
“Eventually that fight gets very fierce, but a mini version of that, in defining essential health care workers, is what is going on within the health care system right now,” Caplan said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has laid out categories but they are broad, so each state — and each hospital system — has come up with its own plan and priorities. The result has been a sometimes confusing constellation of rules and groupings that has left health care workers like Baker — as well as professional societies of groups such as pathologists, dentists and medical examiners — wondering where they stand.
“What’s happening is a little confusing,” said Dr. Sally Aiken, a medical examiner for Spokane County in Washington State and president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. “We are not really clear if we are somewhere in Phase 1A or not,” she said, referring to the CDC’s name for the first vaccination group. She noted that rules differed by state.
She voiced a view expressed by many who were interviewed for this article: “We don’t need to be at the top. But we are also trying to respectfully say, ‘Don’t forget about us. We have some risk, too.’ ”
One of the most critical categories has been firefighters and other emergency services workers.
Firefighters, who respond to 911 calls and enter people’s homes, are often a first point of contact with the health care system. They provide about 85% of emergency medical response in the country, said Harold Schaitberger, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters.
But despite their front-line role, he said, it is unclear when they will be vaccinated.
“We should be absolutely up front,” Schaitberger said. Firefighters had to fight to get access to adequate personal protective equipment, he said, and now they are having to do it all over again with the vaccine.
And as the virus surges in many places, that job has only gotten more dangerous. Last week, six of the 33 firefighters serving Newport, Kentucky, a city across the river from Cincinnati, were out of commission because they had either contracted COVID-19 or had close contact with someone who did.
Jake Silvati, president of the Newport Professional Firefighters Local No. 45, said he had not heard a clear answer from the office of Gov. Andy Beshear on where they will fall in line. He said he supported the governor, but he expressed worry that some people responsible for the vaccine rollout may not realize the crucial role that firefighters play.
“The sooner that we can get that vaccine, the higher we can get in line,” Silvati said. “It’s just another tool for us to be healthy.”
Hospitals are ground zero for the vaccine effort, but even there, not everyone can be covered with the first allotment.
Dr. Melanie Swift, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic, is helping that hospital system manage the effort to begin vaccinations of its large staff, mostly in the Midwest.
The system made a spreadsheet of risk categorizations for each of its 72,000 staff members, and the workers with the most frequent, intensive and least controlled contact with COVID-19 patients will be vaccinated first. The first doses of the vaccine, set to arrive this week, will probably cover most of those workers, Swift said, roughly 6,500 people in its flagship Rochester, Minnesota, location.
What other workers have asked when they will get it?
“Oh, only everyone,” she said. “Most people have prefaced their question with, ‘Of course I don’t think I should be ahead of the COVID ICU staff who have been drinking from a fire hose since March. But our pediatric patients don’t stay reliably masked; perhaps we are at increased risk,” she said, listing an example of one common question.
She said she had been telling people that everyone would eventually get vaccinated.
The question of when is a moving target. Dr. William Borden, chief quality and population health officer at G.W. Medical Faculty Associates in Washington, said that the doses it had received would not cover all of the workers in the top priority departments but that he hoped to receive more soon.
Confusion over who goes first is not uncommon.
Ivan Phillips-Schmidt, a traveling nurse in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was working in a hospital Monday when he saw his manager collecting signatures from other workers to get the vaccine.
But when the manager got to Phillips-Schmidt, he said, she walked right past.
Phillips-Schmidt, 23, said he was later told that travel nurses — who work on temporary contracts and have been in high demand as hospitals run short on staffing — would not be vaccinated during Phase 1 of the distribution process. The hospital, Sanford Health, has not told him when Phase 2 begins.
“It makes me feel like I’m just not really valued or not worth protecting,” said Phillips-Schmidt, who said he was one of two traveling nurses in his department. “I’m doing everything that the staff nurses do — dozens, hundreds of COVID exposures.”
A spokeswoman for Sanford Health said that the hospital was not excluding travel nurses from receiving the vaccine but that there was a scheduling problem that may have led to Phillips-Schmidt’s experience.
For some family physicians like Baker in Bismarck, the lack of clarity has been frustrating.
During a news conference in North Dakota on Wednesday, a family physician received the coronavirus vaccine. But it was unclear when health authorities would complete the initial phase and how Baker fits into that.
Baker said his small staff was just as at risk as many hospital workers, considering the high incidence of infection in his state and the sick patients that were coming in every day.
“We’re vulnerable, and we are necessary,” he said.

When Americans receive a coronavirus vaccine, federal rules say they shouldn’t have to pay anything out of pocket.
Congress passed legislation this spring that bars insurers from applying any cost sharing, such as a copayment or deductible. It layered on additional protections barring pharmacies, doctors and hospitals from billing patients.
To consumer advocates, the rules seem nearly ironclad — yet they still fear that surprise vaccine bills will find their way to patients, just as they did with coronavirus testing and treatment earlier this year.
“It is the American health care system, so there are bound to be loopholes we can’t anticipate right now,” said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.
Americans vaccinated this year and next generally will not pay for the vaccine itself, because the federal government has purchased hundreds of millions of doses on patients’ behalf. It has agreed to buy 100 million doses from Pfizer-BioNTech — and is in negotiations for more — and 200 million from Moderna, enough to inoculate 150 million Americans (the vaccines require two shots). It also has orders in to purchase more vaccines still undergoing trials.
The Affordable Care Act provides additional protections, because it requires most health insurers to fully cover all federally recommended preventive care. The CARES Act, passed this spring, supercharged these Obamacare rules.
Usually, insurers have about two years to start covering a newly approved preventive service. The CARES Act required coverage 15 days after a recommendation from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Some insurers, including Aetna and certain Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, have already announced that they will not bill patients for the vaccine or its administration.
“Health insurance providers pay for the administrative fees associated with administering the COVID-19 vaccine,” said David Allen, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans. “The administration fee covers clinicians providing the vaccine to patients, public health reporting, and addressing patient questions.”
The federal government has used other levers to curtail surprise vaccine bills. When it offered enhanced Medicaid payment rates this spring, it required states to fully cover coronavirus vaccines for all their enrollees as a condition of receipt. All 50 states accepted the extra funding, and are now subject to those requirements.
Elsewhere, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires vaccine providers to sign a contract agreeing not to bill patients for the vaccine and the cost of administering it. Out-of-network doctors who do not have a contract with a patient’s private insurance will be required to accept the Medicare rate for administering the vaccine — $16.94 for the first dose and $28.39 for the second, according to rules published in October. For uninsured patients, health providers will need to send those charges to a provider relief fund for reimbursement.
That’s different from the rules around coronavirus treatment, which regulated insurers’ cost sharing but did not take steps to curtail billing by doctors and hospitals. That meant some patients received bills they didn’t expect.
“What makes the vaccine protections unique is that there are requirements on both the insurers and the providers,” said Karyn Schwartz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “It’s a belt-and-suspenders approach that makes the consumer protections much stronger.”
Even with these protections, experts do see some weak spots. One has to do with the type of health coverage Americans carry. Millions are still covered by “grandfathered” health insurance plans, which existed before the Affordable Care Act and are exempt from its rules. So those plans are not required to fully cover the coronavirus vaccine, or any other preventive service.
Experts also worry about uninsured Americans. The United States does not have a national program to cover vaccination costs for them. For coronavirus, it is instructing health providers to submit costs associated with vaccination to a $175 billion Provider Relief Fund created last spring.
The fund had $30 billion remaining as of Nov. 10. There’s no backup source of funding for the uninsured to get covered if it’s depleted.
“The question marks for me are the uninsured, and the folks that are in the unregulated plans,” Corlette said.
Additional fees could accompany a vaccine. Some providers are accustomed to charging a visit fee for all in-person patients. Most emergency rooms charge “facility fees,” the price of coming in the door and seeking care, as do some hospital-based doctors. Some patients receiving coronavirus tests at emergency rooms faced facility fees higher than $1,000, according to billing documents submitted to The New York Times. These fees typically do not exist at retail pharmacies, where many Americans may get vaccinations.
Federal law is quite clear that patients should not have to pay for the vaccine and its administration. But there isn’t language that defines what counts as “vaccine administration,” and whether the visit fee makes the cut.
“The question that I’m still not clear on is what happens if someone walks into an outpatient department that charges a facility fee and gets a vaccine,” said Kao-Ping Chua, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan who has studied coronavirus medical billing. “Is there a possibility they could get charged? I think the answer is yes.”
If patients have adverse reactions to the vaccine and require medical care — as one health care worker in Alaska did earlier this week — they will not have special protections against those charges. If a visit for a vaccine delves into other medical issues — if a patient, for example, also has blood drawn or discusses preexisting conditions with a provider — that could also mean regular fees for care.
Then there is the prospect of Obamacare repeal. Last month the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case aiming to end the Affordable Care Act. If the challenge is successful, it will invalidate the Obamacare mandate to cover preventive services like the coronavirus vaccine.
Insurers may still choose to cover the vaccine — and find it cost-effective to do so, if it prevents hospitalizations — but they could charge a copayment, just as they do for doctor’s visits and prescription drugs.
“All the vaccine coverage hinges on the Affordable Care Act,” Corlette said. “So if that goes away, that is another very big problem.”

Texto completo: Jaws dropped Dec. 10 at St. Elizabeth Healthcare when leaders saw the Fort Thomas hospital listed in the New York Times as one of the busiest COVID-19 care centers in the nation.
St. Elizabeth's main COVID-19 facility, its Fort Thomas hospital, has been busy, the leaders said, but not as busy as that, and they went on the hunt for the mistake.
"When we're living and breathing these numbers by the hour, you know that there was an error there," said Vera Hall, St. Elizabeth's chief nursing executive. "When you hit the New York Times, you stop and drop everything."
Hall and other St. Elizabeth officials pinned the problem on the Kentucky Hospital Association, but a KHA official said the culprit was a coding bug in the computers of the Kentucky Department of Public Health.
That agency is compiling bed capacity data across the commonwealth and reporting it to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Hall said the mistake was not St. Elizabeth's but "a double counting" at the KHA that added the total number of COVID-19 patients at Fort Thomas than the average for the week of Nov. 27 – 145 – and the number of the facility's negative-pressure rooms, which was 100, and came up with 224.
That's the number released Dec. 7 when the federal government initially made its bed capacity data public. The Times then analyzed the data to create lists of the nation's most overtaxed intensive-care units that were published Dec. 10. Fort Thomas came in fourth among larger-population centers, which came as a surprise to Hall and other Fort Thomas officials.
"I know that data is kind of a hot spot, how accurate is the data?" Hall said. "We don't want to further continue the suspicion that the numbers are inflated. But even so, 145 patients – that's a lot of patients."
At the KHA, Melanie Moch, vice president of of data and health information services, said the source of the problem was not at the KHA, although she understood how the St. Elizabeth officials would think so.
The trade association has been working with the state health department to push hospitals to report their bed capacity daily.
"I'm on all the Zoom calls with them, so I can see how they would think it's us," Moch said, but the KHA is not handling the data. The association discovered that earlier this week, St. Elizabeth updated their number, which triggered a coding bug to double-count the Fort Thomas census.
Moch said the health department and the Kentucky Department of Emergency Management went through the coding Dec. 10 and the problem shouldn't happen again.
In August, the Trump administration directed hospitals to stop sending the information to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and instead send it to HHS.
Dr. James Horn, St. Elizabeth's chief quality officer and an emergency doctors, said more patients are seeking care now than on Nov. 27. As of Dec. 10, the system had 170 patients with COVID-19, and some are getting treated at St. Elizabeth Florence.

Texto completo: The claim: Thalidomide, a rapidly approved drug, was banned in the early 1960s after it was discovered to cause birth defects in newborns.
Thalidomide and its side effects continue to be cited by vaccination skeptics as a cautionary tale of a harmful drug that governments allowed to hit the market. Since March, multiple social media posts have drawn parallels between thalidomide and the development of COVID-19 vaccines, warning people to be cautious of quickly produced medicines.
One tweet on thalidomide, reposted on Facebook and shared more than 1,000 times, asks "RAPID 8 months tested vaccine?" That is followed by, "THALIDOMIDE was a RAPID APPROVED drug introduced in 1957 to counteract nausea and insomnia in pregnant women. It was marketed in 50 countries before being withdrawn in 1962 due to malformations in newborns." It advises, “Be very careful with what’s coming,” above a black-and-white photo of children with missing and deformed arms.
Tyler Green, an Australian resident who sent the thalidomide tweet, told USA TODAY the goal of his post was to encourage people to be “appropriately cautious of hastily approved medications.”

Discovering defects
Thalidomide was introduced in the late 1950s and widely marketed as a safe, over-the-counter sleep sedative. It was eventually sold in 46 countries, though never in the United States. According to an article from Northwestern University, thalidomide sales at the time rivaled those of aspirin.
Around 1960, doctors started prescribing the drug to pregnant women experiencing morning sickness. Doctors and newspapers, however, soon reported that babies whose mothers took thalidomide were being born with phocomelia, a rare condition that causes missing, shortened and flipper-like limbs.
By 1962, most countries where thalidomide was sold banned the drug, but not before it caused an estimated 10,000 children to be born with phocomelia.
Executives of a West German pharmaceutical company eventually stood trial for continuing to produce and sell the drug even after reports of phocomelia arose. The charges were dropped in 1970, after the company agreed to pay victims $27.3 million ($183 million in today’s money).

'A complete overhaul'
The rise and fall of thalidomide prompted regulators across the globe to strengthen testing protocols for new drugs.
Though thalidomide was never approved in the United States, it was given to around 20,000 residents in clinical trials and distributed to more than 1,000 physicians. Credit for keeping the drug out of American’s medicine cabinets belongs to an FDA inspector named Dr. Frances Kelsey, who blocked thalidomide’s approval, withstanding pressure from pharmaceutical officials and her own agency.
“The case of that drug led to a complete overhaul in the approval and marketing of drugs in the US and beyond,” said Julie Swann, a systems engineer at N.C. State University who advised the federal government’s response to the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
More: Fact check: Bell's palsy among COVID-19 trial participants likely unrelated to Pfizer vaccine
In 1962, Congress passed the Kefauver-Harris Amendments, which set new safeguards for drug testing and approval. Manufacturers now had to prove drugs’ efficacy before they entered the market. The FDA gained more supervision over clinical trials, which over the years became more complex and thorough.
The new regulations positioned doctors and the FDA as “important market gatekeepers between consumers and pharmaceutical companies,” writes Xaq Frohlich, a history professor at Auburn University who researches the history of the FDA.
Today, drug development in the United States involves a preclinical stage with no human subjects, followed by three phases with progressively more volunteer subjects. Only then may the FDA approve a drug.
Modern vaccine development
As global death totals rise, governments have accelerated their development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines. Some counties have already approved the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, and other vaccines appear on the horizon.
Though health experts acknowledge the process has been quickened, they assure the process producing COVID-19 vaccines has been unlike what happened six decades ago with thalidomide.
“Like in all things, there can be mistakes or new knowledge that arises, but it is a misrepresentation to use thalidomide as a case study of what is happening in the federal approval process now,” Swann said. She noted government regulators today have “many more checks and balances” to monitor drug safety.
In the United States, where the coronavirus has already killed more than 300,000 people, Operation Warp Speed has let companies manufacture vaccine doses even as trials were being conducted. Still, no vaccines will be administered until they receive FDA approval and a CDC recommendation.
Thalidomide is no longer widely prescribed, but it is still used to treat two conditions: inflammation tied to Hansen’s disease (also known as leprosy) and multiple myeloma.
Our ruling: Missing context
We rate this claim as MISSING CONTEXT, in that it may mislead without more information. Thalidomide did cause birth defects in an estimated 10,000 babies before being pulled from the market in the early 1960s. Yet connecting thalidomide to COVID-19 vaccines is misleading. Thalidomide did not undergo the same extensive clinical trials as the COVID-19 vaccine; it actually instigated reforms in drug testing and approval. There is no evidence that the accelerated process behind COVID-19 vaccines circumvented the modern standards of health regulators like the FDA.

Texto completo: In this era of working from home and schooling from home and exercising from home and making sourdough from home, the question will soon present itself: What else is there to do from home?
For kids, the answer might be to publish a newspaper from home. And now there are ample apps and websites to turn their ideas into real publications.
Kids starting their own paper is like a dam with a crack. And the moment they realize they have complete agency to report what they want, write what they want, as well as add comics? That's the flood.
The upsides to a homegrown newspaper are myriad. Kids learn how to investigate and listen, differentiate between reliable and unreliable sources, research and fact-check, and, perhaps most importantly, learn that their own interests have value. Plus a kitchen-table newspaper does wonders for a child's writing and editing skills.
Children by their very inquisitiveness have the makings of a great journalists. They are innately curious, naturally unbiased and typically don't let up until their questions are answered.
Here are some instructions for any budding journalists wishing to embark on a do-it-yourself literary adventure.
Start with the name.
Most people find that the most inspiring first step is titling the publication. Maybe the newspaper is named after the kids' neighborhood, state or dog. Add a secondary word like Dealer, Daily, Weekly, Post, Bulletin, Sentinel, Gazette, Tribune, Globe, Observer, Journal or even Picayune, and you've got yourself a newspaper name.
Select a focus.
Next, they need to think about what topics they want to cover. If kids actually sit at a table and write down all of their ideas, they have technically had their first editorial meeting. Discipline and structure aren't going to be the easiest skills to embrace (they are likely to be the hardest), but they are necessary. Even in the loosest possible way.
Create sections.
Coming up with story ideas can be daunting, especially to little kids, so maybe start with the sections they want: sports, school, climate. Or perhaps politics, opinion or comics, jokes and games. Pets and snacks and presidential cartoons? Sure! Even the vaguest idea of sections will inform the work ahead.
Delegate responsibilities.
Whether working with siblings or other kids remotely, the teamwork required in establishing duties and meting out responsibilities cannot be underestimated. This phase is guaranteed to raise tempers; there may be tears. Once you have a sports editor, someone in charge of the cover art, a photo director, a makeshift city desk, perhaps even a food critic, tasks will flow easier and kids will come out stronger.
Gather the stories.
The first thing a reporter needs to know is where to get information. This is a great opportunity for kids to learn the difference between primary sources (an interview with the owner of a local music store) and secondary sources (reading a reliable article about the best music of 2020). While primary sources are always preferable, they're not always necessary.
The best reporting usually involves interviewing an expert. This might sound daunting until they realize: Everyone is an expert in something. The expert may be a teacher or a student talking about virtual learning, the owner of a dog rescue explaining how to adopt a pit bull or a local librarian on the best scary books for fifth-graders.
The young reporter's job is to find experts who can supply information that is both factual and relevant.
It may not always be possible to obtain interviews, so an understanding of credible online sources is important. Given that it is a crowdsourced content hub, Wikipedia cannot be trusted as a credible source. A good alternative is brittanica.com, any website with a .gov or .edu address, a reliable newspaper or Google Scholar.
Start writing.
For the novice, a question-and-answer format is a great place to start since it doesn't require much writing beyond transcribing the interview. Writing an actual article - one with an introduction, supporting facts and a conclusion - is terrific practice and often mirrors what sixth- and seventh-graders are learning in school.
Remember the puzzles and the comics.
History tells us that a newspaper is not a newspaper without a crossword. If there was ever a place to put arbitrary facts to good use, it is here. Puzzlemaker.discoveryeducation.com or CreateWordSearchPuzzle.com do the work of building the puzzle, so the kids can focus on the theme, the words and the clues.
The comics section will not be a hard sell. Websites such as storyboardthat.com and canva.com let the artist choose a scene, select a template and drop in characters.
Teach the value of intellectual property.
For a lot of kids, creating a piece of journalism will seem as simple as cutting and pasting an article from The New York Times and putting it in quotation marks with an attribution at the end. Have them put that piece in their own words and get another source. Encourage children to ask themselves where the idea came from, if they used any of the same words as one of their sources, or if they borrowed a phrase, joke or idea from someone else and forgot to give credit.
Call in the art department.
The creative director is very likely to be the same person as the sports editor and the crossword writer. Again, the rules of plagiarism apply: An amazing picture of a polar bear in the local paper is not up for grabs without permission or proper attribution. Kids can explore a stock website, such as istockphoto.com, which has a massive inventory of images for sale.
Put it all together.
Making it look like a real newspaper is the fun part. My Newspaper app (available on an iPhone or iPad), newspaperclub.com and makemynewspaper.com are all user-friendly options with pre-existing templates. Should the newspaper become a magazine, websites like flipsnack.com and canva.com can accommodate templates, layouts and printing.
Read all about it!
For distribution, kids can walk around the neighborhood, pass it out on the corner, maybe even start their own newspaper bike route. Just be sure each copy has an email address so that readers can comment on all the hard work.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
After doctors found cancer in Dr. Mark Samberg’s prostate last spring, the 70-year-old retired urologist prepared to have his prostate removed. He knew that the surgery would cure him, assuming the cancer was confined to the organ.
But his doctors had a nagging concern — the cancer cells seen on the biopsy were aggressive and may already have escaped from his prostate. If so, the operation would not cure him. The problem for Samberg, and for many men with aggressive prostate cancer, was this: If there are cancer cells outside the prostate, how can they be found?
Now the Food and Drug Administration has approved a test that can locate prostate cancer cells wherever they are. Exuberant cancer specialists said the test would alter treatment for patients nationwide.
“It’s the most exciting thing in prostate cancer in my lifetime,” said Dr. Kirsten Greene, chair of the urology department at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.
The test relies on a radioactive tag attached to a molecule that homes in on prostate cancer cells that have spread to other locations in the body and may seed new tumors. Once tagged, the clusters of cells appear as bright spots on PET scans.
At the moment, the FDA’s approval applies only to testing at the University of California, San Francisco, and the University of California, Los Angeles, which conducted clinical trials. But several companies hope to market similar tests soon.
“It’s absolutely fabulous,” said Dr. Oliver Sartor, professor of medicine at Tulane University School of Medicine. When he learned that the test had been approved, he said, he danced in his office “and had a toast of imaginary champagne.”
Now specialists are hoping to use the technique to kill cancer cells, not just find them. The idea is to attach a radioactive drug to the molecule that seeks out prostate cancer cells. The molecule will deliver the drug directly to those cells and, it is hoped, the radiation will destroy the cancer. Experiments already have begun at UCSF and UCLA.
The road to the new test has been long. Nearly 30 years ago, researchers discovered that prostate cancer cells carry a unique protein on their surfaces called prostate specific membrane antigen, or PSMA. More recently, researchers found small molecules that could home in on PSMA.
Scientists theorized that radioactive tracers attached to those molecules could make prostate cancer cells visible on PET scans. In 2010, researchers at the University of Heidelberg in Germany published the first images of prostate cancer cells located in this way.
Over the past four years, studies involving about 1,000 patients by Dr. Jeremie Calais, a nuclear medicine physician at UCLA, and Dr. Thomas Hope, a nuclear medicine physician at UCSF, showed that the scan accurately detected prostate cancer cells anywhere in the body before treatment and even after treatment, when cancer may recur.
The research led to changes in treatment for most patients, including decisions to recommend targeted radiation, guided by the scans, rather than chemotherapy or androgen-blocking therapy, treatments that impact the entire body.
Hope described two situations in which the PET scans can transform treatment decisions.
Most men learn they have prostate cancer when a simple blood test finds high levels of prostate specific antigen, or PSA. The next step is a biopsy of the prostate and removal of cancer cells for examination to see how aggressive they appear.
Men often have MRI scans to see if the capsule surrounding the prostate has been breached — a sign the cancer has gotten out. And doctors consider how high PSA levels are. The higher they are, the more cancer in the body and the more likely it has spread.
The second scenario occurs after a man has had his prostate removed or destroyed by radiation. If the patient’s PSA levels start to rise months or years later, the cancer that doctors thought they had cured had already seeded itself elsewhere in the man’s body.
In both situations, “we know they have disease, but we don’t know where it is,” Hope said. The new scan seems able to show doctors where to look. The researchers are conducting studies to see if these treatment revisions ultimately prolong patients’ lives.
Samberg, who lives in Sacramento, California, was one of the participants in the UCSF trial. Before his scheduled prostatectomy, the scan turned up cancerous cells in his bones and lymph nodes. “That was shocking,” he said.
Without the new test, the doctors would have removed Samberg’s prostate, and they would have realized he still had cancer when his PSA levels began to rise. In such a case, doctors usually irradiate the area where the prostate used to be — the prostate bed, which is the site of remaining cancers a bit more than half the time.
For Samberg, that procedure, like the prostatectomy, would not have helped. “Standard therapy for me would fail,” he said. Instead, the discovery that his cancer was in his bones and lymph nodes pointed to targeted radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and, most recently, immunotherapy.
“I am in complete remission,” Samberg said. “I hope it makes a difference long term.”

Texto completo: Jaws dropped Dec. 10 at St. Elizabeth Healthcare when leaders saw the Fort Thomas hospital listed in the New York Times as one of the busiest COVID-19 care centers in the nation.
St. Elizabeth's main COVID-19 facility, its Fort Thomas hospital, has been busy, the leaders said, but not as busy as that, and they went on the hunt for the mistake.
"When we're living and breathing these numbers by the hour, you know that there was an error there," said Vera Hall, St. Elizabeth's chief nursing executive. "When you hit the New York Times, you stop and drop everything."
Hall and other St. Elizabeth officials pinned the problem on the Kentucky Hospital Association, but a KHA official said the culprit was a coding bug in the computers of the Kentucky Department of Public Health. That agency is compiling bed capacity data across the commonwealth and reporting it to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Hall said the mistake was not St. Elizabeth's but "a double counting" at the KHA that added the total number of COVID-19 patients at Fort Thomas than the average for the week of Nov. 27 – 145 – and the number of the facility's negative-pressure rooms, which was 100, and came up with 224.
That's the number released Dec. 7 when the federal government initially made its bed capacity data public. The Times then analyzed the data to create lists of the nation's most overtaxed intensive-care units that were published Dec. 10. Fort Thomas came in fourth among larger-population centers, which came as a surprise to Hall and other Fort Thomas officials.
"I know that data is kind of a hot spot, how accurate is the data?" Hall said. "We don't want to further continue the suspicion that the numbers are inflated. But even so, 145 patients – that's a lot of patients."
At the KHA, Melanie Moch, vice president of of data and health information services, said the source of the problem was not at the KHA, although she understood how the St. Elizabeth officials would think so. The trade association has been working with the state health department to push hospitals to report their bed capacity daily.
"I'm on all the Zoom calls with them, so I can see how they would think it's us," Moch said, but the KHA is not handling the data. The association discovered that earlier this week, St. Elizabeth updated their number, which triggered a coding bug to double-count the Fort Thomas census.
Moch said the health department and the Kentucky Department of Emergency Management went through the coding Dec. 10 and the problem shouldn't happen again.
In August, the Trump administration directed hospitals to stop sending the information to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and instead send it to HHS.
Dr. James Horn, St. Elizabeth's chief quality officer and an emergency doctors, said more patients are seeking care now than on Nov. 27. As of Dec. 10, the system had 170 patients with COVID-19, and some are getting treated at St. Elizabeth Florence.

Texto completo: If you've ever wanted to know where best-selling authors get inspiration to write their novels, now is your chance.
MorseLife Health System will take on the role of an online literary cafe this season by offering live discussions with four award-winning authors.
The organization's annual Literary Society Series, which has moved to a virtual platformbecause of the coronavirus pandemic, begins at 9:30 a.m. today with one monthly author talk through March 11.
The series will give donors the opportunity to hear from Alka Joshi ("The Henna Artist") today; Emma Donoghue ("The Pull of the Stars") on Jan. 14; Ann Patchett ("The Dutch House") on Feb. 11; and Brit Bennett ("The Vanishing Half") on March 11 as they talk about their writing process and their inspiration for their novels.
Joshi's "The Henna Artist" was voted Best Historical Fiction and Best Debut Novel by the Goodreads Choice Awards in 2020 and has been named A Reese's Book Club Pick. The novel also is a New York Times, USA Today, Publishers Weekly, Toronto Star and Calgary Herald bestseller.
Donoghue is best known for her international bestseller, "Room," New York Times Best Book of 2010 and finalist for the Man Booker, Commonwealth and Orange prizes. Her screen adaptation of the book was nominated for four Academy Awards.
Patchett has been the recipient of awards such as the Women's National Book Association's Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Her books have been in The New York Times Notable Books and New York Times bestsellers.
Bennett's "The Vanishing Half" has topped The New York Times Bestseller list and was a Good Morning America Book Club Pick.
Joan Bever, vice president of Events for MorseLife, said the organization's Literary Society has always been one of their most popular events.
"We felt that it was more important than ever to stay engaged and connected with our supporters so we decided to add a fourth presentation and take the series virtual," Bever told the Daily News. "Each season, we always try to procure a diverse variety of novels that are interesting to our audience. This next season's award-winning authors will surely create great conversations for attendees of MorseLife's Literary Society Series."
A Q&A session will follow each presentation, moderated by MorseLife Literary Society's event chairs, Cynthia Berenson, Penny Blumenstein and Marlene Strauss.
"MorseLife has been hosting the Literary Society for 13 years now as a way to introduce more people to our mission," said President and CEO of MorseLife Health System Keith Myers in a press release. "With support from our Annual Giving Society members, who include supporters of this beloved Literary Society, we've been able to expand our operations with new programs that are dedicated to enhancing the lives of seniors."
A charitable, nonprofit organization, MorseLife has launched programs that seek to improve the lives of seniors for 37 years. Their programs include short-term rehabilitation, long-term care, independent and assisted living, home health care, Hospice services, memory care and meals-on-wheels.
Tickets are readily available to members of the organization's Annual Giving Society. For more information about how to get tickets, or to participate in the Literary Society Series, email events@morselife.org or call 561-242-4661.

Deaths higher than thought in 25-44 age group

Texto completo: While many believe that COVID-19 is a disease that only kills the elderly, a study found that the virus also contributed to excess death in adults between the ages of 25 and 44.
Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital found that 76,000 Americans in this age range died from March through July, nearly 12,000 more than expected based on prior seasonal trends, according to the research letter published Wednesday in JAMA.
On average, about 38% of those deaths were attributed directly to COVID-19. In some regions, like New York and New Jersey, about 80% of excess deaths were attributed to the disease.
In regions that experienced substantial surges, COVID-19 deaths "equaled or exceeded the number of deaths caused by unintentional opioid overdoses in 2018," said Dr. Jeremy Faust, lead author and ER physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
Other headlines:
Texas has become the second state to surpass 1.5 million COVID-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. Only 10 countries have topped that figure.
The other state with more than 1.5 million cases, California, has ordered an additional 5,000 body bags and stationed mobile morgues in hospitals in the hardest-hit counties, including Los Angeles and San Diego, Gov. Gavin Newsom said.
Cases have declined in some Midwestern states, including Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Nebraska. Hospitalizations and deaths are still on the rise due to an earlier surge of infections.
The U.S. has seen 16.7 million cases and 304,000 deaths.
Pfizer facing vaccine manufacturing problems
The leaders of Operation Warp Speed on Wednesday addressed a report in The New York Times that the Trump administration didn't secure more doses of the Pfizer vaccine when the option was available.
"It wouldn't make sense whatsoever to pre-order more from one vaccine manufacturer than any other one before we knew a vaccine works," said Moncef Slaoui, who leads Operation Warp Speed.
Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Pfizer has come up about half short of what the company expected to produce this year. Azar said Pfizer is working at "maximum capacity" to deliver the 100 million doses it is contracted to supply to the U.S., and that the government is looking to expand the contract in the second quarter.
The government's relationship with Pfizer is contractually different than to the ones with the other vaccine makers, Azar said.
"On the other five (vaccine makers), we are more intimately engaged in the support of the development and manufacturing of their product on an ongoing basis, whereas the relationship Pfizer wanted with Operation Warp Speed was the guaranteed purchase of vaccine if approved by the FDA," Azar said.
Vaccine distribution updates
Some 2 million more doses are set to be delivered next week. On Thursday, 886 more deliveries will be made to locations across the U.S. as the country continues "a steady drumbeat cadence of deliveries of vaccine out to American people," said Gen. Gus Perna, who is heading distribution logistics.
Starting as soon as Friday in Ohio and Connecticut, residents of long-term care facilities will begin vaccinations, Perna said. The efforts in long-term care centers will expand to more than 1,100 facilities by Monday then increase by thousands a day.
Perna also described the efforts to increase distribution of the vaccine at pharmacies around the country, with 19 chains partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Through those partnerships, Perna said he expects a gradual roll-out starting in mid-January that will cover 37,000 brick-and-mortar facilities.
Perna said four trays of vaccine, two in California and two in Alabama, dropped below the required storage temperatures when transported. Perna said officials were able to identify those trays and that they never left the trucks. The doses were sent back to Pfizer, which, with the FDA, will determine whether they are still safe and effective.
Ex-CDC appointees detail Trump meddling
Two former GOP political appointees to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described in New York Times interviews how the Trump administration meddled in the agency's science and corroded trust in the once-apolitical health institution.
"Everyone wants to describe the day that the light switch flipped and the CDC was sidelined. It didn't happen that way," Kyle McGowan, former CDC chief of staff, told The Times. "It was more of like a hand grasping something, and it slowly closes, closes, closes, closes until you realize that, middle of the summer, it has a complete grasp on everything at the CDC."
McGowan and former deputy chief of staff Amanda Campbell, who left the CDC in August, depicted episodes of the White House injecting politics into the agency's guidance, briefings and Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports, a noted publication.
"It wasn't until something was in the M.M.W.R. that was in contradiction to what message the White House and H.H.S. were trying to put forward that they became scrutinized," Campbell told the Times.

AJC SENATE WATCH: Ossoff knocks Perdue's stock trades amid pandemic: Trades early in year were well above the senator's average.

Texto completo: "Senator David Perdue profited from the pandemic, while he downplayed the risk -- undermined doctors and scientists -- compared coronavirus to the common flu." --Jon Ossoff in ad released in October.
What we found:
The eyes of the nation are on Georgia, where David Perdue, a one-term Republican, is locked in one of two high-stakes runoffs to determine which party narrowly controls the U.S. Senate. As the campaign proceeded through the fall and polls showed a tightening race, his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff ramped up his attacks on Perdue for some stock trades that were made early in the year, just as the possible impact of the coronavirus coming into focus.
Perdue, one of the wealthier members of the U.S. Senate, has repeatedly said he has done nothing wrong. He also has said his stock trades are handled by independent advisers and without his input, although recent news reports by The New York Times and other news outlets indicate the senator has provided those advisers guidance, at least to some degree.
It is illegal to use nonpublic information gained as a company insider or member of Congress to make investment decisions. Perdue, through his campaign staff, says federal agents have looked at his recent stock trading and found no wrongdoing.
In late January, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported near Seattle on Jan. 20. Four days later, select members of Congress met behind closed doors for a coronavirus briefing. Perdue was not at that meeting, according to his campaign.
During this period, Reuters reported daily updates were being presented to members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on the worldwide spread of the virus. Perdue is not a member of that committee.
Still, his stock trades, between late January and mid-February, numbered nearly 100 and were well above his average. This included up to $245,000 in stock purchases in Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant that's been racing to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, and up to $185,000 in stock of DuPont De Nemours, makers of personal protective equipment used to avoid exposure to the virus. In addition, he sold $165,000 in stocks for Caesar Entertainment, a major player in the casino industry that's been hard-hit by the pandemic.
According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, his stock portfolio swelled in value by about $500,000 from December 2019 to April 2020, even though not all his trades appeared to capitalize on the pandemic. For example, he also made new investments in Disney and Delta Airlines, two companies that have not fared well in the pandemic, and sold stock in two now much-in-demand companies, Kroger grocery store chain and Proctor & Gamble, the maker of Mr. Clean, Comet, Swiffer and other top cleaning brands.
The senator's re-election campaign says that the Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee cleared him. The proof his camp offers is an excerpt from a June 16 letter in which Deborah Sue Mayer, the Senate Ethics Committee's chief counsel, wrote that the panel "did not find evidence that your actions violated federal law, Senate Rules, or standards of conduct" and considered the matter closed, the AJC reported.
The campaign has not responded to repeated requests by The AJC for the entire letter.
PolitiFact reported that Perdue campaign spokesman John Burke said Ossoff's claims had been debunked. PolitiFact also said last week that Perdue's Nov. 30 campaign ad isn't accurate.
"For one thing, there has been no public disclosure that the Senate Ethics committee investigated Perdue at all," PolitiFact reported. Perdue's ad also say he was "exonerated." Federal law enforcement agencies generally decide to prosecute or not, rather than exonerate, the Politi-Fact report said.
The Senate Ethics committee seldom finds fault in members of the U.S. Senate, the AJC reported. "An analysis of the committee's publicly available annual reports from 2007 through 2019 shows it received 1,189 complaints of alleged violations. Not one resulted in a disciplinary sanction, records show," the AJC report said.
Last month, The New York Times reported that Perdue and other lawmakers were investigated by the Justice Department for possible insider trading related to investments they made early in the coronavirus spread. Investigators, according to the Times, found that an executive with Atlanta-based financial technology company Cardlytics had mistakenly sent an email in January to Perdue, a former company board member, that vaguely referenced coming changes to the company.
The Times reported that Perdue told one of his investment advisers, shortly after receiving the email, to sell $1 million worth of stock in Cardlytics, or about 20 percent of his holdings in the company -- suggesting the senator could be more closely involved in his stock trades than previously indicated.
Perdue's campaign says there is no contradiction. He had no control over how most stocks he held in individual companies was managed, a campaign strategist said.
Ossoff, who finished second to Perdue in the November general election, has said the stock trades are evidence that the Republican is a crook, though the senator has not been convicted of any crime. He also has called for reform measures requiring all members of Congress to place their stocks in blind trusts.
In his Oct. 2 ad, Ossoff accuses Perdue of downplaying the potential harm from the virus, comparing it to the common flu and saying, "We've had ordinary flu seasons with more deaths." Perdue did make those statements.
But other parts of Perdue's record also shows he did understand the gravity of the situation. In a public service announcement he made in late March, he said: "First of all, I know this virus is causing a lot of concern, and rightfully so. Let me assure you of this: the world's best public health officials are right here in Georgia at the CDC. They're working around the clock to help contain this virus and to develop a vaccine."

Texto completo: I will take the vaccine when my turn comes because I believe it’s my civic duty. Also, I don’t want to get sick, writes Liz Soares.
I may be waiting until 616,700 Mainers have been vaccinated against COVID-19 before I am.
This is based on a handy online tool provided by The New York Times. I submitted my age and county of residence; noted whether I am a health care worker, essential worker, first responder or teacher, and indicated whether I had COVID-related health risks.
As an over-60 teacher, I thought I might be a little higher in the lineup. Not that I mind. I wear my mask, keep my distance and wash my hands. I have seen that these measures work when they are consistently implemented, as they are in my school.
I’m thrilled the vaccines are coming, but I’m also anxious about getting one. I’m perfectly fine in the middle of the pack. That said, I will take the vaccine when my turn comes, because I believe it’s my civic duty. Also, I don’t want to get sick.
The New York Times tool displays a virtual line of 100 people to demonstrate where I am standing right now. Ahead of me in this order are health care workers, nursing home residents, first responders, people with health risks, other elderly people and essential workers.
It’s a nifty graphic, with health care providers in their scrubs and young adults with their backpacks and hoodies. Everyone is wearing a mask.
I wondered what exactly an essential worker is. There are an estimated 41,000 of them in Maine. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the term covers employees in 12 different fields, including food and agriculture, information technology, and water and wastewater management.
If I’m sounding like a COVID-19 geek right about now, it’s because I am. I’m a school librarian with a background in journalism, so I firmly believe knowledge is power. I haven’t missed one of Maine CDC Director Nirav D. Shah’s news briefings since he began doing them in March. If I’m working or otherwise busy at 2 p.m., I watch it online later.
I want to know how many new cases there are and where the outbreaks are happening. A grim narrative has unfolded over the past nine months. In the beginning, uncertainty and fear. Then, hopefulness with so few cases in the summer. Now, a surge, with higher and higher numbers and many more outbreaks.
I’ve been fascinated — and impressed — with the rapid growth of our knowledge about this virus. Our last day of school before the shutdown was March 13. The first case in Maine had been announced the previous day, and for the first time, students were concerned, asking questions. At that point, the only advice we were getting was don’t hug or shake hands.
Then the discussion about mask wearing began. I remember the first time I went to the supermarket and saw many people wearing masks. Mask wearing hadn’t been mandated yet. There was still uncertainty over whether they protected wearers from droplets emitted by others. No matter. The next time I shopped, I wore a mask. Better safe than sorry, I figured. Plus, I have that civic duty thing going on.
Now we know that masks prevent our germs from going out, as well as others’ from coming in. Schools were able to reopen and stay in session much longer than I and my colleagues predicted. Americans are being vaccinated as I write this. It’s amazing. I feel like I’m watching history happen.
My husband and I recently rewatched the HBO miniseries “John Adams,” based on the David McCullough biography. In a powerful scene, a doctor inoculates Abigail Adams and her four children against smallpox. It’s a horrifying procedure. He uses a lancet to cut their skin and then injects pus from a smallpox victim.
Next, viewers see the victim, covered with sores, lying in the back of a cart, clutching a cross. The doctor scrapes his skin for the next inoculation.
The Adams’ survived, although young Nabby developed a bad case and was scarred for the rest of her life. Luckily, though some of us may have fears and concerns about taking a brand new vaccine, we do not have to take the risk Abigail Adams took, or endure such a gruesome procedure.
Reflecting on the bravery of people who endured difficult times helps me find the courage I need just to go about my daily life these days. But I am also reassured by the thought that even without a firm grasp of science, doctors were able to slow the spread of smallpox in the 18th century. Now, not only do we have the wherewithal to produce a vaccine in nine months, we can predict when a 60-plus teacher in Kennebec County might get it.
As Winston Churchill said after the British defeated German forces at El Alamein: “This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”

Taliban Use Lethal 'Sticky Bombs' Nearly Daily to Terrorize Afghans

Texto completo: The Taliban's recent shift to magnetic bombs to target Afghan officials in Kabul underscores the government's struggle to protect its own people.
KABUL, Afghanistan -- As he has done most workdays, Mahbubullah Mohibi left his home on Tuesday morning in a white armored S.U.V. with government plates, bound for his office job as deputy governor for Kabul Province.
His driver was wheeling through the narrow streets of Kabul's Macroyan neighborhood when the S.U.V. was rocked by an explosion. Mr. Mohibi, 42, and his secretary were killed and two bodyguards were wounded, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said.
Someone had attached a homemade magnetic bomb to Mr. Mohibi's vehicle, an increasingly common and lethal tactic targeting government officials and other prominent Afghans in the capital.
The dull, crumpling echo of a magnetic bomb detonation has lately provided the daily soundtrack to Kabul's busy morning commute. A so-called "sticky bomb" exploded nearly every day somewhere in Afghanistan this fall -- with dozens such attacks in Kabul alone the past six months, according to New York Times tallies.
A few hours after the attack on Mr. Mohibi, a magnetic bomb killed Abdul Rahman Atshan, the provincial council deputy chief of central Afghanistan's Ghor Province, and seriously injured a council member riding with him, a provincial police spokesman said.
And on Wednesday morning, a police officer and a government intelligence officer were killed in separate blasts in Kabul caused by magnetic bombs attached to their vehicles, a police official said.
Magnetic bombs are part of a Taliban strategy to sow terror and chaos among Afghans, particularly in the capital, local security officials say. Coupled with assassinations of government employees, security forces and civil leaders by roving gunmen, the attacks have underscored the government's inability to protect its own people -- and are adding fuel to the public's growing discontent and distrust of Afghanistan's leaders in the midst of their efforts to negotiate peace terms with the Taliban.
"It's a great outcome for the Taliban -- each one is like a news bomb in the media," Mohammad Arif Rahmani, a member of the Afghan Parliament's security committee, said of the magnetic explosives. "These bombs are spreading big fears through society."
As part of a deal signed with the United States in February that laid out the timeline for a final American withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Taliban pledged to curtail mass-casualty attacks, like truck-bombings, in cities.But the group has instead expanded its use of magnetic bombs to demonstrate the extent of its reach into the capital, as well as the government's vulnerability, as it seeks leverage at the next round of peace talks that are scheduled to reconvene in Qatar in January.
Magnetic bombs have been used in Afghanistan since the early years of the insurgency around 2005, as well as in Iraq. But the intensified pace of such attacks this year has shifted the security equation in Kabul, forcing anyone connected to the government to reassess how and when they use their vehicles.
Kabul's chaotic traffic works to bombers' advantage. Vehicles are often pinned in traffic jams, where attackers on motorbikes or passing pedestrians can ease past and furtively attach a magnetic bomb.
The capital now feels like a city under siege, with something as prosaic as a commute to work a source of dread, and every car on the street a potential deathtrap.
"The situation is so unpredictable -- you don't know what will happen tomorrow when you get into your car," said Aiman Mayar, 22, whose father, a Ministry of Education official, was killed by a magnetic bomb in Kabul three months ago.
The official, Dr. Abdul Baqi Amin, was riding in a ministry vehicle that had been parked in a ministry parking lot the night before, his son said. Like the loved ones of so many other bombing victims, Mr. Mayar was left wondering why his father was targeted -- and how someone managed to attach an explosive device to his vehicle despite government bodyguards and security precautions.
"I want to know how it's possible that a car with a governmental number plate gets blown up with a magnetic bomb and the government doesn't even know who did it or how," Mr. Mayar said. "It's been three months since they promised an investigation, but there's been nothing."
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for some magnetic bomb blasts, but others go unclaimed, such as the attacks on Mr. Mayar's father and Mr. Mohibi, exacerbating public fears that anyone could be targeted at any time for reasons that will never be explained.
The brazen attacks leave an enduring impression that the militants can operate in the government's capital with near impunity, said Atiqullah Amarkhel, a retired Afghan general who watched an insurgency slowly strangle Kabul in the early 1990s until Afghanistan's Russian-backed government collapsed.
"Kabul is an open city -- these Taliban live here and make their bombs here," Mr. Amarkhel said. "After each one of the magnetic bomb explosions, the government gets more discredited."
The magnetic bombs are typically assembled using plastic high explosives and powerful magnets, a government intelligence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said insurgents smuggle explosives into Kabul using an underground courier system known as belti.
Attackers try to attach the bombs as close as possible to a car's fuel tank to ensure that the vehicle is engulfed in flames. The devices can be detonated remotely with radio signals or with a time-delay fuse.
At the same time, the Taliban have stepped up widespread attacks against government forces in rural provinces and remote district centers. Afghan civilians are frequently killed in the crossfire. At least 212 civilians were killed in October, the deadliest month for civilians since September 2019, according to data compiled by The New York Times.
Even low-level functionaries affiliated with the government have been targeted by magnetic bombs. In October, Yousaf Jan, an Afghan contractor hired to deliver fuel for police vehicles, was killed by a bomb attached to his delivery vehicle in Khost Province in eastern Afghanistan.
Gul Nawaz, the contractor's cousin, said he had no idea who had attacked Mr. Jan or why.
"I just know that nobody has investigated his case and nobody has helped his family," Mr. Nawaz said.
The magnetic bomb attacks are likely to persist. The device is a brutally effective weapon -- cheap, precise and lethal.
"It doesn't cost much and requires little in the way of facilities," said Mr. Rahmani, the Parliament security member. "But it has a very high impact."

Texto completo: Until Jeffrey Toobin's fateful appointment with Zoom on Oct. 15, his quarantine was going better than most people's.
In August, his eighth book, "True Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Investigation of Donald Trump," about Robert Mueller's inquiry into election meddling, was published, getting positive reviews and a brief berth on the New York Times best-seller list. His third, about the Monica Lewinsky scandal, is being filmed by Ryan Murphy for a limited series on FX.
And over on HBO, he was about to appear as himself on the whodunit "The Undoing," delivering commentary on the murder trial that shapes the story's arc.
Then in a matter of minutes, Mr. Toobin, 60, committed the act that would make him subject, not observer, of scandal, investigation and commentary. While working on a podcast about the presidential election for WNYC and The New Yorker with some of the magazine's other well-known journalists, including Jane Mayer and Masha Gessen, he was seen lowering and raising his computer camera, exposing and touching his penis, and motioning an air kiss to someone other than his colleagues, Mx. Gessen said. The magazine suspended Mr. Toobin that day and executives began an investigation.
"It wasn't a full-out sexual act, but it was much more than a second," Mx. Gessen said. "I was really, truly shocked."
Four days later, Vice broke the news about the incident. New York Public Radio, the parent organization of WNYC, which in 2017 fired the broadcasters Leonard Lopate and Jonathan Schwartz after accusations of inappropriate behavior, informed employees and board members in an email that Mr. Toobin, a frequent contributor, was banned "indefinitely" from its airwaves and podcasts.
And the gavel of public opinion came banging down. Jimmy Fallon made fun of Mr. Toobin on "The Tonight Show." Donald J. Trump Jr., whom the journalist had criticized, was among those gleefully heckling him on Twitter. So was O.J. Simpson, whose murder trial Mr. Toobin made his name covering. ("At least Pee Wee Herman was in a X-rated movie theater," Mr. Simpson said in a video.)
Now that name was a punchline, a headline, a hashtag (#MeToobin) -- and a point of debate. For as many people were excoriating Mr. Toobin for lewd and inappropriate behavior in a virtual workplace, others were thinking, or even saying, "there but for the grace of God go I," acutely conscious of all the private or potentially embarrassing moments they'd stolen in this odd new zone where we now meet our colleagues.
The fragile boundary between screen and reality was showcased on, of all places, the cover of the Dec. 7 New Yorker, which features a woman at her computer, crisply attired above the waist; in casual disarray below.
By the time this issue was published, Mr. Toobin's contract with the magazine had been canceled, and he had requested a leave of absence from CNN, where he is chief legal analyst, and had sometimes appeared multiple times a day. When the episode of "The Undoing" that featured him aired in late November, his image had been edited out, leaving just the audio of his fictional commentary.
His once widely heard public voice was silent throughout the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court and during the election. He also declined to comment for this article.
'He's Complicated'
One of Mr. Toobin's favorite books is "The Great Gatsby." He has referred to its narrator, Nick Carraway, in The New Yorker, in articles written for other publications and on CNN. For a time, he attached the name to a personal Gmail account. Carraway is someone "neither all good nor all bad, not all right or all wrong, part of the story but also outside of it," Mr. Toobin said in a "By the Book" column in The New York Times in 2016. "He's complicated."
Mr. Toobin's path to journalism, at least, was simpler than Carraway's to bond trading. He grew up on the Upper West Side and attended the private school Columbia Grammar & Preparatory. His father, Jerome Toobin, was the news director at Channel 13, but the family star was Jeffrey's mother, Marlene Sanders, a correspondent for ABC and CBS News who was among the first female journalists on the ground in Vietnam.
In a 2015 interview with The Times after her death, Mr. Toobin said he was raised knowing women could be both mothers and professionals: "This was her life. She had a job and she traveled and she had a son she loved."
She actually had two sons. Mr. Toobin's younger brother, Mark, was born in 1967 with Down syndrome and lived away from the family, most recently in a group home in Connecticut. Mark, who is still alive, was not mentioned in Ms. Sanders's Times obituary, written with survivor information provided by Mr. Toobin.
At Harvard, Jeffrey Toobin majored in history and literature, graduating in 1982; there he served as editorial chairman for The Crimson newspaper and met his future wife, Amy McIntosh.
He went on to Harvard Law School, Ms. McIntosh to Harvard Business School. They married in 1986. An assistant secretary of education in the Obama administration, she now consults. They have two adult children, Ellen and Adam. Mr. Toobin also has a younger son, Rory, with Casey Greenfield, a lawyer.
In Mr. Toobin's early career he clerked for a federal judge, served as an associate counsel during the Iran Contra proceedings and worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn. In 1991, he published his first book, "Opening Arguments: A Young Lawyer's First Case, the United States v. Oliver North," a Carraway-like personal account of his background role in someone else's story.
In Washington, he'd befriended a young reporter named David Remnick, who facilitated his introduction to Tina Brown, the editor of a splashy new iteration of The New Yorker. "I really hired him on impulse, thinking I would take a risk on him," she said. Mr. Toobin started at Talk of the Town, then became a star while covering the Simpson murder trial (resulting in the best-selling book "The Run of His Life," also an FX series). "He could combine news sense with gravitas and he broke news again and again," Ms. Brown said.
In the office, Mr. Toobin sat down the hall from Mr. Remnick, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book "Lenin's Tomb" in 1994, and the two men became closer. Named Ms. Brown's successor four years later, Mr. Remnick led the magazine out of a period of red ink and retained its prestige even as sister titles have receded, floundered or folded. The New Yorker has overseen coverage central to the national discourse around sexual misconduct.
Still, as Condé Nast, the publisher of The New Yorker, has along with other media organizations faced criticism of elitism and tardiness around diversity, there is little room for error from even its veteran VIPs.
In June, the editor of Bon Appétit, Adam Rapoport, stepped down after a picture of him in brownface surfaced on Instagram, amid complaints from staff members that people of color were not compensated or treated fairly. Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue (and artistic director of Condé Nast), has apologized for long marginalizing people of color in its pages. In the last few years, writers started receiving contracts that contained morality clauses that allowed termination for "public disrepute, contempt, complaints or scandal."
And the Zoom meeting was not the first time Mr. Toobin has surprised someone in the business with his sexual forwardness. The magazine journalist Lisa DePaulo said that in 2003 Mr. Toobin asked her out for New Year's Eve, telling her he'd separated from Ms. McIntosh. A few days after accepting, she returned home to a phone message from Mr. Toobin in which, she said, he described in vulgar terms a sex act he planned on enacting with her.
"I kept the message and played it for all my friends," she said. (One of whom corroborated her story in an interview.) Mr. Toobin later called to confirm she'd gotten his message -- "usually someone takes me to dinner first," she told him -- and told her he was back together with his wife.
"I didn't think he was a sexual predator," Ms. DePaulo said. "I just thought he was a nice guy who was pervy. It was just like, 'Jeffrey? Ick!'
Mr. Toobin had followed his mother to ABC News, where he served as a legal analyst before moving to CNN in 2002. As his public profile grew, his private life attracted media attention. In 2009 and 2010, Rush & Molloy, a gossip column in The New York Daily News, reported on an extramarital affair he'd started with Ms. Greenfield, then a fact checker at Glamour, another Condé Nast publication. She became pregnant in 2008.
After her son, Rory, was born in 2009, Ms. Greenfield, who went on to work in family law, sued Mr. Toobin, 13 years her senior, over child support. She declined to comment for this article.
Mr. Toobin had no contact with the new baby "by his choice," according to a court document, until he was nine months old. Mr. Toobin now sees Rory, who was an usher at Ellen's wedding in 2018, a few times a month.
The affair and its resolution did not diminish Mr. Toobin's professional standing, colleagues say, nor the range of his reporting. He visited sex clubs with the political consultant Roger Stone for a 2008 profile, explored the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and reported on Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media (which had written, with snark and glee, about Mr. Toobin's entanglement with Ms. Greenfield).
But masturbation at a remotely conducted work meeting was a new order of business.
Besides inviting mockery of a magazine whose dignity and restraint has been part of its brand since the William Shawn years, it presented an urgent, if very 2020 human resources issue. "I want to assure everyone that we take workplace matters seriously," Stan Duncan, the chief people officer of Condé Nast, wrote in a Nov. 11 email sent to the staff of the magazine, announcing that Mr. Toobin would no longer be associated with it. "We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected and upholds our standards of conduct."
A spokesman for Condé Nast declined to comment, as did Mr. Remnick. He and Mr. Toobin have not spoken since the day of the Zoom transgression.
'An Inappropriately Long Lunch Break'
It's unclear if, when or how Mr. Toobin will return to public life. He is on leave from CNN, whose executives are unwilling to discuss his future. (A spokeswoman confirmed that he remains the network's chief legal analyst but would not comment further.) Three CNN employees say that network president, Jeff Zucker, is a big fan of Mr. Toobin's and a believer in second chances. But Mr. Zucker may be leaving CNN in 2021, making his opinion perhaps irrelevant.
Besides the FX series, Mr. Toobin has several Hollywood projects in development; it is unclear how, if at all, his fall from grace might affect these. (A film version of "American Heiress," Mr. Toobin's book about Patty Hearst, was to star Elle Fanning but was canceled by 20th Century Fox Film in 2018.) The Gawker article has been optioned by Anonymous Content, the production and management company. "The Nine," his best-selling 2007 book about the Supreme Court, is being developed for Warner Bros. by a group led by Rob Reiner. An adaptation of "True Crimes and Misdemeanors" is also in the works.
A representative for Doubleday, Mr. Toobin's current publisher, said that his contract had been fulfilled with that most recent title, leaving him in limbo there too. But judging from the reaction to and discussion of the now-infamous Zoom call, there would likely be a market for his own writing about it.
Several of Mr. Toobin's longtime associates feel he was unfairly punished. "You are a fine person and a terrific journalist and did nothing here to hurt anyone outside of yourself and your family," Jonathan Alter, a friend of Mr. Toobin's for 40 years, tweeted after Mr. Toobin announced his exit from The New Yorker.
"I don't like Twitter mobs, and I don't like bullies from the left or the right taking part in cancel culture," Mr. Alter said later by phone. "I have trouble with the conflation of offenses. I don't put Al Franken in the same category as Harvey Weinstein."
Ms. Brown, who worked with Mr. Weinstein for years after she left The New Yorker, agreed. "I think 27 years of superb reporting and commitment to The New Yorker should have been weighed against an incident that horribly embarrassed the magazine but mostly embarrassed himself," she said.
Malcolm Gladwell, one of the magazine's best known contributors, said in an interview: "I read the Condé Nast news release, and I was puzzled because I couldn't find any intellectual justification for what they were doing. They just assumed he had done something terrible, but never told us what the terrible thing was. And my only feeling -- the only way I could explain it -- was that Condé Nast had taken an unexpected turn toward traditional Catholic teaching." (Mr. Gladwell then took out his Bible and read to a reporter an allegory from Genesis 38 in which God strikes down a man for succumbing to the sin of self-gratification.)
Even Mx. Gessen, who initially found the incident "traumatic," said they now feel sympathy for Mr. Toobin. "I think it's tragic that a guy would get fired for really just doing something really stupid," they said. "It is the Zoom equivalent of taking an inappropriately long lunch break, having sex during it and getting stumbled upon."
But Mr. Toobin may not want anyone's pity. Amid the 2018 Supreme Court confirmation process for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the journalist scoffed on CNN at Republicans who said white men, as a demographic, were being mistreated. "Garbage," Mr. Toobin said. "All this whining about the poor plight of white men is ridiculous."

Texto completo: I’m not a Debbie Downer. Far from it. I’m usually an optimist who pushes for hope in the most dire of circumstances. However, when I hear friends talk about how the new year and Joe Biden’s presidency will answer our collective prayers and cleanse our collective palate from 2020′s unrelenting onslaught of pain and misery, I can’t help but feel skeptical.
“What makes you think 2021 will be any better?” I ask them.
Like many, I would love an instant catharsis, a release from this enduring tragedy. I want us all to be able to interact without wearing masks, to hug our loved ones and to sleep peacefully knowing a president isn’t rage-tweeting while watching Fox News. But despite all the talk about how bad this year has been, life will not return to normal at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve. Chaos and crises don’t follow a calendar. Most of the underlying problems and challenges that made 2020 feel like a horror story will roll along with us into the new year.
It’s true that 2020 was unusually bad, right from the start. It began with the eruption of the Taal Volcano in the Philippines that temporarily forced more than 135,000 people into shelters. We also learned about the worst outbreak of desert locusts in 70 years in Kenya, with hundreds of millions of locusts swarming the country. To cap off the month of January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus a global health emergency.
Since then, more than 300,000 Americans have died, more deaths than in any other nation. The United States is the pity of the world, recently recording its most COVID-19 deaths in a week, and state governors have warned of overwhelmed hospitals.
We had the most named storms of any year on record, and devastating fires burned over four million acres in my home state, California. I haven’t even talked about all the floods and earthquakes. We lost precious time to combat climate change, while President Trump dismissed it as a “hoax.”
We lost Kobe Bryant, Chadwick Boseman, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sean Connery and Alex Trebek.
It’s obvious that we’ll say goodbye to more beloved public figures in 2021 — that’s the cycle of life. But, all of the other problems and fissures that made 2020 tough will remain and deepen, too.
Our country’s disregard for basic precautions against the transmission of the coronavirus, and Mr. Trump’s failure to lead, could result in some 502,000 COVID-19 deaths by April 1, according to a projection from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We have to keep social distancing and wearing masks but also continue aggressively educating a misinformed population about the enduring risks of the coronavirus.
Thanks in part to disinformation that circulates on Facebook and Twitter, vaccine hesitancy, which is a top-10 global health threat according to the WHO, is on the rise. Even if a coronavirus vaccine is made available to all, we’ll have to convince people to get it — even those who flout social distancing, insist the virus threat isn’t real and believe that the vaccine is created by Bill Gates and the “deep state” as a means of mind control.
Jan. 1 will officially usher in the new year, and along with it a potential wave of evictions across the country if the moratorium issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is lifted. Billionaires have gotten richer, but gross domestic product growth is expected to slow significantly in the first quarter of 2021. Where will Americans who don’t have homes, savings, daily wages or health insurance go during the middle of a pandemic? Elementary school students who were forced to study remotely earlier this year lost the equivalent of some three months’ progress in math and fell a month and a half behind historical averages in reading, according to a report from McKinsey & Company.
Republicans will do what they can to limit a Biden agenda, and the Republican-controlled Senate has held a relief package hostage.
Instead of helping Americans, many Republicans are promoting lies about election fraud to stroke the ego of a narcissist vulgarian who is riling his base to the tune of millions. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month found that nearly 70 percent of Republicans say the election was rigged.
If we want 2021 to be better, we will have to make it better ourselves.
One way to start: elect Democrats in Georgia’s two Senate runoffs on Jan. 5. Those seats will ensure that Democrats regain control of the Senate, allowing them to give relief to millions of Americans, and protect democracy and the rule of law.
The rest of us must confront the brutal realities head-on. Let’s resolve to be patient and steadfast. Let’s resolve to spend 2021 fighting for science, facts, democracy and compassion and repairing all that was lost in 2020. After a full year of that, maybe — just maybe — 2022 will be better.

The Big Thaw: How Russia Could Dominate a Warming World

IT WAS ONLY November, but the chill already cut to the bone in the small village of Dimitrovo, which sits just 35 miles north of the Chinese border in a remote part of eastern Russia’s Jewish Autonomous Region. Behind a row of sagging cabins and decades-old farm equipment, flat fields ran into the brambly branches of a leafless forest before fading into the oblivion of a dreary squall. Several villagers walked the single-lane dirt road, their shoulders rounded against the cold, their ghostly footprints marking the dry white snow.
A few miles down the road, a rusting old John Deere combine growled on through the flurries, its blade churning through dead-brown stalks of soybeans. The tractor lurched to a halt, and a good-humored man named Dima climbed down from the cockpit. Dima, an entrepreneur who farms nearly 6,500 acres of these fields, was born in the Liaoning Province of northeastern China — his birth name is Xin Jie — one of a wave of Chinese to migrate north in pursuit of opportunity in recent years. After Dima’s mostly Chinese laborers returned home this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, he has been forced to do much of the work himself. Bundled against the wind in a camouflage parka, he bent to pick a handful of slender pods from the ground, opening one to reveal a glimpse at Russia’s future.
A great transformation is underway in the eastern half of Russia. For centuries the vast majority of the land has been impossible to farm; only the southernmost stretches along the Chinese and Mongolian borders, including around Dimitrovo, have been temperate enough to offer workable soil. But as the climate has begun to warm, the land — and the prospect for cultivating it — has begun to improve. Twenty years ago, Dima says, the spring thaw came in May, but now the ground is bare by April; rainstorms now come stronger and wetter. Across Eastern Russia, wild forests, swamps and grasslands are slowly being transformed into orderly grids of soybeans, corn and wheat. It’s a process that is likely to accelerate: Russia hopes to seize on the warming temperatures and longer growing seasons brought by climate change to refashion itself as one of the planet’s largest producers of food.
A man attending to his farm land upon spring thaw. Dima on his land. Today the spring thaw comes a month earlier than it did 20 years ago, he says. (Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times)
Around the world, climate change is becoming an epochal crisis, a nightmare of drought, desertification, flooding and unbearable heat, threatening to make vast regions less habitable and drive the greatest migration of refugees in history. But for a few nations, climate change will present an unparalleled opportunity, as the planet’s coldest regions become more temperate. There is plenty of reason to think that those places will also receive an extraordinary influx of people displaced from the hottest parts of the world as the climate warms. Human migration, historically, has been driven by the pursuit of prosperity even more so than it has by environmental strife. With climate change, prosperity and habitability — haven and economic opportunity — will soon become one and the same.
And no country may be better positioned to capitalize on climate change than Russia. Russia has the largest land mass by far of any northern nation. It is positioned farther north than all of its South Asian neighbors, which collectively are home to the largest global population fending off displacement from rising seas, drought and an overheating climate. Like Canada, Russia is rich in resources and land, with room to grow. Its crop production is expected to be boosted by warming temperatures over the coming decades even as farm yields in the United States, Europe and India are all forecast to decrease. And whether by accident or cunning strategy or, most likely, some combination of the two, the steps its leaders have steadily taken — planting flags in the Arctic and propping up domestic grain production among them — have increasingly positioned Russia to regain its superpower mantle in a warmer world.
FOR THOUSANDS of years, warming temperatures and optimal climate have tracked closely with human productivity and development. After the last ice age, human colonization of Greenland surged with a period of warming only to sharply contract again during a period of abrupt cooling. More recently, researchers have correlated a quickening economic pulse in Iceland with years that had above-average temperatures, just as suffocating heat waves in the global South have tempered growth. There is an optimum climate for human productivity — average annual temperatures between 52 and 59 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences — and much of the planet’s far north is headed straight toward it.
Marshall Burke, the deputy director of the Center for Food Security and the Environment at Stanford University, has spent the better part of a decade studying how climate change will alter global economies, mostly focusing on the economic damage that could be wreaked by storms and heat waves and withering crops. A 2015 paper he co-wrote in the journal Nature made the geographic implications clear: Draw a line around the planet at the latitude of the northern borders of the United States and China, and just about every place south, across five continents, stands to lose out. Productivity, Burke found, peaks at about 55 degrees average temperature and then drops as the climate warms. He projects that by 2100, the national per capita income in the United States might be a third less than it would be in a nonwarming world; India’s would be nearly 92% less; and China’s future growth would be cut short by nearly half. The mirror image, meanwhile, tells a different story: Incredible growth could await those places soon to enter their prime. Canada, Scandinavia, Iceland and Russia each could see as much as fivefold bursts in their per capita gross domestic products by the end of the century so long as they have enough people to power their economies at that level.
For two years The New York Times and ProPublica have been reporting on the great global climate migration that is already underway. By 2070, more than three billion people may find themselves living outside the optimum climate for human life, causing tens of millions of migrants to press northward into the United States and Europe. (Most migrants do move north, where there is the greatest land mass and economic opportunity.) The U.S. itself, the reporting showed, is likely to undergo its own vast demographic transformation as heat, drought and rising sea levels displace millions of Americans. In this final installment of our three-part series, the focus is on who benefits — looking at where the planet’s masses will most likely end their journey in the pursuit of a stable climate. The optimal niche for human life will eventually move beyond the U.S. and Europe, toward the pole, and people will move with it.

This could present an extraordinary opportunity for the world’s northernmost nations — but only if they figure out how to stem their own population decline while accommodating at least some of a monumental population push at their borders. Take, for example, Canada: It is flush with land as well as timber, oil, gas and hydropower, and it has access to 20% of the world’s fresh water. It has a stable, incorrupt democracy. And as the climate warms, Canada will move into the ecological sweet spot for civilization, benefiting from new Arctic transportation routes as well as an expanded capacity for farming. But there are only 38 million people in Canada, and Canadians are dying at a faster rate than they are being born. Burke’s research suggests climate change will, by 2100, make Canadians 2½ times richer in terms of per capita G.D.P. than they would be if the planet were not warming. Canada may be able to seize that opportunity only if it welcomes a lot more people.
This is why a group of Canadian business executives and academics have called on their government to turn the country’s immigration system into a magnet for the planet’s most talented people, hoping to nearly triple Canada’s population by 2100. The government has signaled some receptivity, increasing its immigration targets this year by 14%, in part reflecting a public sentiment that recognizes the importance of immigration to Canada’s economy. Whether today’s Canadians are truly ready to see migrants outnumber them 2-to-1, though, remains to be seen.
The story is similar in the northern nations of Europe, where low birthrates and aging populations are out of step with the projected needs of agriculture and other industries. The countries of Western and Central Europe are among the world’s largest growers of food, but native population declines force a heavy reliance at harvest time on migrant workers from places like Belarus and Romania. Norway and Sweden, too, could soon see a longer growing season and an increased harvest for their vegetable, fruit and berry crops as temperatures warm, but even now they can’t harvest them without bringing in 15,000 to 30,000 migrant workers apiece, says Arne Bardalen of the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research, an expert on agriculture, food security and climate change.
Wrapped up in all of this — the farming, the migration, the warming — is a larger game of global influence. The issue of national security, for any of these countries as well as the United States, is inextricably interlinked not only with immigration and border policies but also with food security. The race for prosperity in a climate-changed world is about achieving domestic self-reliance and also expanding geopolitical influence. But, as John Kerry, who is President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming climate czar and a former U.S. secretary of state, put it to me recently, both are dependent on how the accessibility or usability of territory — whether Arctic passages or thawing land — changes over time. The scarcer food and other resources become on a global level, the more the ability to produce food domestically becomes a tool of power. And the more nations can keep themselves afloat in this changing world, the more they stand to benefit just by watching others sink. “It could be very tense,” Kerry said, “a really, really messy process.” All of that makes the flow of people — whether you call them climate refugees or human capital — an inseverable part of the geopolitical power struggle driven by climate.
Russia has been explicit about its intention to come out ahead as the climate changes; in its national action plan on climate released in January, it called on the country to “use the advantages” of warming and listed Arctic shipping and extended growing seasons among things that would shower “additional benefits” on the nation. Russia may be no better positioned, politically speaking, to welcome large numbers of migrants than the U.S. or Canada; in fact, xenophobia is probably even more prevalent there. But how it tackles migration and its own demographic challenges will have tremendous consequences for the U.S. and the rest of the world. Russia has always wanted to populate its vast eastern lands, and the steady thawing there puts that long-sought goal within reach. Achieving it could significantly increase Russia’s prosperity and power in the process, through the opening of tens of millions of acres of land and a flourishing new agricultural economy.

WHEN NADEZHDA Tchebakova, a leading Russian climate ecologist, moved to Siberia to research shifts in the region’s climate, she followed in the footsteps of Gulag prisoners who had been banished to a land considered so inhospitable that the mere prospect of crossing it would prevent escape. In time she found a rapidly warming countryside of forests and inviting and temperate hills. In a study she published last summer in the journal Environmental Research Letters, with the co-writers Elena Parfenova and Amber Soja, an American from NASA, Tchebakova estimated that by 2080, Russia’s permafrost in the Asian part of the country will be reduced by more than half, at least in the active layer within six feet of the surface. One-third of its land mass would begin to switch from “absolute extreme” in its inhospitality to “fairly favorable” for civilization — and quite hospitable — she wrote, adopting the ecological terminology that the Russian government itself had invented to dictate how much hardship pay settlers banished to the region should receive. One of the coldest and most ecologically hostile places on the planet, she found, is fast becoming pleasantly livable.
Land’s ability to support life boils down to basic biology. Organisms need enough light and heat to produce compounds that living creatures can consume in order to build a web of food. Permafrost stalls much of that process, but as it thaws, the cycle can begin. It’s difficult to pinpoint just how much a single degree of warming opens up new lands in the north, but Tchebakova’s research suggests that if humans continue to emit carbon dioxide at high rates, roughly half of Siberia — more than two million square miles — could become available for farming by 2080, and its capacity to support potential climate migrants could jump ninefold in some places as a result. Not all thawed land will work; poor soils in many places won’t be arable or will require loads of fertilizer to make things grow. And the change won’t come overnight; soils in the process of thawing are an inherently unstable recipe for mayhem as roads and bridges crack and buildings collapse with the seasonal heaves and sinks of the earth. For a while, thawing regions may be nearly impassable. Eventually, though, the thaw will be complete and a new equilibrium reached that makes the land buildable and plantable again.
The wait may not be especially long. This season, crops of winter wheat and canola seed outside Tchebakova’s own city of Krasnoyarsk in southern Siberia produced twice the yields as the year before. “It’s exactly what we predicted,” she said, “except we predicted it by midcentury.” As Vladimir Putin himself once glibly put it, a couple of degrees of warming might not be so bad: “We could spend less on fur coats, and the grain harvest would go up.”

Agricultural dominance is just a small part of what Russia’s climate optimists say the country has to look forward to. The steady melting of the Arctic sea ice will open a new shipping lane that would cut transit times from Southeast Asia to Europe by up to 40% and also shorten travel time to the United States, positioning Russia to profit by controlling this route between China and the West. With a few exceptions, St. Petersburg among them, Russia’s largest cities and most important military bases are also far less vulnerable to inundation from sea-level rise than those of, say, the United States, which has its largest cities on the water and will inevitably divert trillions of dollars in coming decades to fortify or relocate strategic assets. Even the savings in energy that will come from warming temperatures amounts to a mild economic stimulus.
But agriculture offers the key to one of the greatest resources of the new climate era — food — and in recent years Russia has already shown a new understanding of how to leverage its increasingly strong hand in agricultural exports. In 2010, when wildfires and drought conspired to ruin Russia’s grain harvests, Putin banned the exporting of wheat in order to protect his own people, then watched as global wheat prices tripled. The world reeled in response. From Pakistan to Indonesia, poverty increased. High prices rocked delicate political balances in Syria, Morocco and Egypt, where about 40% of daily caloric intake is from bread. The shortages poured fuel on Arab Spring uprisings, which eventually pushed millions of migrants toward Europe, with destabilizing effect — a bonus for Russian interests. And much of this turmoil began with wheat. As Michael Werz, a senior fellow for climate migration and security at the Center for American Progress, says, “There’s a reason people demonstrated with baguettes in Cairo.”
When Europe and the United States imposed sanctions on Russia after the downing of a Malaysian passenger jet over Ukraine in 2014, Russia countered by imposing sanctions on European imports. It seemed self-punishing at first, but the move was meant to give Russia’s own domestic food producers an opening and prod them to fill the supply gap. When Putin addressed his Federal Assembly the following December, he boldly proclaimed Russia would soon be “the largest world supplier” of healthful foods, referring to his goal of keeping Russian foods mostly GMO-free. By 2018, Putin’s sanctions had paid enormous dividends: Since 2015, Russia’s wheat exports jumped 100%, to about 44 million tons, surpassing those of the United States and Europe. Russia is now the largest wheat exporter in the world, responsible for nearly a quarter of the global market. Russia’s agricultural exports have jumped sixteenfold since 2000 and by 2018 were worth nearly $30 billion, all by relying largely on Russia’s legacy growing regions in its south and west. In Africa, Putin told attendees of the Russia-Africa Economic Forum held in Sochi last fall, “We are now exporting more agricultural products than weapons.”
In the decades to come, as Russia’s grain and soy production rise as a result of climate change, its own food security will give it another wedge to drive into global geopolitics, should it wish to use it. Russia’s agricultural dominance, says Rod Schoonover, the former director of environment and natural resources at the National Intelligence Council and a former senior State Department analyst under the Obama and Trump administrations, is “an emergent national security issue” that is “underappreciated as a geopolitical threat.”

TO AMERICAN intelligence experts, two things have become clear: Certain parts of the world might one day use the effects of climate change as rungs on a ladder toward greater influence and prosperity. And the United States, despite its not-unfavorable position geographically, is more likely to lose than win — not least because so many of its leaders have failed to imagine the magnitude of the transformations to come.
For John Podesta, the profound geopolitical challenges posed by climate change first became clear in July 2008, not long before he took charge of President-elect Barack Obama’s transition team. That month, he took part in a war game hosted by the Center for New American Security, a Washington-based research group. The room was full of people who were, like him, awaiting their chance to reenter influential positions in the American government. Around the table in a private conference room at the Newseum in Washington, were former U.S. military officials, a former EPA administrator, advisers to Chinese intelligence officials, analysts from McKinsey and the Brookings Institution and at least one European diplomat. “Let me be very clear,” Podesta told the gathering, in his assigned role as the United Nations secretary general. “Our time is running out.”
The exercise was set in 2015, with the climate crisis becoming violently apparent. A Category 5 hurricane had struck Miami shortly after a cyclone killed 200,000 people in Bangladesh. The scenario was designed by a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security named Sharon Burke, who would later become an assistant U.S. secretary of defense; her game plan suggested that a wave of climate migrants would be driven from their homes, part of the climate-caused displacement of as many as a billion people by 2050. One significant question put to the group then was how the United States, Europe, China and India would respond to that enormous migration and whether they could agree on what obligations under international law nations should have to care for migrants.
It wasn’t easy. None of the countries involved wanted to open the door to being obliged to take climate migrants in, Burke told me. The participants clashed over whether climate migrants could be called “refugees” at all, given the U.N.’s insistence on reserving that term for those persecuted or forced to flee. They wound up deciding the word should be applied only to victims of climate-driven disasters, not those suffering from slow-onset change like drought. In the end, the players were reluctant to face the migration challenges in depth — a worrisome sign that, in the real world, wealthy nations like the United States would be likely to cling to the status quo even as large-scale humanitarian crises begin to unfold. “One of the insights we got was that migration was just an absolute no-go zone,” Burke said. “I wasn’t expecting that.”
The game marked a turning point of sorts in how some U.S. officials viewed the security threats posed by climate change. In 2010, in what was a rare and early official assessment of climate risk, the U.S. Department of Defense’s Quadrennial Defense Review warned that climate change “could have significant geopolitical impacts,” contributing to poverty, starvation, drought and the spread of disease, all of which would “spur or exacerbate mass migration.” By 2014, the Defense Department had applied the term “threat multiplier” to climate change, describing how it would make many of the security establishment’s greatest nightmares even worse. By the time Podesta went to China in late 2014 to negotiate an emissions agreement — a diplomatic feat that laid the groundwork for the Paris climate accord — he had come to believe that it was climate-driven food scarcity that posed the dominant threat to global security and to American interests. He saw that scarcity, and the migration it would cause, as leading to a fundamental, perhaps dangerous shift in the geopolitical balance of the world. “We were just at the beginning of the imagining of how big the problem was,” Podesta told me.
America’s strategic challenges from climate change don’t just revolve around food. Sea-level rise, for one, could displace 14 million Americans by 2050, even with modest warming, while in Russia fewer than two million people are at risk. American military installations around the world are also particularly vulnerable. According to a 2018 Defense Department analysis, about 1,700 of them might need to be moved out of the way of flooding rivers and coastlines and of hurricanes. And the enduring reluctance in right-wing political circles to talk about sea-level rise and warming has hamstrung U.S. strategy and made it difficult for the country’s leaders to see around the curve. If you take any factor out of your calculus, you create blind spots. One telling example: Russia has 34 icebreakers, and China, which is nowhere near the Arctic, has four; the United States has just two, one of which is nearly a half-century old. When it comes to climate, the defense establishment “has been more of a reactive than a proactive entity,” said John Conger, a former deputy under secretary of defense and now the director of the Center for Climate and Security. “So emergencies and crises get more attention than opportunities and possibilities.”
But in the long term, agriculture presents perhaps the most significant illustration of how a warming world might erode America’s position. Right now the U.S. agricultural industry serves as a significant, if low-key, instrument of leverage in America’s own foreign affairs. The U.S. provides roughly a third of soy traded globally, nearly 40% of corn and 13% of wheat. By recent count, American staple crops are shipped to 174 countries, and democratic influence and power comes with them, all by design. And yet climate data analyzed for this project suggest that the U.S. farming industry is in danger. Crop yields from Texas north to Nebraska could fall by up to 90% by as soon as 2040 as the ideal growing region slips toward the Dakotas and the Canadian border. And unlike in Russia or Canada, that border hinders the U.S.’s ability to shift north along with the optimal conditions.
Marshall Burke projects that over the next 80 years, per capita GDP in the United States will drop by 36% compared to what it would be in a nonwarming world, even as per capita GDP in Russia will quadruple. A recent study led by researchers at Columbia University found that a disruption in U.S. agriculture would quickly propagate throughout the world. After just four years of a Dust Bowl-like event — a time when some crop yields dropped by 60% — global wheat reserves would be cut by nearly a third, and U.S. reserves would be almost entirely gone. And as the livability and capacity of American land wanes, U.S. influence in the world may fade along with it.

The lyrics to Russia’s modern anthem suggest that at least some of its leaders have anticipated this moment: “Wide spaces for dreams and for living are opened for us by the coming years.” As if to fulfill that vision — and perhaps with the expectation of needing more land to execute his climate ambitions — Vladimir Putin declared in 2013 that the remaking of Russia’s East “is our national priority for the entire 21st century,” and that “the goals that have to be attained are unprecedented in their scope.” In laying out that ambition, he surely had history in mind. There was the outpost Russia built at the Sea of Okhotsk in the 1700s; efforts to drive out Chinese settlers of the Qing dynasty in the 1800s; the founding of the Jewish Autonomous Region, which ultimately brought as many as 40,000 Yiddish-speaking Jews to the area around Birobidzhan, in 1934; and even the longstanding banishment of workers and prisoners alike to Siberia and the Far East under Stalin and afterward.
All these efforts at settlement, though, have been focused on re settlement — on moving Russia’s own citizens eastward to exploit this new land of opportunity. The current plan invites any Russians willing to relocate themselves in Siberia and the Far East, including in the Birobidzhan area of the Jewish Autonomous Region, to buy properties at 2% interest. Russians willing to move there can also apply for free plots of farmland. College and trade training can also be free.
And yet none of these efforts to encourage internal migration have had much of an impact. The government says that it has distributed nearly 150,000 acres to roughly 86,000 people, but only 14% of them did not already live in the region. Since 1991 the population of the states that have traditionally made up the Far Eastern Federal District has decreased by 25%; the decline has slowed, but it remains a drip in the wrong direction. The situation is considered so dire that the government has a bureau to address it, the Department of Human Capital. (The department rebuffed repeated requests for an interview.)
Andrey Shvalov’s story helps to illustrate why. In 2016, Shvalov applied for land through the resettlement program, abandoning his life as a photographer to pioneer rural land in the Far East. He filled out an application online and was quickly granted five acres of woodland outside Blagoveshchensk, a small city on the Chinese border about 260 miles northwest of Dimitrovo. It was only after arriving there, with his wife and two young children, that he discovered all the challenges the program could not solve.
“My first problem was where to get water,” he says. Shvalov watched YouTube videos to learn how to drill a well, erect a house and cut and dry his own firewood. First, he built a chicken house, and the family camped inside of it. Now, four years in, his wife keeps an apartment in town while Shvalov and the children sleep in a temporary hut as he builds the house. “In the city,” he says, “we all thought about motivation and goals. Here, the main thing is what you will drink and eat.” The biggest problem? There is no infrastructure to connect to and, despite official claims that the government is supporting the settlers, not enough government money to build it. Near Shvalov’s place, the Amur district has been losing about 1,600 people each year; Russia’s national demographics department refers to it as a “donor” region. The Jewish Autonomous Region surrounding Dimitrovo is in similar decline. There is simply no one to do the work.

It’s no surprise, then, that the region has become increasingly dependent on what Anatoly Vishnevsky, director of the Institute of Demography at the National Research University in Moscow, has called “replacement migration” for labor. In fact Russia’s own demographic statistics show the net population decline in its eastern regions in spite of small but steadily increasing foreign migration — not just the Chinese, North Koreans and Japanese who have made homes in the region but also migrants from the Caucasus and Central Asian states and even some from India, Turkey and Afghanistan.
In late October I spoke on a video call with Sergei Karaganov, founder of Russia’s Council on Foreign and Defense Policy and an influential adviser to Russian presidents, including Putin. Karaganov, who is normally pictured in suit and tie but who also describes himself as a hunter, sat in the pine-walled dining room of his dacha an hour and a half outside Moscow, where he was isolating to avoid COVID-19. Behind him an enormous bear skin was stretched out on the wall next to the bust of a six-point elk. Russia needs so much labor in the east, he told me, that it has even contemplated flying workers in from India: “We think about the lower hundreds of thousands.”
There is an underlying sense, though, that sooner or later there will be more human capital available than Russia knows what to do with. Asian Russia sits atop a continent with the largest global population, including not just the Chinese but also nearly two billion South Asians — from the flooding Mekong Delta and Bangladesh to the sweltering plains of India — many of whom will inevitably be pushing northward in search of space and resources as the climate gets hotter and sea levels continue to rise. Russia is “not willing to bring in too many Chinese,” Karaganov said. “But when it comes, it will come from there and Central Asia, the Caucasus. This is a problem, but it could be the greatest opportunity.”

IN THE NEAR term, while Russia may prefer its migrants to come from Central Asia and other countries farther south, it’s the Chinese who seem most likely to come. They’ve already settled throughout Siberia and the Far East, sometimes through intermarriage with Russian citizens — which makes them eligible for land-disbursement benefits — or by leasing lands from Russians who received it under government giveaways. At one point, Russian news articles described more than 1.5 million Chinese living in southern Russian territories, though precise numbers don’t exist; some experts say the number is probably much lower. This year, many returned to China amid fears of the closure of the border because of the coronavirus. But most people, including Karaganov, expect they’ll be back, tantalizing Russians with prospects for growth while at the same time triggering the age-old racist tendencies that have clouded Russia’s efforts to assimilate outsiders of non-Russian descent.
When Dima first came from the city of Shenyang, at 26, adventurous migrants were chasing opportunities across the Russian frontier. He had taken a train to Khabarovsk, the largest city in the Russian East, and then continued west on rumors of free arable land. Quickly enough he found work on a collective near Dimitrovo and hustled produce to buyers along the railroad to make a living until, five years later, the collective folded and most of the Russians moved away.
Dima saw it as an opportunity. The China he’d left was urban, crowded and poor, and this part of Russia was like the wild east, flush with subsidies, space and opportunity. His wife, a Russian citizen, qualified for a cheap loan: enough for farm equipment and 50 acres to grow soybeans and barley for feed. By 2020 Dima had tilled profits into more land until he was running two large combines over nearly 6,500 acres of soybeans and employing 15 mostly Chinese workers to do it. And throughout it all, he had begun to fit in. “My neighbors see me as Dima,” he says, speaking Russian in a thick Chinese accent, “although I can’t hide the fact I don’t speak well.”
Dima says he is confident that, once the pandemic ends, more of his countrymen will be drawn to the region, probably with bigger investors and bigger companies. “You can’t retreat,” he says, noting that they’ve wagered too much money here. “They will come.” These days, much of the Chinese money is in Vladivostok, a breezy and moneyed port city scattered over rolling hills on the shoreline of the Sea of Japan, about nine hours by jet from Moscow. It’s through here that Chinese companies have begun channeling billions of dollars toward Russian land leases and farm operations, and from here that the farms are shipping thousands of tons of soybeans and corn and wheat south to Chinese cities. By video call from his office’s modern glass-walled conference room at the Russian Far East Investment and Export Agency in Vladivostok, Absamat Dzhanboriev, the agency’s agricultural investment director, describes a steep rise in agricultural production that can come only from large-scale corporate farming. In 2018 more than 900,000 tons of soybeans were exported from the East. Soon, he says, the region will harvest two million tons of soybeans from 3.7 million acres of farmed land — an area roughly the size of Connecticut. And the more the land warms, the farther north the industry will be able to push, eventually doubling farmed land again, producing nearly six million tons or more each year.
Chinese money supports 14% of new farm development in the region, more than any other foreign source. Last year, for example, Chinese investors, including a state-owned company, used a Russian subsidiary to start developing 123,000 acres for soy and other crops in an area near Vladivostok and to build a soy-processing plant that would handle 240,000 tons a year. The deal makes the Chinese venture one of the largest private landholders in the Russian east; according to local news reports, it is likely to employ a number of Chinese workers, rely on Chinese technology and sell its products in China. In exchange, Russia says it will earn income tax (after a decade-long abatement) and that a Russian development bank also has a 20% stake in the project. (By law, Dzhanboriev said, such joint ventures are supposed to hire Russians to do at least 80% pof the work.)

For now, at least, these deals seem to be pushing the Chinese and Russian governments closer together. The groundwork was laid in May 2015, when Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to form a $2 billion agricultural fund for trade partnerships in Russia’s east. Investments like these support loans and farming and the construction of badly needed roads and electrical lines in Russian villages like Dimitrovo, while also opening the literal back door — Russia’s remote southeastern border — to China’s colossal market, a market that Putin has coveted. Since then the money has continued to flow, with nearly $14 billion reportedly invested by 2017 across Russia’s resource sectors and another $10 billion pledged by Xi for cross-border infrastructure efforts. This year, the first major bridge linking the two countries across the Amur River was completed.
Given that China appears to siphon much of the profits and products from these ventures, it has not always been clear to Russians in the east that the deals are worth it. But analysts point out that the goals of the two countries — at least for the moment — are complementary. Russia gets long-term growth and the establishment of a durable industry in a region that it has failed to develop in the past and does not have the resources or the technology to do so now on its own. It also gets, according to an analysis by Angela Stent for the Brookings Institution, China’s “unequivocable support” for its programs and policies, something that has become invaluable following the sanctions imposed by the West after the Crimean invasion.
ULTIMATELY, IT IS the clumsy maneuvering of the United States that might prove most responsible for making Putin’s eastern development agenda a success. American tariffs, imposed as part of the Trump administration’s trade war with China, led to China’s own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans, creating the largest catalyst for Chinese buyers to look north for new markets. According to the U.S. Congressional Research Service, China’s total food and agricultural imports from Russia increased 61% in 2017 and 2018, yet another example of the U.S. failure to see the chessboard when it comes to the intricate geopolitical implications of climate change.
“The U.S. has made a few historic mistakes, and I don’t think they are able to repair them,” Karaganov told me. The first was what he characterized as the rejection of Russia’s bid some two decades earlier to strengthen ties with the West. “The second was helping to bring Russia and China together.” With China’s wealth paired to Russia’s resources, and the political trajectories and climate-related interests of the two countries more or less aligned, there is nothing short of a new world order at stake — an order, Brookings Institution analysts say, based not only on economic alignment but also on the two countries’ common commitment to supplanting Western hegemony.
Whether this great Eastern alliance can endure, though, remains an open question, in part because of the underlying and unresolved issue of human migration and the colonization of the Asian north. As strong as the China-Russian partnership appears to be — China has become Russia’s largest trading partner for oil, arms and more — it is an asymmetrical one. Russians continue to distrust Chinese intentions, particularly in the East. The boon in investment is accelerating Russia’s development goals but with trade-offs that stoke rising resentment and fear.

Two centuries ago much of the Russian Far East was a part of China. As recently as 1969, there were border clashes there. After the fall of the Soviet Union, fears of a Chinese invasion were rekindled. And while those fears have since softened, suspicions toward the Chinese linger, a mark of Russia’s famously xenophobic outlook on many non-Russian-speaking immigrants but also a vestige of its history with its southern neighbor. The fear of Chinese overrun in the East is a perennial one; it comes and goes throughout the years — and is sometimes overstated — but it never quite goes away.
And as climate change increasingly drives mass migration, the eventual pressure from the population to the south is quite real. Northeastern China, a report from the U.S. National Intelligence Council warns, will face water shortages and droughts that could drive its population into Russia “in large numbers,” potentially unsettling the entire region. Chinese migrants might be pulled into the Russian Far East by economic opportunities today, the council stated, but by as soon as 2030 the dynamic could flip to one in which they will instead be pushed out of China for lack of basic resources.
Climate Change Will Make Parts of the U.S. Uninhabitable. Americans Are Still Moving There.
Instead of moving away from areas in climate crisis, Americans are flocking to them. As land in places like Phoenix, Houston and Miami becomes less habitable, the country’s migration patterns will be forced to change.
And it won’t just be from China. Water shortages and more frequent droughts across Central Asia and Mongolia and south as far as India could push large numbers of people north. A 2015 study by Russian demographers published in the Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences looked at how unabated climate change would force the “resettlement of millions” of Vietnamese, many of whom might also come to Russia, as sea levels inundate the Mekong Delta by the end of this century.
If there is any lesson to be learned from the instability that has already been caused by climate-driven migration around the world, whether drought-stricken Guatemalans at the U.S. border or Syrians pressing into Europe, it’s that a strategy of accommodating migrants would almost certainly be more to Russia’s benefit than one that attempts to keep them out. Accommodation, an abundance of migration research shows, stands a better chance of preserving Russia’s own sovereignty while improving the stability of its surrounding regions; exclusion is likely to lead to endless conflict and chaos on its borders, which risks spilling across in destabilizing ways.
The fact is that the people of Asia have long ventured north — into Siberia, the Far East and beyond — as the climate has undergone cyclical change through the course of history. Around 3,000 years ago a drought in central China drove Mongol herders a thousand miles north into the steppes of Khakassia, in Siberia, where they remained raising horses and sheep for centuries. The likelihood of that process repeating as the climate warms is now inevitable, said Amber Soja, a scientist who has examined the migration of ancient civilizations in north Asia as a research fellow at the NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia. One way or another, she says, “people are going to move. Because people need to eat.”

As Democrats look to the incoming Biden administration to reverse much of President Donald Trump’s work, the conservative imprint he has left on the federal courts is only deepening.
Much attention in recent months has focused on the Supreme Court and its newly appointed justice, Amy Coney Barrett. But an analysis of decisions by the country’s appellate bench — where nearly all contested federal litigation ends — shows the transformation of the judiciary under Trump.
Early this year, The New York Times reviewed more than 10,000 published decisions and dissents during the first three years of the Trump administration. It found that the president’s picks for the appeals courts were more likely than past Republican appointees to disagree with peers selected by Democrats and more likely to agree with their Republican colleagues, suggesting they were more consistently conservative.
An updated analysis of more than 1,700 opinions published over the first six months of the year shows that the trend has intensified as the judges have established a larger body of work.
“It’s more polarized,” said Joshua Fischman, a law professor at the University of Virginia. “We’ve seen a huge conservative shift. A lot of these judges are very young, and they’ll be there for a long time.”
Trump has named 53 of the 165 judges on the nation’s regional appeals courts, lifetime appointments that will have a vast and enduring effect. Most cases on the courts are decided unanimously by three-person panels, and dissent is relatively rare. But as a group, his selections were nearly four times as likely to clash with colleagues appointed by Democratic presidents as those appointed by Republicans. Judges nominated by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush showed the same tendency, but to half the extent.
The judges who exhibited the pattern included some who had been under consideration for the Supreme Court and some who had deep political connections on Capitol Hill. One had done legal work for Trump’s 2016 campaign and later, as acting head of the Justice Department’s civil division, was in charge of defending high-profile presidential policies that came under attack in the courts.
Yet while Trump has made clear that he expects loyalty from his judicial appointees, they have ruled against him in lawsuits that his campaign brought regarding the 2020 election. Most notably, Barrett last week joined her fellow justices in denying an effort by Texas to overturn the Biden victory in four battleground states.
At the appeals level, Judge Stephanos Bibas of the 3rd Circuit, nominated in 2017, wrote a blistering decision last month rejecting the Trump campaign’s election challenge in Pennsylvania. And Judge Andrew L. Brasher of the 11th Circuit, appointed this year, wrote an opinion this month rebuffing the campaign’s effort to bypass the lower federal court and decertify Georgia’s election results.
Fischman said that to rule differently would have been to flout the law. “It’s completely against judicial culture,” he said. “They just could not be taken seriously as judges if they sided with Trump here.”
Bibas and Brasher serve on courts that Trump has flipped toward conservative majorities. While Bibas was not among the most disputatious of the appointees, according to the analysis, he dissented in a significant gun-rights case in which two Democratic appointees upheld New Jersey’s limit on large-capacity magazines.
“We must treat the right to keep and bear arms like other enumerated rights,” he wrote. “We may not water it down and balance it away based on our own sense of wise policy.”
Barrett — who until October served in Indiana on the 7th Circuit, where there is a particular culture of agreement — also followed the pattern, striking out against Democratic-named colleagues over 7% of the time and against Republican appointees 2.5% of the time, the analysis showed.
In one such case, she disagreed that a man who had admitted to killing his wife was denied the right to a lawyer when a judge questioned him. (Her position later held sway when the case was considered by a full slate of 7th Circuit judges.)
On the District of Columbia Circuit, Judge Neomi Rao, confirmed to the bench just last year, has already made waves. Of four cases with published opinions that she participated in alongside two Democratic appointees, she dissented three times, the analysis showed. In June, she wrote the majority opinion ordering a lower-court judge to dismiss the case against Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser.
In a case decided in May, Judge Joel M. Carson III of the 10th Circuit dissented as his Democratic-appointed peers ruled against a challenge to the Trump administration’s ban on bump stocks, the attachments that allow semi-automatic rifles to fire in sustained bursts. That case is now under consideration by the full circuit.
And this month, Judge Lawrence J.C. VanDyke broke from his colleagues on the 9th Circuit, objecting as they ruled against the Trump administration and called an immigration policy favoring wealthy immigrants for green cards “arbitrary and capricious.” VanDyke was among the handful of Trump nominees at the appellate level whose qualifications were questioned by the American Bar Association.
Not all the judges fit the pattern: Many serve on courts with a majority of Republican appointees, and some belong to circuits with a stronger culture of consensus. But The Times found that Trump appointees were more likely to be involved in a case featuring dissent even when those factors were accounted for.
The analysis examined how often and with whom the judges agreed but not the ideological content of their opinions. Though the cases sometimes touched on big policy debates — abortion, gun rights, policing — they more often concerned matters like employment disputes and criminal and immigration court appeals.
The Trump administration’s work in swiftly filling vacant judgeships has depended heavily on Republicans in the Senate, particularly Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. He has encouraged eligible federal judges to retire to create more openings and has led a confirmation process in which Republicans shunned compromise and sought unbending conservatives and reliable political allies to populate the bench.
As of this month, if pending nominations are taken into account, President-elect Joe Biden stands to inherit fewer than 25 openings across the federal judiciary, compared with the more than 100 that carried over to Trump from Barack Obama's administration.
Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee have appealed to Lindsey Graham, its Republican chairman through the end of the year, asking him not to proceed with any more nominations before Biden is sworn in.
But even with a Democrat in the White House, the Republicans will be in a position to continue their push for conservative appointees, or at least block liberal ones, unless Democrats gain control of the Senate by winning both seats in next month’s special election in Georgia.
“A lot of what we’ve done over the last four years will be undone sooner or later by the next election,” McConnell said in October as Barrett was confirmed. “They won’t be able to do much about this for a long time to come.”

President Donald Trump’s neighbors in Florida are seeking to enforce a decades-old compact that says Mar-a-Lago, his private social club, cannot be used as a full-time residence — as Trump has suggested he plans to do after he leaves the White House.
Neighbors of Mar-a-Lago sent a letter to the Town of Palm Beach and the U.S. Secret Service on Tuesday complaining that Trump has violated the 1993 agreement he made with the town that allowed him to convert the property to a moneymaking club.
“Per the use agreement of 1993, Mar-a-Lago is a social club, and no one may reside on the property,” wrote Reginald Stambaugh, a lawyer representing the DeMoss family, which has a property next to Mar-a-Lago.
“To avoid an embarrassing situation for everyone and to give the president time to make other living arrangements in the area, we trust you will work with his team to remind them of the use agreement parameters,” Stambaugh wrote. “Palm Beach has many lovely estates for sale, and surely he can find one which meets his needs.”
The letter came as Trump’s days in office are winding down and he is proceeding with plans to move with his wife and son to Florida after the inauguration of his successor, President-elect Joe Biden, on Jan. 20. The New York Times reported in 2018 that Trump had changed his domicile to Mar-a-Lago, in part for tax purposes. Almost immediately, residents of the town began raising questions about the legality of the move, given the agreement the president struck with the town decades ago.
Construction has been done on the president’s residential quarters at the club, where Trump is expected to spend the Christmas holiday and which Stambaugh argued already violates the use agreement.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on Stambaugh’s complaint, which was first reported by The Washington Post. The mayor of Palm Beach and a spokesperson for the Trump Organization did not respond to emails seeking comment.
Glenn Zeitz, a New Jersey-based lawyer who is assisting Stambaugh and is not being paid by the DeMoss family, said the town had declined to enforce certain aspects of the agreement in the past on several issues, including how many days a year the president has stayed there.
In other instances, Trump has been given leeway by the town because of legitimate security concerns. Among them was the addition of a helipad for Marine One, which will be removed after he leaves office.
“As president, I think they gave him certain considerations that they felt were the appropriate thing because of his status,” said Zeitz, who encountered Trump decades ago when he represented a client whose property the then-casino owner wanted for an Atlantic City expansion.
Trump has sought to do things like build a dock attached to his property that the agreement prohibited, ostensibly for club members’ use. That effort was blocked by the town, and then the president submitted a revised effort claiming it was for private use for himself and the first lady. He withdrew the second dock petition after the 1993 use agreement became public.
With the letter, Stambaugh is hoping to push the town to make clear that Trump is flouting the terms of his agreement allowing him to convert the sprawling Mar-a-Lago property, once owned by Marjorie Merriweather Post, from a private residence into a club.
“The significant tax breaks the president received for this arrangement remain in effect, as does the use agreement,” Stambaugh wrote. “Some press reports indicate that renovation has already commenced at Mar-a-Lago in order to make the family quarters more commodious for full-time residency.”
Part of that use agreement, which was reviewed by The Times, limits how long members can stay there. It says that there cannot be stays for “three nonconsecutive seven-day periods by any one member during the year.”
The club is also supposed to file sworn statements with the town each year asserting that a minimum of 50% of its members live or work in Palm Beach and that the club has no more than 500 members.
Some of those reports have not been filed. And the club has seen a boom in the number of members who have joined in the past few years, according to records reviewed by The Times, although it is not clear if they replaced departing members.

Buttigieg Recalls Discrimination Against Gay People, as Biden Celebrates Cabinet’s Diversity

WASHINGTON — Pete Buttigieg was a teenager, not yet openly gay, and had dreams of being an airline pilot when he watched Republicans in the late 1990s deny a confirmation vote to President Bill Clinton’s choice for ambassador to Luxembourg because of his sexual orientation.
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., majority leader at the time, called homosexuality a sin and compared it with personal problems like alcoholism, kleptomania and sex addiction. Blocked by his adversaries, Clinton used a recess appointment to send James Hormel, a San Francisco philanthropist and heir to a meatpacking fortune, overseas.
Now, two decades later, Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and earlier this year a primary race opponent of Joe Biden’s, is poised to become the first openly gay Cabinet secretary after Biden, now president-elect, picked him to run the Transportation Department. Buttigieg recalled the teenage memory during brief remarks on Wednesday.
“I watched that story, and I learned something about some of the limits that exist in this country when it comes to who is allowed to belong,” he said. “But just as important, I saw how those limits could be challenged.”
With Biden seated nearby during his remarks, Buttigieg recalled proposing to his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, in an airport terminal — “Don’t let anybody tell you that O’Hare isn’t romantic,” he joked — and thanked the president-elect for not wavering from the history-making nomination.
“I can’t help but think of a 17-year-old somewhere who might be watching us right now, somebody who wonders whether and where they belong in the world, or even in their own family, and I’m thinking about the message that today’s announcement is sending to them,” Buttigieg said.
History was clearly on Biden’s mind, as well. Even as he has been buffeted by the demands of Democratic interest groups over the past several weeks, the president-elect said he remained determined to assemble a Cabinet that was not only qualified but also mirrored the diversity of the United States’ population.
Biden, who seemed annoyed by public and private criticism of his choices so far, said that when he was finished, he would have “a Cabinet of barrier-breakers, a Cabinet of firsts” unlike any of his predecessors’.
“We’ll have more people of color than any Cabinet, ever. We’ll have more women than any Cabinet, ever,” he said, noting that he has picked the first Black defense secretary, the first Latino head of homeland security, the first woman and South Asian American to lead the budget department and the first woman to be Treasury secretary, among others. “Our Cabinet doesn’t just have one first or just two of these firsts, but eight precedent-busting appointments.”
“And today,” he added, “a ninth.”
There has never been an openly gay Cabinet secretary. Under President Donald Trump, Richard Grenell, who is openly gay, served as acting director of national intelligence, a Cabinet-level post that is not part of the 15 Cabinet posts defined by federal law. He also did not face Senate confirmation because Trump chose to make him an acting director.
At 38, Buttigieg would also be one of the youngest Cabinet secretaries in history. Julián Castro was 39 when President Barack Obama appointed him housing secretary in 2014. And Alexander Hamilton was in his mid-30s when he became the nation’s first Treasury secretary.
Like both of those men, Buttigieg has higher ambitions. His bid for the presidency this year vaulted him from obscurity into the top tiers of the Democratic Party. Now, he will have a national platform from which to continue building a political identity.
But that may put him in direct competition with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, 56, who also challenged Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination and is all but certain to run for president again, perhaps as soon as 2024, when it is expected that Biden will not seek another term.
The pair expressed nothing but warmth toward each other Wednesday, at an event in Wilmington, Delaware. Harris, who joined the event via video because of a winter storm on the East Coast, called Buttigieg a “trailblazing leader from the industrial Midwest who understands we need to create opportunity for people of all backgrounds.” Buttigieg thanked the vice president-elect for “your trailblazing leadership, your encouragement and your friendship.”
The good feelings might evaporate quickly if Buttigieg and Harris end up facing off against each other in a primary campaign that could begin in just over two years. Or Buttigieg could defer to Harris, waiting until he has a clearer path to the White House.
Biden called Buttigieg “a policy wonk with a big heart” and said he “selected Pete for transportation because the department is at the intersection of some of our most ambitious plans to build back better.”
If Buttigieg wins confirmation as transportation secretary, Biden said he would play a key role in advancing his ambitious agenda to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure and would be a central official in the administration’s efforts to combat climate change.
Buttigieg supports restoring Obama-era vehicle emissions standards and making the United States carbon neutral by 2050, priorities that align with the climate-centric role that Biden wants for his Transportation Department. The agency has the authority to regulate vehicle emissions, the leading source of climate-warming pollution in the United States.
Buttigieg spoke of his own “personal love of transportation ever since childhood,” and he emphasized the need to improve the country’s infrastructure, mocking Trump for repeatedly declaring an “infrastructure week” only to fail in negotiating a bipartisan deal to secure more funding to repair the nation’s crumbling roads and bridges.
“Americans expect us to see to it that the idea of an infrastructure week is associated with results and never again a media punchline,” he said.

President Donald Trump visited Montana four times in 2018 as part of the Republican Party’s attempt at unseating Sen. Jon Tester. It didn’t work: Tester was reelected that year to a third term.
But last month Tester’s Republican colleague from Montana, Sen. Steve Daines, rolled to reelection against a formidable and well-funded Democratic rival, Gov. Steve Bullock.
Why did Tester prevail while Bullock lost? And more to the point, why do most Democrats keep faring so poorly in rural America?
Tester, a farmer from Big Sandy, Montana — and the only full-time farmer in the Senate — has a few ideas. He lays them out at length in his new book, “Grounded: A Senator’s Lessons on Winning Back Rural America,” a memoir that doubles as a policy manifesto.
He also discussed his views in a recent interview with The New York Times. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: Beyond President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, which is no small thing, this was a difficult year for your party, and especially in rural areas. Why?
A: I think showing up is a fundamental rule of politics, and I don’t know that we showed up. Because of COVID, we didn’t show up on the campaign trail. And in a state like Montana, you have to give people a reason to vote for you or they’ll vote Republican — they’ll default to Republican. And I think that hurt us greatly in 2020. The Republicans, for the most part, didn’t see the pandemic as near as a threat to health as some of the Democrats did.
Q: Do you think that the images of riots and arson in American cities may have motivated rural folks to vote for Republicans more than the people who actually lived in some of those cities?
A: Yes. And then what we didn’t do is we didn’t respond to them. We didn’t come out with strong advertisements saying: “Rioting, burglary, is not demonstration and it’s not acceptable. And you’d be punished by the full extent of the court if I’m in a position of leadership.” We didn’t come out with a very strong pushback on that, and certainly wasn’t timely when it was time.
Q: How do you balance support for law enforcement with accountability for police officers who break the law?
A: You approach it from a standpoint that we’re going to do our level best to make sure we have the best-trained folks that we can on the beat, whether you’re in Big Sandy, or Great Falls, or wherever you’re at in the state of Montana.
And I think the whole idea about defunding police is not just bad messaging but just insane. And I’ll tell you why. The area where we have the greatest poverty in the state of Montana is Indian Country. And where do we need more police officers than anywhere else? Indian Country. I mean, that’s a fact. Because of poverty, crime is more prevalent. We need more police officers, not less.
Q: Can Democrats go on the offensive in rural America?
A: Democrats can really do some positive things in rural America just by talking about infrastructure and what they’re doing for infrastructure, particularly in the area of broadband. And then I would say one other policy issue is how some Republicans want to basically privatize public education. That is very dangerous, and I think it’s a point that people don’t want to see their public schools close down in Montana.
Q: Is the issue for Democrats in rural areas the appeal of Trump, or is this a longer-term structural problem for the party?
A: There’s no doubt about it, he has an appeal in rural America. I can’t figure it out, but there’s no denying it.
But I will also tell you I think there’s a long-term structural issue. And by the way, I’ve had this conversation with Chuck Schumer [the Senate Democratic leader] several times — that we have to do a better job developing a message so that rural Americans can say, “Yeah, those guys, they think like I do.” Because that’s what Trump has right now.
I can go into the list of things that might be insane about this president, but the truth is that rural people connect more with a millionaire from New York City than they do with the Democrats that are in national positions.
So that tells me our message is really, really flawed, because I certainly don’t see it that way.
We do not have a — what do I want to say — a well-designed way to get our message out utilizing our entire caucus. So we need to do more of that. You cannot have Chuck Schumer talking rural issues to rural people; it ain’t gonna sell. And quite frankly, I don’t know that you can have Jon Tester go talk to a bunch of rich people and tell them what they need to be doing.
Q: Some Democrats believe they are never going to establish a durable Senate majority because of the nature of every state having two senators and the party’s difficulties with rural voters. When you hear that, does that tick you off?
A: Yeah, it does. Yeah, it does.
Q: Why?
A: Because the problem isn’t that the country’s skewed against the Democrats; the problem is that the Democrats have not done a very good job talking about what we believe in.
If there’s one mistake that is made way, way, way too often by folks in public service, it’s that you walk into a room and who does most of the talking? The senator.
Now, some forums that’s what the people want. But for the most part if you’re in a town hall, and you let people tell you what they’re thinking, let them tell you what’s going on — and then search into your mental database to find out if there’s anything that we’ve done to help solve that problem — then maybe you can have a conversation. But to walk in and say, “You need to think this, and this is what I believe is the right thing to think,” that switch goes off.
Q: In 2008, Barack Obama cracked 40% of the vote in a lot of rural America. Flash forward 12 years and Joe Biden is in the 20s in some of these counties. At this time 10 years ago, South Dakota had one Democratic senator, North Dakota had two, Montana had two. What has happened in about 10 years’ time?
A: You know where Barack Obama spent Fourth of July in 2008?
Q: Butte.
A: Butte, Montana. He showed up. Now, he didn’t win much in it, but he did a hell of a lot better than people thought he was going to do because he showed up.
What has happened in Montana as far as losing Max Baucus’ seat, and in North Dakota and in South Dakota, I think speaks to the fact that we’re not speaking to rural America. And look, Steve Bullock lost [this year’s Senate race in Montana] for a number of reasons. One was they nationalized it. They totally nationalized his race. They tried to do it to me, too. What I had that Steve didn’t have was there wasn’t a damn pandemic, and I could go out. And we did, man. We showed people that I was not AOC, for Christ’s sake.
Q: You said, “Our party should stand for three words: ‘opportunity for everyone.’” Democrats always complain that they can’t distill their message onto a bumper sticker. But that’s three words — could that fit on a sticker?
A: Yeah, it could — it could work, yeah. It means you take care of the folks who need help, you give them opportunity.
Q: In your book, you challenge Donald Trump Jr. to a day of “pickin’ rock” on your farm. Does your offer still stand?
A: You’re goddamn right.
Q: You lost your home county in 2018 even though you exceeded 50% statewide. Did that personally sting you, and does that speak to the larger structural problems facing the party?
A: Look, for sure. I mean, yeah, I would love to win my home county, but it is very red.
Q: How much of that is just people living on Facebook?
A: It is a big part of it, right? I’ve got good friends of mine, I might add, really, really good friends of mine, lifelong friends, that quite frankly say stuff that I go: “Really? That’s what you think? That’s crazy.”
Q: When you started in state politics in 1998, I’m guessing that you had many more weekly and daily papers in Montana. And now people are getting their news from Facebook every morning.
A: That’s exactly right. That’s exactly right. And all from people that have the same view.
Q: Your seat was once held by Mike Mansfield, the former Senate Democratic leader, whose tombstone at Arlington National Cemetery simply reads, “Pvt., U.S. Marine Corps.” Do you think any of your Senate colleagues will have a tombstone that modest?
A: [Laughs] Hopefully my tombstone will say “Jon Tester ...”
Q: “Farmer?”
A: “Farmer.”

Joshua Hawkins said the request seemed “pretty weird,” but the dark-haired man who made it was offering cash and a lot of it.
The man said his name was Nate, and he wanted Hawkins, a local artist, to paint an enormous Soviet-style mural of Cookie Monster — the voracious, pastry-loving “Sesame Street” creature — and three Russian words on a commercial building in Peoria, Illinois.
When the job was done over Thanksgiving weekend, the man paid in full, and Hawkins, 33, proudly displayed the mural on his Facebook page.
But Hawkins learned C can also be for Caper.
Less than a week after the mural went up, Hawkins said he received a call from the real Nate Comte, who said he had never commissioned the Cookie Monster mural.
He also made his feelings about the mural very clear: He swiftly used white paint to cover the wall.
In a brief interview, Comte expressed fury over the attention that the apparent prank had gotten from national and international news outlets.
“This isn’t news,” Comte said, then added an expletive. “I’ll give you a headline: Man paints his own building wall.
“I don’t hate art,” he earlier told The Journal Star of Peoria. “But I don’t know what the hell that was.”
Hawkins said Comte threatened to call the police, even after he explained that he had been bamboozled. Hawkins denied that he had concocted the mural himself.
“I wish I had the patience to pull this elaborate of a prank off,” he said.
Hawkins, who apologized to Comte on his Facebook page, said he was still trying to figure out the real identity of the man who hired him, whom he described as tall, fit and in his 40s. He has scoured social media for clues, kept an eye out for the fake Nate’s truck and wondered about the connection between the man who hired him and the real Comte.
“I’m telling you I’ve been trying,” Hawkins said. “I don’t know if it’s some friend of his or a pissed-off neighbor or some distant relative that’s pulling a prank, but it’s curious.”
One thing Hawkins said he is confident about: The fake Nate knew Comte.
“He knew his building, he knew his name, and he knew he wasn’t there,” Hawkins said.
Around Peoria, a riverfront city of about 110,000 people in central Illinois, the episode has spawned an untold number of theories about who might have commissioned the mural.
“We just kind of like the mystery of it,” said Jenn Gordon, executive director of ArtsPartners of Central Illinois. “Whoever was behind it, they certainly put a spotlight on Peoria.”
Comte erased the mural despite the consternation of some in the local arts community, who expressed sadness and even anger about its removal.
Comte told The Journal that he had received “hate mail” for painting over the vibrant colors and the Russian words, which put a Cookie Monster twist on an old Bolshevik slogan, “Peace, land and bread.”
“Now I’m the evil Grinch,” Comte said.
Comte confirmed that he had created a Facebook page, “Graffiti Replacement Mural,” inviting people to post an image to replace the mural he had whitewashed.
“The owner will select the winning design and hire a local artist to paint it,” the page said.
In retrospect, Hawkins said, he could have asked more questions. The design request was an odd one for Peoria, where Hawkins said businesses usually commission murals of families, celebrities from the city and animals.
Hawkins said the man never showed him any permits or proof he owned the building. He did not say what he did for a living and never gave his full name. He only provided the last name Comte in a two-sentence email that he sent Hawkins with a copy of the design.
“The design is attached,” the email, dated Nov. 23, said. “The graphic designer put it a one foot scale grid over it so you can lay it out from this image. Sincerely, Nate Comte.”
An email sent to the account seeking comment was not answered. Neither was a message left on the voicemail of a phone number provided in the email.
Hawkins said he first met the man at an art show in Peoria about a year and a half ago. He did not hear from him again until he called him the week before Thanksgiving to commission the mural.
“I was really hesitant at first because it’s a pretty big mural,” Hawkins said. But the man was offering enough money that Hawkins would be able to hire a large crew to help him.
Hawkins asked him what the Russian words meant, and the man replied, “Peace, land, cookies.”
“I thought he was opening a bakery,” Hawkins said.
Hawkins said he last saw the man Nov. 29, when they met for lunch, where Hawkins said he showed him pictures of the mural.
Later that day, when the mural was finished, Hawkins called him and texted him to come and see it. The man never responded, and Hawkins said he has not heard from him since. Hawkins declined to say how much he was paid.
The episode will remind artists to ask more questions of people who commission their work, said Gordon, the art program director.
“This is a relatively small community, and I think there is just a little bit of good faith from artists when they’ve been commissioned to do a piece,” she said.
The neighborhood where Hawkins painted Cookie Monster is a mix of residential and industrial buildings largely bereft of the colorful murals that dot other parts of the city, said Katy Shackelford, an urban planner in St. Louis who lived in Peoria for more than five years and advised on public art installations.
The fast removal, however, gave the mural and its “cheeky” take on the Bolshevik rallying cry a significance it otherwise might not have had, Shackelford said.
“I think the message went further because it was temporary,” Shackelford said. “If it had stayed up over time, people would have been like, ‘Man, that was an ugly mural.’ ”
Despite the stress the trickery caused, Hawkins said he was not vexed with his mysterious patron, whom he described as an “honest liar.”
In other words: Me no angry.
“The guy paid me, and he paid me pretty well,” Hawkins said. “So I’m not mad at all about that.”

A fast-moving winter storm barreled through the Mid-Atlantic and into the Northeast on Wednesday, with forecasters warning of as much as 2 feet of snow in some areas and freezing rain, strong winds and hazardous travel conditions along the Interstate 95 corridor.
For the millions of people living in big East Coast cities like New York and Philadelphia — where snow began falling in the afternoon — the storm was on track to be one of the biggest in several years.
The storm, a nor’easter, hit first in Maryland, Virginia and the Washington, D.C., area, with a mixture of freezing rain and snow blanketing the region. Near Frederick County, Maryland, dozens of cars could barely inch forward on a packed highway. In Washington, about 50 miles southeast, the snow seemed to be turning to slush.
The storm was expected to stretch nearly 1,000 miles, from North Carolina to New England, according to the National Weather Service. It threatened to fell trees, knock out power and cover roadways with ice. Schools that have been holding in-person classes, including in New York City and Boston, had either already closed or announced plans to do so.
By early afternoon, the storm was creating dangerous travel conditions in parts of the Mid-Atlantic. Snow was falling across the Baltimore area, forcing some COVID-19 testing sites to close temporarily; forecasters there expected sleet and perhaps freezing rain by evening.
Farther north, with the first snowflakes signaling the storm’s approach, people rushed to complete their preparations. Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey declared a state of emergency, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said he anticipated doing the same.
In Massachusetts, where a foot of snow was expected, Gov. Charlie Baker asked residents to prepare and to avoid travel when the snowfall was heaviest. In Boston, officials announced that garbage pickup that had been scheduled for Thursday and Friday would be delayed by a day. Two city-sponsored mobile COVID-19 testing sites were also closed.
By the afternoon, some businesses in and around Boston made plans to close. Matt Otten, manager at Zaftigs Delicatessen, a Brookline, Massachusetts, restaurant known for its Jewish comfort food, said he typically would not close because of bad weather. This time, though, he was worried. “We are concerned for our workers’ safety since the roads are going to be very treacherous,” he said.
Boston, Hartford, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island, had the potential to get more than a foot of snow in 24 hours, something that had happened only three times before, the National Weather Service in Boston said.
Washington, like Philadelphia and other cities, began to get a wintry mix of rain and snow in the afternoon. Western Maryland and southern central Pennsylvania were forecast to bear the brunt of the storm, with as much as 2 feet of snow falling in those areas.
Even as state and municipal officials were issuing stern warnings, some people greeted the storm’s arrival with joy.
For Lucas Whiffen, 3, of Philadelphia, it would be the first big snowstorm of his life. His mother, Gail Whiffen, noted that his new snow pants had not yet arrived, but Lucas was confident he had plenty of winter gear: “A jacket and mittens and a hat, shoes, boots,” he said, eagerly awaiting the snow in which to use them.
Benjamin and Rebecca Tu of Orange County, California, marveled at the storm as they strolled through the woods near Wissahickon Creek in Philadelphia. It was the first one they had ever seen.
“What do you do to prepare for it?” Tu wondered. He had considered charging his phone in case the power went out. But he didn’t do it.

Newest Pandemic Shortage and Price Spike: Christmas Trees

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
NEW YORK — Diana Karvelis spent 15 minutes choosing just the right Christmas tree — a 5-footer that cost $65 — at a stand in Manhattan on a freezing weekday night.
“In the past it’s been a ‘nice to have,’ now it’s a ‘need to have,’” she said.
Karvelis, who was laid off from her job and moved to a new apartment in the midst of the pandemic, said that in a year when she could not see her family in person, the experience reminded her of cutting down a Christmas tree while growing up outside Detroit.
She is one of many New Yorkers searching for comfort in conifers, clamoring for Christmas trees as balms of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic that has turned everyone’s life upside down.
But the Christmas tree business, like seemingly everything else, has been disrupted by the virus. There are fewer sidewalk stands in the city, with some vendors citing public health concerns as the reason they are staying away, while others have noted an unmistakable spike in demand from pent-up New Yorkers desperate for holiday cheer.
And eager buyers are being asked to dig a little deeper as some vendors raise their prices.
Across the United States, Canada and much of Europe, consumers have been snapping up trees, leading in many cases to record sales. Some people are first-time buyers, while others are buying earlier than usual, making it challenging to keep fresh trees in stock.
Tim O’Connor, executive director of the National Christmas Tree Association, said growers sold 26.2 million trees in the United States last year and that “all indications are that it will be a higher number than that” in 2020.
In New York, there is clearly a correlation between pandemic fatigue and people heading for the nearest tree seller — in some cases right after cleaning the Thanksgiving dinner dishes.
“I think people are just starving for human contact,” said Erika Lee Sengstack, an owner of Tree Riders NYC, the East Village stand where Karvelis bought her tree. “And to be able to make that connection on the street, over a tree, is truly heartwarming.”
Some vendors worry that they might not have enough trees this season.
“The racks should speak for themselves,” said Jody LaBonville, gesturing to the scarcity of trees left at the stand in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, that he runs with his wife, Elen.
There did appear to be plenty of trees at the NYC Trees stand in Hell’s Kitchen, which spilled onto the sidewalk from a narrow lot off 10th Avenue. But many of them were slated for delivery, and more popular sizes, like 4- and 5-foot trees that are suitable for smaller apartments, were rarely available.
Kendall Larkin and Scott Elchison snagged a 5-footer for their nearby apartment before the stand ran out.
“I am a fanatic of Christmas,” Larkin said. “I think the saddest part is that a lot of the traditional stuff we can’t do, so this is a must.”
Harold DeLucia, who runs NYC Trees and Tyler’s Trees, said sales were already up nearly 200% at his stand from the same period last year.
Jane Waterman, who has run Uptown Christmas Trees for 46 years, said she had sold 2,000 more trees than this time last year from her 19 locations around the city.
“Trees have been flying off the lots," she said.
Reneé Campbell, part of a family that owns a tree farm in North Carolina, said “our phone has rang off the hook” with calls from vendors desperate for more trees, including several in the Northeast.
Still, New Yorkers who have yet to get a tree need not panic. They can still find well-stocked stands in many neighborhoods — but they might need to size up or size down and pay more than in years past.
Darnell Thornton and his daughter Celine, who purchased a 7-foot-tall tree from LaBonville, said his extended family usually gathers at their townhouse in Brooklyn for the holidays.
But even though that was out of the question this year, Thornton said he still wanted to make his home festive. He paid $200 for the tree, the same amount he paid for a larger tree last year, but he said he did not mind.
“We want to come to him and support his business,” Thornton said.
LaBonville, who helped Thornton tie the tree to his Jeep Grand Cherokee, said that on average he had to charge about 20% more this year, but “most people, they understand it.”
Many factors have contributed to the short supply. Many growers planted fewer trees after demand cratered during the 2008 recession, which affects the market now because trees can take a decade to mature.
This year some vendors in New York ordered fewer trees and chose to operate fewer stands than normal since the pandemic was so dire when they started making plans in the spring.
Kevin Hammer, who has been referred to as the city’s Christmas tree kingpin, said he decided to open only half the stands he normally does, though he would not specify a precise number.
The pandemic created other problems for Hammer. Many of his sellers usually travel to the city from the Canadian province of Quebec, but because the border is closed to all nonessential travel they could not make the trip. He was left with trees and locations to sell them, but nobody to make the sales.
“Five weeks before D-Day is when everybody started canceling, and I lived on the phone for five weeks, calling everyone I know,” Hammer said.
Some vendors who have become seasonal fixtures in their neighborhoods have not returned this year because of the virus.
One of them, who said that he had worked at a stand run in Greenwich Village for the past 19 years, said the border restrictions kept him away from the city.
“My customers keep texting me, ‘Where are you?’ ‘What’s going on?’” said the vendor, who asked to be referred to by his first name, Sebastien, to avoid possible greater government scrutiny at the border in the future.
LaBonville, who has traveled from Jackman, Maine, near the Canadian border, with his wife to sell trees for six years, was one of the people Hammer called as he scrambled to reorganize his stands.
LaBonville said that normally they set up a stand in the West Village, but this year Hammer sent them to Brooklyn to take over a location that had been run by someone from Quebec for a decade.
During tree-selling season, LaBonville and his wife live out of a recreational vehicle that they park in the lot of a medical clinic behind the stand. When they are not selling trees, they plant them: They work as foresters the rest of the year.
LaBonville said the clinic allows them to park there for the duration of their stay and to use its bathroom in exchange for trees for the staff.
Such arrangements are common in the city. A 1938 law allows people to sell trees on city streets without a permit, as long as they have permission from nearby property owners and do not block pedestrians.
Many vendors develop close ties to neighborhoods they visit year after year, finding companionship during their long cold days on the street.
“I’ve been preached at, I’ve been lectured, I’ve been edified,” LaBonville said. “I feel like Lucy with the psychiatrist’s stand.”
In the dark winter of 2020, more customers than usual may seek his ministrations.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
LONDON — In a year of hard decisions about how to confront the coronavirus, perhaps none has proved as anguished for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as whether to ban Britons from getting together for a little Christmas cheer.
For weeks, British tabloids have speculated darkly that Johnson would be forced to “cancel Christmas.” Some noted he would the first British leader to do so since Oliver Cromwell tried to stamp out Yuletide merrymaking during the ascetic days of the Puritan movement in the mid-17th century.
On Wednesday, Johnson stuck by his pledge to lift some important restrictions for a few precious days between Dec. 23 and 27 — a decision that attests to his deep-seated desire not to be seen as the Ebenezer Scrooge of Downing Street, as well as to the atavistic appeal of the Christmas holiday in this otherwise secular country.
Johnson has not wavered even after new cases surged in London, which prompted the government to put the capital under stricter rules between now and Dec. 23. Nor has he backed down after two British medical journals warned of the potentially dire consequences of easing the measures over Christmas.
His decision sets him apart from leaders in other European countries that cherish the season every bit as much as Britain does.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel imposed a nationwide lockdown that will extend over Dec. 25, snuffing out hopes for a reprieve after the country’s beloved Christmas markets were shuttered earlier this month. The Netherlands and the Czech Republic have also imposed lockdowns, while Italy is leaning toward one.
“The Christmas debate has really brought out the argument between those who believe it is all about preventing deaths and those who believe there have to be other considerations,” said Jonathan Sumption, a historian and former justice on Britain’s Supreme Court who is a vocal critic of the lockdowns.
Christmas, he said, “is now largely a nonreligious festival, but it has a lot of the resonance of family reunions that Thanksgiving has in the United States,” making it a celebration that cuts across cultural and religious boundaries.
Gathering children and grandparents around a Yuletide table — aglow with a brandy-soaked pudding; alive with the pop of Christmas crackers — exerts such a pull on the British popular imagination, Sumption said, that even if the government were to impose a lockdown, many would simply flout it.
Johnson seemed to acknowledge that reality. In a news conference, he pleaded with Britons to show caution in their social interactions by keeping family gatherings small and brief, and by putting off visits with grandparents and other elderly people until after they are vaccinated. But he said he did not want to “criminalize” those who have already made plans to spend time with their families.
“We don’t want to cancel Christmas,” he said. “That would frankly be inhuman and go against the instincts of a majority of people in this country.”
It clearly goes against his instincts. The prime minister lamented having to take such a “prescriptive” approach, even invoking the dreaded example of Cromwell himself. Back in March, he waited a week longer than most European countries to impose a lockdown. In November, he moved more slowly than other leaders in imposing fresh restrictions after a second wave of infections.
As he often does, Johnson tried to lift spirits with humor. “Have yourself a merry little Christmas, but this year alas, preferably a very little Christmas,” he said.
Reversing course on the rules at this late stage would only have deepened the confusion, Johnson’s defenders said. After 10 months of pandemic, they said, the public could be trusted to use common sense.
Still, the net result is a muddled situation, where the government’s rules and guidance on Christmas have diverged. The authorities in Scotland are advising tighter restrictions than their counterparts in England. In Wales, where a new lockdown looms, the law is being changed to enforce tougher measures over the festive period, too. All this is setting the stage for what medical experts fear could be a post-holiday surge in infections.
The British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal published a joint editorial this week urging Britain to follow the example of Germany. They projected there could be nearly 19,000 people in hospitals by year end — comparable to the levels in early April, at the height of the deadly first wave of the pandemic.
“We believe the government is about to blunder into another major error that will cost many lives,” the journals said.
Medical experts pointed to the explosion in cases in the United States after Thanksgiving as an omen for what Britain could expect in January. The prevalence of infections in London and the south and east raised the specter of tens of thousands of people carrying the virus to less affected parts of the country.
While experts said they were sympathetic to giving people a reward at the end of a grueling year, the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine meant they would only have to endure one last stretch of deprivation before relief comes.
“I saw both sides of this of this debate a few weeks back,” said Devi Sridhar, the head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh. “Now I’m convinced it’s a bad idea.”
For Johnson, a leader who craves approval, the paradox is that the public seems to back a harsher approach. Almost half of people said they believed the Christmas rules were not strict enough, according to a recent poll by Ipsos MORI. About 2 in 5 said they were right and just 10% said they were too tough.
Those results might seem surprising, given Britain’s deep attachment to Christmas. The festivities sprawl over two days, with Dec. 26 also a national holiday, known as Boxing Day. Some date the extravagant celebration of Christmas to the Victorian era, when it started to symbolize some of the nation’s common values.
“It was seen to symbolize the British love of home and family, their respect for tradition and the past, and a shared way of life in a society divided by class and politics,” said Martin Johnes, a professor of history at the University of Swansea.
“During the Second World War,” he said, “some suggested it was important to celebrate Christmas because it summed up everything people were fighting for.”
Giles Fraser, the rector of St. Mary’s church in Newington, South London, agreed that Christmas plays “a central part in the cultural psyche” — so much so that he said he was not sure whether the politicians making decisions fully appreciated how central it was to people’s morale.
Fraser, who works in economically deprived parts of London, said the need for celebration was particularly acute this year after the deaths, illness and job losses of the pandemic. His own parish recently suffered a blow when its church hall collapsed after a suspected arson attack.
For Fraser, the pandemic has meant planning for compromises like moving carol singing outside the church. But canceling Christmas would be “an existential blow to people's well-being in a way that perhaps might not be understood elsewhere,” he said. “That is why politicians are so reluctant to take it on.”
“I will feel very rebellious,” he added, “if I am told by the government that I am not allowed to do it.”

Pandemic Leaves More Military Families Seeking Food Assistance

WASHINGTON — Fort Bragg, the largest military base in the United States, has all the trappings of a small American city: shopping centers, a barber shop and social clubs. In a sign of the times, it also has a food bank.
This spring, the YMCA on base — which started a food pantry last year to respond to the growing food insecurity among military families — saw a 40% increase in requests for groceries. During the same period, grocery requests to AmericaServes, a network that helps military families, jumped to the biggest service request in the organization’s history.
The story is much the same around the country, hunger groups say, for the lowest-income families in the military, who have a specific set of challenges, and different from civilians whose economic fortunes have also been damaged by the coronavirus pandemic.
Spouses of active-duty troops have lost jobs, the same as thousands of other Americans, but are often the least likely to be able to find new ones. Children who rely on free or reduced meals at school no longer are receiving them, and military families often have more children than the national average.
“A lot of kids who were getting breakfast and lunch at school no longer are,” said Michelle Baumgarten, the associate executive director of the Armed Services YMCA at Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, who said peanut butter and jelly and oatmeal requests have soared. “Families were going from two incomes to one income is the common thread.”
While many poor civilian families have turned to federal food programs for support, military families often receive a housing allowance that renders them ineligible for food assistance, a quirk in the law that Congress has repeatedly failed to resolve.
The most junior enlisted personnel earn $1,733 to $2,746 a month; 7% to 18% of military families and veterans have had someone in their house seek emergency food assistance, according to a report from the advocacy group Blue Star Families.
While military families make up a small portion of the 37 million Americans struggling with food insecurity, hunger experts say most Americans have no idea that people serving in the military often need to rely on help to eat.
“There is something that’s so unjust about it that the families who are making significant sacrifices for our country, and are not able to fully meet their basic needs,” said Josh Protas, the vice president of public policy at Mazon, a Jewish group focused on hunger. “The charitable sector doesn’t have the capacity to fully address this issue — nor should it. I really think the Pentagon has really tried to sweep this under the rug.”
The Defense Department is working on a report to Congress on the topic, said Maj. César Santiago, a Pentagon spokesman.
Veterans are in a similar situation, hunger advocates and service organizations have found. Food help has become the No. 1 request at Serving Together, an organization that assists veterans and military families in Maryland and Washington, for the first time in at least five years, said Jennifer Watson, a program manager there. The group has a partnership with two other organizations, and teenagers have been helping to distribute food boxes to hungry veterans.
Military families had distinct problems in the economy long before the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States. Spouses of members of the military have high unemployment — roughly 25% — because of their constant relocations and inability to transfer professional licenses from state to state.
Because they are so mobile, military spouses tend not to accrue seniority in the workplace, and so often are the first fired and the last rehired in a weak economy. Many of the families have difficulty managing money.
“Military families, particularly junior enlisted people, struggle with financial literacy,” said Daniel Gade, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who now teaches public policy at American University in Washington. “Military families are often rather isolated, which means they have a thinner social network.”
According to a recent study from the Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University, nearly 40% of active-duty families had food and nutrition support needs since the pandemic hit.
While rent forgiveness and unemployment insurance claims covered other basic costs, food has leapt to the front of the line of needs. “In nearly six years of supporting coordinated care networks around the country, food assistance has never cracked the top three requested services overall,” said Nick Armstrong, the senior director of research and data for the institute.
On a recent Wednesday, the food pantry at Fort Bragg was buzzing with business. “It’s been eye-opening to see the families that do struggle in the military,” said Rachel Szabo, who was recently laid off from her job in industrial design.
Her husband, who is stationed at Fort Bragg and is on the lower end of the pay scale, and Szabo, who is pregnant, have been getting help from the YMCA at the base, which began its food program a year ago and has seen explosive growth in need. “I had never needed to reach out for assistance,” Szabo said. “When I did lose my job, we still had bills. I have a lot of student loans still, so being able to reach out to the Y to make ends meet has really been a lifesaver.”
In San Diego, another YMCA program is distributing meals to 1,000 children in military families weekly, and its food distribution for that group has increased by more than 400% since the pandemic began. “The greatest need has come from our military kids no longer being in school,” said Tim Ney, who runs a program for military families there. “They no longer have access to the free or reduced cost meals.”
The Pentagon says the issue of hunger on military bases — which have had food pantries for years — is overstated.
“Military members are very well paid,” said Santiago, citing a recent study conducted by RAND National Defense Research Institute. “Junior enlisted members, on average, are paid better than 90% of the adult working population with a high school education and similar years of experience in the workforce. The issue of food insecurity has been examined and found to be minimal in the military.”
Several members of Congress disagree and have been working on legislation to change the housing benefit that prohibits some families from getting food assistance.
“Our military is weakened when service members are unable to feed their families,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who has tried repeatedly to change the law, to no avail.
Gade, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for senator from Virginia this year, acknowledged that his party is often hostile to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as food stamps are also known. But he said that he believed the parties could find common ground on this particular issue.
“We know SNAP isn’t going anywhere,” he said, adding that fixing what he called the “egregious” rule “is something we can do together.”

Lawmakers condemn '1619 Project' for schools

Texto completo: Two Republican state lawmakers have condemned the use of "The 1619 Project" in an Arizona school district.
Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Oro Valley, and Rep. John Fillmore, R-Apache Junction, wrote in a statement that they are concerned that the Balsz School District plans to bring lessons from "The 1619 Project" to the classroom.
The project is a Pulitzer Prize-winning initiative from The New York Times that contextualizes America's founding and history by examining the impacts of slavery on the nation.
The lawmakers also condemned an effort by Arizona State University's Center for the Study of Race and Democracy to bring the project to other schools.
Earlier this month, Balsz Superintendent Arleen Kennedy told The Arizona Republic that the project would help present a more honest view of American history.
"This is the reality of what America is," she said. "And whenever you say that, people automatically go to the negative, and say, 'Well, you're calling America bad.' What we're doing is we're trying to put context to what it means to be American, make no bones about it."
Finchem and Fillmore also wrote letters to Kennedy and Arizona State University President Michael Crow.
District officials and a spokesperson for Crow did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The lawmakers' statements questioned the historical veracity of the project but did not point out specific passages or portions found to be inaccurate.
Some historians have criticized parts of the project, questioning accuracy. Chief among the complaints is the assertion that the American Revolution was fought, in part, to protect the institution of slavery.
The editor-in-chief of The New York Times Magazine defended the project, and that assertion, in an opinion piece.
"I am happy to respond to any assertion that is in that so-called curriculum that the School Board and the University might think factual," Finchem wrote in the statement.

Treasure smiles upon Venezuelans

Texto completo: The most extraordinary moment in the young fisherman's life began in the most mundane way: with a morning visit to the latrine.
Walking back to his tin-roofed hut on Venezuela's Caribbean coast, the fisherman, Yolman Lares, saw something glisten along the shore. Raking his hand through the sand, he pulled up a gold medallion with an image of the Virgin Mary.
The village of Guaca was once at the center of Venezuela's fish processing industry but is now reduced to penury by the lack of gasoline and the closure of most of its small fish-packing plants. Amid such misery, the valuable find seemed like a miracle.
"I began to shake, I cried from joy," said Lares, 25. "It was the first time something special has happened to me."
At home, Lares told his father-in-law, also a fisherman. Word of the discovery spread swiftly, and soon most of the village's 2,000 residents had joined in a frenzied treasure hunt, combing every inch of the waterfront, digging around dilapidated fishing boats, even sleeping on the beach to protect their few square feet of sand and the untold fortune the plot could contain.
Since late September, their search has turned up hundreds of pieces of gold and silver jewelry, ornaments, and golden nuggets that washed up on their shore, offering the villagers a baffling and wondrous -- if short-lived -- reprieve from Venezuela's seemingly endless economic collapse.
Dozens of villagers said they had found at least one precious object, usually a gold ring, with unconfirmed reports that some had sold their discoveries for as much as $1,500.
To many here, the unexpected bounty was a message of hope.
"This is God, setting his agenda," said Ciro Quijada, a local fish plant worker who found a gold ring.
No one knows where the gold came from and how it ended up scattered along a few hundred feet of Guaca's narrow, workaday beach.
The mystery has merged with folklore, and explanations draw equally on legends of Caribbean pirates, on Christian traditions and on the widespread mistrust of Venezuela's authoritarian government.
The jagged coastline around Guaca, on Venezuela's Paria peninsula, is punctuated with bays and islands that have long given refuge to adventurers.
It was on this peninsula, in 1498, that Christopher Columbus became the first European to set foot on the South American continent, thinking he'd found the entrance to the Garden of Eden.
Later, this sparsely defended coastline was regularly raided by Dutch and French buccaneers. Today, it is a haven for drug and fuel smugglers and modern-day pirates who prey on fishermen.
Did a storm disturb a pirate treasure chest or break open up a sunken colonial frigate?
Did the bounty come from modern smugglers heading to nearby Trinidad? For weeks, Guaca was rife with speculation.
Government opponents said officials may have sprinkled the gold on the beach to calm protests by local residents against the terrible living conditions.
Others fretted the government would send soldiers to confiscate their treasure.
Some villagers called the gold a blessing, others a curse that would doom anyone touching it.
Once the first photo of the discovery was posted on Facebook, the news spread around Venezuela. But the area's remoteness, the widespread shortage of gasoline and the coronavirus quarantines prevented a national gold rush.
A chemical test commissioned by The New York Times on a link of gold chain discovered on Guaca's beach indicated the piece was likely manufactured in Europe in recent decades.
The test showed the chain was made of high-quality, 18-karat gold uncommon in Venezuela's domestic jewelry production. The alloy would have been difficult to produce in pre-modern conditions, said Dr. Guy Demortier, a jewelry-authentication specialist based in Belgium.
Chris Corti, a technical expert in jewelry-making based in Britain, examined photographs of several objects discovered in Guaca and said they appeared to have been commercially manufactured in the mid-20th century.
But he cautioned that more analysis was needed to make a firm determination about the date and origin of the pieces.
The source of Guaca's treasure may never be known. The villagers almost immediately sold the objects they discovered to buy food.
"Whatever we get, goes straight in the mouth," said Hernan Frontado, a fisherman and Lares' father-in-law, who had to beg neighbors for cassava, the cheapest local staple, to feed his family before finding several pieces of gold jewelry.
Frontado sold his finds in Carupano, the closest city, for less than what he thought they were worth to buy rice, flour and pasta.
Before Venezuela's economic crisis began in 2014, Guaca and the surrounding villages supplied Latin America with sardines and canned tuna.
Today, only eight of the 30 rudimentary sardine warehouses in the area still operate; the nearby tuna canning factories, run by the government, have gone bust.
Crippling fuel shortages this year have tipped the downturn into a daily fight for survival for many villagers.
To obtain any gasoline for their boats, the villagers have to sell half their sardine catch to the government at a set rate equivalent to just 1.5 cents for a pound.
"The government doesn't care about us at all," said Jose Campos, a sardine fisherman. "We keep giving them fish, and we get nothing in return."
Fuel became so scarce this year that many fishermen had to row out to the open sea, or stay out in their small, exposed boats for days to preserve gasoline, braving storms, thirst and pirates.
"It got so bad, I felt as if a rope was tightening around my neck," said Lares, who first discovered the gold.
He made $125 from the objects he found -- by far the biggest sum he ever made at once.
Lares used the money to buy staples in bulk. He also bought some sweet breads for his children -- the first treat they'd had in years. He fixed a broken television and bought a used speaker, giving his family some entertainment in their earthen-floor home without indoor plumbing, where six people share one bed under a leaking roof.
The treasure has allowed his family to go back to eating twice a day. His youngest child, 2-year-old Thairy Lares, has gained weight in the past month, though she is still malnourished.
The treasure did not change Lares' life, but it reminded him that good things can happen, even amid hardship.
Guaca's residents still find small golden objects in the sand. At sunset, when the beach goes quiet, a few residents can be seen sitting by the surf, running their hands through the sand in the fading light.
"If it happened once," Lares said, "it will happen again."

Texto completo: At harvest time, as neighbors and relatives reap their crops, 80-year-old Jamal Khan can only look in despair on the plot of land that was the source of his family's livelihood -- until the American forces arrived over a decade ago.
Just before sunset one day, armored vehicles drove into fields of knee-high corn stalks, claimed about 30 acres that were co-owned by about as many families and quickly cordoned off the area with barbed wire. This was now Combat Outpost Honaker-Miracle, one of the roughly 1,000 military installations the United States and its coalition partners would prop up across Afghanistan.
"In the whole vastness of the lord's world, I had this plot of land and this house that I am living in and nothing else," said Khan, who lives the Watapur District of Kunar province, in eastern Afghanistan. "We told them this is our private land, how do you suddenly put up here? They said nothing."
Khan is one of countless Afghans whose land became a casualty of the U.S.-led war and the sprawling military infrastructure born from it. They have been forced to navigate a maze of Afghan and American bureaucracy and indifference, stoking a growing bitterness toward coalition forces and the Afghan government alike.
Despite the drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan from more than 100,000 in 2011 to fewer than 5,000, some of the property they occupied has not been returned. Instead, the bases and the land have been transferred to Afghan security forces.
The Americans have left Watapur but Khan does not have his land back, and similar conflicts linger across the country. In at least half a dozen of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, The New York Times has found land disputes involving owners who said they had simply been shut out.
In a country where due process is nearly impossible in the face of corruption and state erosion, the U.S. presence has added to a long history of land disputes that have often served as an underlying cause of local conflicts.
The Taliban touts the swift resolution of disputes in its shadow courts as a strength, and the unresolved discord over land bolsters the insurgents' message that not only are Afghans deprived of justice under the American-backed government, but that the U.S. military presence has added to the injustice.
Khan still carries a pile of documents: petitions to the government, and even confirmation letters from the U.S. Army that say he is the rightful owner. On several occasions, he says, delegations from Kabul came to investigate -- and they asked the villagers for money to cover their expenses during the stay.
But the most painful reminder of the trespass is his collection of small receipts. Although the Afghan army now occupies his land, Khan is still required to pay tax on the plot.
Over the years of fighting, the size of the U.S.-constructed installations varied greatly. Some bases were sprawling, even housing their own fast-food chain restaurants. In other cases, coalition forces would briefly occupy empty Afghan homes, destroying or modifying walls for defensive purposes before leaving.
Today, most installations are controlled by Afghan security forces; the few U.S. bases that remain are shuttering now as part of the U.S. deal with the Taliban.
In northern Balkh province, the U.S.-led coalition forces built a base next to the provincial capital's airport. Amanullah Balkhi, a local business owner, says the installation occupied about 20 acres of his land.
The defense ministry said it was government land, Balkhi was told, but if he proved he owned it, the coalition would compensate him and pay rent. He says he fought a six-year legal battle that cost him about $2 million, which he covered by selling two of his apartment buildings, renting out more land and taking on $500,000 of debt.
"I have the deed, and the government and the courts have attested that this is my land," he said. "But the Americans still have the land and they still deny me."
Balkhi has become deeply depressed, he said, adding, "I have ruined my life to get my right, but I have gotten nothing."
The story of a base in Panjwai, in southern Kandahar province, is almost identical -- and speaks to the troubling legacy the United States has left behind.
About 10 years ago, dozens of coalition vehicles arrived at the small village and eyed about 10 acres of vineyard owned by half a dozen villagers. They even tasted the grapes before getting to work building a new base.
"They didn't carve a road where there was a trek, where we came and went -- they carved a road for themselves through people's lands, people's gardens," said Fida Muhammad, a tribal elder from Panjwai and one of the vineyard's owners.
In the initial days, there was word that the coalition forces were offering compensation, but the area was so restive that approaching the base for money meant taking potentially lethal risks. Villagers feared the Americans would mistake them for the Taliban. And they knew that if they did manage to get their money, the Taliban, who were everywhere, would know and come after them for profiting from the occupiers.
The area was so lush that "you had to squint your eyes to find a dry patch," said Rashid Gul, a village resident. But these days it's desolate except for one small patch of vineyard.
"It ruined the irrigation system too -- for five years, the irrigation canals were ruined, the land dried," Muhammad said of the coalition base. "Many families left the area. They went to the city for daily labor."
As one of the village elders, Muhammad took the lead in trying to get compensation and reclaim the land, to no avail. When the Americans ran the base, he said, the villagers' claim was simply lost in bureaucracy; come tomorrow, come the next day, he was told repeatedly.
"We have lost hope of finding someone who can get us our right," said Muhammad, who said he had made about 30 trips with petitions. "It's just tiring ourselves, losing more money, but we can't find a door to knock on for justice."
When a base was transferred to Afghan control, the forces stationed there were often too preoccupied with defending it against Taliban attacks to pay much attention to land claims. Many of the Afghan commanders who rotated through simply did not care about the local residents' grievances, which they saw as an issue between the farmers and the Americans.
Gul worried that even if one day the plot of land in Panjwai were returned, figuring out which piece belonged to whom could spark new disagreements.
Land disputes have been one of the main issues of conflict in the village, he said. Recently, Muhammad had to quell a feud because one farmer's tractor had crossed into another man's land.
"All this land is mixed up now," Gul said.
Resolving those conflicts would require digging through government archives, hoping to find old property demarcation records.
Asked how long that would take, he offered a tired smile.
"This is Afghanistan," he said.

Texto completo: GUACA, Venezuela - The most extraordinary moment in the young fisherman's life began in the most mundane way: with a morning visit to the latrine.
Walking back to his tin-roofed hut on Venezuela's Caribbean coast, the fisherman, Yolman Lares, saw something glisten along the shore. Raking his hand through the sand, he pulled up a gold medallion with an image of the Virgin Mary.
The village of Guaca was once at the center of Venezuela's fish processing industry but is now reduced to penury by the lack of gasoline and the closure of most of its small fish-packing plants. Amid such misery, the valuable find seemed like a miracle.
"I began to shake, I cried from joy," said Lares, 25. "It was the first time something special has happened to me."
At home, Lares told his father-in-law, also a fisherman. Word of the discovery spread swiftly, and soon most of the village's 2,000 residents had joined in a frenzied treasure hunt, combing every inch of the waterfront, digging around dilapidated fishing boats, even sleeping on the beach to protect their few square feet of sand and the untold fortune the plot could contain.
Since late September, their search has turned up hundreds of pieces of gold and silver jewelry, ornaments, and golden nuggets that washed up on their shore, offering the villagers a baffling and wondrous - if short-lived - reprieve from Venezuela's seemingly endless economic collapse.
Dozens of villagers said they had found at least one precious object, usually a gold ring, with unconfirmed reports that some had sold their discoveries for as much as $1,500.
To many here, the unexpected bounty was a message of hope.
"This is God, setting his agenda," said Ciro Quijada, a local fish plant worker who found a gold ring.
No one knows where the gold came from and how it ended up scattered along a few hundred feet of Guaca's narrow, workaday beach.
The mystery has merged with folklore, and explanations draw equally on legends of Caribbean pirates, on Christian traditions and on the widespread mistrust of Venezuela's authoritarian government.
The jagged coastline around Guaca, on Venezuela's Paria peninsula, is punctuated with bays and islands that have long given refuge to adventurers.
It was on this peninsula, in 1498, that Christopher Columbus became the first European to set foot on the South American continent, thinking he'd found the entrance to the Garden of Eden.
Later, this sparsely defended coastline was regularly raided by Dutch and French buccaneers. Today, it is a haven for drug and fuel smugglers and modern-day pirates who prey on fishermen.

Texto completo: GUACA, Venezuela - The most extraordinary moment in the young fisherman's life began in the most mundane way: with a morning visit to the latrine.
Walking back to his tin-roofed hut on Venezuela's Caribbean coast, the fisherman, Yolman Lares, saw something glisten along the shore. Raking his hand through the sand, he pulled up a gold medallion with an image of the Virgin Mary.
The village of Guaca was once at the center of Venezuela's fish processing industry but is now reduced to penury by the lack of gasoline and the closure of most of its small fish-packing plants. Amid such misery, the valuable find seemed like a miracle.
"I began to shake, I cried from joy," said Lares, 25. "It was the first time something special has happened to me."
At home, Lares told his father-in-law, also a fisherman. Word of the discovery spread swiftly, and soon most of the village's 2,000 residents had joined in a frenzied treasure hunt, combing every inch of the waterfront, digging around dilapidated fishing boats, even sleeping on the beach to protect their few square feet of sand and the untold fortune the plot could contain.
Since late September, their search has turned up hundreds of pieces of gold and silver jewelry, ornaments, and golden nuggets that washed up on their shore, offering the villagers a baffling and wondrous - if short-lived - reprieve from Venezuela's seemingly endless economic collapse.
Dozens of villagers said they had found at least one precious object, usually a gold ring, with unconfirmed reports that some had sold their discoveries for as much as $1,500.
To many here, the unexpected bounty was a message of hope.
"This is God, setting his agenda," said Ciro Quijada, a local fish plant worker who found a gold ring.
No one knows where the gold came from and how it ended up scattered along a few hundred feet of Guaca's narrow, workaday beach.
The mystery has merged with folklore, and explanations draw equally on legends of Caribbean pirates, on Christian traditions and on the widespread mistrust of Venezuela's authoritarian government.
The jagged coastline around Guaca, on Venezuela's Paria peninsula, is punctuated with bays and islands that have long given refuge to adventurers.
It was on this peninsula, in 1498, that Christopher Columbus became the first European to set foot on the South American continent, thinking he'd found the entrance to the Garden of Eden.
Later, this sparsely defended coastline was regularly raided by Dutch and French buccaneers. Today, it is a haven for drug and fuel smugglers and modern-day pirates who prey on fishermen.
Did a storm disturb a pirate treasure chest or break open up a sunken colonial frigate?
Did the bounty come from modern smugglers heading to nearby Trinidad? For weeks, Guaca was rife with speculation.
Government opponents said officials may have sprinkled the gold on the beach to calm protests by local residents against the terrible living conditions.
Others fretted the government would send soldiers to confiscate their treasure.
Some villagers called the gold a blessing, others a curse that would doom anyone touching it.
Once the first photo of the discovery was posted on Facebook, the news spread around Venezuela. But the area's remoteness, the widespread shortage of gasoline and the coronavirus quarantines prevented a national gold rush.
A chemical test commissioned by The New York Times on a link of gold chain discovered on Guaca's beach indicated the piece was likely manufactured in Europe in recent decades.
The test showed the chain was made of high-quality, 18-karat gold uncommon in Venezuela's domestic jewelry production. The alloy would have been difficult to produce in pre-modern conditions, said Dr. Guy Demortier, a jewelry-authentication specialist based in Belgium.
Chris Corti, a technical expert in jewelry-making based in Britain, examined photographs of several objects discovered in Guaca and said they appeared to have been commercially manufactured in the mid-20th century.
But he cautioned that more analysis was needed to make a firm determination about the date and origin of the pieces.
The source of Guaca's treasure may never be known. The villagers almost immediately sold the objects they discovered to buy food.
"Whatever we get, goes straight in the mouth," said Hernán Frontado, a fisherman and Lares' father-in-law, who had to beg neighbors for cassava, the cheapest local staple, to feed his family before finding several pieces of gold jewelry.
Frontado sold his finds in Carupano, the closest city, for less than what he thought they were worth to buy rice, flour and pasta.
Before Venezuela's economic crisis began in 2014, Guaca and the surrounding villages supplied Latin America with sardines and canned tuna.
Today, only eight of the 30 rudimentary sardine warehouses in the area still operate; the nearby tuna canning factories, run by the government, have gone bust.
Crippling fuel shortages this year have tipped the downturn into a daily fight for survival for many villagers.
To obtain any gasoline for their boats, the villagers have to sell half their sardine catch to the government at a set rate equivalent to just 1.5 cents for a pound.
"The government doesn't care about us at all," said José Campos, a sardine fisherman. "We keep giving them fish, and we get nothing in return."
Fuel became so scarce this year that many fishermen had to row out to the open sea, or stay out in their small, exposed boats for days to preserve gasoline, braving storms, thirst and pirates.
"It got so bad, I felt as if a rope was tightening around my neck," said Lares, who first discovered the gold.
He made $125 from the objects he found - by far the biggest sum he ever made at once.
Lares used the money to buy staples in bulk. He also bought some sweet breads for his children - the first treat they'd had in years. He fixed a broken television and bought a used speaker, giving his family some entertainment in their earthen-floor home without indoor plumbing, where six people share one bed under a leaking roof.
The treasure has allowed his family to go back to eating twice a day. His youngest child, 2-year-old Thairy Lares, has gained weight in the past month, though she is still malnourished.
The treasure did not change Lares' life, but it reminded him that good things can happen, even amid hardship.
Guaca's residents still find small golden objects in the sand. At sunset, when the beach goes quiet, a few residents can be seen sitting by the surf, running their hands through the sand in the fading light.
"If it happened once," Lares said, "it will happen again."

Tim Wu: Facebook cannot buy its way out of competition

Texto completo: The Federal Trade Commission and more than 40 states filed an antitrust suit against Facebook on Wednesday, prompting the company and its defenders to argue that Silicon Valley’s very way of doing business is under attack.
On the contrary. What the federal government and states are doing is reasserting a fundamental rule for all American business: You cannot simply buy your way out of competition. Facebook, led by its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has taken that strategy to a smirking and egregious extreme, acquiring multiple companies to stifle the competitive threat they pose. To ignore the company’s conduct would be to license it, allowing a long-illegal practice to become a norm.
As the metaphor goes, capitalism is a jungle and business is about survival. A business can survive in one of two ways: It can be as good as, or better than, the competition; or it can spend money to buy up any competitors that endanger its market share or disable them using tactics like exclusive dealing. The core message of the Sherman Antitrust Act is that buying up or disabling competitors, while often effective, is prohibited as a means of doing business.
This rule, in effect since 1890, has been widely ignored in Silicon Valley over the past decade and a half. If the first generation of tech juggernauts developed a reputation for ignoring accounting rules (think of WorldCom or AOL), the second generation was notorious for ignoring the basics of antitrust law. During the 2010s, the idea that they could “always just buy any competitive start-ups” (Zuckerberg’s words) became the default strategy for dealing with new threats. Buoyed by high stock prices and with billions of dollars in cash on hand, big companies bought smaller rivals with ease.
No one faults Facebook for gaining its social networking dominance in the first place, beating rivals like Myspace in the 2000s. The trouble is what it did to hold on to the kingdom.
In the early 2010s, Facebook became insecure about its prospects. Younger people began favoring sites like Instagram. Messaging apps, especially WhatsApp, become another popular alternative. As Zuckerberg himself noted, social networking threatened to become a multitude of mechanisms for exchanging information, maybe even — gasp — a competitive marketplace of medium-sized players.
Facebook could have tried to meet these challenges by improving its product. And to be fair, it did continue to innovate and improve — in some ways. But at the same time, as the legal complaint filed this week shows, Facebook also engaged in a campaign to buy or bury many of the most dangerous threats to its dominance: WhatsApp, Instagram and about a dozen others.
Facebook’s strategy was similar to John D. Rockefeller’s at Standard Oil during the 1880s. Both companies scanned the horizon of the marketplace, searching for potential competitors, and then bought them or buried them. That was the essence of the Rockefeller business model. The investigative journalist Ida Tarbell wrote memorably of Rockefeller’s aggressive approach to acquisition: “And nothing was too small: the corner grocery in Browntown, the humble refining still on Oil Creek, the shortest private pipeline. Nothing, for little things grow.”
It was precisely this business model that Congress banned in 1890.
Facebook’s public defense of itself rests on the most rickety of foundations. It notes (correctly) that the federal government did not block its mergers with companies like WhatsApp and Instagram at the time, and then argues (incorrectly) that this means nothing can be done now. But nothing in the law or legal tradition justifies that argument. Standard Oil was broken up in 1911, decades after its greatest offenses; the same was true with the dismantling of Alcoa and AT&T. In historical terms, the case against Facebook is coming quickly.
More important, when the federal government opted not to block Facebook’s mergers with companies like Instagram, it explicitly reserved the right to take another look at the mergers (and in any event, the states were not involved in the federal government’s original decision). There is often information that the government cannot access or know at the time it reviews a merger, but that emerges later. As it often does, the passage of time has made things clearer: Facebook’s conduct became more obviously anticompetitive and the lasting nature of its monopoly became undeniable.
A more radical defense of Facebook suggests that a monopolist buying up its rivals is just “the Silicon Valley way.” But that is a recipe for monopolistic immortality and, ultimately, an acceptance of monopoly capitalism. There have been nations — prewar Germany, today’s China — that have embraced such a thing. But in the United States, we have repeatedly rejected it through the democratic process. Unfortunately, we’ve been backsliding for two decades, which is why the reassertion of the rules is so important.
The Facebook lawsuit is what lawyers call a “big case,” for it may transform the tech industry. It joins a tradition of such cases, including the antitrust suits against Standard Oil, American Tobacco, Alcoa, IBM, AT&T and Microsoft. None of those cases damaged the American economy. On the contrary, the lawsuits were aimed at monopolies that had squashed competition, and they resulted in revitalized, reorganized and ultimately more innovative industries.
It has been more than 20 years since the United States has taken as serious a look at the practices of big business as it is doing now. By that measure, the case against Facebook is long overdue.

Michelle Goldberg: Just how dangerous was Trump?

Texto completo: Throughout Donald Trump’s presidency, there’s been an argument on the left over the sort of threat he poses.
The American left’s most famous figures — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, Noam Chomsky — saw Trump as an authoritarian who could, if reelected, destroy American democracy for good. But another strain of left opinion viewed Trump’s fascistic gestures as almost purely performative, and believed his clumsiness in marshaling state power made him less dangerous than, say, George W. Bush.
A leading proponent of this position is political theorist Corey Robin, author of an essential book about right-wing thought, “The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism From Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin.” In an interview with the left-wing publication Jewish Currents, he argued, “Compared to the Republican presidencies of Nixon, Reagan and George W. Bush, Trump’s was significantly less transformational, and its legacy is far less assured.”
The Electoral College’s ratification of Joe Biden’s victory seems an appropriate point to revisit this debate. Trump tried, in his sloppy, chaotic way, to overturn the election, and much of his party, including the majority of Republicans in the House, and many state attorneys general, lined up behind him. Yet he failed, and it’s unlikely that he will follow calls from supporters, like his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, to declare martial law.
So what matters more, the president’s desire to overthrow American democracy, or his inability to follow through? Just how fascist was Trump?
Part of the answer depends on whether you’re evaluating Trump’s ideology or his ability to carry it out. It seems obvious enough that the spirit of Trumpism is fascistic, at least according to classic definitions of the term. In “The Nature of Fascism,” Roger Griffin described fascism’s “mobilizing vision” as “the national community rising phoenix-like after a period of encroaching decadence which all but destroyed it.” Translate this into the American vernacular and it sounds a lot like MAGA.
Fascism is obsessed with fears of victimization, humiliation and a decline, and a concomitant cult of strength. Fascists, wrote Robert O. Paxton in “The Anatomy of Fascism,” see “the need for authority by natural chiefs (always male), culminating in a national chieftain who alone is capable of incarnating the group’s historical destiny.” They believe in “the superiority of the leader’s instincts over abstract and universal reason.” This aptly describes Trump’s movement.
Yet Trump was only intermittently able to translate his movement into a government. The national security state was more often his antagonist than his tool. There were Justice Department investigations of the president’s political enemies, but they mostly came to nothing. The military was deployed against protesters, but only once.
Trump celebrated what may be the extrajudicial killing of Michael Reinoehl, an antifa activist wanted in a fatal shooting, but such killings weren’t the norm. He put children in cages, but was pressured to let them out. And in the end, he lost an election and will have to leave.
The damage he’s done, however, may be irreversible. On Twitter, Robin argued, correctly, that George W. Bush, far more than Trump, changed the shape of government, leaving behind the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security. Most of Trump’s legacy, by contrast, is destruction — of even the pretense that the law should apply equally to ruler and ruled, of large parts of the Civil Service, of America’s standing in the world. (If mainstream liberals are more deeply horrified by Trump than some leftists, it could be because they maintain greater romantic attachments to the institutions he’s defiled.)
Most consequentially, Trump has eviscerated in America any common conception of reality. Other presidents sneered at the truth; a senior Bush official, widely believed to be Karl Rove, famously derided the “reality-based community” to journalist Ron Suskind.
But Trump’s ability to envelop his followers in a cocoon of lies is unparalleled. The Bush administration deceived the country to go to war in Iraq. It did not insist, after the invasion, that weapons of mass destruction had been found when they obviously were not. That’s why the country was able to reach a consensus that the war was a disaster.
No such consensus will be possible about Trump — not about his abuses of power, his calamitous response to the coronavirus, or his electoral defeat. He leaves behind a nation deranged.
The postmodern blood libel of QAnon will have adherents in Congress. Kyle Rittenhouse, a young man charged with killing Black Lives Matter protesters, is a right-wing folk hero. The Republican Party has become more hostile to democracy than ever. Both the Trump and Bush presidencies concluded with America a smoking ruin. Only Trump has ensured that nearly half the country doesn’t see it.
In May, Samuel Moyn predicted, in The New York Review of Books, that if Biden won, fears about American fascism would dissipate. Complacent in their restoration, he wrote, those who warned of fascism “will cordon off the interlude, as if it was ‘an accident in the factory,’ as Germans after World War II described their 12-year mistake.”
As American electors gathered — with police offering armed guards and Michigan’s capitol closed by “credible threats of violence” — Moyn’s words, meant cynically, seem too optimistic. Trump failed to capture America, but he may have irrevocably broken it.

Paul Krugman: When did Republicans start hating facts?

Texto completo: Republicans spent most of 2020 rejecting science in the face of a runaway pandemic; now they’re rejecting democracy in the face of a clear election loss.
What do these rejections have in common? In each case, one of America’s two major parties simply refused to accept facts it didn’t like.
I’m not sure it’s right to say Republicans “believe” that, say, wearing face masks is useless or that there was widespread voter fraud. Framing the issue as one of belief suggests that some kind of evidence might change party loyalists’ minds.
In reality, what Republicans say they believe flows from what they want to do, whether it’s ignore a deadly disease or stay in power despite the voters’ verdict.
In other words, the point isn’t that the GOP believes untrue things. It is, rather, that the party has become hostile to the very idea that there’s an objective reality that might conflict with its political goals.
Notice, by the way, that I’m not including qualifiers, like saying “some” Republicans. We’re talking about most of the party here. The Texas lawsuit calling on the Supreme Court to overturn the election was both absurd and deeply un-American, but more than 60% of Republicans in the House signed a brief supporting it, and only a handful of elected Republicans denounced the suit.
At this point, you aren’t considered a proper Republican unless you hate facts.
But when and how did the GOP get that way? If you think it started with Donald Trump and will end when he leaves the scene (if he ever does), you’re naive.
Republicans have been heading in this direction for decades. I’m not sure whether we can pinpoint the moment when the party began its descent into malignant madness, but the trajectory that led to this moment probably became irreversible under Ronald Reagan.
Republicans have, of course, turned Reagan into an icon, portraying him as the savior of a desperate, declining nation. Mostly, however, this is just propaganda. You’d never know from the legend that economic growth under Reagan was only slightly faster than it had been under Jimmy Carter, and slower than it would be under Bill Clinton.
And rapidly rising income inequality meant that a disproportionate share of the benefits from economic growth went to a small elite, with only a bit trickling down to most of the population. Poverty, measured properly, was higher in 1989 than it had been a decade earlier.
Anyway, gross domestic product isn’t the same thing as well-being. Other measures suggest that we were already veering off course.
For example, in 1980 life expectancy in America was similar to that in other wealthy nations; but the Reagan years mark the beginning of the great mortality divergence of the United States from the rest of the advanced world. Today, Americans can, on average, expect to live almost four fewer years than their counterparts in comparable countries.
The main point, however, is that under Reagan, irrationality and hatred for facts began to take over the GOP.
There has always been a conspiracy-theorizing, science-hating, anti-democratic faction in America. Before Reagan, however, mainstream conservatives and the Republican establishment refused to make alliance with that faction, keeping it on the political fringe.
Reagan, by contrast, brought the crazies inside the tent.
Many people are, I think, aware that Reagan embraced a crank economic doctrine — belief in the magical power of tax cuts. I’m not sure how many remember that the Reagan administration was also remarkably hostile to science.
Reagan’s ability to act on this hostility was limited by Democratic control of the House and the fact that the Senate still contained a number of genuinely moderate Republicans. Still, Reagan and his officials spent years denying the threat from acid rain while insisting that evolution was just a theory and promoting the teaching of creationism in schools.
This rejection of science partly reflected deference to special interests that didn’t want science-based regulation. Even more important, however, was the influence of the religious right, which first became a major political force under Reagan, has become ever more central to the Republican coalition and is now a major driver of the party’s rejection of facts — and democracy.
For rejecting facts comes naturally to people who insist that they’re acting on behalf of God. So does refusing to accept election results that don’t go their way. After all, if liberals are servants of Satan trying to destroy America’s soul, they shouldn’t be allowed to exercise power even if they should happen to win more votes.
Sure enough, a few days ago televangelist Pat Robertson — who first became politically influential under Reagan — pronounced the Texas lawsuit a “miracle,” an intervention by God that would keep Trump in office.
The point is that the GOP rejection of facts that has been so conspicuous this year wasn’t an aberration. What we’re seeing is the culmination of a degradation that began a long time ago and is almost surely irreversible.

Texto completo: Two of the most intense factions in our politics, the anti-Trump Resistance with its claim to be standing against fascism and the conservatives trying to delegitimize Joe Biden’s victory with claims of widespread voter fraud, agree on almost nothing, but they do agree on one point: The Trump administration was successfully undermined — the Trump agenda thwarted and Donald Trump himself defeated — by liberal institutions that refused to normalize him, maintained a persistent alarm about his presidency and took every opportunity to obstruct, investigate, protest and impeach.
The liberals urging constant vigilance and outrage against Trump’s challenge to the 2020 outcome are trying to see this project of resistance through to its Biden-inauguration end. Meanwhile, the Trumpian side is trying to imitate it, since lurking below the right’s fantasy politics is a more cynical assumption that it’s a great idea, a highly effective political counterpunch, for Republicans to act like Biden is an anti-president, a Great Pretender — because that’s what liberals did to Trump and it obviously worked.
I think both of these groups are mostly wrong — that what defeated Trump was Trump himself, that the “fascism” discourse around his presidency was often a distraction, and that the most successful strategies pursued by the Democrats were strategies of normalcy rather than alarm. But now that the Electoral College has voted and a Biden presidency seems essentially assured, let’s consider the best arguments for how and why the Resistance undid Trump.
From the Resisters themselves, those arguments accuse anyone who was skeptical of their alarmism of ignoring the importance of passion, organization and mobilization in American politics. To eye-roll at the would-be defenders of liberalism and democracy, Laura K. Field of the Niskanen Center asserted just before the election, is to engage in an “implicit denial of the work that has gone into attempting to defeat Trump.” If his authoritarianism has fizzled out in fantasy and hopeless lawsuits, it still could have been much, much worse if people hadn’t felt a world-historical incentive to resist — an effort that merits “gratitude and respect, not dismissive call-outs and belittling tweets.”
Rather than emphasizing mobilization, meanwhile, the Trumpist version of Field’s argument emphasizes elite power — the way that the media and the judiciary and the bureaucracy joined with congressional Democrats in denying Trump any of the normal space of action that his predecessors enjoyed. This newspaper’s famous Op-Ed by “Anonymous” (later revealed to be Miles Taylor, the homeland security secretary’s chief of staff) claiming to represent the Resistance inside the Trump White House offers a condensed symbol of what these Trump supporters have in mind — a kind of inside-outside game of obstruction, with media entities and government officials cooperating to keep the agenda that Trump actually campaigned on from taking shape.
To these arguments I would offer a concession and a rejoinder.
The concession first: There’s no question that the anti-authoritarian, America-imperiled narrative of the last four years had some benefits for Trump’s opponents. It helped pressure the disparate factions of the American elite, from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, to close ranks against the president. It created an ideological home and a compelling self-understanding for anti-Trump Republicans. It contributed to the mobilization of suburban and minority voters in crucial states like Georgia and to the general sense of purpose that a successful political movement needs. And in its inside-game form, elite resistance definitely obstructed at least some of Trump’s expressed desires, from Gary Cohn and John Bolton maneuvering deceptively on NAFTA or NATO to the generals who repeatedly slow-walked orders to withdraw forces from the Middle East or Afghanistan.
My rejoinder, though, is that it’s not clear whether the Resistance mentality was more effective than more politically normal modes of fighting Trump, and whether the inside-the-system obstruction of the president actually derailed a real agenda rather than just adding extra layers of chaos to a presidency that never had a vision or a plan.
On the first point, one might observe that the Trump-era controversies most dominated by Resistance theatrics were conflicts that the Resistance didn’t win — the long Russiagate investigation and imbroglio, the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation battle, the impeachment fight.
At the same time, Trump’s actual defeats were the work of very conventional political campaigning: a midterm campaign in which the Democrats organized around health care and other kitchen-table issues and a presidential election in which they nominated their most moderate candidate and ran on normalcy and decency, casting Trump as a terrible person and a bad president but not a Mussolini in the making.
Then, too, the gains from the Resistance mentality came with a political price. The anti-Trump closing-of-ranks within elite institutions helped shore up the president’s populist bona fides, his claim to represent outsiders and non-elites, even when his actual policies favored insiders and the rich. The tendency to see an authoritarian depredation behind every policy move, however banal, weakened the credibility of the media, especially putatively neutral outlets like CNN. The pitch of anti-Trumpism bound once-dubious Republicans to his cause, almost matching the mobilization on the Democratic side.
And the liberal belief that Trump was obviously, self-evidently a white supremacist and semi-fascist left liberalism somewhat blindsided by the voters who disagreed: not just the white shy-Trumpers of the suburbs but also the Trump-voting Latinos and African Americans who helped keep the 2020 race competitive, denying Biden his blowout and the Resistance the full repudiation of Trumpism that it sought.
On the right, meanwhile, the Trumpist conceit that the Mueller investigation or MSNBC hysteria were the main forces preventing a more successful Trump agenda gives that opposition way too much credit — and Trump himself way too little blame. It was not the Resistance but his own indifference that induced Trump to outsource policymaking to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell during the two years when his party actually controlled the government. It was not the Mueller investigation but the attempted Obamacare repeal and a not-very-populist tax plan that drove his polling numbers to their notable lows.
When Kayleigh McEnany complained recently that her boss “was never given an orderly transition of power,” she had a point — but the major source of disorder was not Crossfire Hurricane or the Steele dossier but just the Trump team’s own incompetence, notably Jared Kushner’s decision to ditch Chris Christie’s transition plan without having a replacement.
The Resistance may have induced Democrats to take a lot of party-line votes against the president, but if Trump actually pursued his promised infrastructure bill he would have found Democratic takers. In areas where he had competent people working for him (judicial nominations, above all), the political and media opposition was impotent to stop him. Impeachment was just a segue into his presidency’s peak, a triumphant State of the Union address just before the coronavirus came calling. Even late in 2020, Nancy Pelosi was willing to make a deal with him on a big new round of coronavirus relief, which might have helped save his reelection bid — yet Trump preferred instead to go down tweeting.
So treating Biden the way Trump was treated, opposing him as Trump was opposed, is only a devastating strategy if you assume that Biden and his White House will miss as many opportunities and perform as many face-plants as Trump’s administration did.
And that’s without even getting into the fact that the Republican campaign to delegitimize Biden can’t really emulate the Resistance, since the whole point of the anti-Trump effort was to mobilize a political and cultural establishment from which the populist right is notably excluded. At most a refusal to recognize Biden’s legitimacy could keep congressional Republicans voting in lock step against whatever the new president supports. But most would vote in lock step anyway, and the Republican senators most likely to break ranks, a Mitt Romney or a Susan Collins, are the least likely to be swayed by appeals to Biden’s supposed illegitimacy.
Which means the attempt to build a right-wing Resistance narrative should probably be understood less as an effort to actually impede Biden’s administration and much more as a project to maintain Donald Trump’s position as his party’s leader, a president in exile — because, after all under its theory, he never really lost.
If the idea of Trump 2024 appeals to you, as it currently does to many Republicans, then this kind of Resistancing may sound like a good way to keep anybody else from claiming any kind of real position in the party. But the primary claim being made for it — that it will obstruct and defeat Biden the way Resistance liberals took down Trump — is a twofold error: They didn’t, and it won’t.

Bret Stephens: Donald Trump and the damage done

Texto completo: A few days before Barack Obama left office, he invited a small group of conservative writers, all Never Trumpers, for a conversation in the White House’s Roosevelt Room. The mood was dark.
The president was worried about the future of the Republican Party. We worried about the future itself. Someone mentioned the possibility of global thermonuclear war as a plausible outcome of a Trump presidency.
Nearly four years on, it’s worth comparing what was predicted about the Trump administration versus what actually happened.
Among the predictions: The stock market would never recover. We’d stumble into war with North Korea or Iran. The free press would be muzzled. Vladimir Putin would rule Donald Trump through blackmail. Trump-appointed judges would dismantle the rule of law and overturn the verdict of elections. Trump would never leave office.
None of this came to pass. Bad things happened under Trump. But nothing so bad that it couldn’t be stopped by courts (such as his attempt to end the DACA program), prevented by Congress (his desire to ease sanctions on Russia), undermined by underlings (his effort to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria), exposed by the press (the child-separation policy), corrected by civil servants (his coronavirus misinformation), rejected by voters (his presidency) or dismissed by the very judges he appointed (his election challenges).
Yes, there were serious missteps in the handling of the COVID crisis. But those who would blame Trump for tens or hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths ought at least to acknowledge that a pandemic of this magnitude would have gravely challenged any president. Deaths in the United States from COVID-19 (91 per 100,000 people) are slightly worse than in France (87) but better than in Britain (97), Spain (102) and Italy (107), all of which imposed harsher lockdowns and had more engaged leaders.
All of this has convinced many of my fellow conservatives, including those who were initially hostile to Trump, that there’s more than a touch of derangement to those of us who oppose him — a mixture of justified distaste for the man and his manners and unjustified fears about the consequences of his governance.
Trump, as they see him, wasn’t Mussolini II. He was mostly just Archie Bunker II — a blowhard easily kept within the four corners of our constitutional system.
But the catastrophe of Trump’s presidency doesn’t mainly lie in the visible damage it has caused. It’s in the invisible damage. Trump was a corrosive. What he mainly corroded was social trust — the most important element in any successful society.
I was reminded of this again reading an extraordinary essay in The Washington Post by former Secretary of State George Shultz, who turned 100 on Sunday. His central lesson after a life that spanned combat service in World War II, labor disputes in steel plants, the dismantling of segregation and making peace with the Soviets: “Trust is the coin of the realm.”
“When trust was in the room, whatever room that was — the family room, the schoolroom, the locker room, the office room, the government room or the military room — good things happened,” Shultz wrote. “When trust was not in the room, good things did not happen. Everything else is details.”
What Shultz attests from personal experience is extensively documented in scholarly literature, too. In high-trust societies — think of Canada or Sweden — people tend to flourish. In low-trust societies — Lebanon or Brazil — they generally don’t.
Trump’s presidency is hardly the sole cause of America’s declining trust in our institutions, which has been going on for a long time. In some ways, his was the culmination of that decline.
But it’s hard to think of any person in my lifetime who so perfectly epitomizes the politics of distrust, or one who so aggressively promotes it. Trump has taught his opponents not to believe a word he says, his followers not to believe a word anyone else says, and much of the rest of the country to believe nobody and nothing at all.
He has detonated a bomb under the epistemological foundations of a civilization that is increasingly unable to distinguish between facts and falsehoods, evidence and fantasy. He has instructed tens of millions of people to accept the commandment, That which you can get away with, is true.
Apologists for this president might rejoin that there are also examples of this form of politics on the other side of the aisle, notably in the person of Bill Clinton. That’s true. But it only causes one to wonder why so many of the same conservatives who vehemently objected to Clinton on moral grounds vehemently support Trump on the absence of moral grounds.
It may take Americans decades to figure out just what kind of damage Trump did in these last four years, and how to go about repairing it. The good news: no global thermonuclear war. The bad: a different kind of radioactivity that first destroys our trust in institutions, then in others, and finally in ourselves. What the half-life is for that kind of isotope remains unmeasured.

Culture has had to reckon with white privilege

Texto completo: "Dear White American Theater." So opened the scathing statement released June 8 and signed by some of our most influential playwrights and directors who are Black, Indigenous and people of color. "We see you. We have always seen you," the letter read a few lines later. "We have watched you pretend not to see us."
Landing in inboxes and on Instagram soon after Black Lives Matter activists took to the streets all over the country to protest the police killing of George Floyd, this open letter - like so many others in literature, arts and journalism - set out to expose how white gatekeepers and predominantly white-led cultural institutions systematically oppress artists and audiences of color that they claim to support.
Shortly after, it seemed as if almost every Black artist in America - from the fashion industry, Hollywood and the music world to performing arts venues and museums - began organizing with one another and decrying the specific ways that racism harmed Black creatives in their various industries (as a writer, even I signed an open letter). These examples ranged from hiring discrimination in fashion to unequal pay for African American musicians and executives to improper compensation and credit for the Black staff members in theaters and museums. While the sheer volume of the statements recognized the devastating toll that white privilege exacts on Black professional life, these open letters took it one step further. They demanded that organizations, many of which have long congratulated themselves for their open-mindedness and liberalism, reckon with their own racist practices from inside out.
Six months later, we now know that some groups rose to the occasion; others resisted. And while it is too soon to know if this moment, like the pandemic, will be consigned to the history books or if true change is on the horizon, there are some promising signs.
White actors - like Jenny Slate, who played a biracial character on the popular Netflix animated comedy "Big Mouth" - stepped away from voice roles to make space for Black actors to play Black characters. Country music groups like Lady Antebellum and the Dixie Chicks chose new names in an effort to distance themselves from glorifying the Confederate South.
Some organizations made swift changes in leadership. The president and board chairman of the Poetry Foundation stepped down immediately after an open letter signed by over 1,800 poets condemned the organization's "non-substantive" four-sentence statement in support of Black Lives Matter. Gary Garrels, senior curator at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, resigned after his statements warning of "reverse discrimination" against white artists in a Zoom staff meeting came to light.
And in New York City, William Carden announced his plans to step down as artistic director of Ensemble Studio Theater, where the entirety of its four-person artistic staff is white. "The key to anti-racism is sharing power," Carden told The New York Times in August. "It takes a lot of work and a lot of humility, and it requires that white people step aside."
While these new measures range from the cosmetic to the substantive, they begin to chip away at a truth that Black artists have always known: that the only way to achieve equity is to expose how white privilege exists from top to bottom in many of these cultural institutions, making it nearly impossible for artists of color to tell their stories on their own terms.
Fortunately, Black artists are not waiting around for change to happen, slowly or suddenly. Radha Blank's comedy "The 40-Year-Old Version," which debuted on Netflix in August, portrays Blank (playing herself) as a playwright and aspiring rapper who has to wrestle with whether to compromise her aesthetic vision when a white producer, Josh Whitman (Reed Birney), agrees to stage her play, "Harlem Ave," if she agrees to add a main white character. While Radha, the character, initially agrees to his terms, even allowing her Black female lead to appear as a caricature of African American womanhood, the film itself pokes fun at white gatekeepers and an American theater world that can only appreciate Black art when white people remain front and center.
Much like the cascade of open letters that were posted this summer, her movie provides a model to cultural institutions on how to integrate the lessons learned from our current racial reckoning. Whiteness, like any other source of power and site of privilege, must be challenged and moved out of the way as our dominant gaze so we can all finally see each other and ourselves.

Drugmakers Are Pulling Back From a Program to Help the Needy

WASHINGTON — Some of the nation’s top pharmaceutical companies have stopped giving federally mandated drug discounts to hospitals and clinics that care for the poorest Americans, a move that is prompting bipartisan calls for the health secretary, Alex Azar, to demand reinstatement of the price breaks or punish the firms.
The companies — including two that are partnering with the Trump administration on coronavirus vaccines — began scaling back their participation in the federal drug pricing program over the summer, saying that some hospitals and clinics were exploiting it to pad their own bottom lines. They say individual patients are not being hurt.
But hospitals, clinics and pharmacies that serve the poor say the change violates federal law and has been devastating — both to patients and to their own budgets — in the middle of an economic downturn spurred by the worst pandemic in 100 years. They say that the cutbacks are illegal and that now is not the time to reduce discounts that help them better serve the poor.
On Monday, a bipartisan group of state attorneys general, including Xavier Becerra of California, who is President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for health secretary, wrote a sharply worded letter to Azar calling on him either to require the payments or impose fines on the drugmakers. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia signed on.
“The health secretary needs to step in here and make sure that prescription drugs are provided to people that need them right now in the middle of a pandemic,” said Attorney General William Tong of Connecticut, who is leading the effort along with Becerra. “It really stuns me that companies do not seem to understand that people need access to health care and prescription drugs, literally, to live.”
A spokeswoman for Azar declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Several associations representing hospitals and clinics have sued the Trump administration, seeking to force Azar to act.
At issue is the future of the so-called 340B Drug Pricing Program created by Congress in 1992. It requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide steep drug discounts to certain health centers and hospitals that rely on taxpayer support — including Ryan White HIV/AIDS clinics and federally qualified health centers — as a condition of their drugs being covered by Medicaid.
These hospitals, clinics and their affiliated pharmacies pass the discounts on to consumers who do not have insurance, or adequate insurance, to pay for their drugs. But for insured patients, the hospitals, clinics and pharmacies are reimbursed by insurance programs at higher levels, and are supposed to use the savings to expand services to the poor.
The goal is to “stretch scarce federal resources as far as possible, reaching more eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services,” the Health Resources and Services Administration, which runs the program, says on its website.
William von Oehsen, a lawyer who represents an association of Ryan White clinics in a lawsuit against the government, described the 340B program as a “vital financing tool” and said drug companies “need to do their part to lower costs for these providers that are highly dependent on taxpayer support.”
The pharmaceutical industry, though, has never liked the program. A statement on the website of PhRMA, the industry’s trade group, declares that the program “needs to be fixed.”
Drugmakers say that 340B has grown far bigger than Congress intended, costing them tens of billions of dollars each year in part because of a decision by the health resources agency about 10 years ago to extend the discounts to pharmacies that contract with eligible hospitals and health centers.
A Government Accountability Office report in 2018 found that roughly one-third of the 12,000 covered clinics and hospitals use contract pharmacies. The number of contract pharmacies has grown rapidly, the report said, increasing from about 1,300 in 2010 to nearly 20,000 in 2017.
“The statute does not contemplate contract pharmacies,” said Derek Asay, a senior adviser for government strategy at Eli Lilly, which notified the health resources agency in July that it was going to scale back its participation in the program, beginning with prescriptions for the drug Cialis, which treats erectile dysfunction.
Asay, who said the program had been “plagued with abuses and problems with integrity,” said Lilly has decided to cut off discounts for nearly all contract pharmacies. In the case of hospitals or clinics that do not have in-house pharmacies, he said, the company will make an exception to allow one contract pharmacy to receive discounts.
But Becerra — in whose lap the issue will fall should the Senate confirm him as health secretary — said in a statement that the drugmakers were acting “unlawfully” in changing the program without the consent of Congress. Hospitals and clinic executives, and their lawyers, agree.
Sue Veer, the president and chief executive of Carolina Health Centers, a network of federally supported clinics, said that cutting off contract pharmacies would “reduce the savings that my health centers can retain and then invest back into primary care, things like behavioral health and substance abuse programs,” or programs for people who have HIV.
The move by Lilly prompted a scolding from Robert Charrow, the general counsel for the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Azar, who leads the department, was the president of Eli Lilly from 2012 to 2017.
In a letter sent in September, Charrow noted that the company’s stock price had jumped 11% since January, while “most health care providers, many of which are covered entities under section 340B, were struggling financially and requiring assistance” from the federal government. He said the timing of Lilly’s pricing changes was, “at the very least, insensitive to the recent state of the economy.”
Other drug companies — including AstraZeneca and Sanofi, both of which are partnering with the government on coronavirus vaccines — have followed Lilly’s lead, each imposing its own set of restrictions.
A spokeswoman for Sanofi, Ashleigh Koss, said that while the company “supports the 340B Program and its core objective of increasing access to outpatient drugs for uninsured and vulnerable populations,” it is refusing to grant discounts to pharmacies that are unwilling to provide data “necessary to identify and prevent waste and abuse.”
AstraZeneca said in a statement that the company “changed our approach to help mitigate the significant compliance issues that have been well documented in audits” performed by the Government Accountability Office, which audits government programs for Congress.
The companies say patients are not being harmed. But health executives and the lawyers representing them say that is not true.
In an affidavit filed in federal court as part of von Oehsen’s lawsuit on behalf of the Ryan White Clinics for 340B Access, Daniel Duck, the owner of the Corner Drug Store in Springhill, Louisiana, described a patient who paid $17.30 a month for insulin as part of the store’s “cash savings program” for customers who qualified for 340B prices.
But the cost went up to more than $1,300 after the drug’s maker, Sanofi, “no longer allowed the drug to be purchased with 340B discounts.” Eventually, the patient figured out a way to get the insulin through Medicare for a $300 copayment, which she said she would not be able to pay the next month.
A lawyer for Equitas Health, which serves as a contract pharmacy for a federally qualified health center in Columbus, Ohio, described a similar experience involving four patients who would ordinarily pay four cents for an insulin drug made by Sanofi.
“The retail cost of the prescription is $400,” the lawyer, Trent Stechschulte, wrote in an email. Combined with a dispensing fee of $15, he said, that is a cost that patients cannot afford and a level that harms the finances of hospitals serving the poor.

WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden is expected to announce a significant part of his energy and environment team this week.
In the coming days, Biden intends to name prominent leaders in the climate and clean-energy world to two senior positions: Gina McCarthy, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will be his senior adviser on climate change, and Jennifer Granholm, a former governor of Michigan, will lead the Department of Energy.
Biden on Tuesday named Pete Buttigieg, the former Democratic presidential candidate and mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to be his secretary of the Department of Transportation, a job that is expected to become climate-centric in the next administration as Biden pushes policies to promote electric vehicles and climate-resilient infrastructure.
Still undecided, though, is the president-elect’s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. That person will be central to Biden’s campaign pledges to enact an ambitious agenda of fighting climate change and reinstating environmental regulations that President Donald Trump rolled back.
“A new era of climate accountability is upon us," former Vice President Al Gore said in a statement. “The U.S. is back on task.”
Gore described McCarthy as “uniquely suited for the job” and said her appointment, along with John Kerry’s role as global climate envoy, “affirms that Joe Biden is serious about America leading by example and driving deep reductions in pollution and climate emissions.”
McCarthy, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration, was the architect of landmark rules to cut planet-warming pollution. In her new role, she would be in charge of coordinating domestic climate change policies across the federal government.
In addition to developing the Clean Power Plan, which set the first-ever national limits on carbon emissions from power plants, she also pushed forward rules to cut mercury emissions from power plants, to increase fuel efficiency in automobiles and to limit methane leaks from oil and gas wells.
The coal, gas and oil industries opposed all these policies, which were ultimately repealed or weakened by the Trump administration.
McCarthy’s deputy will be Ali Zaidi, New York state deputy secretary for energy and environment. Zaidi served in the Obama administration’s Office of Management and Budget, where he helped to coordinate and enact climate change policies and served as a top adviser on climate change to Biden’s campaign.
John Podesta, the founder of the Center for American Progress and onetime adviser to former President Barack Obama on climate change, called McCarthy and Zaidi a “powerhouse team.”
Some Republicans were less enthusiastic. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said in a statement that he was concerned about reviving Obama-era policies that he described as “punishing” to his state as well as other states with economies reliant on fossil fuels.
“Increased innovation — not the appointment of countless unchecked czars — will help protect our environment without punishing our economy,” Barrasso said.
In her new position, McCarthy will be empowered to direct agency heads across the federal government to enact climate policies, from emissions rules at the EPA to financial regulations on companies in connection with their bottom-line financial exposure to climate risks.
However, it is not yet clear who will hold her old job of EPA administrator — a position that will come with the authority to reinstate and strengthen the very Obama-era climate rules that McCarthy once wrote.
Biden’s first choice to lead the EPA was Mary Nichols, California’s top climate change regulator. But liberal activists contended that she had not done enough in her state to address racial disparities in environmental policy.
That has set off a scramble to find a new candidate to lead the agency. Possibilities now include Richard Revesz, a law professor and former dean of the New York University School of Law; Michael S. Regan, head of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality; and Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles.
One member of the Biden transition staff said that a final EPA choice might not come until after Christmas.
Granholm and Buttigieg are also expected to serve among McCarthy’s top clean-energy lieutenants.
As head of the Energy Department, Granholm will oversee the U.S. nuclear weapons complex as well as 17 national laboratories and a wide range of energy research and development initiatives, including a major loan office that backed the launch of Tesla.
Several people close to the transition said advisers had struggled over whether the Energy Department should be led by someone steeped in its core mission, ensuring the safety of the country’s nuclear arsenal, or whether Biden should select someone with a vision for leading a clean-energy transformation.
Granholm, a longtime champion of renewable energy development, is widely credited during her two terms as Michigan governor with steering her state through a recession and working with the Obama administration on a 2009 bailout of the automobile industry that included clean energy investments and incentives for carmakers to invest in technologies like battery storage.
After her second term ended, in 2011, she became an advocate for renewable energy development. She has given a TED Talk on how investing in alternative energy resources can bolster state economies, something Biden has focused on in his coronavirus recovery plan.
Buttigieg, as Transportation Secretary, is expected to play a key role in setting tougher rules on auto emissions, the leading source of climate-warming pollution in the United States, to encourage electric vehicles and to provide funding for mass transit.
“Transportation should really be considered as a green agency,” said Carol Browner, who served as Obama’s senior climate change adviser.
During his presidential campaign, Buttigieg pledged to restore Obama-era vehicle emissions standards and called for making the United States carbon neutral by 2050.
Climate change is also expected to play a broader role in planning infrastructure like roads, bridges, dams and levees, as the department takes into account new climate science showing how heat and flooding could damage such structures, and building and planning accordingly.
Buttigieg has frequently traced his awareness of the climate emergency to his experience managing two immense floods of the St. Joseph River when he served as mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
Biden is also said to be nearing a decision on who to appoint as Secretary of Interior, who would oversee the nation’s 500 million acres of public lands, including national parks, oil and gas drilling sites, and endangered-species habitat. The Interior secretary would also be at the head of any effort to strengthen federal protections for vast swathes of land and bodies of water that the Trump administration has opened up to drilling, mining, logging and construction.
The top contender is said to be Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., an appointment that would resonate with symbolism. If confirmed by the Senate, Haaland would be the first Native American appointed to a cabinet secretary position.
The Interior Department has for much of the nation’s history governed federal lands and often dislodged and abused Native Americans. Haaland is a citizen of Laguna Pueblo, one of the country’s 574 federally recognized American Indian tribes.
A growing coalition of progressive Democratic groups, Native American tribal leaders and Hollywood celebrities have spent weeks campaigning for Biden to select Haaland. Those efforts have had an effect, according to people within the transition.
However, Biden is also hesitant to remove a Democrat from the House, which would temporarily diminish Democrats’ already narrow majority in the chamber until a special election could be held in Haaland’s district.
Other candidates in contention for the Interior post are Michael Connor, a former deputy Interior Secretary in the Obama administration, who is a citizen of the Taos Pueblo tribe, and Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., a longtime friend of Biden’s who has spent his career pushing for wilderness conservation.

How to Make a Spectacular Holiday Trifle

Of all the British puddings with their whimsical names — the roly-poly, the spotted dick, the whim wham and the Eton mess — none is as popular on this side of the pond as a custardy, boozy, cream-topped trifle.
Flamboyant, fruity and exceedingly merry, trifles are a show-off dessert with a self-effacing name.
For all their fanciness, they’re also highly adaptable. As long as you have layers of cake, custard, some kind of fruit or jam (or both), and a fluffy cloud of cream on top, you can vary it as much as you like.
This said, there are, still, a few very loose rules to keep in mind for the best possible result.
The first is about the cake. The anchor of the trifle, the cake layer adds substance to all the ethereal creaminess covering it. But you don’t need to make it from scratch. Store-bought ladyfingers (also called boudoir biscuits) and sponge cake are time-honored choices. Poundcake and panettone work, too.
Second, you’ll want to consider the soak. Then, make sure the cake is well-doused. Add the sherry or whatever liquid you’re using slowly, giving it a chance to soak in, then add more if you see any dry spots.
Although sweet sherry is the usual choice, Diana Henry, the London-based food writer and author of many cookbooks, including “From the Oven to the Table” (Mitchell Beazley, 2019), also recommends Madeira, Marsala, port and even whiskey, bourbon and gin.
“Trifle without booze is just sweet,” she wrote in an email.
That said, using a zingy fruit juice paired with its fruit — say, orange juice layered with sugared segments of blood and navel oranges, or apple cider spiked with apple cider vinegar alongside poached or sautéed apples — would work gorgeously in a more temperate dessert.
While the cake doesn’t have to be made from scratch, the custard should be. It should also be thick enough to mound on your spoon so it holds up amid the cream, fruit and cake. Flavor it with plenty of vanilla, citrus zest or spices, or use lemon curd or chocolate pudding instead.
Finally, festoon the top with almonds or amaretti for crunch, or glacéed or fresh fruit for color, or nothing at all for a more minimalist take. And save the leftovers for the days ahead. (It keeps for a few days covered in the fridge.)
As Henry contends, if you love all the ingredients you add to the bowl, you really can’t go wrong.
“With trifles,” she wrote, “you should be able to bend and break the rules.”
—
Recipe: Classic Trifle With Berries or Citrus
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
Total time: 1 hour, plus chilling
For the custard:
1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons/20 grams cornstarch
Pinch of fine sea salt
4 egg yolks
1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream
3/4 cup/180 milliliters whole milk
Optional flavorings: 1 teaspoon orange or lemon zest, 1 cinnamon stick or 6 cardamom pods
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
For the fruit:
1 1/2 cups berries or 3 oranges (a mix of blood oranges and navel is pretty)
1 to 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
For assembly:
About 6 to 8 ladyfingers (also called Savoiardi or boudoir biscuits, or use sponge cake or poundcake), plus more if desired
Berry jam or orange marmalade
1/4 cup sherry, Madeira, dessert wine, brandy or orange juice, plus more as needed
1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream
1 tablespoon powdered sugar
Sliced almonds, candied citrus peel, crumbled amaretti or berries, for garnish (optional)
1. Make the custard: In a large bowl, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add egg yolks and whisk until smooth.
2. In a medium saucepan, heat cream, milk and any of the optional flavorings over medium heat until simmering.
3. Slowly whisk 1/2 cup hot cream mixture into yolk mixture until well mixed. Whisking egg mixture constantly, slowly pour in remaining cream. Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan and place it over medium-low heat.
4. Cook custard, stirring continuously especially around the bottom and edges of the pot, until the custard has thickened enough to mound on the spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Don’t let it come to a boil, but a few simmering bubbles is fine. If it starts to curdle at any point, remove pot from the heat and whisk it intensely. It should smooth out.
5. Once the custard is thick, scrape it into bowl, whisk in vanilla and press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto its surface. Let the custard cool for at least 30 minutes. At this point, custard can be chilled for up to 3 days or used to assemble the trifle. Pluck out cinnamon stick or cardamom pods, if using, just before assembling trifle.
6. Prepare the fruit: If using berries, put them in a bowl, sprinkle with sugar to taste, and use a fork to mash them. If using oranges, supreme them: Cut the tops and bottoms off each one, squeezing the juice from the severed pieces into a bowl. Using a paring knife, cut the peel and all the white pith off the fruit. Working over the bowl to catch the juices, slice the segments away from the membrane, letting fruit fall into the bowl. It’s OK if the segments fall apart; you’re going to break them up anyway. When all the segments are cut out of the membranes, squeeze the membranes over the bowl to release as much of the juice as possible. Sprinkle oranges with sugar, to taste, and, using your hands, break the segments up into pieces. You want a pulpy, juicy mix in the bowl. There should be a lot of liquid. Let oranges or the berries macerate for 20 minutes.
7. To assemble the trifle, spread the ladyfingers on one side with a thick layer of jam or marmalade. Put the ladyfingers, jam-side down, in the bottom of a medium (6- to 8-cup) trifle dish or any other serving bowl or dish (or use individual dishes, cups or glasses). You want to cover the bottom completely and, if you are using a bowl, go a little bit up the sides; break up the ladyfingers if needed to make them fit.
8. Sprinkle sherry (or whatever liquid you are using) over the ladyfingers, making sure they are well-moistened. Be generous: You don’t want any dry bits.
9. Spoon fruit and all their juices over ladyfingers. Top with custard. If you like a higher cake-to-custard ratio, you can break up a few more ladyfingers and scatter them on top of the custard, then drizzle with more sherry. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours.
10. When ready to serve, using an electric mixer or a whisk, beat the cream and powdered sugar until fluffy; it should hold a light peak. Spoon whipped cream on top of trifle and garnish as you like. Serve immediately. (Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 days.)

He’s Too Quiet for His Mate to Hear Him. So He Makes a Megaphone.

For better or for worse, female tree crickets tend to prioritize two traits in their mates: loudness and size. The louder the boy cricket, the more likely a lady is to be wooed by his serenade. The larger he is when she finds him, the more time she will stay locked in a sexual tryst — in some cases, up to an hour of rollicking, sperm-shuttling fun.
That might sound like bad news for suitors that are smaller or soft-spoken. But a few of these males can deploy a clever ruse to make themselves heard above the din, new research shows. To stay competitive, the study finds, crickets with quieter voices or tiny bodies will fashion mini-megaphones out of leaves to amplify their calls, coaxing females into mating with them longer and more frequently than they otherwise would.
Rittik Deb, a biologist at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India, can still vividly recall the first time he observed the behavior, called “baffling,” in 2008. Then a graduate student, he watched in awe as a male cricket, no bigger than a kernel of corn, scurried up a large leaf of a pignut plant and munched a hole into its fleshy center. The little lothario then shoved his head and forelegs through the opening, as if at a carnival’s photo stand-in, and began to trill a surprisingly loud tune.
“We humans boast about loudspeakers, but they have evolved to make such a simple structure,” said Deb, a co-author of a paper on baffling that was published Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. “I don’t have exact words for the joy that I felt.”
Tree cricket baffling was initially described by scientists in the 1970s. Since then, a smattering of reports have looked at the ways in which males will chew leaves into botanical speaker systems. But little was known about how or why the behavior came to be, Deb said.
To pinpoint baffling’s evolutionary origins, Deb and his colleagues at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, where he earned his doctorate, eavesdropped on tree crickets of the species Oecanthus henryi. Baffling males, the researchers found, tended to be more petite than their unmic’d counterparts.
When warbling without a leaf, smaller males chirped at about 60 decibels — akin to noisy restaurant chatter. But once outfitted with foliage, the crickets were able to amp up their serenades substantially, “at least double or triple the volume,” Deb said. The bigger the leaf, the more the crickets were able to broadcast their bravado, on occasion achieving sound pressures around 70 decibels, about the roar of a vacuum cleaner.
In the lab, the researchers found that females naturally gravitated toward louder cricket calls. The crickets even eagerly approached quiet chirps when they were played from speakers at a higher volume — the scientists’ synthetic take on baffling.
Baffling also seemed to increase smaller males’ chances of engaging in longer bouts of sex, giving their sperm more of an opportunity to mosey over to their mates. Although small males don’t usually mate for more than a few minutes at a time, the length of that sexual spell can more than double when they amplify their calls with leaves, the researchers found.
That might sound like the cricket version of catfishing. Then again, baffling, a form of tool use, could level the playing field for the underdogs of the tree cricket world, said Natasha Mhatre, a tree cricket expert at the University of Western Ontario in Canada who worked with the researchers on a previous study about baffling.
With leaves on their side, males that were disadvantaged by their song or size could become “just as sexy” as their brethren, said Tamra Mendelson, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who was not involved in the study.
Still, baffling has its limits, and many loud or large males don’t bother with the behavior. That might be because these crickets already have more than enough females to mate with, the researchers found through a mathematical model.
Tree crickets are hot to trot for only a couple of hours each evening. Large males, who can copulate for 45 minutes at a stretch — thus increasing their chances of siring more offspring — might max out their mating by monopolizing only two females a night. Smaller and quieter contenders, on the other hand, have more time to make a sound-augmenting leaf and book extra engagements.
In a pinch, the insects can make use of other instruments as well. Deb recalled one industrious suitor in the lab who, with no pignut available, gnawed his way through a sheet of tissue paper and stuffed his noggin through the gap.
It’s true that being big has its perks. But “there are many ways of being attractive,” Mendelson said.

This year, physical distance and safety became part of a suddenly urgent conversation for everyone. But for educators focused on intimacy and consent, questions about bodies and boundaries are a constant focus. Here’s how a number of experts are teaching people how to treat themselves and others well — and where they can teach you.
Who Should Think About Pleasure? You
Robyn Dalzen has facilitated consent workshops around the world for the past four years, often coaching individuals and couples through the complexities of physical intimacy. This work has now indefinitely shifted to the virtual realm.
“We all have desires, and we all have barriers that keep us from speaking up and asking for what we want,” Dalzen said. “At a very fundamental level, just the process of naming our desire and asking for what we want is incredibly vulnerable.”
Dalzen became a consent educator after learning about the tool called the Wheel of Consent from its creator, Betty Martin. Martin invented the wheel based on two factors that are always at play when people touch each other: who is doing and whom it’s for .
The wheel introduces nuanced ideas about “giving” and “receiving,” topics that are fraught for many people — and that some may have never thought to ask about.
“To have a lot more fun, consent needs to be expanded to mean ‘What’s our agreement?’ ” Martin said. “‘What is it that we both want? What is it that we both don’t want? What are some options?’
“We arrive at consent together,” Martin continued, “instead of somebody giving consent or getting consent.”
There are silver linings to moving these workshops online; people who weren’t comfortable attending or who didn’t have the time to show up in person, can participate. These conversations can also bear new weight in a year in which perceptions of personal autonomy and privilege have changed for many people.
“When we’re in the midst of a pandemic, and major disruptions politically in this country and racial injustices coming to light — what place does pleasure have in this current reality?” Dalzen asked. “Is it something frivolous? Is it taking away from where we should be putting our focus and attention?”
Her decision remains that pleasure is necessary in the worst of times.
“The more connected we are — to ourselves, to our desires — and the more we express that in the world,” Dalzen said. “It’s not taking away from or diverting from these major social and health issues, but it’s actually focusing in on who we are as individuals and what kind of world we want to live in.”
Setting Boundaries at the Store
Nenna Joiner, who runs the Feelmore sex shops in Oakland and Berkeley, California, kept their stores open throughout the pandemic.
In the store, Joiner, who uses nongendered pronouns, tries to show customers how to mindfully ask intimate questions and assert the boundaries of their comfort zones.
“The ‘no’ is powerful in the workplace, where there’s no sex happening,” Joiner said. “It’s powerful in relationships, and it’s also empowering in general. There’s always room for it.
“We make sure we’re talking about exactly what the customer wants, regardless of what our personal beliefs are,” Joiner said. “The benefit of owning, operating and working at a sex shop is that you are really there for the needs of the community.”
Pleasure activists, and Joiner is one, say that pleasure is important politically and that healthy sexuality gives strength to people — particularly those who’ve been ignored in these conversations.
“If you read a lot of the sex books that have been written out there, most of them were definitely not written with women of color in mind,” Joiner said. “When you’re thinking about pleasure, or you’re thinking about activism, you’re thinking last about brown women.”
Keeping It Spicy (and Educational)
“Sex education is bad sex. It’s dry; it’s faceless; it’s monotonous; it’s boring; it’s systematic,” said Shan Boodram, who’s known as Shan Boody on YouTube. “So I wanted to utilize the education that I had gotten, which was interesting people, and salacious stories and storylines that you wanted to follow, and I wanted to merge those two together.”
Social media allows her to reach more people, including those who may be able to attend an in-person workshop. Her videos, starting with their titles and image covers, are spicy — and straight to the point.
Once inside, she teaches people that the way they think about sex and consent isn’t the same for everyone. “In the kink community, everything is a ‘no’ until you get a ‘yes,’ ” she said. “In the vanilla community, everything is a ‘yes’ until you get a ‘no.’
“When you start saying to somebody, ‘Oh, your lips are so sexy, do you mind if I kiss them?’ or ‘Your skin feels so good, can I run my tongue along it?’ consent becomes a part of the foreplay and a part of the dialogue,” she said. “Everybody benefits when there is sexy, enthusiastic yes-focused dialogue.”
Opening the Dialogue on Instagram
After Amalie Have was sexually assaulted in 2014, she wrote a blog post detailing her process trying to report the incident. She had a surveillance tape that showed a man approaching her tent repeatedly; two witnesses, who heard her saying “no”; and she completed a rape kit — yet her assailant was still acquitted.
Have, who lives in Copenhagen, said Danish women reached out to her to share similar experiences. She took to Instagram to continue the conversation. The platform allowed her to quickly and effectively mobilize people. But the backlash she encountered was also jarring.
“People were like, ‘Yeah, but you were traveling alone; you looked like you did; you had a few beers prior; you were sleeping in a tent; and you were wearing the dress you wore,’ ” Have said. “And especially the last thing — I was like, ‘Oh, OK, this is interesting. Let me use that as a visual conversation starter.’”
She continued to wear the dress from the night of the incident, creating a project called “The Green Dress.” Her work has also taken her offline; she campaigned for consent-based legislature at the Danish parliament and worked on Amnesty International’s “Let’s Talk About Yes” campaign.
As the pandemic unfolds, Have watches it shape her life. “You’re so aware of other people now, and whether they’re in your space or 5 inches from you,” she said. “This has highlighted that we have a problem when other people set boundaries and they’re different from our own. We feel like it’s somehow criticizing what we’re doing ourselves or limiting our way of navigating freely.”
She has also worked to keep the conversations about consent sex-positive: “Because I was like, OK, I also need to survive in this.”

ATLANTA — President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Georgia voters to cast ballots for two Democratic Senate candidates in a pair of critical runoffs early next month that he hopes will give his party control of the Senate and help Democrats advance the agenda he promised during his campaign.
“You all did something extraordinary in November,” Biden said to cheers and honks at a drive-in campaign rally intended to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. “You voted in record numbers in order to improve the lives of every Georgian. And you voted as if your life depended on it.”
“Well, guess what?” he added. “Now you’re going to have to do it again.”
Biden arrived in Georgia a day after the Electoral College affirmed his victory and in-person early voting began for the elections that will determine whether Republicans lose their majority in the Senate. Hours before the event, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, acknowledged Biden’s victory for the first time, saying “the Electoral College has spoken.”
To win control, Democrats need to defeat both of the state’s incumbent Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, in contests that have drawn intense national attention and significant campaign cash. Perdue is facing Jon Ossoff, while Loeffler is being challenged by the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
The results of those two elections on Jan. 5 will have an outsize effect on the contours of Biden’s presidency. If Republicans keep both seats, the president-elect will face steeper challenges in securing confirmation for his Cabinet and will most likely have to pare back his ambitions on climate change, immigration, infrastructure spending and other priorities.
The rally for Ossoff and Warnock was held on the grounds of Pullman Yard, a former rail car depot that became a popular site for film and movie shoots and will be redeveloped into retail and office space.
The site reflects the physical transformation Atlanta has undergone, where a surge in construction and development has stoked familiar worries about gentrification. But the transformation has also driven the political shift in Georgia that helped propel Ossoff and Warnock into the runoffs.
“It looks totally different than when I got here in ’96,” said Fantara Houston, an elementary school assistant principal who attended the rally.
The rallygoers — which spanned age and race and included Atlanta natives as well as transplants who have flooded into the city in recent years — watched from their cars, tooting their horns in place of applause. Another crowd of hundreds gathered along the sidewalks outside.
Fighting a cold and coughing several times during his remarks, Biden sought to tie Loeffler and Perdue to President Donald Trump’s failed efforts to overturn the elections by raising false allegations of voting fraud in Georgia and other swing states.
Biden mocked the two senators for supporting a lawsuit filed by the Texas attorney general that sought to overturn the results of the presidential elections in four states, including Georgia.
“Maybe your senators were just confused. Maybe they think they represent Texas,” Biden said to more honks and cheers. “Well, if you want to do the bidding of Texas, you should be running in Texas, not in Georgia.”
In the three weeks since being projected to be the president-elect, Biden has sought to minimize partisanship and keep his focus on the pandemic, which has killed more than 300,000 people in the United States and is raging out of control. In speeches, he has repeatedly called for unity of purpose and said he will be a president for all Americans, including the more than 74 million who voted for Trump in the presidential race.
But for Biden, the runoff elections will be an early test of his power to shape the future of the Democratic Party.
In an email to his supporters as he flew to Atlanta from Washington, Biden made a raw, political appeal for campaign contributions to help the Democratic Party win.
“Both of these races are within a few points, and it really could go either way,” Biden wrote in the email. “That’s why I’m holding a rally today for both of these candidates, so they can spread their message to as many Georgians as possible. And if you donate $7 you can help them and the DNC reach even more voters,” he said, referring to the Democratic National Committee.
Biden narrowly won Georgia last month, making him the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since 1992.
“Our message and his message is going to continue to reflect what he’s been saying all along,” Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s campaign manager and incoming deputy chief of staff, said of his visit. “In particular, really talking about early voting and the importance of voting, talking about the importance of Georgia in his victory.”
In his remarks, the president-elect singled out the contributions of Stacey Abrams, who lost a bid to become Georgia’s governor in 2018 but is credited by many Democrats in the state for energizing the electorate by continuing to campaign for voter rights in the past two years.
“Is there anyone in America who has done more to protect the right to vote in this election?” Biden asked the crowd. “Is there anyone who’s done more to make sure the voice of every Georgian is heard? I don’t think so. Stacey Abrams, you’re a hero.”
And he repeatedly urged Georgians not to wait until Jan. 5 to vote.
“Tell your friends, your family, just like you did in November,” he said. “Turn out the vote so that it’s not even close.”
Runoff elections typically see a substantial drop-off in voter interest, especially in comparison with a presidential campaign, but the first day of early voting suggested these high-stakes races were bucking that trend.
About 168,000 Georgia voters showed up to voting sites on Monday, exceeding by tens of thousands the number of votes cast on the first day of in-person early voting for November’s general election, suggesting voter interest stoked by Trump, Biden and their fired-up supporters.
Trump held a rally in southern Georgia this month, and on Tuesday, a spokesman for his campaign, Tim Murtaugh, sounded the same line of attack being used by Loeffler and Perdue. Ossoff and Warnock, he said, “represent the left-most fringe of the Democrat Party.”
A small group of Trump’s backers came to Biden’s event, waving large banners. Two of them walked on the street in front of the crowd, waving an American flag and wearing “Make America Great Again” hats.
One of Biden’s supporters, Nicole Gordon, brought her own small speaker and sang along as she played the Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” — a not-so-subtle jab. Later, she held her speaker over her head, singing along to Aretha Franklin’s “Respect.”

An Impressive Centerpiece With Just Five Ingredients

Savory-sweet fish, topped with tangles of herbs and bright lemon juice, looks and tastes like a celebration for your pandemic pod. There’s an unexpected inverse relationship between how easy it is to make this dish and how special it feels when it’s served. A four-ingredient, five-minute glaze coats a single slab of salmon, and the whole thing comes together in under 30 minutes.
While it helps to start with the highest-quality salmon, any fresh option will be delicious using this slow-baked technique. It yields tender fish that flakes apart in silky slips and prevents the squeaky dry bites and excess white protein globs of salmon that’s been cooked too hard or too long or both.
In “The River Cottage Fish Book,” Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Nick Fisher explain: “It’s not that cooking fish is difficult. It’s just that overcooking fish is easy.” Baking salmon at a low temperature helps prevent that and yields a balance of opaque and translucent flesh that is sometimes referred to as “medium-rare.” Even though that description is somewhat accurate, it’s confusing to use the same language you’d use for steak with fish. Fish cooks much faster and its ideal internal temperature is 120-130 degrees, which would be very rare in steak.
But you don’t need a meat thermometer to know when salmon is done. You just need to stop cooking it when it feels nearly hot. To test for the right temperature, slide a metal cake tester or thin paring knife into the fillet’s thickest part, hold it there for a few seconds, then press the tip against your upper lip, which is sensitive to heat. It should feel very warm. The salmon will continue cooking on its way to the table and end up hot in the center as it rests while everyone gathers to eat.
The method alone delivers perfect salmon, and the glaze guarantees an impressive main dish. Maple syrup tastes festive with its natural sweetness, and a dollop of mayonnaise ensures richness. Since the salmon doesn’t brown or crisp in low heat, it gets pops of crunch from whole mustard seeds and finely sliced cilantro stems instead. The stems — and roots — carry an intense aroma, echoed by the delicate leafy tops that garnish.
Served straight from the baking dish, this simple centerpiece is as quick to clean up as it is to prepare. It’s the sort of low-effort cooking that leaves you with time for holiday projects — or a well-deserved rest at the end of an exhausting year.
+
And to Drink …
Salmon can be enjoyed with many different wines, both white and red, depending on how it’s served. This dish combines the sweetness of maple syrup with the pungency of Dijon mustard, along with the natural richness of the fish. It would go well with its classic red and white partners, pinot noir and chardonnay, although I would look for a slightly fruitier pinot noir, say, an Oregon bottle, rather than a subtler Burgundy. You could drink an Oregon chardonnay with this, too, and while we’re at it, how about an Oregon pinot gris? Another good red option would be a cru Beaujolais, maybe a Côtes de Brouilly, Juliénas or Fleurie, though, if you demand consistency, it could be an Oregon gamay instead.
— ERIC ASIMOV
+ Recipe: Maple Baked Salmon
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 25 minutes
1 (1 1/2-pound) skin-on or skinless salmon fillet
12 fresh cilantro sprigs
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons whole-grain Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Lemon wedges, for serving
1. Remove salmon from the refrigerator. Heat oven to 325 degrees.
2. Bundle the cilantro sprigs by their stems and hold them tightly, then slice the stems crosswise until you get to the leaves. Reserve leaves for garnish. Transfer sliced stems to a small bowl and stir in the maple syrup, mustard and mayonnaise until well mixed.
3. Season the salmon all over with salt and pepper and place in a baking dish, skin-side down if there is skin. Slather the maple sauce all over the top.
4. Bake until a paring knife slides into the center with only a little resistance, 15 to 20 minutes. When you remove the knife and touch the blade to your upper lip, it should feel very warm but not hot. The salmon will continue to heat through out of the oven while in the baking dish. Top with the reserved cilantro leaves, and squeeze lemon wedges all over just before serving.
Tips:
For 8 servings, buy a whole side of salmon, which usually weighs 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 pounds, and double the glaze ingredients. Bake on a parchment-lined sheet pan until medium-rare, 18 to 22 minutes.

WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders scrambled Tuesday to reach agreement on a stimulus bill and a catchall omnibus financing package to keep government funding flowing, meeting to try to hammer out critical spending deals before a Friday deadline.
The meeting of the top two Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate were the first in-person spending talks in months for the leaders, with a final deal still elusive on both the dozen must-pass spending bills and hundreds of billions of dollars in economic aid for individuals and businesses struggling amid the pandemic, and to fund the distribution of a vaccine.
It took place in the Capitol office suite of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who hosted Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and the Republican leaders Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California.
The group met for a little under an hour to discuss how to resolve their differences before government funding is scheduled to lapse at week’s end, agreeing to reconvene later in the evening for a second session, according to a person familiar with the plans.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin joined the session by phone, after speaking separately with Pelosi for more than an hour.
Leaving the meeting, McCarthy signaled some degree of optimism, saying, “We’re continuing to work,” and, “I think there’s progress.”
The four leaders have agreed that any additional pandemic aid should be wrapped into the year-end spending measure, and that Congress should not adjourn without approving some pandemic relief as COVID-19 cases continue to rise across the country and the government works to distribute the vaccine to essential workers and others.
Even if Congress were to pass a bill this week, it may not be in time to prevent millions of Americans from going weeks with no source of income, given that many state unemployment offices have already programmed their systems to cut off benefits after next week, when the current pandemic programs expire.
Reinstating the benefits in those states will take time, especially because the plan being considered by Congress would make several technical changes to the programs, which the Labor Department must then incorporate into formal regulations, said Elizabeth Pancotti, a policy adviser for Employ America, an advocacy group. The Christmas and New Year’s holidays, when state offices are shut, will add further delays, she warned, though workers would eventually receive back pay for the weeks where their benefits lapsed.
There are still hurdles to a final agreement, particularly without a bipartisan consensus on the two thorniest policy impediments: a Democratic demand for additional aid to support state and local governments and a Republican push for sweeping liability protections for businesses, hospitals, schools and other institutions open during the pandemic.
It was unclear whether leaders of either party would embrace a $748 billion version proposed on Monday by a group of moderates in both parties, which separated out $160 billion for state and local governments and coronavirus liability protections for businesses and other entities, leaving them for another bill.
Before the meeting Tuesday, McConnell pointed to the bifurcated plan as he continued to push for lawmakers to jettison the two items and approve a narrow package with money for vaccine distribution, unemployment funds and help for schools and small businesses. After months of insisting that a sweeping liability shield was a “red line” for another package, McConnell said again that he was willing to drop the demand if Democrats would agree to abandon their top priority, as well.
“We all know the new administration is going to be asking for yet another package,” McConnell said at a weekly news conference. “It’s not like we won’t have another opportunity to debate the merits of liability reform and of state and local government in the very near future.”
Even if the four leaders were to reach an agreement, it would most likely face hurdles among some rank-and-file lawmakers, as Republicans chafe at the prospect of spending billions of dollars in taxpayer funds and Democrats argue that an agreement amounting to less than $1 trillion would be insufficient.
Some lawmakers are also mounting a pressure campaign to include direct payments for all working Americans in the stimulus deal. Two senators, Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have threatened to hold up the broader government funding bill if Congress failed to ensure that Americans receive payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child in the stimulus measure.
In a letter sent to the leaders, liberal Democratic lawmakers, led by Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Ro Khanna and Katie Porter, both of California, argued that such payments “are a crucial part of any COVID relief package.” They pressed for at least $2,000 in direct payments and at least six months of unemployment benefits, including enhanced supplemental benefits that expired earlier this year.
“There is absolutely no reason why we can’t put the direct payments in, and dare the Senate to take them out,” Jayapal said.
The White House has voiced support for another round of direct payments, and Mnuchin’s included a $600 stimulus check in his latest offer to Pelosi. But Democrats panned that $916 billion proposal because it failed to revive supplemental unemployment benefits that lapsed over the summer.
“I’m not going to say if that’s a red line or not,” Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said when pressed on whether President Donald Trump would approve a stimulus package without direct payments. “We’re hopeful there is a deal there that the president can then look at and support.”

Texto completo: There's an emerging media narrative that Joe Biden is more difficult for the press to cover than Donald Trump because Mr. Biden allegedly has superior character and therefore generates fewer scandals. Accepting this spin naturally requires one to ignore the Biden family influence-peddling business. But the fear among media executives about their own businesses is real. Bashing Donald Trump has been profitable. Can you hold an audience by lauding Joe Biden?
"CNN and MSNBC Fret Over Post-Trump Future" is the headline on a New York Times story. But the paper could have just as easily been writing about itself. Timesmen John Koblin and Michael M. Grynbaum write:
CNN and MSNBC thrived during the Trump years, reaching new heights in ratings and revenue while devoting countless prime-time hours to criticizing a White House antagonist their viewers just could not quit.
Now faced with a Trump-less future, top executives at the rival cable news networks have summoned star anchors and producers to private meetings in recent weeks, seeking answers to a pressing question: What's next?
People at both networks know that viewers who abhorred President Trump may no longer need their nightly therapy sessions with Rachel Maddow or Don Lemon. And President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. seems unlikely to generate the 24/7 grist of drama and scandal that resurrected cable news, taking it from a dying medium to a focal point of modern politics...
"What happens," asked one MSNBC on-air personality, "when you don't need us?"
Whether the medium is cable television, the internet or print, who needs a news organization that won't challenge the people in power? Beyond the Biden family, the Times and other anti-Trump media outlets have been given another opportunity to start exercising their nonpartisan journalistic muscles again. But they don't seem to be taking it.
"The New York Times has yet to cover the growing controversy surrounding Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., and his relationship with an alleged Chinese spy," notes Joseph Wulfsohn of Fox News.
It's been a week since Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian and the Aspen Institute's Zach Dorfman reported in Axios on the alleged spy, a Chinese national known as Fang Fang or Christine Fang, According to the Axios report:
Among the most significant targets of Fang's efforts was Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.).
Fang took part in fundraising activity for Swalwell's 2014 re-election campaign, according to a Bay Area political operative and a current U.S. intelligence official. Swalwell's office was directly aware of these activities on its behalf, the political operative said. That same political operative, who witnessed Fang fundraising on Swalwell's behalf, found no evidence of illegal contributions...
Fang helped place at least one intern in Swalwell's office, according to those same two people, and interacted with Swalwell at multiple events over the course of several years.
Former FBI assistant director of intelligence Kevin Brock opines in The Hill:
Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) represents the state's 15th Congressional District, which sits like a splattered trapezoid between Berkeley and Silicon Valley. The Blue Man Group is less blue than Rep. Swalwell's district...
Swalwell's prior experience in the world of foreign intelligence operations was limited to his role as a small-town councilman. Why then, you might logically wonder, was he assigned to the prestigious and sensitive intelligence committee? It wasn't for his keen understanding of Russian tradecraft, that much we know. Think more along the lines of the business and philosophical interests of the China-groveling high-tech companies and socialist academic communities whose districts he straddles.
Remaining incurious about stories like this one could certainly make it hard to engage readers looking for news.

This Day in Political History
Four years may seem like a long time ago, and perhaps it was given the changes since then in American politics. By mid-December of 2016 Hillary Clinton and her supporters had accepted the results of the November presidential election and were treating America's president-elect with graciousness and respect.
Just kidding. On this day in 2016, the FBI secretly recorded a conversation between a bureau source and Trump associate Carter Page. Two months earlier, the FBI had used a bogus Clinton-funded dossier of Russian collusion claims and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court into approving the first of several warrant applications focusing on Mr. Page.
Mrs. Clinton would continue for years promoting fact-free Russia conspiracy theories about her political rivals. And back on Dec. 15, 2016, many of her supporters were still seeking to prevent the winner of the November election from taking office. Calvin Woodward and Rachel La Corte of the Associated Press reported on an effort among Democrats to derail Donald Trump's victory at the Electoral College. According to the AP report:
Republican electors are being swamped with pleas to buck tradition and cast ballots for someone else at meetings across the country Monday that are on course to ratify Trump as the winner. AP interviews with more than 330 electors from both parties found little appetite for a revolt...
The interviews found widespread Democratic aggravation with the electoral process but little expectation that the rush of anti-Trump maneuvering can stop him. For that to happen, Republican-appointed electors would have to stage an unprecedented defection.
This column's most celebrated alumnus observed :
Call it the "Animal House" ploy, after this exchange from the classic 1978 comedy: "I think that this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody's part!" "We're just the guys to do it."
But the idiots have a lot of loud megaphones. Mediaite notes that "there's a new celebrity PSA out" in which "Martin Sheen, Richard Schiff, Debra Messing, James Cromwell, BD Wong, Bob Odenkirk, Moby, and some other big names" urge electors "to do the right thing and step in to vote their conscience"—that is, the conscience of Sheen, Schiff, Messing, et al., who can't stand Trump...
The idiots are also getting plenty of respectful attention from the so-called mainstream media. Politico reports that Larry Lessig, a Harvard law professor, "claimed Tuesday that 20 Republican members of the Electoral College are considering voting against Donald Trump."
Only two GOP electors ended up voting for someone other than Mr. Trump, fewer than the five Democratic electors who voted for someone other than Mrs. Clinton. (Three other Democratic electors attempted unsuccessfully to do so and had their votes invalidated under state law; one changed his vote to Mrs. Clinton, and the others were replaced by alternate electors.)
The chance that "faithless electors" will override the decisions of voters has lately become even less likely. In July of this year, Mr. Lessig represented the losing side as the Supreme Court unanimously decided that states can require electors to honor the votes of their citizenry and penalize those who don't.
Back in 2016, it quickly became clear that there was little appetite among Republican electors to vote for a Democrat, no matter how much effort Mr. Lessig devoted to raising liberal hopes. Observed James Taranto:
So this is fake news. But the idea of an Electoral College revolt is being widely propagated by anti-Trump journalists and commentators. Some of them, like E.J. Dionne of the Washington Post, more or less acknowledge that the idea is a fantasy.
According to the AP, it was a fantasy that even some Democratic electors didn't want to indulge:
"We lost the election," said John Padilla of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a Democratic ward chairman. "That's how elections are and you shake hands with your opponent and you get on with what you have to do and support your candidate."

Delivery Workers in South Korea Say They’re Dying of ‘Overwork’

SEOUL, South Korea — At a logistics depot the size of an airplane hangar in southern Seoul, couriers recently held a ritual at the start of another grueling work day: They stood for a moment of silence to remember more than a dozen fellow couriers who they say died this year from overwork.
“We won’t be surprised here if one of us drops dead, too,” said Choi Ji-na, one of the couriers.
Choi, 43, and other delivery workers in South Korea say that they feel lucky to have jobs amid growing unemployment, and that they are proud to play an essential role in keeping the country’s COVID-19 cases down by delivering record numbers of packages to customers who prefer to stay safe at home.
But they are also paying a price.
The string of deaths among couriers this year has caused a national uproar, drawing attention to worker protections that are unevenly distributed in a place that once had one of the longest workweeks in the world. Packages are expected to arrive with “bullet speed,” but the uninsured workers delivering them say that it is becoming impossible to keep up with the demand, and that labor rule changes made by President Moon Jae-in have left them out in the cold.
There have been 15 deaths among couriers so far, including some who died after complaining of unbearable workloads that kept them on the clock from dawn until past midnight. The delivery workers say they’re dying of “gwarosa,” or death by overwork.
“The workload has become just too much,” Choi said. “Since the coronavirus came, going home early enough to have dinner with my children has become a distant dream.”
Couriers are some of the hardest-working, least protected workers in South Korea. Between 2015 and 2019, only one to four couriers died per year. This year, nine couriers died in the first half of the year alone, according to data that the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency submitted to the lawmaker Yong Hye-in.
When Moon slashed the maximum workweek to 52 hours from 68 in 2018 to ensure a “work-life balance” and a “right to rest,” couriers were left out of the deal. As the pandemic rages on and packages pile up, couriers say they are not only facing longer hours but also an ever-present fear that they will succumb to the mounting volume of work.
Online orders have surged around the world, and demand for delivered goods in South Korea has grown by 30%, to 3.6 billion parcels this year, according to some estimates.
Most deliveries in South Korea are handled by large logistics companies. Those firms outsource the labor to couriers, who are independent subcontractors working on commission using their own trucks in assigned areas. Since 1997, as e-commerce as boomed and competition has intensified, online shipping costs in the country have dropped by more than half.
Shopping malls and logistics firms now promise even faster deliveries, offering “within-the-day,” “before-dawn” and “bullet-speed” options. But the fees collected by couriers have dropped. Workers now receive between 60 and 80 cents per parcel and have been slapped with penalties when they fail to meet delivery deadlines set by major online shopping retailers.
One courier in Seoul, Kim Dong-hee, returned home at 2 a.m. on Oct. 7. Later that day, he returned to the warehouse to pick up 420 packages. He still had many deliveries to make when he texted a colleague at 4:28 a.m. the next day. He said he would be home by 5 a.m. but would barely have time to eat and wash up before heading out again.
“I am just too tired,” he wrote.
Four days later, he didn’t show up for work. When colleagues checked his home, they found him dead; police ruled that heart failure was the cause. Colleagues say he was killed by overwork. He was 36.
The day that Kim sent his message, another man in Seoul, Kim Won-jong, collapsed on his delivery route, complaining of chest pain and difficulty breathing before he died.
“I remember how tired he looked late in the evening, his shoulders slumped and his cap pulled low, as if he were semiconscious,” a customer who knew Kim wrote online after his death made news.
It has become common to see weary couriers weaving through apartment compounds in the dead of night, delivering fruit, bottled water, Christmas decorations and other items that many shoppers now prefer to have delivered. Some residents who fear infection have refused to share elevators with delivery workers, forcing them to haul packages up stairs.
The pandemic has brought profits to couriers and logistics companies like CJ Logistics, Hanjin Shipping and Lotte. But categorized as self-employed, most of the country’s estimated 54,000 “taekbae gisa,” or home-delivery drivers, do not benefit from the labor laws that protect full-time corporate employees. Benefits such as overtime, paid vacation and insurance against on-the-job injuries are largely unavailable.
According to a September survey by the Center for Workers’ Health and Safety, a rights group, couriers work an average of 12 hours a day, six days a week. According to government data submitted to lawmakers, work-related injuries for couriers soared by 43% in the first half of the year.
Couriers in the United States, Europe and China have gone on strike seeking better protections. In South Korea, they have staged strikes hoping to secure shorter hours and a “life with evenings.”
“We organized and fought back because we had no one to talk to,” said Park Ki-ryeon, 36, a courier since 2016.
“We, too would like to keep warm indoors, like the people we serve,” Park said. “But many of us are not well educated and started this work with debts to pay. If we quit, we don’t have an alternative.”
Choi became a delivery worker seven years ago after a divorce made her a single mother of two young children. She has hauled packages weighing up to 55 pounds apiece up and down stairs. She sometimes has to climb walls to make deliveries, because homeowners are out, with their gates locked, but want the parcels left inside. Couriers have been known to injure their ankles — or become the subject of police calls made by neighbors who mistake them for burglars.
She said she liked the work because she could get home in time for her children to return from school, but the virus changed everything. Choi now delivers up to 370 parcels a day, 30% more than before the pandemic. She starts work at 6:30 a.m. and rarely gets home before 10 p.m.
At the depot, container trucks rumbled in under the pre-dawn sky, bringing cargo from across South Korea. As what seemed like an endless stream of parcels of all shapes and sizes were unloaded, Choi and her colleagues gathered around a conveyor belt to search for packages with addresses in their districts.
The deliveries would stretch well into the night.
Some logistics companies have apologized for the recent spate of deaths and promised to provide benefits, like medical checkups, and add more workers in phases to help shorten work hours and manage the increased volume.
Moon’s government has vowed to introduce a five-day workweek and ban nighttime deliveries, admitting that his policies have not kept up with the growth of the delivery industry and that “the burden was concentrated in long hours and heavy workloads for couriers.”
After the deaths generated headlines, people also began expressing sympathy for the couriers, leaving drinks and snacks at the door with notes saying, “It’s OK to be late.”
“When strangers pass me on the streets, they say to me, ‘Please don’t die! We need you,’” Park said.
But the reforms promised by logistics companies and the government have been too slow to arrive.
When his grandmother died last month, Park said, he had to hire a replacement courier with his own money to deliver the parcels along his route just so he could take a half day off to mourn her.
“We want change,” he said. “We are not working machines.”

When Allison Protsko was a child, the arrival of the Christmas season meant driving with her family to pick out a Christmas tree, cutting it down themselves and dragging it home.
This year, about a decade since Protsko, 34, last brought a real Christmas tree into her home, she decided to go with her children and her boyfriend, Joseph Storminger, to Bell’s Christmas Trees in Accord, New York, reviving a cherished family tradition.
“Just the smell from the tree brings back that Christmas feeling and the memories from childhood,” Protsko said.
The stress of 2020, including a pandemic, protests against racial injustice and a bitterly contested presidential election, left many Americans like Protsko grasping for scraps of joy wherever they could be found. The holidays offered an outlet.
As demand has surged, some pick-and-cut tree farms, like Bell’s, have sold out their supplies of Christmas trees for the first time ever. Elsewhere, retail lots have been picked clean as families have bought their first fresh Christmas trees, or their first ones in a very long time.
Bell’s Christmas Trees, about 100 miles north of New York City, has dedicated about 25 of its 150 acres to the nurturing of a dozen varieties of Christmas trees. The Bell family started planting trees in 1991 as members were planning to pivot away from the strenuous dairy business that had been the farm’s focus for decades.
The Christmas trees proved more popular than expected, so they planted more every year. This year, their supply sold out. Bell’s announced that it would close for the season Dec. 8, 15 days earlier than last year, to preserve the smaller, less mature trees that the farm was counting on selling next year and in the years to come. “We can’t grow them fast enough,” said Brian Bell, one of the owners.
Just four days before Bell’s closed for the season, Protsko and her family drove about 45 minutes to the farm from their home in Montgomery, New York. They cut down a 14-foot tree, rolled it down a hill and drove home with at least a foot of it sticking out of their truck.
“Next year, we’ll bring a tape measure,” she said.
Protsko said she wanted to make the holiday extra special for her children, Richie, 5, and Will, 3, after a difficult year in which she and her husband separated.
They planned to decorate the tree together, lining it with calming white lights and filling it with the Barbie ornaments from Protsko’s childhood and her children’s dinosaur ornaments.
“It’s not a big magazine-picture-perfect tree,” she said. “It’s made of memories over the years.”
Jacquelyn and Justin Swisher of Stone Ridge, New York, bought a 6-foot tree at Bell’s, brought it home and decorated it with family photos framed in ornaments, including their wedding photo and a sonogram of their young son, Cashton.
Jacquelyn Swisher said she wanted to start new holiday traditions with Cashton, now 17 months, who is excited for Santa Claus to visit.
She said the pandemic had contributed to a draining year in her job as a second-grade teacher. Desperate for a safe, fun family activity, they went to Bell’s right after Thanksgiving to buy a real tree, their first as a family. Getting one, she said, will be her perfect Christmas tradition.
On Dec. 6, they returned to Bell’s, this time to find a tree for a sick colleague of Swisher’s. She and her husband looked for the perfect tree as Cashton ran around.
“I knew that my son would like a little adventure,” she said, “and if she knew that he picked it out, it’d probably make her smile.”
Having a festive home, Swisher said, is a good way to prepare for a fresh start next year, when her family hopes to move past the pandemic and focus on activities that are bright and fun and positive.
“We wanted our home to be nice and special for the holiday season.” she said. “We’re hoping that what we have going here is a nice beginning for 2021.”

NEW YORK — When outdoor dining began in the summer, the owners of Maya Taqueria fully embraced it. They built a patio on the street outside their restaurant in Brooklyn, and protected it with heavy wooden barriers adorned with plants.
Now, as a major winter storm approaches New York City, the hulking, costly structure that helped the restaurant survive the pandemic faces its own challenges: high winds, heavy blankets of snow and the city’s fleet of plows.
New York City’s restaurants, already staggered by the loss of indoor dining this week, have now been ordered by the city to close their roadway dining programs at 2 p.m. Wednesday.
The closure order is temporary, and officials said it could be lifted by Thursday night. But the major snowstorm, expected to sweep into the area on Wednesday afternoon, will pose a significant test for restaurant owners and of how the city’s now-permanent outdoor dining program can withstand severe winter weather.
The city urges restaurants to remove the tops of their outdoor dining structures, but it will not require them to take those structures off the street.
For Maya Taqueria, moving the patio, which required reflective material and sandbags to guard against winter weather, would be impractical, said Daniel Nasser, one of the restaurant’s partners.
“These things now weigh 300 or 400 pounds,” Nasser said. “You can’t tell me to make this thing weigh this much and then have me dismantle and bring it in.”
As of Tuesday morning, the National Weather Service was warning of blizzard-like conditions in the region, with the potential for as much as a foot of snow in parts of New York City and wind gusts that could reach 45 mph.
Given the forecast, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has ordered state agencies to prepare for an emergency response. In New Jersey, parts of which could see up to 18 inches of snow, Gov. Philip Murphy said the storm could be “a real whopper.”
On Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio urged residents to take precautions on Wednesday and Thursday and avoid traveling by car.
“This is going to be a serious storm, and people need to take it seriously,” he said.
De Blasio said that in-person learning will proceed as planned on Wednesday. The city will close coronavirus testing sites run by its Health and Hospitals system from 2 p.m. on Wednesday to noon on Thursday.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it was preparing for the storm but warned that overnight and early morning travel could become difficult, as the subway would be closed for cleaning and bus service could be curtailed because of icy or snow-filled roads.
With many students already learning remotely during the coronavirus pandemic and a large portion of workers still toiling from their homes, the storm may be less disruptive to daily routines than it otherwise might have been. But for restaurants, the storm could be yet another blow to a struggling industry that has been in dire financial straits since pandemic restrictions were first implemented in March.
As outdoor dining has become an economic lifeline, restaurants and bars have seen their fortunes increasingly tied to weather conditions.
“Man versus nature is one of those classic literary conflicts,” Emmeline Zhao, a partner and the general manager of Silver Apricot in Greenwich Village, said. “But I feel like I’m living that out in real time.”
New York City introduced an expanded outdoor dining program in June, a bid to extend economic support to restaurants by allowing for tables on sidewalks and streets where dining had previously been limited or forbidden.
Restaurateurs quickly responded, building makeshift dining rooms outdoors. The program was popular with diners, and de Blasio made it permanent in September.
The city’s Sanitation Department, which is charged with snow removal, quickly realized the roadway dining setups could pose challenges for plowing, said the acting sanitation commissioner, Edward Grayson.
Officials were concerned that the large structures would remove the space available to plows on the city’s narrower streets, making it more difficult for them to maneuver. They also worried that diners seated at roadway tables could be pummeled by high-velocity snow hurled in the plows’ wake.
“We want to make sure we protect public safety, which is our job,” Grayson said. “But we’re also cognizant that, especially now, these small businesses, these restaurants, need to stay open as long as possible.”
The Sanitation Department opted for a two-tier advisory system for winter weather. The lower level, a winter operations advisory, urges restaurants to take steps to protect customers and staff from snow, ice or sleet but does not require them to close outdoor dining.
The higher level, a snow alert, is triggered when an inch or more of snow is in the forecast. It requires roadway dining to close, electric heaters to be taken off the street and furniture to be moved inside or otherwise secured. Sidewalk dining is still allowed.
The Sanitation Department’s guidance calls on restaurants to “remove or consolidate structures” only if the forecast calls for more than a foot of snow.
“Some of the structures that were put up are pretty elaborate,” Grayson said. “And we would imagine that if we put out a snow alert, they wouldn’t be able to take them down right away.”
The Sanitation Department also changed its training program to help drivers learn to navigate around outdoor dining structures, and redesigned its plow routes to avoid potentially tight turns on roads that have been made narrower.
Multiple restaurant owners said they were happy to comply with the guidance, noting that they were unlikely to have served outdoors in a snowstorm anyway.
“I don’t want the staff going out in the snow,” said Vicki Freeman, a partner in four New York City restaurants, including Cookshop, which has a large seating area on busy Tenth Avenue in Chelsea.
As the storm approached, Freeman planned to remove the furniture from the street at her restaurants. But she was unsure if she would be able to remove the overhead heaters in her outdoor spaces.
“That’s a huge deal, to unhook all the heaters and then have an electrician come over and re-hook them,” she said.
Even before winter, outdoor dining was costly for many restaurants. Many quickly built sidewalk or street cafes in the summer only to spend more to rebuild them when requirements changed.
The regulations shifted again last month, when the city’s Transportation Department, which oversees the outdoor dining program, first provided winter weather guidance.
In addition to reflective tape, the department is requiring orange “snow sticks” to help drivers avoid hitting roadway barriers. A number of “high-priority” restaurants on streets with high crash rates and heavy traffic will also be required to have water-filled plastic barriers.
The number of restaurants subject to the mandate was not immediately available, but a spokesman said the Transportation Department had given out hundreds of barriers, as well as more than 40,000 sandbags.
Nasser said he had not received such assistance, though he had not been depending on it.
While the city had been communicative about guidance, Nasser generally felt that officials were not adequately guiding restaurants through an incredibly difficult year.
“It’s one thing to give us these notices,” Nasser said, “but it’s another thing to hold our hand through the process.”
As the snow approached, he planned to take the steps required, he said. Though he felt his outdoor setup was sturdy and secure, he would watch nervously to see if it withstood the elements.
But if the structure broke or buckled, Nasser said, he would likely shutter his outdoor dining program.
“I’d probably just take the thing down instead of going through all that again,” he said.

NEW YORK — Aida Corporan has avoided the coronavirus by hunkering down in her apartment at the Bailey Houses, a public housing complex in the Bronx.
But she cannot get away from the health threat inside her own home: mold.
Corporan, who suffers from artery and kidney problems, said heavy rains have leaked into her bathroom from her building’s dilapidated roof and left behind mold on the walls that cannot be scrubbed away.
“It’s a shame we have to live like this,” said Corporan, 76. “It’s hard.”
The pandemic has trapped many poor New Yorkers in miserable living conditions in the city’s public housing system, the largest in the nation with 400,000 tenants, most of whom are people of color.
While better-off families have upgraded their homes with sleek new kitchens, work studios and pricey Peloton bikes to isolate in relative comfort, many public housing tenants have been forced to cope with mold, broken elevators and rundown playgrounds. Some have even been stuck at home with no heat or cooking gas.
And with winter descending and the coronavirus surging again, there are likely to be fewer chances to escape dismal apartments.
Though the New York City Housing Authority has long struggled to keep up with repairs and maintenance at public housing developments, its backlog has soared during the pandemic to 474,790 open work orders in November from 375,310 work orders in March, according to the authority’s records.
In contrast, there was a smaller increase in open work orders in the months before the pandemic: 373,910 in February compared with 336,290 in November 2019, according to data available in records published online.
In addition, during the pandemic, the average number of days to complete repairs — a measure of the level of service — has also increased between November and March to 224 days from 156 days.
“The problems are getting worse,” said Daniel Barber, 51, the chairman of a citywide council for public-housing tenant association leaders who lives in the Andrew Jackson Houses in the South Bronx.
When tenants call housing authority workers for needed repairs, he said, “they’ll take the call and a ticket gets created, but then no one is actually going to do the work. People are being told everything is being deferred by COVID.”
Housing authority officials said they scaled back nonemergency repairs and maintenance beginning in March to protect employees and tenants by reducing contact and time spent in individual units. But since then, they said they have taken steps to resume some nonemergency work — emergency repairs have continued throughout the pandemic — that will help reduce the backlog.
“Every New Yorker’s home should be a comfortable and safe place to ride out a global pandemic, public housing included,” said Laura Feyer, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio. “NYCHA is working to address these issues while taking all federal, state, and local public health guidelines into consideration for the safety of residents and staff.”
Two years ago, the city announced an ambitious plan to fix public housing, including renovating thousands of units and taking aggressive measures to address heat and mold problems.
Public housing tenants routinely complain about squalid living conditions, including frequent hot water outages, broken elevators, lead paint and rats. The problems have worsened in recent decades as the housing authority has struggled to get adequate federal funding to maintain its more than 300 developments.
Housing authority officials say that the cost of needed repairs to the city’s public housing totals $40 billion, and in July, they unveiled a blueprint that outlined strategies for improving and stabilizing the developments.
“NYCHA needs capital to address ongoing issues in its aging housing portfolio, which has suffered due to decades of federal disinvestment,” said Rochel Leah Goldblatt, a spokeswoman for the housing authority. “We are working toward innovative solutions to raise that capital while focusing on the health and safety of our residents and staff.”
The housing authority is overseen by a federal monitor as part of a 2019 agreement following a sweeping, multiyear federal investigation of the city’s public housing system, which documented false claims that apartments had been inspected for lead.
The federal monitor, Bart M. Schwartz, has expressed concern about the housing authority’s growing backlog of work orders during the pandemic and has urged the authority to restart routine repairs and chip away at the backlog.
The most common work orders that have not been addressed are requests to fix paint, walls, ceilings, mold, kitchen cabinets and lead, though housing authority officials refused to provide specifics about the various categories.
Victor Bach, a housing policy analyst for the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit social services agency, said the deteriorating day-to-day conditions at some developments have added another layer of stress for tenants already worried about the pandemic.
“The pandemic obviously makes a bad situation even worse,” he said. “Residents are dealing with that — and very, very difficult living conditions.”
At Campos Plaza II, a public housing complex in Manhattan, tenants have complained of worsening leaks, broken building door locks, rats and rotting odors from exterminations, and mold and unfinished kitchen repairs at an on-site community center that was used for child care programs.
In Queens, dozens of residents at the Astoria Houses were forced to cook on hot plates for months after the cooking gas was turned off in September to fix a leak. The problem was not fixed until December, tenants said.
“These repairs are particularly important during the COVID-19 crisis as New Yorkers remain stuck indoors,” said Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat, who called on the housing authority to expedite repairs at the Astoria Houses and Campos Plaza II, which are both in her district.
Maloney recently visited Astoria Houses with a community organization, Queens Together, which gave out crockpots to residents. Another community group, Queens Liberation Project, raised more than $8,000 in donations through a social media campaign to help prepare and deliver hot meals to tenants.
At the Bailey Houses, tenants said that rainwater pools on the roof and trickles down into their apartments. Water marks stain the walls. Paint bubbles up on damp ceilings. Mold invades bathrooms and kitchens.
After hearing the complaints, state Assemblyman Victor M. Pichardo, a Democrat whose district includes the development, visited the roof with tenants to see for himself. He then secured $3 million in state capital funding to fix the roof, presenting a ceremonial check to tenants in 2018.
But nearly two years later, the roof is still leaking.
Housing authority officials said they could not start the roof repairs at the Bailey Houses until they actually received the $3 million from the state Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, which just released the money in November.
But the dormitory authority said the housing authority could have started the roof repairs earlier and received reimbursements afterward.
“It’s just bureaucratic finger-pointing, and it’s frustrating,” Pichardo said. “If you’re asking people to stay home because of the pandemic and they’re living in terrible conditions, how is that fair to them?”
For Corporan and her neighbors, their lives are tougher because of the delay in fixing the roof. “I try to cope with everything going around me, but it’s not easy,” she said, adding that she would be spending the holidays by herself in a depressing apartment.
In Tasha Terry’s apartment, paint is peeling off the wall in her teenage daughter’s bedroom from the constant roof leaks. She sprays the wall with bleach to cover up the dank smell, but adds that there is nothing else that can be done until the roof is fixed.
“I try not to let it stress me out,” said Terry, 46, a security guard. “I still have to live here.”

A major winter storm is forecast to sweep through parts of the Mid-Atlantic states and the Northeast starting early Wednesday, sending heavy snow, freezing rain and strong winds surging through the region into Thursday.
The storm, a nor’easter, is expected to stretch from North Carolina up through Virginia before advancing north, blanketing some areas with up to 2 feet of snow, the National Weather Service said. The onward march of severe weather could also bring ice accumulations, tree damage, power outages, closures of schools and businesses, and dangerous travel conditions, the service said.
When will it start snowing?
The storm will unleash a hazardous mix of rain and then heavy snow starting Wednesday, kicking off in western North Carolina and southwest Virginia, where it will let loose sheets of freezing rain, the Weather Service predicted.
From there, the system is expected to migrate and spread, stretching as far north as Boston, southern New Hampshire and Albany, New York. It could affect areas as far west as Pittsburgh and as far south as Washington and Northern Virginia.
Late Wednesday morning, heavy snow is forecast to overtake areas near and northwest of Interstate 95 in the Mid-Atlantic region. Washington, Philadelphia and other major cities can expect to be blasted with a wintry mix of rain and snow.
By Wednesday evening, the system will churn farther northeast, dropping heavy snow on northern New Jersey and southern New York state, including New York City, the Weather Service said. By Wednesday night, the effect of the winter storm will be felt in southern New England, the service predicted.
How bad will it get?
Forecasters warned there could be power outages, downed trees and hazardous travel. The relentless freezing rain at the start of the storm could gradually compound into layers of ice more than a quarter-inch thick in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, weighing on branches and electricity infrastructure.
Western Maryland and southern central Pennsylvania are forecast to bear the brunt of snow accumulations, with as much as 2 feet of snow falling, possibly leading to dangerous travel conditions and isolated power outages, the Weather Service said. Up to 2 feet of snow could blanket eastern Pennsylvania to northwest New Jersey.
More than 6 inches of snow is forecast from eastern West Virginia to southeast Massachusetts, but in areas along Interstate 95, including from central Maryland to Long Island, the outcome is uncertain, depending on whether there is a mix of rain or snow.
A rapidly moving system, gone on Thursday
The storm is fast moving, so although its effect will be fiercely felt when it does hit, the system will not linger.
As of midday Tuesday, about 15 million people were under a winter storm warning, meaning storm conditions are imminent. They include parts of Virginia, West Virginia and western Maryland, which was expected to receive heavy snow Wednesday morning, continuing through a good part of the day.
About 40 million people are under a storm watch, including those in the New York City and Boston areas, as of midday Tuesday, and those watches will most likely be upgraded as the storm moves closer to them, said Bob Oravec, a Weather Service meteorologist in College Park, Maryland.
In New York City and into southern New England, the snow will be heaviest in the late afternoon and will come down heavily Wednesday night and into early Thursday morning.
“The snowstorm is going to have a huge impact on travel,” Oravec said. “It will be an issue, but it is not going to be an event that is too long-lasting.”

Peter Nygard, the Canadian fashion executive, has been charged with sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other crimes that involved dozens of women and teenage girls in the United States, the Bahamas and Canada, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Tuesday.
Nygard, 79, used his company’s influence, its money and its employees to recruit adult and “minor-aged female victims” over a 25-year period for the sexual gratification of him and his associates, according to a nine-count federal indictment. He was arrested in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on Monday at the request of the United States under an extradition treaty, the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan said.
The women Nygard is accused of targeting often came from disadvantaged economic backgrounds and, in some cases, had a history of abuse. Nygard sexually assaulted some of them, while others were assaulted or drugged by his associates “to ensure their compliance with Nygard’s sexual demands,” the indictment said.
Nygard’s lawyer in New York, Elkan Abramowitz, declined to comment on the charges. Jay Prober, his lawyer in Winnipeg, vehemently denied the charges against his client. He said Nygard, now being held in a Manitoba jail, expected to be vindicated.
In February, The New York Times detailed how a long, ugly feud between Nygard and his billionaire neighbor in the Bahamas had led to a lawsuit accusing Nygard of sexually assaulting minors there. Interviews with dozens of women and former employees described how alleged victims were lured to Nygard’s Bahamian home. The article documented a pattern of complaints about him stretching back 40 years and showed how he had used his money and threats to silence alleged victims.
The indictment features some of the same allegations as the lawsuit, filed in New York in February. More than 80 women, from the Bahamas to Denmark, have signed on as plaintiffs.
April Telek, 47, a Canadian actress, said she was raped and held against her will by Nygard in 1993, after she reported for a modeling job. She has given a statement to Winnipeg police and is a part of the lawsuit. She said she had not been contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
“This is the best — the best thing that could possibly have happened for me, and for so many of the women that he has caused terror for over the years,” Telek said. She added, “It feels like Christmas morning.”
For decades, Nygard portrayed himself as a playboy, describing the young women he surrounded himself with as “the source of youth,” according to a video he produced about his attempts to fight aging. Born in Finland, he grew up in Canada, launching his multinational fashion company, Nygard International, in Winnipeg more than 50 years ago.
Nygard was brought into a Canadian courtroom Tuesday afternoon in chains around his wrists and ankles.
He was ordered held pending further court proceedings. A bail hearing was scheduled for Jan. 13, but Prober, his lawyer, said he planned to seek such a hearing as early as next week. Although Canadian courts usually grant extradition to the United States, the process can take years.
Nygard divided his time between Canada, the United States and the Bahamas, where he built a sprawling, Mayan-themed compound with sculptures of animal predators and naked women that he described as the “Eighth Wonder of the World.”
The indictment charged that Nygard used the prospect of modeling and other fashion industry jobs to lure women and teenage girls. It said that he also he used money from his company to pay for so-called pamper parties in Los Angeles and the Bahamas that featured free drinks, manicures and massages.
He forced dozens of victims to engage in “commercial sex,” defined in federal law as any sex act performed in exchange for something of value, and used threats and promises to grant or withhold modeling opportunities or financial support to maintain control over them, the indictment said.
Nygard International, a privately held company that once employed 12,000 people, is known mainly for selling leggings and flowing tops to middle-age women through its own outlets and department stores in Canada and the United States.
Nygard, estimated to be worth roughly $750 million in 2014 by Canadian Business magazine, was known for blending his professional and personal lives. A 1980 news article described an area of his Winnipeg office as a “passion pit” with a mirrored ceiling and a couch that transformed into a bed at the “push of a button.”
Nygard stepped down from his company in February, after federal authorities raided his home in Los Angeles and corporate headquarters in New York, and major customers like the department store chain Dillard’s dropped his fashion lines. The Times reported that month that the raids were part of an investigation into allegations of sexual assault that had been underway for at least five months.
In March, the company filed for bankruptcy in Canada and in the United States.

I already have a copy of the Burns/Ward history, so my kids will have to look elsewhere this Christmas for their father. My wife Anita has already fielded some inquiries about a Pirates calendar, but I’m afraid that the Pirates were so awful last season that there aren’t 12 Pirates good enough to grace a calendar.
What I’d like this Christmas is a rain check for a game that hasn’t been played yet. Next summer, I want to be sitting in the stands at PNC Park in Pittsburgh with my family.
* Reading Baseball is a series of stories by Richard "Pete" Peterson, author of "Growing Up With Clemente" and co-author with his son, Stephen, of the forthcoming "The Turnpike Rivalry: The Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cleveland Browns."
In recognition of the birth of PBS 50 years ago, the writers and editors of the New York Times put together a list of the 50 greatest PBS programs.
It should come as no surprise that "Mister Rogers‘ Neighborhood," described as "empathy and honesty wrapped in a cardigan," topped the New York Times list.
Also high on the New York Times list was the Ken Burns 11-hour documentary series on the Civil War. After the success of his Civil War documentary, Ken Burns decided that his next project should be a history of baseball. In a "60 Minutes" interview, he claimed that "the first real progress in civil rights after the Civil War takes place when Jackie Roosevelt Robinson, the grandson of a slave, makes his way to first base at Ebbets Field on April 15, 1947." He added, "There’s no question that the story of baseball is just going to take off from the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the failure of Reconstruction to that moment."
While watching the Ken Burns PBS documentary is a joy for baseball fans and essential for an understanding of the intimate relationship between America’s game and American history, Ken Burns added to his accomplishment when he co-authored, with renowned historian Geoffrey Ward, "Baseball: An Illustrated History" as a companion for his documentary.
The narrative of the book, supplemented by a wealth of photographs from baseball’s past, follows the same nine inning format as the documentary, but it also includes an introduction by Hall of Fame writer Roger Angell and essays from baseball’s most distinguished historians for each chapter.
"Baseball: An Illustrated History" would make a wonderful Christmas gift for the baseball fan in your life. At a time when a tragic pandemic and a bitter political divide have disrupted our lives and challenged our confidence in the future, Ken Burns and Geoffrey Ward, through their illustrated history of baseball, remind us of our capacity to

Texto completo: When it was disclosed last spring that the coronavirus had stealthily infected 99 people after the Cambridge, Massachusetts, pharmaceutical company Biogen held a two-day conference in February, it helped add the term "superspreader" to the pandemic lexicon.
Little did anyone know how super the spread would actually become.
A new analysis of the Biogen event at a Boston hotel has concluded that the coronavirus strains set loose at the meeting have since migrated worldwide, infecting about 245,000 Americans -- and potentially as many as 300,000 -- by the end of October.
The virus strains spread to at least 29 states. They were found in Australia, Sweden and Slovakia. They wended their way from a room packed with biotechnology executives to Boston homeless shelters, where they also spread widely among occupants.
Those are just the infections. How many people were killed by the virus strains cannot be reliably estimated. Nor do the figures include infections among the 6 million Americans who have tested positive for the coronavirus since October, as infections have spiked.
"It's a cautionary tale," said Bronwyn MacInnis, a genomic epidemiologist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. "When we hear these stories of clusters where 20 or 50 or 100 were affected, that does not account for what happens after."
A spokesman for Biogen did not respond to requests for comment on the report.
The analysis, by more than 50 health care experts and researchers based primarily in the Boston area, was published last week in Science, the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It is based on genetic analyses of the coronavirus taken from 28 people who attended the Biogen annual leadership conference, at a Marriott hotel on the Boston waterfront, on Feb. 26-27.
At the time, only 30 coronavirus infections had been confirmed in the United States, according to data compiled by The New York Times. More than a month earlier, Chinese authorities had quarantined the 11 million residents of Wuhan, where COVID-19 was first detected. But the epidemics that would ravage Europe were still on the horizon; Italy had recorded its first death only days earlier.
Some other companies had canceled international meetings out of caution, but Biogen forged ahead, bringing in 175 executives, including officials from Italy, Switzerland and Germany, for its leadership meeting. Within days, some were falling ill.
The analysis of 28 cases determined that each person had been infected with a strain of the coronavirus, named C2416T, that had not previously been seen in the United States. The only known instances of the strain that preceded the Biogen conference involved two French patients, ages 87 and 88.
"We think the mutation arose in early or mid-February," Dr. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious-disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a researcher at the Broad Institute, said in an interview. "We think there was a single importation into Boston, and that single importation was tightly linked to the spread that occurred at the conference."
That finding and a second marker -- a mutation of C2416T that appears linked solely to some infections at the conference -- enabled researchers to track the Cambridge strain across the nation and even the world, and make broad estimates that excluded cases unconnected to the meeting.
By May, it was estimated that between 44,000 and 56,000 known coronavirus cases were directly tied to the Biogen conference. About 40% were in Boston, but the C2416T strain was carried across the country, to Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and perhaps elsewhere by people who had been at the meeting.
Fresh data included in the current analysis raised the estimate to about 245,000 cases -- as low as 205,000 and as high as 300,000 -- in 29 states. The researchers estimated that the Cambridge strain of the virus was responsible for 1.9% of all known coronavirus cases in the United States through October.
Massachusetts was no longer a center of the outbreaks, although the virus strain remained widespread there. Instead, the researchers estimated that about 29% of all cases related to the Boston meeting occurred in Florida. Lemieux said scientists have no explanation for why the Cambridge strain of the virus grew so robustly there.
One of the study's more arresting findings was that within a month of the Biogen conference, the virus strain introduced there had made its way to Boston-area homeless shelters. Tests at the shelters, affiliated with the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, found 14 strains of the coronavirus, four of which appeared to have become superspreaders. The researchers found that two clusters of cases that resembled superspreader events were associated with the virus from the conference.
Lemieux said that offered a lesson for those who take a casual attitude toward the coronavirus. "That's just the interconnectivity of society," he said. "Our intuition about how disconnected we can be is not reliable. We are so connected that we don't appreciate the linkages and interactions we have."
He said it was impossible to say how the coronavirus was brought into the leadership meeting.
"We don't know whether it entered with somebody who was there for the conference, or it entered before the conference and was amplified by it," Lemieux said. "All we know is that we're not able to detect any spread with cases before the conference."
But in the months since the Biogen outbreak, the company has come under fire for staging an international conference at a time when the likelihood of a pandemic was becoming clearer.
The company said previously that it decided to hold the conference using the best information it had at the time.
But the study released this month only underscored concerns about that judgment, said John Carroll, the editor of Endpoints News, which covers the biotech industry.
"The irony, of course, is that a large drug company was responsible for triggering the mother of all superspreader events that played a major role in making the virus endemic in the U.S., killing more than 3,000 Americans a day," he said. "Top Biogen execs accidentally triggered a massive health care train wreck, and watched it play out from the sidelines."

Texto completo: In this era of working from home and schooling from home and exercising from home and making sourdough from home, the question will soon present itself: What else is there to do from home?
For kids, the answer might be to publish a newspaper from home. And now there are ample apps and websites to turn their ideas into real publications.
Kids starting their own paper is like a dam with a crack. And the moment they realize they have complete agency to report what they want, write what they want, as well as add comics? That's the flood.
The upsides to a homegrown newspaper are myriad. Kids learn how to investigate and listen, differentiate between reliable and unreliable sources, research and fact-check, and, perhaps most importantly, learn that their own interests have value. Plus a kitchen-table newspaper does wonders for a child's writing and editing skills.
Children by their very inquisitiveness have the makings of a great journalists. They are innately curious, naturally unbiased and typically don't let up until their questions are answered.
Here are some instructions for any budding journalists wishing to embark on a do-it-yourself literary adventure.
Start with the name.
Most people find that the most inspiring first step is titling the publication. Maybe the newspaper is named after the kids' neighborhood, state or dog. Add a secondary word like Dealer, Daily, Weekly, Post, Bulletin, Sentinel, Gazette, Tribune, Globe, Observer, Journal or even Picayune, and you've got yourself a newspaper name.
Select a focus.
Next, they need to think about what topics they want to cover. If kids actually sit at a table and write down all of their ideas, they have technically had their first editorial meeting. Discipline and structure aren't going to be the easiest skills to embrace (they are likely to be the hardest), but they are necessary. Even in the loosest possible way.
Create sections.
Coming up with story ideas can be daunting, especially to little kids, so maybe start with the sections they want: sports, school, climate. Or perhaps politics, opinion or comics, jokes and games. Pets and snacks and presidential cartoons? Sure! Even the vaguest idea of sections will inform the work ahead.
Delegate responsibilities.
Whether working with siblings or other kids remotely, the teamwork required in establishing duties and meting out responsibilities cannot be underestimated. This phase is guaranteed to raise tempers; there may be tears. Once you have a sports editor, someone in charge of the cover art, a photo director, a makeshift city desk, perhaps even a food critic, tasks will flow easier and kids will come out stronger.
Gather the stories.
The first thing a reporter needs to know is where to get information. This is a great opportunity for kids to learn the difference between primary sources (an interview with the owner of a local music store) and secondary sources (reading a reliable article about the best music of 2020). While primary sources are always preferable, they're not always necessary.
The best reporting usually involves interviewing an expert. This might sound daunting until they realize: Everyone is an expert in something.
The expert may be a teacher or a student talking about virtual learning, the owner of a dog rescue explaining how to adopt a pit bull or a local librarian on the best scary books for fifth-graders.
The young reporter's job is to find experts who can supply information that is both factual and relevant.
It may not always be possible to obtain interviews, so an understanding of credible online sources is important. Given that it is a crowdsourced content hub, Wikipedia cannot be trusted as a credible source. A good alternative is brittanica.com, any website with a .gov or .edu address, a reliable newspaper or Google Scholar.
Start writing.
For the novice, a question-and-answer format is a great place to start since it doesn't require much writing beyond transcribing the interview.
Writing an actual article - one with an introduction, supporting facts and a conclusion - is terrific practice and often mirrors what sixth- and seventh-graders are learning in school.
Remember the puzzles and the comics.
History tells us that a newspaper is not a newspaper without a crossword. If there was ever a place to put arbitrary facts to good use, it is here. Puzzlemaker.discoveryeducation.com or CreateWordSearchPuzzle.com do the work of building the puzzle, so the kids can focus on the theme, the words and the clues.
The comics section will not be a hard sell. Websites such as storyboardthat.com and canva.com let the artist choose a scene, select a template and drop in characters.
Teach the value of intellectual property.
For a lot of kids, creating a piece of journalism will seem as simple as cutting and pasting an article from The New York Times and putting it in quotation marks with an attribution at the end. Have them put that piece in their own words and get another source. Encourage children to ask themselves where the idea came from, if they used any of the same words as one of their sources, or if they borrowed a phrase, joke or idea from someone else and forgot to give credit.
Call in the art department.
The creative director is very likely to be the same person as the sports editor and the crossword writer. Again, the rules of plagiarism apply: An amazing picture of a polar bear in the local paper is not up for grabs without permission or proper attribution.
Kids can explore a stock website, such as istockphoto.com, which has a massive inventory of images for sale.
Put it all together.
Making it look like a real newspaper is the fun part. My Newspaper app (available on an iPhone or iPad), newspaperclub.com and makemynewspaper.com are all user-friendly options with pre-existing templates. Should the newspaper become a magazine, websites like flipsnack.com and canva.com can accommodate templates, layouts and printing.
Read all about it!
For distribution, kids can walk around the neighborhood, pass it out on the corner, maybe even start their own newspaper bike route. Just be sure each copy has an email address so that readers can comment on all the hard work.

Texto completo: The Braves continue to signal a commitment to their team name, including a spotlight on Native American culture and tradition in recent weeks, as other professional sports franchises have opted to change names.
The Cleveland Indians will change their name, it was reported Sunday by the New York Times with several other media outlets confirming the Major League Baseball organization's intention. Earlier this year, the Washington Redskins dropped their name and the National Football League franchise currently exists at the Washington Football Team until a replacement name is announced. Both organizations relented to pressure from Native American groups, fans and business partners. The Washington team's name has long been considered a racial slur.
Braves officials told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in July they have no intention of changing the name of the franchise nor the use of a tomahawk as a logo. They are discussing the tom-
--ASSOCIATED PRESS ahawk chant often done at home games.
"We are so proud of our team's name, and our expectation is that we will always be the Atlanta Braves," Terry McGuirk, the Braves' chairman, told the AJC.
"I would say unequivocally the Atlanta Braves'name will stay the Atlanta Braves," he added later. "We come to that position as a result of a lot of listening to our fans, to the Native American community. We have spent the last six months trying to make sure we are grounded in everything we say going forward, so I would again answer the question: Yes, we will be the Atlanta Braves."
Just last month, the Braves posted on social media an appreciation to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp for a proclamation of the recognition of Nov. 27 as Native American Heritage Day. Braves president and CEO Derek Schiller was among those at the ceremony along with Nealie McCormick, Donald Kirkland and Vonnie McCormick from the Georgia Council on American Indian Concerns.
Days later, the Braves announced the release of a syllabary T-shirt with net proceeds benefiting the new Kituwah Academy and Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Speakers Council.
The T-shirt features a series of symbols (pronounced ah-nay-zo, uh-shki) meaning "Ball Player" and traditional basket weave designs. In a press release about the T-shirt, theBraveswrote: "Last year the Braves committed to build strategic and supportive relationships with diverse groupsandtribesintheNative Americancommunity, including a cultural working group with the Eastern Band of the Cherokees (EBCI).The Braves and the working group are collaborating on important issues related to culture, education, and outreach. This T-shirt is the latest from the collaboration."
The release also included a statement from Chief Richard Sneed, principal chief of the EBCI. "The EBCI is grateful for the relationship we have built with the Atlanta Braves organization. The release of the syllabary T-shirts demonstrates the Atlanta Braves' commitment to honoring the history, culture, and present-day lives of Native Americans across Indian Country."
WithintheNativeAmerican community, there are strong andvariedopinionsontheuse of the Braves name and associated imagery. Many Native American people, including theNationalCouncilofAmericanIndians, havecalledforthe Braves to change their name andtoendtheuseofthechop, assertingtheBravesnameand use of the chop perpetuate the "warrior savage" myth. Sometakeissuewiththechop but not necessarily the name in and of itself. Some are not offended by either.
Braves fans have expressed similar sentiments on both sides of the issue.
The Braves haven't responded to requests for commentMondayintheaftermath of the Cleveland news.
Cleveland could announce its plans for a name change as soon as this week, the New York Times
reported.According to the report, Cleveland
plans to keep the Indians name and uniforms for the 2021 season. The franchise, named the Indians since 1915, has previously phased out the use of logos and imagery of mascot Chief Wahoo.
The NFL's Kansas City Chiefs and the National Hockey League's Chicago Blackhawks have said they have no intention of changing their names.
"The brand goes along with the name," McGuirk told the AJC. "The tomahawk logo on the jersey as a big piece of our iconography is here to stay. We are proud of it. We think our constituencies hold it in an equally high level of esteem."
The team's position on the tomahawk chop at games is a different and unresolved question, the executives said.
"At this point in time, those discussions are still ongoing," Schiller said. " It's a topic that deserves a lot of debate and a lot of discussion and a lot of thoughtfulness, and that's exactly what we are doing."
The tomahawk chop came under scrutiny in 2019 when St. Louis Cardinals relief pitcher Ryan Helsley, a member of the Cherokee Nation, criticized its use during the National League Division Series. In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Helsley called the chop and chant "a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general" and said it depicts them as "caveman-type people"who "aren't intellectual."
In a July interview with the AJC, Schiller declined to compare the Braves' case to the Redskins' or Indians', saying: "I don't think we can speak to those (teams') situations."
Schiller said the Braves name, to him, "means somebody who possesses courage, is a warrior. So for me, it's held in high regard and it's esteemed by the Native American culture and it's powerful. It's very representative of strength and honor."
The Braves franchise was known by various other names in the late 1800s and early 1900s in Boston: the Red Stockings, Red Caps, Beaneaters, Doves and Rustlers. The team was renamed the Braves in 1912 and known by that moniker until 1936, when the name was changed to the Bees.The team returned to Braves in 1941, and that name followed the franchise as it moved from Boston to Milwaukee in 1953 and from Milwaukee to Atlanta in 1966.
Staff writers Tim Tucker and Sarah K.Spencer contributed to this report.

MORE DETAILS Indians namewill remain next season
The Cleveland Indians are changing their name. "It's time,"owner Paul Dolan said Monday. "The name is no longer acceptable in our world."
Details of the team's plan: |They will be called Indians until a new name is chosen and will play as the Indians at least through next season.
|Tribe, the team's popular nickname for decades, has been ruled out, Dolan said.
|The team removed the Chief Wahoo logo from its caps and jerseys in 2019, but it never stopped selling merchandise bearing the logo. Profits from future sales of Wahoo items will go to organizations or causes supporting Native Americans.

Texto completo: As editor of the magazines Analog and Omni, he was a champion of a new generation of authors, including George R.R. Martin.
Ben Bova was a hard-science guy -- and a passionate space program booster -- and his visions of the future encompassed a dizzying array of technological advances (and resulting horrors or delights), including cloning, sex in space, climate change, the nuclear arms race, Martian colonies and the search for extraterrestrials. In newspaper articles, short stories and more than 100 books, he explored these and other knotty human problems.
Mr. Bova, who died on Nov. 29 in Naples, Fla., at 88, had a background in journalism and technical science writing, and his work was based in facts. He was determinedly not a fantasy author.
"Ben Bova is the last of the great pulp writers," Gerald Jonas wrote in The New York Times in 2004, reviewing "Tales of the Grand Tour," a collection of Bova short stories about exploring the solar system. "Not for Bova the ambiguities and excesses of cyberpunk rage, nanotech noodling or quantum weirdness," he continued. "His characters resemble elements in the periodic table, clearly defined by a few well-chosen traits."
"Reading Bova," Mr. Jonas concluded, "you are always aware of solid ground beneath your feet -- even when the protagonist is an alien life form swimming in Jupiter's world-girdling, 5,000-kilometer-deep ocean."
(Mr. Bova often pondered the possibilities of sex in zero gravity. In one article, he proposed, as he put it, "an advertising slogan that an orbital honeymoon hotel could use: If you like water beds, you're going to love zero gee.")
But it was his role as editor of Analog magazine that made him beloved in the science fiction world, now a sprawling community but a bit smaller in 1971, when he took over after the death of John W. Campbell, the magazine's celebrated editor.
Analog was the latest incarnation of Astounding Science Fiction, the paperback-size pulp magazine that began in 1930 and ignited the careers of Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard (the founder of Scientology) and others from the so-called golden age of the genre, which lasted from the late 1930s to midcentury, according to Alec Nevala-Lee, author of the 2018 book "Astounding: John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard, and the Golden Age of Science Fiction."
Mr. Bova broadened Analog's male-hero-based, hard-science ethos by embracing darker and more nuanced work from authors like Joe Haldeman, Spider Robinson, Vonda N. McIntyre and George R.R. Martin.
"Without him, I cannot say for certain I would have had a career at all," Mr. Martin wrote on his blog when Mr. Bova died. Many of Mr. Martin's stories were published and edited by Mr. Bova. When Mr. Bova left Analog in 1978 to run Omni magazine, a glossy science fiction publication started by Kathy Keeton and Bob Guccione of Penthouse, Mr. Martin went with him.
The year before, Analog published an issue consisting almost entirely of work by female writers. But Mr. Bova was not always a champion of women in the gender wars, which at the time were particularly fraught in science fiction, long a male-dominated field. At a convention in 1980, as The New York Times reported in 1982, he said that women had not "raised the level of science fiction a notch."
"Women have written a lot of books about dragons and unicorns," he added, "but damned few about future worlds in which adult problems are addressed."
Some colleagues say that the remark was out of character, and note that Mr. Bova had promoted the careers of a number of young female science fiction editors.
"He was seriously interested in the future," said Robert Silverberg, a science fiction writer who contributed to Analog. "Science fiction wasn't just a literary venture for him."
Benjamin William Bova was born on Nov. 8, 1932, in Philadelphia, the oldest of three children. His father, Benjamin Pasquale Bova, worked in a tailor's shop; his mother, Giove (Caporiccio) Bova, was a homemaker.
Mr. Bova graduated a year early from South Philadelphia High School and earned a degree in journalism from Temple University, a master's in communication from the State University of New York at Albany and a Ph.D. in education from California Coast University, an online program.
Early in his career, Mr. Bova was a newspaper reporter and editor and then a technical writer and editor for Martin Aircraft, where he worked on Project Vanguard, the first American artificial satellite. He was later a marketing manager at Avco-Everett Research Laboratory in Everett, Mass., where "hot air specialists," as he described his colleagues, did research on lasers and high temperature gases for the Air Force and built heat shields for the Apollo modules.
Mr. Bova was a science adviser to film and television productions, including "Sleeper," Woody Allen's futuristic 1973 comedy. (He was uncredited.)
In 1970, Mr. Bova and his fellow science fiction author Harlan Ellison wrote a short story about a robot police office set in the not-too-distant future. "Brillo," as they titled it, was also part of a pitch they made to Paramount Pictures for a series based on their tale. When a show called "Future Cop" appeared on ABC, Mr. Ellison sued, winning a judgment of $ 337,000. He used some of the proceeds to put up a billboard across from Paramount's offices in Hollywood that read, in part, "Don't Let Them Steal From You."
For his work as an editor, Mr. Bova was awarded the Hugo Award six times by the World Science Fiction Society. He taught science fiction at Harvard University and the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan. In 2005, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation "for fueling mankind's imagination regarding the wonders of outer space." He was president emeritus of the National Space Society and the Science Fiction Writers of America.
His marriage to Rosa Cucinotta ended in divorce. He met his second wife, Barbara Berson, a literary agent, at a science fiction convention. They clicked, their son Ken Bova recalled in an interview, when she told Mr. Bova, "I grok you" -- an expansive neologism familiar to both Robert Heinlein fans and counterculture boomers. She died in 2009.
His third wife, Rashida Loya-Bova, confirmed his death, in a Naples hospital, saying the cause was complications of a stroke.
In addition to her and his son Ken, Mr. Bova is survived by two other sons, Michael Bova and Seth Warren Rose; two daughters, Gina Bova and Elizabeth Bova Osborne; his sister, Barbara Brusco; and several grandchildren.

To the Editor:
Re "Playing to Base, Most in House G.O.P. Joined Failed Election Suit" (news article, Dec. 12):
We are living through the gravest domestic threat to our nation and democracy since the Civil War. I wish that were hyperbole, but it is fact. Never before has the president of the United States, cheered on by scores of his party's elected officials in Congress and statehouses nationwide, tried (and tried, and tried) to overturn the results of a free and fair election he indisputably lost.
It is a naked power grab that would make the most shameless and corrupt tinpot tyrant blush. It is so foreign to our country's most basic principles and values that it is difficult to comprehend that it is actually happening here. But it is happening, and it is terrifying. That the attempt appears likely to fail, and has been marked by buffoonish incompetence at every step, is cold comfort. Even buffoons (and their accomplices) can learn from their mistakes.

Re "Justices Deny Bid by Texas to Subvert Vote" (front page, Dec. 12):
The Texas election lawsuit was a loyalty test, pure and simple.
President Trump and his many followers will remain a commanding presence in the Republican Party for the foreseeable future. He and they demand unadulterated loyalty; any elected Republican who doesn't support him wholeheartedly does so at the peril of his or her career. This consideration overwhelmed the logic of the case itself.
It's fortunate that the lawsuit went directly into the Supreme Court's dumpster, but it's sad that this nonsense even remotely threatened the way our country is governed.

To the Editor:
I don't believe that President Trump and his forces ever expected to win in the courts with their fictitious fraud charges and imaginary vote stealing conspiracies. Their legal assault is just one part of a deliberate plan to undermine, heckle, harass and hamper the incoming Biden administration and to keep the anger boiling among Trump supporters, thus paving the way for Mr. Trump's return to the White House in 2024.
Other parts of the strategy include a stonewalling Republican majority in the Senate, and packing federal agencies and departments with Trump supporters.

To the Editor:
I legally cast my vote via mail-in ballot for Joe Biden in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The repeated attempts by President Trump and his enablers to discard my vote and the votes of millions of other citizens is unconscionable. I request that The New York Times provide a full-page roll call of shame of all the state attorneys general and congressional Republicans who supported the Texas lawsuit to destroy democracy. Please use the largest typeface possible.

Re "In Rejecting Lawsuit, Justices Deliver a Rebuke to the G.O.P." (front page, Dec. 13):
You report, "Indeed, after the Supreme Court's ruling, the Texas Republican Party effectively called for secession by red states whose attorneys general joined in the Texas suit."
The Texas Republicans might want to look at which states pay more to the U.S. Treasury and which states receive more. After that they should take a look at what a smashing success Brexit has been. If they still want to leave ... Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

To the Editor:
I am a registered member of the Republican Party, not of the Trump Party. My voting choices today are between the Trump Party and the Democratic Party. I cannot vote for the Trump Party because its leader is not honest.
The Republicans who did not sign on to the Texas attorney general's request to overturn the results of the election in four states should bring to life again the once noble and patriotic Republican Party.

Texto completo: The veteran journalist took charge of the newsroom two years ago in an effort to bring stability to the paper under new ownership.
Norman Pearlstine, the executive editor of The Los Angeles Times, has moved into a senior adviser role while the search for his successor continues, the paper's owner said in an email to the staff on Monday.
In the email, which was obtained by The New York Times, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner and executive chairman, said that Mr. Pearlstine, 78, would report to him in the new role and would help select the journalist who will follow him as executive editor.
Two managing editors, Scott Kraft and Kimi Yoshino, will take over the day-to-day running of the newsroom. They will report to Dr. Soon-Shiong, as will the head of the editorial pages, Sewell Chan.
"We cannot thank Norm enough for his contributions to The L.A. Times," Dr. Soon-Shiong wrote in the memo to the staff. "As we became the new owners and needed to rapidly and thoughtfully revive this great American newspaper, Norm's experience as a journalist and media executive proved invaluable." He added that he would update staff when "the right candidate" was found.
Mr. Pearlstine came out of retirement in 2018 to helm The Los Angeles Times after it was bought for $ 500 million by Dr. Soon-Shiong and his wife, Michele B. Chan, from Tribune Publishing (then known as Tronc). The paper at the time was reeling after a rocky period of leadership changes and staff cuts, and the newsroom cheered the new direction.
Dr. Soon-Shiong, a Los Angeles billionaire who made his fortune as a medical-industry entrepreneur, hoped to bring stability to the newsroom with the appointment of Mr. Pearlstine, a veteran journalist and media executive who had held top jobs at Time Inc., Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Forbes.
His latest post did not come without its own challenges, as The Los Angeles Times grappled with a racial reckoning inside its newsroom.
In a Sept. 21 article, The Los Angeles Times itself reported on missteps by the paper's leaders and a lack of internal confidence in Mr. Pearlstine. The article noted "ethical lapses" and "bullying behavior" among some of the paper's editors, as well as "other failures of management."
On Oct. 5, Mr. Pearlstine announced that he was stepping down as top editor, but, at the request of Dr. Soon-Shiong, would stay on until his successor was named.
In an email to staff on Monday, Mr. Pearlstine said his goal during his tenure was "to put a team in place that could assure The Times's revival."
"Although work on finding my successor has just begun, I believe my work is done," the editor wrote in the email, which was obtained by The New York Times. "There are several people on staff who are ready to succeed me and several talented editors from elsewhere have also asked to be considered."
Mr. Pearlstine acknowledged "unforeseen challenges," but said "the memorable journalism" had made his time at the paper worthwhile.
