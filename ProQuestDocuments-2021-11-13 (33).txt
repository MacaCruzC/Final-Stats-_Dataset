Texto completo: A reader says the Giuliani associate's statements leave no doubt that the president was deeply involved in the Ukraine affair.
To the Editor:
Re "Key Figure in Effort to Pressure Ukraine Says Trump Knew 'Everything"' (news article, Jan. 16):
Lev speaks! The phrase "what did he know and when did he know it?" is often bandied about whenever a high-ranking government official is accused of wrongdoing. In the case of Donald J. Trump and Ukraine, the president knew everything, and knew it from the very beginning because he set it in motion.
In interviews with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC and with The New York Times, Lev Parnas, the indicted Soviet-born associate of Rudy Giuliani, left no doubt that Mr. Trump knew "everything," and Mike Pence and Bill Barr were involved in a criminal conspiracy that attempted to pressure the young Ukrainian president to announce investigations of Joe and Hunter Biden that could have unfairly influenced our 2020 election.
This new evidence is accompanied by documents that Mr. Parnas recently turned over to the House Intelligence Committee, which will undoubtedly be used by the Democratic House managers when Mr. Trump's impeachment trial begins in the Senate. The only question that remains unanswered is how many Republican senators will vote to uphold their oath of office and how many will continue to support the criminal in the Oval Office.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'CHEKHOV/TOLSTOY: LOVE STORIES' at Theater Row (previews start on Jan. 23; opens on Feb. 10). Will two great Russians' tales taste great together? The Mint Theater continues its relationship with the English playwright Miles Malleson, staging two of his adaptations: Chekhov's story of an artist and Tolstoy's tale of a peasant couple. Jonathan Bank and Jane Shaw direct a cast that includes Vinie Burrows.
212-239-6200, minttheater.org
'EMOJILAND' at the Duke on 42nd Street (in previews; opens on Jan. 19). The New York Musical Festival has closed its curtains, but one of the shows it sponsored lives on. Keith Harrison and Laura Schein's ensemble musical centers on a troupe of pixelated icons. Their existential threat? A software update. The cast includes Ann Harada, Josh Lamon, Lesli Margherita and Lucas Steele.
646-223-3010, emojiland.com
'GRAND HORIZONS' at the Hayes Theater (in previews; opens on Jan. 23). The playwright Bess Wohl ("Continuity," "Small Mouth Sounds") makes a commitment to Broadway. In this new play, shown this summer at the Williamstown Theater Festival, an elderly couple, freshly installed in a retirement community, contemplate divorce. Leigh Silverman directs a remarkable cast that includes Jane Alexander, James Cromwell, Ben McKenzie and Ashley Park.
2st.com
'PARIS' at Atlantic Stage 2 (in previews; opens on Jan. 21). Vermont's citizenry is more than 95 percent white. And Emmie isn't. In this new play from the writer-actress Eboni Booth, Emmie (Jules Latimer) gets a job at a big-box store where she has to navigate standing out, blending in and sometimes feeling invisible. Knud Adams directs.
866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org
'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' at the American Airlines Theater (in previews; opens on Jan. 21). Charles Fuller's 1981 play, about a murder at a Louisiana army base, makes its Broadway debut. Kenny Leon's production stars David Alan Grier, Blair Underwood and Jerry O'Connell. "What Mr. Fuller has written," Frank Rich wrote in a review of the original production, "is a relentless investigation into the complex, sometimes cryptic pathology of hate."
212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org
'STEW' at Walkerspace (previews start on Jan. 20; opens on Feb. 1). Page 73 cooks up another debut.

page73.org
'TIMON OF ATHENS' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (in previews; opens on Jan. 19).

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
'THE TRANSFIGURATION OF BENJAMIN BANNEKER' at La MaMa (previews start on Jan. 23; opens on Jan. 24). The celebrated puppet maker Theodora Skipitares returns with a new show about an 18th-century free black man who distinguished himself as an astronomer, a horologist and a creator of almanacs. Assisting the puppets -- some of them 12 feet tall -- are members of the Soul Tigers, the marching band from Benjamin Banneker Academy in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.
866-811-4111, lamama.org
'THE WOMAN IN BLACK' at the McKittrick Hotel (in previews; opens on Jan. 23). If "Sleep No More" hasn't given you nightmares yet, its new housemate might. This winter, the McKittrick Hotel's Club Car will be haunted by Robin Herford's production of Susan Hill's ghost story about a spectral woman who lures children to their deaths. Ben Porter and David Acton star.

Last Chance
'GREATER CLEMENTS' at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center Theater (closes on Jan. 19). Samuel D. Hunter's community tragedy, set in a small, industry-starved Idaho town, goes down the silver mines for the last time. Jesse Green compared it to a mine elevator: "creaky and skeletal but with intermittent access to wonderful things." He added, "If you are looking to cry, as I always am, 'Greater Clements' will give you more than one reason to do so."
212-239-6200, lct.org
'OKLAHOMA!' at Circle in the Square (closes on Jan. 19). The wind will whistle down Broadway for just a few more performances as Daniel Fish's audacious version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic comes to a close. "This isn't an act of plunder," Ben Brantley wrote, "but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity."
212-239-6200, oklahomabroadway.com
'QUEENS ROW' at the Kitchen (closes on Jan. 25). Richard Maxwell's play, set in the aftermath of a future civil war, ceases the hostilities. Ben Brantley wrote that this series of three monologues, each spoken by a woman, is a testament to the forms of faith "that allow human beings to endure amid unspeakable loss and privation."
212-255-5793, thekitchen.org
'SING STREET' at New York Theater Workshop (closes on Jan. 26). The musical adaptation of John Carney's 1980s Dublin romance, directed by Rebecca Taichman, steps away from its synthesizers -- for now. Producers have announced a Broadway transfer that will keep intact much of the original cast, who also sing and play their own instruments. Ben Brantley described the current version as a "promising but still unfulfilled adaptation."
212-460-5475, nytw.org
'SLAVE PLAY' at the John Golden Theater (closes on Jan. 19). A work that has changed the Broadway conversation around race, sex, audiences, ticket prices and even talkbacks, Jeremy O. Harris's barbed comedy ends its run. Jesse Green wrote that in its depiction of three interracial couples, Robert O'Hara's production "lets us all see ourselves in the muddle that is race in America now."
212-947-8844, slaveplaybroadway.com
'THE THIN PLACE' at Playwrights Horizons (closes on Jan. 26). Lucas Hnath's ghost story, directed by Les Waters, turns out the lights. Centered on a young woman who believes in other worlds and a medium who maybe doesn't, the play, Jesse Green wrote, "presses against the deepest human longings not only for connection but also for exposure." He added, "We want to know what's out there, yes, but we also want it to know us."

Texto completo: The mayor's remarks come after a former Philadelphia Museum of Art boss was forced to resign from his Erie Art Museum post following a New York Times report.
Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia called for the Philadelphia Museum of Art to "strengthen" its sexual harassment policies in response to allegations of misconduct against one of the museum's former managers.
In his comments, made to The Philadelphia Inquirer on Wednesday, Mr. Kenney -- who holds an ex officio position on the museum's board -- said the institution should "review and strengthen its policies regarding anti-fraternization and sexual harassment, and require training for all staff." The museum's building is owned by the City of Philadelphia.
The remarks came on the heels of revelations published in The New York Times on Friday about Joshua Helmer, a former manager in the Philadelphia museum's education department who went on to become director of the Erie Art Museum in Pennsylvania. On Monday, Mr. Helmer was forced to resign from his position at the Erie Museum.
A spokeswoman for the mayor, Deana Gamble, added that Mr. Kenney takes such issues "very seriously," The Inquirer reported.
"The mayor is right and as we have indicated, our policies are undergoing close review," Timothy Rub, the Philadelphia Museum of Art's director and chief executive, said Thursday.
In an email message to staff on Tuesday that was obtained by The Times, Mr. Rub said he planned to hold departmental meetings and to cover the matter at an upcoming all-staff meeting. Some employees are planning a group walkout from the meeting in protest of the museum's slowness to respond.
"Nothing could be more important to me than the well-being of our staff and ensuring that we create a safe, productive work environment in which everyone feels free to express concerns and in which they are heard," Mr. Rub said in the message. "I know that we have improvements to make, and I hope that you will join me in this significant work."
The Times reported that multiple women had accused Mr. Helmer of making advances toward them in the workplace while he was at the Philadelphia museum and that an intern had made a similar complaint in Erie. Mr. Helmer, who had been appointed to the Erie post in 2018, denied this misconduct but declined to discuss his relationships with female employees.
In the wake of the report, a Pennsylvania State senator, Pam Iovino, who is a member of the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, said in a statement: "Workplace harassment has no place in Pennsylvania -- it undermines the safety and dignity of employees and must be investigated and addressed. If an individual has created a hostile work environment, they should be held accountable."
Another state senator, Katie Muth, said, "Sadly, this latest story is yet another example of how institutions fail to address workplace misconduct."

Texto completo: After tense exchanges on the issue, Gov. Gavin Newsom said he had made an overture to the federal government.
OAKLAND, Calif. -- After months of acrimony between California and the Trump administration over the state's homelessness crisis, Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Thursday that he would send an envoy to meet with administration officials and discuss ways to address the issue together.
Mr. Newsom spoke of the meeting in an interview after announcing at a news conference that the state was mobilizing 100 camping trailers to shelter some of the state's more than 150,000 homeless people.
"We really have an open hand, not a clenched fist on this," Mr. Newsom said in the interview, inside one of the trailers arrayed in a parking lot near Oakland International Airport. "I hope we can professionalize our relationship."
The governor toured the state this week to discuss the homelessness crisis, saying California would respond as urgently as it would to a major earthquake.
"It's the issue of our time," Mr. Newsom said. "It has happened on our watch and we need to meet this moment."
Nearly half of all unsheltered people in the United States live in California.
A joint effort could signal a profound shift in relations between the Trump administration and California, which have been locked for years in tense battles on everything from environmental regulations to immigration. Homelessness has become a particularly sore spot, with President Trump repeatedly criticizing California cities for their management of the issue.
In September, Mr. Trump ordered that San Francisco be cited for an environmental violation because of human waste on the city's streets, a problem that administration officials linked to homelessness. "They have to clean it up," Mr. Trump said. "We can't have our cities going to hell."
The administration also said in a report that the homelessness crisis had been aggravated by increasing the "tolerability of sleeping on the streets."
Mr. Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco who is no stranger to the issue, acknowledged that the number of unsheltered people "has gone through the roof" in California.
The state has identified more than 1,300 state-owned properties that could potentially be used to shelter homeless people, a list that includes state hospitals and buildings used by the state's Department of Veterans Affairs, the governor said.
The nearly 80,000 homeless people in New York far outnumber those in, say, Los Angeles, with 56,000. But a crucial difference is that 72 percent of California's homeless people are living on the streets, compared with just 4 percent in New York.
At a large homeless encampment less than three miles from where Mr. Newsom spoke, residents said they were not impressed with the government's response.
"At least we could get a shower here," said Monica Martinez, who has been homeless for five years and has trouble walking because of a hip problem. On Thursday she huddled under a quilt in a tent where the floor was soaked from a winter storm. "For us homeless women it's very hard," she said.
Mr. Newsom has announced plans in this year's budget for $ 1.4 billion in homeless assistance and funding for mental health services, adding to the $ 1 billion approved last September, the majority of it emergency aid to cities and counties.
Some of the money is for new housing. Yet the costs of construction in California these days are so high that even large state programs are likely to have limited impact in the long term.
A single unit of affordable housing in Oakland costs about $ 600,000 to build. In San Francisco, where the median home price is $ 1.4 million, one unit can run above $ 800,000.
Homelessness has reached acute levels not only in the state's largest cities but in smaller ones like Santa Cruz and Bakersfield, as well as numerous rural towns. Nearly 200 counties and cities in California have declared a shelter crisis since 2018.
Across the Bay Area, officials have set up special parking lots where homeless people can sleep in their cars or campers. The New York Times counted more than 100 homeless encampments in Oakland alone, including the one where Ms. Martinez sleeps.
In a report published this month, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development blamed California for an overall increase in homelessness nationwide. "While homelessness in most states declined between 2018 and 2019, homelessness in California increased by 16 percent, or 21,306 people," the report said.
The surge in California offset a decrease across many other states, the report said.
Mr. Newsom said on Thursday that he had been encouraged by talks between Trump administration officials and Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, and that state officials had had two exchanges in which the administration had laid out "in prescriptive terms the support they could provide."
Since being sworn in as governor a year ago, Mr. Newsom has struggled to set his own agenda on homelessness, as he confronts crises like the bankruptcy of the state's largest utility, repeated power cuts that affect millions of residents, and wildfires that rage up and down the state.
Still, he said he understood how pressing the issue of homelessness was.
"None of us are naïve about the challenge in front of us," he said. "And none of us are stepping aside and waiting for someone else to solve it."

Nicky Nodjoumi
Through Jan. 19. Helena Anrather, 28 Elizabeth Street, Manhattan; 212-587-9674, helenaanrather.com.
In 1974, the Iranian-American artist Nicky Nodjoumi took his City College M.F.A. back to Tehran, where his politically charged painting quickly antagonized first the Shah's secret police and then Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Revolutionary Guards. In 1981, he was given a major show at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, but it was closed after a single day, and he hurried back to New York, which has been his home ever since.
For a few years in the late '90s, Mr. Nodjoumi made a daily practice of painting or drawing on a shellacked front page of The New York Times. He made portraits of his family; Picasso-like figures with latticework faces; explicit sexual scenes that are both funny and tender; and clearly political but nonspecific images, like a dense black silhouette of a man playing with a bloody-red cat's cradle.
One appeal of a serial project like this, over and above the often wonderful drawing, is how it seems to encompass the endless days and scenes of the world at large even as it reduces them to a comprehensible number. I can count 60 spreads in Mr. Nodjoumi's current show, "New York Times Sketchbooks (1996-1999)," at Helena Anrather; note that these include one Metro section cover and one interior spread painted early on, before he committed to front pages, as well as one flower for the day Princess Diana died; and feel as if I've really gotten to grips with something. Still more appealing, though, is the sense of fleet-footed possibility that the work transmits when hung en masse: If today's nefarious silhouette can turn into tomorrow's couple in flagrante or the next day's bear on stilts, anything might be around the corner for all of us.

Albert Oehlen
Through Jan. 25. Nahmad Contemporary, 980 Madison Avenue, Manhattan, 646 449 9118, nahmadcontemporary.com.
The last five months have brought two solo shows of early work by the restless German painter Albert Oehlen that were previously unseen in New York. In September, 12 paintings from the artist's 1989-90 Fn (Footnote) series went on view at Skarstedt, full of improvisatory abstract brushwork in off-key colors infiltrated by fragments of images from popular culture. These sardonic mash-ups of Pop Art, Surrealism and Neo-Expressionism exemplify the ugly gorgeousness that is something of an Oehlen signature.
Now Nahmad is showing 13 canvases from Mr. Oehlen's "Spiegelbilder" or "Mirror Paintings" series, which began in 1982, around the time of the artist's solo shows, and extended to 1990. They are dark, dour, loosely painted interiors, consistent with his early interest in representation. Some, with titles like "Abolition of a Military Dictatorship," "Oven I," and "Hell, I" or featuring depictions of bunkerlike cinder block structures conjure the Nazi period. But all the scenes whether the grand but decrepit spiral stair in "Staircase Old," or the untitled image of a slovenly library devoid of furniture -- suggest messy aftermaths. Of course Mr. Oehlen's impatient brushwork contributes to the desultory mood. Countering it are a few random mirrors affixed to the surface of each canvas. These irreverently disrupt the painted images with blank patches or glimpses of reality, depending upon where you stand, at once punching holes in the medium's spatial integrity and also implicating us in history's devastations. Ugliness has the louder voice in these works, flanked by tragedy on one side and on the other by the engaging intentional lightness of Mr. Oehlen's pictorial sensibility.

Clarity Haynes
Through Jan. 25. Denny Dimin Gallery, 39 Lispenard Street, Manhattan; 212-226-6537, dennydimingallery.com.
Since the late 1990s, Clarity Haynes has been painting portraits of people's breasts. They aren't descended from the sexy and sexist classical nudes of art history, nor do they have the fleshy weight of the paintings of more contemporary artists like Lucian Freud or Jenny Saville. Instead, in "The Breast Portrait Project," Ms. Haynes -- who works from life over a series of sessions with her sitters that can take years -- depicts the torsos of women, trans, and gender-nonconforming people in remarkable, caring detail. She relishes the tattoos, wrinkles, scars, veins and folds that our dominant society may deem unsightly.
In her current show, "Altar-ed Bodies," which was curated by Benjamin Tischer, co-founder of the recently closed Invisible-Exports gallery, several of Ms. Haynes's breast portraits share space with new paintings of her own altars, which the news release calls "self-portraits of sorts." The altar pieces lack something of the same magnetic force of their counterparts, but the combination of the series is fruitful. In "Genesis" (2009), the pioneering body artist Genesis Breyer P-Orridge wears a necklace whose charms echo the hanging pendants and small totems in "Rainbow Altar (Spring into Summer)," from 2019, while one of her tattoos mirrors the placement of a dangling pink ribbon. Such parallels charge us to treat bodies as sacred, like altars. Rather than sources of worry or shame, they should be sites of empowerment and worship.
JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Kim Tschang-Yeul
Through Jan. 25 at Tina Kim Gallery, 525 West 21st Street, Manhattan, 212-716-1100, tinakimgallery.com.
We are playing historical catch-up at the moment, driven partly by the art market's incessant quest for fresh products, but also by a widespread desire to create a more global narrative of art in the 20th century. A good candidate for this is Kim Tschang-Yeul, a Korean-born artist who, along with Park Seo Bo and Lee Ufan, helped introduce Western modernism to Korea and whose terrific paintings from the 1960s and '70s are currently on view in the exhibition "New York to Paris" at Tina Kim.
Mr. Kim studied art in South Korea and was part of the Korean Informel, a movement that originated in France and favored vigorous, expressive abstraction. Living in Paris and New York, however, Mr. Kim produced work that evolved into what you see here: a radiant, abstract brand of Pop Art, with concentric forms rendered in an unusual mix of acrylic and cellulose lacquer on burlap or canvas. Some of the paintings, like the "Composition" series from 1969 and 1970, have centers that look almost photo-realistic. This propensity was pushed even further in canvases from the mid-70s and one here, from 1980, which have naturalistic droplets of water painted against a monochromatic ground that look so real they might seep off the canvas.
My favorites are the "Compositions," though, which look like psychedelic vortexes rimmed with neon or spectral rainbows. They feel very contemporary, partly because we're in a moment of historical remix and revival that benefits lesser-known strains of art history: Mr. Kim's work looks as if it were painted today, rather than 40 years ago.

Texto completo: For the 2020 festival, Dorrance Dance will be featured in performances and pop up interventions all over the campus.
Dorrance Dance will take over Jacob's Pillow for a week in July as a part of the 2020 festival. The acclaimed tap company led by Michelle Dorrance will debut several new works all over the Pillow campus in Becket, Mass.
Pamela Tatge, the organization's executive and artistic director, said the idea came out of a conversation she had at the festival's pub with Nicholas Van Young, the associate artistic director at Dorrance Dance. He started pounding out rhythms at the bar and tables, she said, and told her "I could really play this structure, these surroundings."
This spurred Ms. Tatge to invite the company to creatively integrate the festival's sites, and the materials they're made of, into a set of performances and pop up interventions.
At the Ted Shawn Theater, a new solo by Ms. Dorrance will receive its world premiere alongside "SOUNDspace." The program will also feature premieres by "living tap legends" commissioned by the company.
At the Doris Duke Theater, Dorrance Dance will present a new work that draws on previously created site-specific pieces by Ms. Dorrance and Mr. Van Young, which will be combined with an exploration of the Pillow's black box theater space. Ms. Dorrance will also curate a week of Inside/Out outdoor performances.
The 2020 festival, announced on Wednesday, will feature several other world premieres, including John Heginbotham's "Dance Sonata," created in collaboration with the composer Ethan Iverson (July 22-26); and "Wicked Bodies," developed by Liz Lerman when she was part of the Pillow Lab artist residency program (Aug. 19-23).
Several festival favorites will be returning. Kyle Abraham's A.I.M. company will perform "An Untitled Love," a new work set to the music of D'Angelo (June 24-28). Limón Dance Company, which made its debut as a company at the festival in 1946, will celebrate its 75th anniversary (July 8-12), performing Doris Humphrey's "Air for theG String," an early piece by its first artistic director.
The full season lineup and more information can be found at jacobspillow.org.

Texto completo: At events across the city, you can commemorate King's achievements or follow his example of activism and service.
The Cathedral of St. John the Divine
Jan. 19, 11-12:30 p.m. and 2-3 p.m.; stjohndivine.org.
King delivered a sermon titled "The Death of Evil Upon the Seashore" in 1956 at this enormous Episcopalian house of worship in Morningside Heights, Manhattan. In his speech, he drew a connection between the escape of Jewish slaves from Egypt in the Book of Exodus and the fate of African-Americans fighting for equality. "There is a Red Sea in history that ultimately comes to carry the forces of goodness to victory," he said. To commemorate King's courageous optimism, the cathedral will hold a service in his memory. Later in the afternoon, in the Chapel of St. James, the composer and conductor Alice Parker will lead an hour of communal singing to honor the civil rights leader. Both events are free and open to the public.
City Parks
Jan. 20; nycgovparks.org.
If you're looking to celebrate King by emulating his commitment to service, volunteering is a way to go. The Department of Parks and Recreation is looking for ecologically minded helpers to pitch in removing invasive plant species at Forest Park in Queens (9 a.m.-12 p.m.); Inwood Hill Park in Manhattan (9 a.m.-12 p.m.); and Conference House Park on Staten Island (9:30 a.m.-12 p.m.). Volunteers will learn how to identify plants that disturb local ecosystems before getting down to work.
Harriet Tubman Memorial
Jan. 20, 10 a.m.; manhattancountryschool.org.
Young people, really young people, are increasingly the leading voices in political causes like the fight for gun control and against climate change. Eighth-graders at Manhattan Country School will gather at the Harriet Tubman Memorial in Harlem to demand "equity now," the theme of this year's march commemorating King. Students will give speeches and wield handmade signs to make sure they're heard over the city's formidable din.
The Brooklyn Academy of Music
Jan. 20, 10:30 a.m.; bam.org.
For Nikole Hannah-Jones, King's life and work of is not a thing of the past. The New York Times journalist, and keynote speaker of this year's daylong celebration at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, has made her career showing that the fight for civil rights is ongoing and the achievements of King and others must be protected and renewed. Onstage, Ms. Hannah-Jones will be joined by the musical guests Son Little and the Brooklyn Interdenominational Choir. "Picture the Dream," an exhibition of artwork by local children inspired by King, on view through Feb. 9, will also emphasize the continuing relevance of his legacy.
Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church
Jan. 20, 11 a.m.-4 p.m. 6753 Fourth Avenue, Brooklyn.
Bay Ridge for Social Justice has decided to postpone its annual "March for Visibility Against Hate" until the weather is more conducive to gathering outdoors. In its place, the activist organization and several co-sponsors are holding a day of educational events at the Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, which will focus on community safety and conflict resolution. According to the event's Facebook page, a potluck lunch will be held to connect community members, and child care will be provided.
The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture
Jan. 20, 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.; bigonion.com.
A walking tour from the group Big Onion, which begins in front of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, will guide visitors through Harlem, a neighborhood that is central to African-American history. The two hour jaunt focuses on the connection between Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, a period of cultural and economic flourishing, and the civil rights movement of the '50s and '60s. The itinerary isn't fully set, but stops could include the Abyssinian Baptist Church, where King spoke at a meeting of black and white clergy in 1957.

The Museum of the City of New York
Jan. 20, 11 a.m.- 2 p.m.; mcny.org.
This museum's ongoing exhibition, "Activist New York," provides a good reminder that the fight for social justice has a long and complex history in the city. Young visitors can absorb this lesson through a scavenger hunt that teaches them about King's role in the civil rights movement and its connections to other similar struggles. Story time and an art activity related to these subjects will kick off the day.
The Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture
Jan. 20, 3-5:30 p.m.; bsec.org.
An event for children and parents here will honor King by highlighting art and culture from Africa. Moses Ogunleye will give a drawing lesson focused on styles and imagery from the continent, and Simba Yangala and dancers from her company JungleDom will introduce African dance forms before performing alongside audience members. Music about King's life will be performed by the vocalist DuPree and the musician Barry Kornhauser.

Markets Soar, Shrugging Off Impeachment

Texto completo: The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 are all in record territory.
Stocks rose to another record on Thursday as solid corporate earnings and the easing of trade war tensions added to Wall Street's strong start in 2020.
The S&P 500, the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 indexes all ended the day in record territory. Tech and semiconductor shares, which had been sensitive to worries about the trade war and the slowdown of the global economy last year, led the gains. Google's parent, Alphabet, closed at a market capitalization of $ 1 trillion for the first time.
After a 0.8 percent climb Thursday, the S&P 500 is up some 2.7 percent in January, showing that the nearly 11-year-old bull market still has plenty of legs left.
The sunny optimism of the stock market may seem surprising in the context of widespread political turbulence in the United States and around the world. On Thursday, the Senate formally opened the impeachment trial of President Trump. And just a couple of weeks ago, outright war between the United States and Iran seemed a distinct possibility.
But from the perspective of investors, the forecast looks downright balmy.
The American economy continues to grow. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, buttressing consumer spending. Inflation remains quiescent. Plus, interest rates are low and the Federal Reserve, which cut rates three times in 2019, appears to be in no rush to raise them.
Giant tech firms such as Apple and Microsoft, which exert outsize sway on broad market indexes because of their size, also continue to climb. On Thursday, Microsoft rose about 1.8 percent, after announcing plans to become carbon negative by 2030.
In rising above $ 1 trillion, Alphabet joined an elite club of American tech companies with valuations that were once unthinkable. The only other American companies with that kind of valuation are Apple and Microsoft.
Globally, the economic picture could be brightening slightly. Chinese exports climbed more than expected in December. Recent numbers have shown a slight rebound for the eurozone's struggling industrial sector.
"Economists had expected and priced in some pretty poor economic data," said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "But it's coming in better than expected in a lot of regions."
On Thursday, the American markets outperformed their foreign counterparts. The Shanghai Composite in China was down 0.5 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. And the Nikkei in Japan eked out a 0.1 percent rise. The CAC-40 in France rose 0.1 percent, and the FTSE 100 in Britain fell 0.4 percent.
The twist of lemon to the rally cocktail this week has been the wave of fourth-quarter earnings results. On the whole, analysts expect that earnings for S&P 500 companies will be down slightly compared with the same period in 2018.
But big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley have announced surging profits. Morgan Stanley's shares rose 6.6 percent after it posted better-than-expected results on Thursday.
"We have no evidence that 2020 is going to be a difficult economic year," James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts. "Difficult politically, potentially geopolitically, but certainly the economic outlook remains very, very stable."

Newly restored, Roger Corman's riotously colorful adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Masque of the Red Death" (1964) and Michael Curtiz's shimmering pink-and-green "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933) are as gaudy as the day they opened -- if not as scary.
The two vintage horror films are showing as a de facto double bill on Friday and Monday as part of the Museum of Modern Art's annual festival of preservation, To Save and Project.
"The Masque of the Red Death" was Corman's audacious attempt to make an art film for the drive-in crowd -- a feast of roistering revelry with intimations of Buñuel, Fellini and Bergman. Eugene Archer, the most auteur-minded of the critics at The New York Times, was enthusiastic: The movie "represents the dauntless young filmmaker at the top of his form," he wrote.
Also in top form is Vincent Price as a supercilious Satanist prince who terrorizes his subjects by contriving sadistic spectacles of humiliation. His foils include Jane Asher, who wanders through the proceedings in a state of wide-eyed alarm. Asher, who, as Paul McCartney's girlfriend, personified Swinging London, is one of several local elements. "Red Death" was shot in England using the sets left over from the seriously medieval Richard Burton-vehicle "Becket," of which it might seem a travesty.
Much of the credit for its color-coded look belongs to the British cinematographer Nicolas Roeg. Whether or not Roeg framed the climactic doomsday images to suggest Luca Signorelli's "Last Judgment" frescoes, some critics have taken the movie, which opened the same year as Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove," for a Cold War nightmare. ("Red Death" to be sure.) Indeed, for all its campy excess, Corman's film ends with the Poe story's grim epitaph: "And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all."
Archer found "The Masque of the Red Death" to be "vulgar, naïve and highly amusing" -- something that could also be said of "The Mystery of the Wax Museum." Its color version was assumed lost until a print was discovered in the personal vault of the studio boss Jack Warner after his death in 1978. (For cinephiles, To Save and Project is the equivalent of browsing a used-book store; you never know what might turn up.)
Lionel Atwill, rolling his "r"s with gusto, plays the Francophile proprietor of a London wax museum whose likenesses of Joan of Arc, Voltaire and Marie Antoinette melt in the orange inferno of a spectacular arson fire set for insurance reasons. A dozen years later, he seeks to revive his operation in New York.
As much a breezily working-class Warner Bros. comedy as a horror film, "Wax Museum" is rife with body-snatchers and bootleggers as well as things that go boo, and was subject to local censorship. (One shot that drew objections showed Atwill's unscrupulous partner using a cigar to torch the museum; another discussed the availability of a particular poison.) Disturbed by the of the movie's two-strip Technicolor, the Times critic Mordaunt Hall thought it "too ghastly for comfort," observing that "after witnessing this unhealthy film, it is very agreeable to gaze upon a short subject dealing with the wonders of Yellowstone Park."
In addition to Atwill, "Wax Museum" features Fay Wray as the young woman measured to be his new Marie Antoinette, and the last reel is enlivened by her famous shriek of terror. ("King Kong," the movie that immortalized her scream, opened two months later.) But "Wax Museum" belongs to Warner contract-player Glenda Farrell, a slangy, insouciant reporter who could have given lessons in newsroom banter to Rosalind Russell of "His Girl Friday." Four years later, Farrell had her own series as Torchy Blane, "the lady newshound with a nose for news."

Texto completo: The leading maker of MSG started a push to ask Merriam-Webster to change its definition of the term, first added in 1993.
Merriam-Webster added "Chinese restaurant syndrome" to its dictionaries in 1993. The definition described symptoms affecting "susceptible persons eating food and especially Chinese food heavily seasoned with monosodium glutamate."
The entry came decades after a physician, Robert Ho Man Kwok, wrote The New England Journal of Medicine to describe an unusual malady. Whenever he ate at a Chinese restaurant, he said, he felt a peculiar numbness.
At first, his letter drew little attention. But six weeks later, the Journal published 10 more, including seven from physicians, describing similar symptoms: numbness, headaches and palpitations after eating Chinese food. The doctors speculated that the cause was a preservative -- monosodium glutamate, or MSG.
On Tuesday, activists took to social media to persuade Merriam-Webster to update the entry. The #RedefineCRS campaign was conceived by Ajinomoto, a Japanese company that developed and has been the leading producer of MSG worldwide since 1909.
"We felt it was important to highlight the outdated definition of Chinese Restaurant Syndrome in light of the extensive human research proving MSG is not linked to such symptoms in food," Tia Rains, the senior director of public relations for Ajinomoto, said in an email.
After the syndrome was described in the '60s, food companies were quick to label the preservative, which adds umami flavor to a dish, as a toxin. Chinese restaurants began displaying signs: "No MSG." It was removed from baby food. A generation of American eaters grew up thinking MSG was dirty, or dangerous.
But several studies have concluded that MSG isn't necessarily bad for you. (And it's not even specific to Chinese food -- it's added to ranch dressing, ramen and McDonald's upcoming fried chicken sandwich. Glutamic acid itself occurs naturally in some tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese.) Some doctors think the reported symptoms might be caused by sodium; others wonder if it's just confirmation bias.
Ajinomoto approached Eddie Huang, the restaurateur and comedian, and Jeannie Mai, a television personality, to lead the #RedefineCRS campaign, in the hope that they can change social perceptions about their product.
"I was shocked that Chinese Restaurant Syndrome was an actual term in a dictionary," Mr. Huang, whose autobiography was adapted for a sitcom, "Fresh Off the Boat," wrote in an email. (The actors are being paid, a spokeswoman for the company said, but she would not disclose how much. Nor would Mr. Huang and Ms. Mai.)
They are targeting a receptive publication. Merriam-Webster, the oldest dictionary publisher in the country, has recently earned a progressive reputation.
Its 2019 word of the year was "they": a singular gender-neutral pronoun for transgender and nonbinary people. And, since at least the 2016 election, its Twitter account has had word-nerds cackling at passive-aggressive posts defining words that have been used incorrectly by politicians.
"We record the language -- we do not create, sanction or promote any specific words; the language's speakers do this, and we provide a record of this use," Emily Brewster, a senior editor at Merriam-Webster, said in an email.
Ms. Brewster said that the publisher had no record of anyone contacting the company about the term until Tuesday morning, and that Merriam-Webster was "grateful" for the heads-up.
The stigma around MSG fueled -- or, perhaps, was fueled by -- long-held racist stereotypes.
After the United States lifted race-based immigration quotas in 1965, many Chinese immigrants, fleeing the Cultural Revolution that began in 1966, settled in the United States and opened restaurants. Many of those used MSG.
"We eat Chinese food three times a day all year, and we never have headaches or numbness or anything else," Roy K.C. Chen, the owner of the Mandarin Inn in Manhattan's Chinatown, said in a 1968 New York Times article about the controversy.
Even now, MSG is shunned in some circles. Lucky Lee's, a Chinese-inspired restaurant opened in April by a white health coach in Manhattan, advertised a "clean" version of the cuisine, which would not be made with MSG and some other ingredients. That brought an outcry from people who felt she had appropriated and demeaned Chinese cuisine; the restaurant closed in December.
"As soon as I heard the actual definition for Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, it hurt because I know it's steeped in decades of xenophobia," Ms. Mai, who has a Vietnamese background, wrote in an email.
The #RedefineCRS campaign comes at a time when the country is grappling with relics of historic prejudice. Monuments to soldiers who fought for the Confederate Army in Civil War are being removed, reconsidered and challenged with adjacent art pieces across the country. Some local governments have banned -- and some are fighting to reinstate -- sports mascots or names reminiscent of stereotypes about Native Americans.
There is a long history of anti-Chinese policies in the United States. President Chester A. Arthur signed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, arguably the first anti-immigrant law directed at a specific nationality. It was not revoked until 1943, after the two countries were allies in World War II.
Merriam-Webster deletes an entry only when the term is no longer in use, Ms. Brewster said. (It removed "air tourist," which once referred to non-first-class airline travelers, and consolidated "threepenny bit" and "threepenny piece" into a single entry.) It labels slurs as "offensive" or "obscene" within the definition, documenting the historical past and cultural function.
"Were we to ignore certain words on the grounds that they are offensive, we would be negligent in our duty as lexicographers," Ms. Brewster said in her email.
"That said," she continued, "we certainly aim to be mindful of the inevitable shifts in language, and we regularly update both definitions and usage labels to reflect changes."
Even as such artifacts of stereotypes and oppression are unearthed and recast, questions remain about how to address a problematic history. Some activists believe they should be removed without a trace, while others worry that that approach can cause cultural amnesia. Some believe in adding updates or challenges to the item to live alongside it, while others think that carries a racist past forward.
In the case of Chinese restaurant syndrome, the activists hope Merriam-Webster will seek a thoughtful reconsideration, turning the phrase into a fragment of a different time.
"I don't think it should be simply removed," Ms. Mai wrote. "There's a lot of history and education that needs to be done around MSG and Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, so I hope redefining the term accomplishes that."

Hashtag Prods Talent Agencies Into Raising Pay

Texto completo: Hourly wage earners at Creative Artists Agency score a victory for the #PayUpHollywood movement.
Using the hashtag #PayUpHollywood, assistants working in the entertainment industry have been agitating in recent months for higher wages and more considerate treatment from their sometimes mercurial bosses.
The assistants scored a small victory recently, when Creative Artists Agency, one of the Big Four talent agencies in Los Angeles, announced that it was raising pay for its hourly workers, a group that includes assistants, mailroom clerks, receptionists and agent trainees.
Assistants will earn $ 18, up from $ 15, according to a spokeswoman for the agency. C.A.A. declined to disclose the increases for other hourly workers or when the changes would take effect.
C.A.A. is the latest Hollywood company to respond to the effort by assistants, who have argued that low pay often means that only people from privileged backgrounds can afford to take entry-level jobs, which has limited diversity in the industry.
Verve, a smaller talent agency, announced in December that it would raise the pay for mailroom employees and assistants by 25 to 40 percent. ICM, another of the Big Four agencies, recently announced that it had given all employees -- including assistants -- an extra month's salary, in addition to bonuses at the end of 2019.
Assistant jobs have long been a proving ground in Hollywood, allowing entry-level workers to learn the ins and outs of the business while fetching coffee, answering phones and listening in on backstage chitchat.
But assistants are expected to work long, irregular hours for low pay while enduring sometimes abusive behavior without complaint. More than 100 assistants, in a recent survey, said a boss had thrown something at them. Emboldened by the #MeToo movement, many of them have challenged longstanding practices.
C.A.A. informed its workers of the raises on Jan. 9, a day before The New York Times published an article on Hollywood assistants that included interviews with a number of entry-level workers in the entertainment industry who complained of low wages, bullying bosses and hostile work environments.

'REV. 23' at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater (Jan. 17, 8 p.m.; Jan 18, 3 and 8 p.m.). The annual Prototype festival, now at the heart of new opera in New York, concludes on Sunday, but not before it has squeezed in three performances of this opera based on a new, "unpublished" chapter of the Book of Revelation by the librettist Cerise Lim Jacobs and the composer Julian Wachner, the music director at Trinity Wall Street. James Darrah directs a production that features Daniela Candillari conducting Novus NY.
212-647-0251, prototypefestival.org
RODERICK WILLIAMS AND JULIUS DRAKE at the 92nd Street Y (Jan. 22, 7:30 p.m.).

Cheating Mars Championships. Are We O.K. With That Now?

Texto completo: The Houston Astros' sign-stealing scheme could be the apex of the cheating era. Or maybe that's just the way things are now in sports.
In years to come, this might be the week this age of sports came to be known as the "asterisk era."
During a decade that brought eye-in-the-sky cameras, rogue chemists, executives with malleable morals and Soviet-era spy craft, those two-fisted disrupters -- science and technology -- have given cheaters seemingly limitless tools to secure victory on playing fields as diverse as the Olympic Games, Major League Baseball, the N.F.L. and horse racing.
The Houston Astros' signs-stealing scheme, laid bare in a sober yet searing report from the baseball commissioner on Monday, is the latest embodiment of that old sports saw, "If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying." The 2017 World Series champions mixed high-tech with the low-fi -- using a television monitor near the dugout to watch the opposing catcher give his pitching signs, then having teammates bang a trash can to let the batter know what was coming.
[ Carlos Beltran of the Mets became the third manager to lose his job over the Astros scandal]
For supporters of clean sports, this looked like just one more powerful weapon that athletes, teams and organizations used to win games and skirt the fair-play police, one more instance of the truth about a champion spilling out too late.
In 2014, the Russian Olympic Committee augmented its medal haul by having doping experts collaborate with the country's intelligence services to switch out urine samples through a hole in the testing laboratory's wall. On their way to six Super Bowl championships, the New England Patriots have been found guilty of using clandestine video surveillance and of somehow ending up with deflated footballs that allowed their quarterback to get a better grip in foul weather. A horse that staged a historic run to the Triple Crown was found to have chemicals associated with performance-enhancing drugs in his system.
Regulators of Olympic sports acknowledge that they are mostly outgunned on the science and technology fronts. Instead, they rely on law enforcement sources, whistle-blowers and moral outrage, all of which are often in short supply.
"It doesn't take a philosopher to know that if you cheat to win, you're not really a winner," said Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, who is perhaps best known for bringing Lance Armstrong's extensive doping operation to light.
Really?
Tygart and international Olympic officials have taken back gold medals and handed out lifetime bans for cheating. Yet Tygart knows there are athletes who keep trying to become faster and stronger through performance-enhancing drugs. The usual rationalizations: Everyone else is doing it, and winning is worth the risk.
Vacating titles and ending careers are powerful deterrents, but in America's professional sports leagues, the commissioners have been resistant to mete out such punishments.
M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred handed down yearlong suspensions for Astros Manager A.J. Hinch and General Manager Jeff Luhnow. Both were subsequently fired by the team's owner, Jim Crane. The Boston Red Sox' owners, John Henry and Tom Werner, also parted ways with their manager -- Alex Cora, who was a bench coach with Houston during its sign-stealing operation and was identified as a major part of the scheme.
In addition, M.L.B. stripped the Astros of their first- and second-round draft picks for the next two years and fined the team $ 5 million. The Red Sox, who remain under investigation for similar violations, may soon be penalized, too.
On Thursday, Carlos Beltran, the lone Astros player named in the report, parted ways with the Mets, who had hired him in November to manage the team.
"I couldn't let myself be a distraction for the team," Beltran said in a statement.
Still, Houston retains its title as the 2017 World Series champion. Presumably, Boston will retain its 2018 title. Would stripping those titles make a difference?
"If the goal was to uphold the honesty and sanctity of the game for a broader community, the ultimate penalty is to vacate the wins and the titles," said Ann Skeet, a sports and leadership ethicist for the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at the University of Santa Clara in California. "But there are some built-in conflicts -- the commissioner works for the owners. They share revenue. Their fortunes are tied together."
It's true that lines between right and wrong have become blurry. Stealing signs in baseball is as old as the game, though using electronics (or stationing a scout with binoculars and signaling equipment in the center-field stands) is illegal. N.F.L. teams study endless hours of video of opponents, but filming opposing coaches is a no-no. Performance-enhancing drugs are illegal, unless officials grant an exemption for a drug that, say, treats asthma.
But the rules are there, and F. Clark Power worries that by flouting them, more is being lost than a sense of fair play. Power is the founder of the Play Like a Champion program, which promotes character education through sports and focuses on proper coaching instruction in youth sports, especially for at-risk children.
He likes to reference what he sees when he witnesses the joy of 7-year-olds playing hide-and-seek.
"Every one of them knows that to have a fair game, you've got to keep your eyes closed while you count," said Power, who has taught at the University of Notre Dame since 1982.
"We need to understand, if we are going to endorse cheating as a means to an end, the children are watching," he said. "So it becomes a question of how do you want to raise your kids? We can't get much lower as a culture if cheating is no longer a moral issue but a form of coping. We need to change the conversation."
Accountability rolled downhill when an investigation into the Patriots found it "more probable than not" that quarterback Tom Brady was "at least generally aware" that the balls used in his team's victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the 2015 A.F.C. Championship Game had been deflated.
The franchise, which is owned by Robert K. Kraft, had tangled seven years earlier with N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell over a sign-stealing scheme. Scouts filmed the sidelines of upcoming opponents and matched play calls to actual plays so Patriots players would know what was coming. The scheme and investigation became known as "Spygate." The N.F.L. fined Bill Belichick, the head coach, fined the franchise and took away the team's first-round draft pick.
A few weeks after the crime that came to be known as "Deflategate," Brady and the Patriots defeated Seattle, 28-24, in Super Bowl XLIX. Eventually, Brady was suspended four games, and the franchise was fined $ 1 million and docked two draft picks. And yet this season, the Patriots were at it again, their video cameras drifting to the sideline of an upcoming opponent.
America's professional leagues do not have a monopoly on conflicts of interest. In April 2018, a colt named Justify failed a doping test after winning the Santa Anita Derby, a victory the horse needed to qualify for the Kentucky Derby the following month.
Under California horse racing rules, Justify should have been disqualified and his $ 600,000 purse money returned. Instead, California regulators waited four months to render judgment, by which point the colt had become the 13th Triple Crown winner and been sold as a stallion for $ 60 million.
In a closed-door executive session, the California Horse Racing Board ruled that the failed drug test had been caused by environmental contamination. Its chairman at the time, Chuck Winner, owned an interest in horses trained by Justify's trainer. The board's maneuvering came to light after The New York Times reported on how a lack of transparency had kept the failed test from the public.
Another champion, another asterisk.
Power, the Play Like a Champion founder, describes himself as an old guy, but one who still often plays in pickup basketball games.
Where, he wonders, have joy and honor on the competition field gone? Worse, what if sports fans fall as far behind in moral outrage as regulators have in science and technology?
"There's a code in those games that you don't cheat," he said of his pickup basketball exploits. "It's a matter of honor."

Recycling in the United States is broken.
For years, we relied heavily on recycling operations in China to take our waste. But that came to an end in 2018, when Beijing barred the import of recycling materials. The result is a waste crisis that has caused at least dozens of municipalities to cancel curbside recycling programs, with many more implementing partial cuts. Huge amounts of recyclables are now going to landfills.
"When the biggest export market is no longer willing to accept your material, there's an imbalance between supply and demand," said David Biderman, the executive director of the Solid Waste Association of North America. "That's just Economics 101."
So, how can we fix the system?
Experts say that we would need to implement changes across the board. Legislators may need to pass laws requiring manufacturers to use more recyclable materials, companies would need to build much-needed recycling infrastructure and people would need to recycle properly.
Cities can't do all that. But they can play an important role.
For a possible model, consider San Francisco, which runs one of the most successful waste-management programs in the United States. Through recycling and composting, the city manages to keep around 80 percent of its waste out of landfills.
That's much higher than the American average. In 2017, the year before the Chinese ban, American cities were recycling and composting about 35 percent of their waste. Europeans do a bit better, keeping almost half of their municipal trash out of landfills on average.
San Francisco's program has been years in the making. In 2000, it introduced the "fantastic three" citywide curbside collection program with separate, color-coded bins for recyclables, compost and trash. In 2009, it passed a law requiring residents and businesses to separate their waste.
City inspectors monitor bins to ensure that residents sort their waste correctly and leave tags if materials are found in the wrong bin. They can impose fines if they find repeat offenders.
Other policies include bans on hard-to-recycle items including single-use plastic bags and polystyrene packaging and an ordinance requiring food vendors to use compostable or recyclable food containers.
San Francisco's system is built on a highly unusual partnership with a single waste company. That company, Recology, has had a monopoly on handling San Francisco's waste for almost 90 years. That no-bid, no-franchise-fee concession has come under harsh criticism over the years.
Critics say that the city could save tens of millions of dollars if it were to break up Recology's monopoly and award waste collection and processing contracts separately.
Supporters say, why mess with a system that gets results? Having a monopoly avoids a "race to the bottom," said Robert Haley, zero-waste manager at the San Francisco Department of the Environment, as companies cut corners to win short-term contracts instead of focusing on broader waste reduction goals.
No matter where you stand on issues like regulation and market competition, the Chinese ban means that the United States recycling system needs an overhaul.
But that might not be as bad as it sounds, Mr. Biderman said.
"The ban is a challenge for recycling programs in the United States," he said. "But it also creates huge opportunities to invest in domestic infrastructure to receive recovered material."
We got two very important global temperature numbers this week. A study released Monday found that the average temperature of the world's oceans hit a record high in 2019. Then, on Wednesday, a report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that the planet's average surface temperature last year was the second-highest on record.
The NOAA report, compiled in cooperation with NASA, echoed a finding by European scientists in early January.
Overall, 2019 was sweltering hot, and it closed out a blistering decade. The years from 2010 to 2019 were the hottest 10-year stretch ever recorded, with global temperature data falling in line with the warming trends predicted under climate change.
We might not think about heat in the ocean as much as we think about surface temperatures. An indicator of what's happening roughly two meters above the earth's surface and two meters below sea level, surface temperature data tends to reflect what most people feel in their day-to-day lives.
But the two are interconnected, and the oceans are working very hard right now. To date, they've absorbed roughly 93 percent of the heat associated with human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. That's saved us from more severe surface warming.
"The ocean taking up a lot of that heating that we've caused is a good thing because it means that our atmosphere is not having to rise in temperature nearly as much as the amount of heat that we're putting in," said Olaf Jensen, an associate professor in the department of marine and coastal sciences at Rutgers University. "But it comes with some really terrible costs."
Those costs, according to Dr. Jensen, include the loss of marine life and increasingly severe tropical storms -- including hurricanes like Harvey, Maria and Irma -- that feed on warm ocean waters.
Researchers are increasingly wary, though, about how much heat the oceans can continue to absorb. We also know that the oceans, under the right conditions, can release that heat back into the atmosphere and warm the planet's surface. That's what many researchers say happened in 2016, the hottest year on record.
"The oceans absorbing the heat is not a get-out-of-jail-free card," Dr. Jensen said. "It's not gone. It's being stored there and it's coming back to us. We're in for a long period of warming, even after we stop heating the atmosphere."
The sooner we stop heating the atmosphere, researchers say, the less heating we, and our grandchildren, will have to deal with down the line.

Texto completo: Fourteen states, New York City and the District of Columbia asked the courts to block the Trump administration from imposing tougher work requirements on food stamp recipients.
WASHINGTON -- Fourteen states, New York City and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Thursday to block new rules that would tighten work requirements for food stamp recipients, accusing the administration of doing an illegal end run around Congress.
The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Agriculture Department and its secretary, Sonny Perdue, argues that the finalized rule, set to take effect in April, is unlawful, arbitrary and capricious.
"The new rule eliminates state discretion and criteria regarding local economic conditions for waiving work requirements, resulting in the termination of essential food assistance for benefits recipients who live in areas with insufficient jobs," the lawsuit maintains.
The Trump administration finalized a rule last month that would raise the bar for states seeking to waive certain work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents and living in economically distressed areas. The Agriculture Department estimated that the rule could push nearly 700,000 people off food stamps.
"Now, in the midst of the strongest economy in a generation, we need everyone who can work, to work," Mr. Perdue said at the time.
The lawsuit argues that Congress rejected stricter requirements for waivers in the 2018 farm bill, so imposing them by executive fiat violates the law. Further, the administration violated the statutory rule-making process by adding elements to the final rule that were not in the proposed rule and by not sufficiently addressing more than 140,000 public comments on the rule, which were overwhelmingly negative, the state attorneys general say.
The Agriculture Department "fails to adequately explain the dramatic policy change or explain the basis for disregarding the evidence-based reasons for its prior policies," the lawsuit maintains. The Democratic officials said they have standing to file the lawsuit because the final rule will harm their governments by hurting their citizens' health and ability to pay for housing.
The plaintiffs include attorneys general from the District of Columbia, New York, California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia, as well as New York City.
The Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia also filed lawsuit on Thursday against the rule. "Implementation of this rule will not increase the employment rate among SNAP beneficiaries," said Eric Angel, the group's executive director, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. "But it will most definitely increase hunger."
Some wards in the District of Columbia have unemployment rates that are more than two times the national average. They are also predominantly black. The Legal Aid Society argues that the rule will have a "negative racial impact, disproportionately and significantly increasing food insecurity in communities of color."
Under the new rule, waivers commonly granted to states and cities now will be awarded only to "labor market areas" defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that have unemployment rates 20 percent above the national average over a two-year period and are at least 6 percent.
The District of Columbia -- which has an unemployment rate of 5.4 percent -- is part of a labor market area that includes wealthier areas of Northern Virginia and Maryland. Nineteen of the 22 counties in that labor market area had unemployment rates lower than the national average. Under the new rule, the District of Columbia would lose its waiver, which it has had for more than two decades, even though the unemployment rate is nearly 50 percent above the national unemployment rate.
The administration has proposed two other changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that have yet to be finalized. One would strip nearly three million people of their benefits and lead to nearly one million children losing automatic eligibility for free or reduced-price school meals. Another proposal would cut $ 4.5 billion from the program over five years by adjusting eligibility formulas, affecting one in five struggling families. Both have received tens of thousands of public comments that have been overwhelmingly negative.

To the Editor:
Re "'BagelGate' Serves Up a Full Platter of Tasty Puns After de Blasio's Toasty Tweet" (news article, Jan. 16):
Thank you for giving us something to laugh about and chew over that isn't partisan politics or anti-Trump rhetoric.
Maybe all political debates should start with the question to all participants: "What is your favorite bagel?" It would not only break the ice, but it would also tell us something personal about the person answering.
At heart, don't people ultimately vote for those with whom they feel some emotional connection?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump wanted to strike down a law that prohibits companies from bribing foreign officials, calling the ban "so unfair" to American companies, two Washington Post reporters recount in a new book.
In the spring of 2017, Trump was at a briefing with Rex Tillerson, then the secretary of state, and aides in the Oval Office. At the mention of a bribery allegation, Trump "perked up" and told Tillerson that he wanted his help in scrapping the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the authors write.
That law, enacted in 1977 and heavily enforced since around 2005, prohibits companies that operate in the United States from bribing foreign officials to obtain or retain business. It has become a major factor in corporate decision-making about operations abroad.
Trump said it was "just so unfair that American companies aren't allowed to pay bribes to get business overseas," according to the book, "A Very Stable Genius," by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig.
"I need you to get rid of that law," Trump told Tillerson.
Tillerson explained that he could not repeal the legislation, according to Rucker and Leonnig. He pointed out that Congress would need to be involved in any effort to strike it down.
Undeterred, Trump told Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser, to draft an executive action to repeal the law.
Tillerson, the authors write, later caught up with Miller in the hallway, where Miller said he had some skepticism about whether that plan for unilateral executive action could work.
The anecdote meshes with the president's past views of the anti-corruption law.
In a 2012 CNBC appearance, he called it a horrible rule and said that "the world is laughing at us" for enforcing it.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department began enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act more concertedly about 15 years ago. It has led to huge fines for companies, including engineering conglomerate Siemens and Brazil's state-owned energy company, Petrobras.
Critics of the government's pursuit of cases under the law have argued that regulators are reading its language too expansively, holding back business.
Skeptics have included Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC, whom Trump nominated to the position in early 2017.
Clayton was an author of a 2011 paper that argued that America's anti-bribery policies tended "to place disproportionate burdens on U.S. regulated companies in international transactions," hurting American competitiveness.
Despite such criticisms and Trump's misgivings, top administration officials have pledged to uphold the law.
"We will continue to strongly enforce" anti-corruption laws, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, said in a speech in April 2017.
And under the current attorney general, William Barr, who was confirmed last year, enforcement actions have continued to rapidly roll in.
"The past three years have shown that very little has changed," said Joshua Roth, a lawyer specializing in these issues at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP, despite early expectations that enforcement might fall off under the Trump administration. "What some of us were forecasting really didn't materialize."

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors in the District have taken steps in recent months to explore a years-old disclosure of classified information to the media, raising some fears that the Justice Department is resurrecting dated instances of possible wrongdoing to support President Trump's crackdown on leaks and possibly target a source of his ire: former FBI director James B. Comey, people familiar with the matter said Thursday.
The prosecutors have begun asking questions about news reporting in 2017 about a classified document " thought to be a Russian intelligence product " that described how then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch had purportedly assured someone in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state would not push too deep, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.
The document was determined to be bad intelligence " possibly a fake meant to dupe the FBI " and those mentioned in it said they do not know each other and did not have any talks like those described. Both The Washington Post and the New York Times reported on the document.
Comey told the Justice Department inspector general he relied in part on the document when he elected in July 2016 not to tell Lynch that he was recommending the Clinton email case be closed without charges before announcing his decision publicly. He reasoned that if the classified material leaked, it could raise concerns about Lynch's credibility, according to an inspector general report on the matter released in 2018.
Some former law enforcement officials say they worry Trump or officials at his Justice Department might be ginning up the investigation now because of the president's hatred of the media " or of Comey. The probe was first reported by the New York Times.
Trump has frequently pushed for probes of his critics and political rivals, and he has been particularly spiteful toward Comey, whom he fired as FBI director in May 2017. Last month, for example, Trump suggested without evidence that Comey had broken the law.
'So what are the consequences for his unlawful conduct,' Trump wrote on Twitter. 'Could it be years in jail?'
Trump and Justice Department officials have pledged to crack down on leaks. Early in the administration, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions boasted of tripling the number of such probes.
That prosecutors are only now investigating leaks about the document is unusual; typically, such probes begin soon after the material is disclosed.
It was not immediately clear what might have sparked the opening of a case almost three years later. The people familiar with the matter declined to provide those and other details. Spokespeople for the Justice Department, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia declined to comment.
The document at issue has been the subject of some government-authorized reporting " which might raise questions about the need for its continued classification at all. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz offered some broad details about the document in his report on the FBI's Clinton email investigation, noting, for example, that the same classified material 'also included an allegation, equally lacking in credibility, that Comey planned to delay the . . . investigation to aid Republicans.'
But Horowitz included more details in a classified appendix. And when Comey referenced the material in his book, 'A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,' which was reviewed in advance by the FBI for sensitive information, he seemed to do so cryptically.
'They came from a classified source " the source and content of that material remains classified as I write this,' Comey wrote.
A lawyer for Comey declined to comment. Last year, the Justice Department considered whether Comey might face criminal culpability for the handling of memos he wrote documenting his conversations with Trump but ultimately determined he could not be charged. It was 'not a close call,' said one person familiar with the investigation, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.
The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia is also investigating Comey's former deputy, Andrew McCabe, on allegations of lying to investigators about a media disclosure. The U.S. attorney's office has faced similar criticism in the McCabe case for pursuing a critic of Trump, and it has yet to bring any charges.

Australian fires stoke discord among Murdochs

Texto completo: It took an epic natural disaster to publicly surface the long-standing tension within one of the world's wealthiest and most powerful families.
In an unusual, brief statement, James and Kathryn Murdoch voiced their 'frustration' this week with what they see as the Murdoch family empire's role in climate change denial. The comments, while focused narrowly on the way Murdoch-owned media properties have covered the wildfires in Australia, highlighted the family's underlying discord. (The fires have claimed 27 lives and affected an estimated 1 billion animals.)
Since James officially left the company founded by his father, Rupert Murdoch, 88 " after having lost out to his older brother, Lachlan, in a succession race " James and his wife, Kathryn, have become increasingly outspoken about their views. Many of their perspectives directly contradict the editorial direction of the Murdochs' properties, including Fox News and News Corp. Australia, the most dominant force in the Australian media landscape.
'Kathryn and James' views on climate are well established and their frustration with some of the News Corp. and Fox coverage of the topic is also well known,' a spokesperson for the couple wrote in an email to The Washington Post, confirming the previously released statement to the Daily Beast.
'They are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia given obvious evidence to the contrary,' the statement continued.
News Corp. Australia publishes more than 140 newspapers and employs 3,000 journalists in print, broadcast and online. Some columnists in Murdoch's Australian outlets have deemed those who attribute the fires to climate change as 'hysterical,' even though most scientists say otherwise. Fox News prime-time host Laura Ingraham recently dismissed the 'climate-change flameout' as 'celebrities in the media' pressing 'the narrative that wildfires in Australia are caused by climate change.'
Representatives for News Corp. declined to respond to the joint statement but referred The Post to an editorial published last week in the Australian, a company-owned newspaper, that decried coverage in the New York Times and the Guardian Australia for 'willfully and ineptly' misrepresenting the Australian's coverage of the wildfires as 'climate denial.'
James and Kathryn Murdoch's comments are the latest in a series of moves distancing themselves from the company James and his siblings were raised to inherit and run.
James Murdoch, 47, has chafed for years against the direction of his father's empire. Inaction on climate change and climate denialism are just one element of that dissatisfaction.
When the younger Murdoch son was an executive in his father's company, he often ran up against his father's loyalists who dismissed his authority.
Former executives of the company who worked with James and spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about their former employer say James is 'thrilled' to be out of the company and free to express his views without looking over his shoulder to wonder what his father and brother think.
In the spring, James said in an interview with the New Yorker that he was 'very lucky to have the opportunity at this point to make a clean break, and literally have an empty slate.' In the same interview, he said that 'there are views I really disagree with on Fox,' a statement that surprised few within the Fox firmament.
James was long at odds with Fox News's late founder, Roger Ailes, and James pushed to have Ailes fired after he was accused of sexually harassing and assaulting women who worked for him. (Ailes, who died in 2017, was forced to resign in the summer of 2016 and received a $40-million payout from the company.)
Kathryn, 48, too, made her dim opinion of Fox News and Ailes well known when her husband was an executive at Fox News's parent company.
Kathryn and James were not available to comment. A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.
The sale of most of the Murdoch-controlled 21st Century Fox to Disney last year netted each of Rupert Murdoch's six children $2 billion. With that money, Kathryn and James Murdoch have doubled down on a wide range of philanthropic causes. They created the Quadrivium Foundation, which says it 'invests in evidence-based solutions to some of society's most urgent challenges.'
James also founded Lupa Systems, a private investment company named after the Roman goddess who nursed the mythical Romulus and Remus. (It is exactly the kind of historical reference that used to draw eye rolls from Rupert Murdoch's executives, when they were forced to work alongside their boss's sons.)
Since leaving the family business, James has also bought a controlling stake in the Tribeca Film Festival; he put money into Artists Writers - Artisans, a company that produces comics and graphic novels; and invested in the Void, a virtual-reality-entertainment company. He also recently bought a stake in Vice.
Even when he was an executive at his father's company, James's values were on display. When he ran the paid-television division Sky, he turned that entity into a carbon-neutral operation. 'A lot of people are worried about climate change but are waiting for someone else to do something about it,' he said in a 2006 statement. 'We are showing that you can take action.'
In her bio, Kathryn notes that she is 'an advocate for improving science communications.' She is a trustee of the Environmental Defense Fund and Climate Central, and is a founding trustee of SciLine, a group that connects scientific experts with journalists. From 2007 to 2011, she served as the director of strategy and communications for the Clinton Climate Initiative. She also serves on the board of the Climate Leadership Council, a group focused on establishing Republican support for climate solutions.
In an interview with the New York Times last fall, Kathryn said that she decided to work to stem climate change after hearing Al Gore speak at the Fox retreat in 2006. The former vice president had recently made 'An Inconvenient Truth,' and presented an abridged version of its findings at the retreat. 'I decided to switch everything I was doing,' she said. 'I wanted to be able to look my children in the eye and say 'I did everything I could.' '
After the Murdoch family elected to sell most of its media empire to Disney, James was eager to move away from the family company, according to former executives and friends whom he spoke to at the time. His older brother, Lachlan, elected to stay behind and run what has become Fox Corp., which encompasses Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox Entertainment and owns and operates 28 full-power broadcast television stations in the United States. (All of the company's movie studios and most of its television production capabilities, along with its interest in National Geographic, were sold for $71-billion to Disney.)
On Monday, News Corp announced that it was donating $3.5 million to fire relief efforts in Australia. That donation is in addition to about $2.8 million that the company said Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch have donated individually.
Rupert Murdoch released a statement announcing the donation: 'It is clear that confronting the bush fire disaster in Australia requires both an immediate response and an ongoing investment in rebuilding the lives and livelihoods of those most affected by the fires across the country. As a company with roots in Australia and an abiding commitment to its people and communities, we are determined to help, both in this time of great need, and well into the future, as the hard work of restoration continues.'

Texto completo: Activists are concerned that rift could hurt efforts to halt a moderate's rise
The current rupture between Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren over who called whom a liar is exposing genuine anger between two candidates who often present themselves as friends and allies. But it has also laid bare the central fight among liberals: Is the Trump era of scorched-earth politics a moment for purity or pragmatism?
Sanders has risen in the presidential field by pushing a revolutionary agenda with little regard for cost or compromise, while Warren has won a following as a liberal who is ambitious but practical. On Thursday, as an array of left-leaning groups urged a truce, some acknowledged the difficulty of bridging the gap between two figures who, despite their shared status as liberal icons, have sharply different personalities and approaches.
That split could play into opponents' hands, some liberals fear.
'We should be finding a path forward through solidarity,' said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. 'I think also that we have to have some perspective that this is the Democratic primary, and both of these people are running because they believe that they would best serve the American public as president of the United States.'
She added: 'I think it's absurd to think that they wouldn't come together and find common ground. Is it going to happen before Iowa? Maybe not.'
The two have not spoken since Tuesday evening, Sanders said Thursday afternoon, and his campaign officials said the campaign sent emails to surrogates this week encouraging them not to escalate the conflict. But their differences are increasingly on display as the candidates make their closing arguments in the final days before the Iowa caucuses on Feb.-3, and the choice facing the newly energized liberal camp comes to a head.
Their rift is colliding with a long-held ambition by liberal activists to unite around a candidate and prevent a more moderate Democrat from winning the nomination.
Warren, who describes her philosophy as capitalism with tougher rules, has produced detailed policy plans, some with multiple pages listing funding mechanisms and other specifics. Sanders, by contrast, calls himself a democratic socialist and says billionaires shouldn't exist; he speaks in broad-brush terms and has shown less interest in justifying his ideas by explaining precisely how they would be enacted or detailing how they would be paid for.
The two also show very different personal styles. Sanders recently revealed to the New York Times editorial board that he avoids calling people on their birthdays, which he sees as distasteful pandering that distracts from the issues. Warren uses nearly any excuse to contact numerous acquaintances, calling people when they get a new job just to wish them luck.
But if the Sanders-Warren conflict has been a long time coming, the catalyst was abrupt and unexpected. In recent days, Warren has said that during a private 2018 dinner at her condo, as the two discussed the 2020 presidential race, Sanders told her he did not think a woman could beat President Trump. Sanders forcefully denies saying that.
The dispute erupted further on Tuesday, as both stuck to their accounts during the Democratic debate. After the event, Warren approached Sanders, and as he reached out his hand she refused to shake it, saying, 'I think you called me a liar on national TV.'
Sanders, who seemed taken aback, replied: 'You know, let's not do it right now. If you want to have that discussion, I'll have that discussion.'
Warren replied, 'Any time.' Sanders said, 'You called me a liar. You told me " all right, let's not do it now.'
Until several years ago, neither senator seemed a likely powerhouse in the Democratic Party, but as the Trump era drives a surge in liberal activism, Sanders has found an audience for ideas he has championed for decades, and Warren's brand of academic populism has garnered new appeal.
But the Democratic primary is making it clear that they can't both be the liberal standard-bearer. Their supporters are battling over the best way to defeat Trump's brand of unconstrained, no-holds-barred politics " whether to respond with a countervailing purity and passion, or to seek allies and trim ambitions, if minimally, in the interest of attracting voters and allies.
The pressure is especially intense given how badly liberals want to defeat Trump and usher in what they hope will be a progressive moment.
Because of that, groups on the left have hoped for months that Warren and Sanders could avoid targeting one another and focus on the more centrist candidates. With Democrats embracing more left-leaning policies than at any time in years, liberals do not want to blow what they see as a historic opportunity to gain power.
Leaders of six liberal groups that have endorsed either Warren or Sanders issued a joint statement Thursday saying the senators' campaigns and supporters 'will need to find a way to cooperate.' They added, 'The crossfire amplified by the media is unhelpful and does not reflect the relationship between two Senate colleagues who broadly worked well together for most of the last year.' It outlined a strategy to build alliances between delegates for the two candidates going into the Democratic convention.
'This is all about delegates,' said Larry Cohen, who chairs Our Revolution, a nonprofit organization established by Sanders. 'It's going to take collaboration to accomplish results in July in Milwaukee,' he said, referring to the Democratic National Convention.
Liberals will have to join forces to ensure that Sanders or Warren is the nominee, Cohen said, or assemble enough delegates to block a candidate the left finds distasteful.
In addition to Our Revolution, groups signing onto the statement included the Sunrise Movement, RootsAction, the Working Families Party, Justice Democrats and Democracy for America.
Similarly, on Wednesday, 18 liberal groups launched an effort that includes a pledge to 'focus our fight for the nomination against candidates supported by the corporate wing, instead of fighting each other.'
Sanders and Warren met nearly two decades ago, when he was a member of Congress and she was a rising academic star. Warren made a presentation at a dinner hosted by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), describing her research on how middle-class families were going bankrupt, according to a Boston Globe account.
Sanders invited Warren to be on his radio show from time to time, and even occasionally to speak as a guest at his town hall meetings in Vermont. He campaigned for Warren's successful Senate bid in 2012, boasting on one occasion that 'I knew Elizabeth Warren before she was Elizabeth Warren.'
Sanders has said he spoke to Warren in 2015 before launching his own presidential campaign, saying he would defer to her as the left's standard-bearer if she wanted to get in the race and challenge eventual nominee Hillary Clinton.
Warren chose not to run that year, however. And to the dismay of many liberals, she also did not endorse Sanders during that campaign, instead staying on the sidelines until the very end when she gave her nod to Clinton.
So while Warren and Sanders are both staunch liberals, when one leading Democrat was asked whether anything suggests the two have a close personal relationship, they replied, 'Frankly, no.'
In the presidential race, Warren and Sanders are also drawing from different voter pools. Sanders has a wide margin of support among younger voters, while Warren does slightly better with older Democrats. Warren also has a small edge among women. She fares better with self-identified Democrats, and he does better with voters who say they're independent, as he is.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who has worked closely with both, said in an interview several months ago that 'both have a crusader mentality around correcting what is wrong.'
Warren, she said, is 'very personable, she reaches out to people.' And she texts frequently, Jayapal added: 'She kind of makes it a point to do that.'
On Thursday, Sanders and Warren joined their colleagues in Washington for the first official day of Trump's impeachment trial, and the two senators attended a lunch for Senate Democrats.
They sat at different tables, which isn't unusual for them, and did not appear to interact, according to a person with knowledge of the lunch who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting.
As Sanders left, he said that he hadn't spoken to Warren.
'We're talking impeachment of a president, allegations that he has tried to disrupt the American process through blackmail,' Sanders said.
A few moments later, Warren emerged from the luncheon. She did not respond to questions from reporters. But others said such disputes among candidates are to be expected.
'It's a primary. You're going to have fights in the middle of a primary,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) who had considered running for president this year. 'Nobody should expect anything otherwise.'

Texto completo: To paraphrase Santayana, Democrats who refuse to acknowledge Hillary Clinton's failures in the 2016 election were always doomed to repeat them. Why is their primary field littered with the failed bids of woke candidates? Why is #WarrenIsASnake trending on Twitter? Because identity politics remains a political loser.
That's the takeaway from the rapidly narrowing Democratic field, and smart liberals warned of it after 2016. Mark Lilla, writing in the New York Times, faulted Mrs. Clinton for molding her campaign around "the rhetoric of diversity, calling out explicitly to African-American, Latino, LGBT and women voters at every stop." Successful politics, he noted, is always rooted in visions of "shared destiny."
Progressives heaped scorn on Mr. Lilla—one compared him to David Duke—and doubled down on identity politics. Nearly every flashpoint in this Democratic race has centered on racism, sexism or classism. Nearly every practitioner of that factionalist strategy has exited the race. Mr. Lilla is surely open to apologies.
Kamala Harris created the first big viral moment when she tore into Joe Biden, absolving him of being a "racist" even as she accused him of working with segregationists to oppose school busing. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand didn't hold the race card but ran a campaign about "women's equality," attacking any Democrat who didn't measure to her standards on abortion, child care and violence against women.
Sen. Cory Booker campaigned relentlessly on "systemic racism" and "social justice," blasting Mr. Biden for his work on the 1994 crime bill and warning the nation of an "all-out assault" on black voting rights in 2020. Beto O'Rourke felt the need to make up for his own whiteness by going all in on reparations for slavery. Julián Castro built his run on complaints about "discriminatory housing policy," injustices to transgender and indigenous women, and threats to marginalized communities.
Which bring us to Elizabeth Warren's attempt to rescue her campaign with a Hail Mary appeal to "sexism." Her campaign leaked in the run-up to Tuesday's debate the claim that Mr. Sanders, in a private 2018 meeting, told her he didn't believe a woman could win the presidency. Mr. Sanders denied it. When the inevitable CNN question came Tuesday night, Ms. Warren played the victim and rolled out a rehearsed statistic about the election failure rate of the men on stage. She praised the Democratic Party for having "stepped up" to elect a Catholic president in 1960 and a black one in 2008 and suggested it should do the same for a female candidate today. Sen. Amy Klobuchar cheered her on.
This is the politics of exclusion—and it explains why a field that began as the most diverse in Democratic history is now coming down to a competition between two old white men. Candidates who speak primarily to subsections of the country are by necessity excluding everybody else. All voters want to know what a candidate is going to do specifically for them, and for the country as a whole. And while many voters view issues in a moral context, few voters feel a moral imperative to vote for candidates solely because they are black, or female, or gay. It's an unpersuasive argument.
Identity politics is also by necessity vote-losing, because it requires accusations. Ms. Warren is getting blowback now after implying that Mr. Sanders is a misogynist, and calling him a liar. Sanders supporters are lacing Ms. Warren on social media with snake emojis and declaring a #NeverWarren campaign. Even if she stages a comeback, she's alienated a key base of support.
Precisely because Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders don't have easy identity-politics cards to play, they've focused on broader themes. Yes, they give shout-outs to core liberal constituencies, but Mr. Biden's consistent argument is that he is the only one qualified to beat Mr. Trump, while Mr. Sanders's is that America needs to overhaul its economic system. Those are positions around which greater numbers of Democrats can unify.
Beyond the brief viral moments they obtained with their made-for-TV attacks, the dropouts never provided a compelling or even memorable agenda. What was Mr. Booker's vision for the country? Did Ms. Harris ever nail down a plan for health care? Was Mr. Castro capable of talking beyond Section 1325 of immigration law? The notion that a Democratic primary audience that nominated Mr. Obama more than a decade ago somehow rejected these candidates because of their race or sex is laughable.
What they rejected, yet again, is a form of politics that pits groups of Americans against one another. It's never been a winner, and the sooner woke candidates awaken to that reality, the better for them and the country.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Rocky Johnson, the hard-bodied professional wrestler known as Soul Man who battled racism early in his career and later helped train his son, actor Dwayne “The Rock" Johnson, has died. He was 75.
His death was announced Wednesday in a statement by World Wrestling Entertainment. No cause was given.
Former professional wrestler Brian Blair, another 1980s WWE star, went to church with Mr. Johnson in the Tampa area. He told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Mr. Johnson had complained of an unspecified illness of late and had missed church that he attended with Blair and other former wrestlers.
"He thought he had the flu or something," Blair said by phone. "I said, 'You, need to get checked out, Rocky.' He said he'd be OK. . . . I talked to (his wife) Sheila and she said he was just being stubborn. He died at home."
Mr. Johnson rose from small-town Canada to fame in the 1980s as a muscular wrestler who bounded off the ropes, delivered punishing jabs, and called himself “the king of the dropkick" for his ability to dispatch opponents with that singular move.
His opponents included well-known figures in the professional wrestling world, such as Greg “The Hammer" Valentine, Don Muraco, and Adrian Adonis. But he was perhaps best known for pairing with another black wrestler, Tony Atlas, in a tag team known as the Soul Patrol.
The two became the first black world tag team champions in WWE history when they defeated the Wild Samoans on Dec. 10, 1983, according to World Wrestling Entertainment, which released a video clip of some of Mr. Johnson's highlights Wednesday.
In an interview with thehannibaltv.com, Mr. Johnson recalled the many successes he had in a career that took him around the world, but said there was also racism in professional wrestling, “then as it is now."
“Now, it's more covered up," Mr. Johnson said in the interview. “But there was a lot."
Mr. Johnson said he fought against such prejudice, refusing to take part in some degrading performances.
“I was headstrong," he said in the interview. “I kept myself in shape and the stuff they were doing in the South, I wouldn't go for. They wanted to whip me on TV, like they used to do with the slaves and all that. I said, 'No. I came in as an athlete, and I'll leave as an athlete.' And they respected me for that."
When his son showed an interest in wrestling, Mr. Johnson said, he offered to train him.
“ 'I'm going to train you 150 percent,' " Mr. Johnson recalled telling his son, in the interview with thehannibaltv.com. “And I was hard on him. But he never gave up."
Born Wayde Douglas Bowles on Aug. 24, 1944, Mr. Johnson grew up in Amherst, Nova Scotia, and moved to Toronto as a teenager. He boxed as a young man and recalled sparring with George Foreman and Muhammad Ali.
He adopted the name Rocky Johnson, he said, as a tribute to two of his favorite boxing greats: Rocky Marciano and Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight boxing champion.
Mr. Johnson's sports-entertainment career began in the mid-1960s with the National Wrestling Alliance. But he found his greatest success when he began his tenure with what is now the WWE in 1983, the company said.
Mr. Johnson retired from the ring in 1991.

Texto completo: It's early in the year and iťs the first "that time of the year," the holiday that we as Americans should be ashamed to celebrate, unless we were highlighting his brilliance in some other field of endeavor. However, that isn't even close to being the case. It was the year 1619 when we as a people (Black I mean) were settled into the relatively new territory of the land soon to become known as the United States of America that has been for us, as close to Hades as possible. CENTURIES have passed since our conditions have gotten incrementally better and it was the attrition of millions of people that got us to certain advancements. Standing amongst the giants who have been credited with the breakthrough to a somewhat equal measure of humanity has been the man whose birthday that we celebrate on Monday, January 20. The realism of Africans in America since 1619 met a formidable foe in this man and for that we say HAPPY BORNDAY, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
In honor of this day, The Brooklyn Academy of Music will for the 34th year host a series of events in celebration of the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The anchoring event is the 34th annual Brooklyn Tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., on Monday, January 20 at 10:30 am. in the Howard Gilman Opera House (Peter Jay Sharp Building, 30 Lafiiyette Ave). The events run from January 17-20 and admission is zilch, nada, FREE. The listings of the events are as follows:

With her unvarnished look at the role of slavery and its legacy on the making of our nation, Hannah-Jones tells us that "without the idealistic, strenuous, and patriotic efforts of Black Americans, our democracy today would most likely look very different-it might not be a democracy at all." The award-winning journalist created The New York Times Magazine's "1619 Project," a multi-media initiative marking the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Black people in Jamestown, Va., the system of slavery that followed, and its enduring legacy in America.

Texto completo: Global economies are being fueled by local companies. The New York Times recently published an article noting: "Globalization is thus gradually giving way to localization, which makes this a promising time for countries with domestic markets large enough to support significant expansion in local businesses." {Ruchir Sharma, author of "The Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World," is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.} Reliance on major corporations meeting the needs of wise consumers is slowly giving way to the nimble small companies that are cleverly utilizing cloud and other technology to meet demand.
Even now, 70% of the national and regional workforce reside in small local companies. Small companies are flexible to address innovative work places that bend toward diverse work needs and lifestyles. In addition, many have collaborative structures that lend to fast track innovation and invention. For these and other reasons, small businesses must thrive!
Thriving, local business must be on the top of the procurement chain for public and private contracts; and must be in front for providing local infrastructure. Looking outside of a jurisdiction boundary for these and other services, reduces revenue and workforce talent needed to grow communities. Instead, jurisdictions must increase local procurement opportunities that will, in turn, invite business investment and raise revenue.
In short, think globally by investing locally!

A continued attack on women's rights

Texto completo: When Trump ran for president in 2016, he promised to nominate candidates for federal judgeships who would overturn support for Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a woman's right to abortion. The rationale for this position was to establish a strong political base with the Christian Evangelicals. This perspective pleased Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell who wanted conservative judges in order to shift the more moderate leaning of the U.S. Supreme Court.
The strategy of those who oppose abortion has been to establish impediments at the state level that preclude access to abortions. A Louisiana case, June Medical Services L.L.C v. Gee, that severely limits the establishment of abortion clinics is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, and great numbers of Republican members of Congress have signed a brief to uphold the law. The law requires that doctors performing abortions must be admitted to practice at hospitals near their medical offices.
Only one doctor in Louisiana meets this requirement.
Opponents of the law assert that the requirement is not medically necessary and it is just a subterfuge to reduce legal abortions by eliminating most medically secure operating facilities.
According to a New York Times report, 39 U.S. senators and 166 members of the House, all Republicans, signed the friend of the court brief to keep the restriction intact. That is 80 percent of Republicans in Congress. Clearly, the overwhelming majority of Republicans in Congress believe that women do not have the right to make unilateral decisions about their body.
In this presidential race year, the Republican administration has been performing in denial of the tripartite structure of American democracy. The executive branch has abrogated the authority of Congress and has shown limited respect for the judiciary. Voters should see that it is a short step to deny the rights of the individual.

Texto completo: Dalton Baldwin
Dalton Baldwin, a long-time resident of Island Heights, an internationally acclaimed pianist for more than six decades and a renown accompanist to some of the greatest vocal recitalists, passed away on December 12, 2019 in Kunming Yunan Province, China, he was 87 years old.
His interest in singing developed early; while in high school, he attended a recital in Morristown, N.J. where the great English contralto, Kathleen Ferrier, performed, and that pointed him in his chosen career path. "You know immediately when a singer has a personal message," he told a 1996 interviewer. Ferrier "had lovely rosy cheeks and an enchanting way, and there again was a message, introducing me to the world of song."
Dalton studied at the famed Julliard School in NYC and at Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio where he received a Bachelor of Music degree. When he was 22, he met French baritone Gerard Souzay, an established star in the world of song interpretation. They migrated to Paris where Dalton refined his talents studying with the internationally renowned pedagogue, Nadia Boulanger.
As they developed their professional partnership, the Baldwin/Souzay team attracted admiring comments from numerous reviewers. In 1968, they recorded complete songs by Francis Poulenc, and a New York Times critic felt they worked together so well that "their interpretations are almost inseparable into individual elements." Dalton also received high praise from critics in his individual capacity: in 1978 while accompanying Elly Ameling at a recital at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall, the Times critic wrote that Dalton Baldwin's playing "was worthy of a review all his own." His piano playing was both lyrical and sympathetic and provided "a rhythmic energy that superbly partnered the singer."
Often described as an equal partner to the singers he performed with, he preferred to be called simply a pianist. Critics routinely praised the refinement, sensitivity and technical command of his playing and equal talent to the singers.
Among the major singers he performed with were Elly Ameling, Jessye Norman, Arlene Auger, Frederica von Stade, Jose van Dam and of course, Gerard Souzay. In a career spanning six decades, Dalton performed on five continents and made more than 100 recordings. Regularly, he conducted master classes in voice in New York, and in Europe and Asia and was awarded Honorary Doctorate of Oberlin College and the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government. In the weeks preceding his death, he had been teaching and performing in Japan; as a celebration of his 60th anniversary year, there was a special tribute to him and he performed with many Japanese singers who worked with him over the years.
In 1981 Dalton met a young talented singer, Lorraine Nubar who was attending the Westminster Choir School Art Song Festival. Lorraine had so inspired Elly Ameling, the famed singer that she brought her to tears. Hearing of this, Dalton sought out Lorraine saying, "...inspire me to tears also". This was the beginning of a life-long companionship both working and traveling together for over 30 years, while developing Master Classes in Nice, France and around the world.
In addition to his beloved Lorraine, Dalton is survived by his sister Martha Baldwin Nelson, nephews and niece Gordon M. Nelson II, Mark B. Nelson and Jenny K. Nelson Scarborough. Dalton was predeceased by his sister Anne Baldwin Kurtosi as well as his parents Dalton Graf Baldwin and Helen Cahill Baldwin.
A memorial service will be held on Sunday, January 19, 2020, at 1:00 PM at the Island Heights United Methodist Church, 111 Ocean Ave, Island Heights.

The Treasury Department’s inspector general is looking into the opportunity zone program following stories by ProPublica and The New York Times about how the tax break meant to help the poor had been manipulated by billionaires.
The development, which was first reported by NBC News, comes after three congressional Democrats wrote to Treasury’s inspector general in October asking for the probe and citing the ProPublica and Times stories.
“We are conducting an inquiry, and expect to complete our work and respond to the Congressional requesters in early spring,” Deputy Inspector General Richard Delmar said in a statement.
The opportunity zone program, passed as part of the 2017 Trump tax overhaul, offers tax breaks to investors who put money into specially designated areas. While it was pitched as a way to help struggling neighborhoods, ProPublica and others have documented how the process has appeared to benefit billionaires with investments in areas that should not have qualified. In other cases, governors have granted the tax break to their political donors and, in some cases, themselves or their families.
Sen. Cory Booker, an architect of the program, along with Reps. Emanuel Cleaver and Ron Kind, asked the inspector general to do a “complete review” of areas picked for the opportunity zone tax break to see if they were truly eligible. The October letter also asked the inspector general to collect all correspondence between Treasury, White House officials and outside interests about the process.
The inspector general said that once the inquiry is complete it plans to publicly post its response to the congressional Democrats.

Texto completo: The Pentagon has revealed that 11 U.S. service members received treatment for concussions from an Iranian missile strike on Jan. 8.
The New York Times reported on Monday that U.S. soldiers were treated for concussions after the attack. The Pentagon confirmed the report Thursday evening and said nearly a dozen troops were medevaced to Germany this week for treatment, according to Defense One.
Tehran launched ballistic missiles at two Iraqi military bases were U.S. soldiers were stationed on Jan. 8. During the attack, an Iranian missile struck a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 passengers and flight crew on board.
After the attack, President Trump and administration officials said that no U.S. or Iraqi soldiers had died in the attack or suffered severe injuries.
"Most importantly, [there were] no casualties, no friendly causalities, whether they are U.S., coalition, contractor, etc.," senior administration military officials told reporters on Jan. 8.
On Jan. 16, a U.S. military spokesman said, "As previously stated, while no U.S. service members were killed in the Jan. 8 Iranian attack on Al Asad air base, several were treated for concussion symptoms from the blast and are still being assessed."
Iran launched the Jan. 8 attack in retaliation for a Jan. 2 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Trump ordered the strike to kill Soleimani after Soleimani orchestrated a violent protest that damaged the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

Gowdy: Comey refused to tell Congress about Russian intelligence document in classified setting

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey refused to tell Congress in a classified setting about a dubious Russian intelligence document, according to a lawmaker who was in attendance.
Trey Gowdy, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina who left Congress one year ago, said Comey claimed the information was "so highly classified" that he could not discuss it in setting in which he was authorized to discuss classified material.
This "fact pattern," Gowdy said, is the focus of a New York Times report published Thursday evening that said federal prosecutors are investigating a years-old leak to reporters in 2017 about the document that factored into Comey's handling of the FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server.
"I know that fact pattern that is referenced in this story," Gowdy said on Fox News, where he is a contributor. "Jim Comey was asked behind closed doors in a classified setting to address it, and he would not do it. His response was [that] it was so highly classified, he was not even going to tell people that were cleared to hear it in a classified setting."
Gowdy was responding to Martha MacCallum, who asked about how the New York Times report suggested there was a political motivation behind the Justice Department's decision to open an investigation years after the leaks took place.
"I’m not a fan of Jim Comey, but I am a fan of being fair to people. And I’m not going to indict him or convict him based on New York Times reporting," Gowdy said. "My experience with him on this very fact pattern, the subject of the article, he would not address it even in a setting where he could do so. And it would have benefited him to do so, and he still did not do it."

Shamira Ibrahim has exposed the Left's Meghan McCain problem

Texto completo: Meghan McCain is a Never Trump Republican in the truest sense of the term. She's long despised President Trump, his attacks on the late Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, and his protectionist politics, but she's still as much a conservative as her late father. She's both an heir to the legacy of a Republican Party that prioritizes peace through strength abroad and limited government at home and socially progressive, a Republican who's as pro-life and pro-gun as she is pro-gay and pro-woman.
In short, she's the ideal talking head for liberals who want to hear a conservative perspective, but without the lies and crassness bordering on bigotry that has subsumed much of the Trump base.
I mention all of this to clarify why the Left cannot hide its malice for McCain — not because she's the wrong kind of Never Trump Republican, but because they don't want to hear from a Republican at all.
To be abundantly clear, not all or even most of those left-of-center wish to shut down discourse in the way the virulent dregs of the Left do. But you wouldn't know it if you read the voices platformed by the media.
The latest entry in the smear campaign orchestrated against McCain comes from Shamira Ibrahim, a "culture writer" and "reporter" published at the New York Times. Ibrahim lambastes McCain— "the privileged product of conservative nepotism, capitalism and the American military-industrial complex" — for crimes such as "using her platform to push back against assault weapons bans" and "accusing her co-hosts of supporting infanticide." (In the segment in question, McCain challenges co-host Sunny Hostin for refusing to support Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse's bill to protect babies born alive during a botched abortion.)
Ultimately, Ibrahim takes McCain to task for the sin of ... well, being routinely berated at the bottom of progressive pile ons, which she claims "reinforces her base with a narrative of the long-suffering victim of censorship."
"Every combative segment is immediately countered by a claim that it’s all just a harmless debate among friends, making the ostensibly organic on-air confrontations feel all the more performative, no matter how genuine the sentiment," Ibrahim writes. "This 'agree to disagree' stance is frustrating, and lies in stark contrast with the current political moment, when many are skeptical of the idea of civil discourse and who it is meant to benefit."
Right there, Ibrahim exposes the lie to the Left's ire toward McCain. They don't want to hear from any conservative, ever, no matter how socially libertarian or anti-Trump she is. They are totalitarians who cannot stand the idea that anyone out there disagrees with them — especially people who fail to fit the media mold of the straight-white-male conservative, redneck strawman.
To her credit, Ibrahim confessed on Twitter that her real beef with McCain is just a beef with conservatives' existence.Tweet
The View, a notorious cesspool of abuse and bullying media leaks, would suffer badly if it ever lost McCain. Without her, they wouldn't just lose any and all ideological diversity at their desk, but also their single best interviewer. Only McCain had the moral clarity to corner since-ousted Women's March co-President Tamika Mallory and challenge her anti-Semitism. Only McCain had the stones to challenge Pamela Anderson's devotion to Julian Assange, a Putin-worshipping cyberterrorist. Only McCain had the chutzpah to make Michael Bloomberg answer for the Democratic Party's failure to condemn anti-Semitism. Only McCain had the journalistic chops to make Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren finally concede that yes, Qassem Soleimani was indeed a terrorist.
As for illiberal leftists such as Ibrahim, when they want McCain replaced by Ana Navarro, it's because they don't want to hear any conservative voice. They just want someone to blindly bash Trump without offering a modicum of conservative commentary.

It's the institutions, stupid

Texto completo: Yuval Levin, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the editor of the journal National Affairs, is not only one of the most thoughtful policy intellectuals on the Right but, at a time when plenty of people across the spectrum have lost their cool, one of the most sober. His fifth book, A Time to Build, hits shelves on Jan. 21. It is among the many recent attempts to explain what, exactly, has gone wrong with politics over the past decade. Its answer, in a word, is “institutions.”
Institutions are everywhere, but they are surprisingly tricky things to define. What characteristics unite the family, a prelegal building block of society, with a corporate entity such as a university? Levin describes institutions as “the durable forms of our common life,” or “the frameworks and structures of what we do together.” The word “form” is important — for Levin, institutions are forms in the deep, Aristotelian sense of the word: The “shape of the whole” that “speaks of [the whole’s] purpose, its logic, its function, and its meaning.” Institutions stand over and above their members, molding them to fit roles and imbuing them with institutional values. A doctor, for instance, gives up part of his individuality in order to fulfill his professional responsibilities (an emergency room is not the place for self-expression). Ideally, he also internalizes the institutional mission of his profession: Do no harm.
In Levin’s view, the main problem with politics today is that our institutions are “deformed” — they are no longer “molds,” willing and able to shape their members in accordance with whatever higher goal they serve. Instead, they have become “platforms,” which “allow people to be themselves and to display themselves before a wider world.” In a mold, the individual serves the institution; in a platform, the individual uses the institution to serve him- or herself.
Books3_012120.jpg
If this all sounds fatally abstract, consider the transformation of the New York Times of 20 years ago into the New York Times of today. Prior to the advent of social media, journalists had to build prestige and respect within the newspaper in order to advance their careers, which required them to abide by the standards of the paper and the wider journalistic profession. Those standards have not exactly vanished today, but it is far easier now for writers for the New York Times to build a following outside of the institution, reducing their incentive to dilute their own personal brands (or compromise their own beliefs) in order to conform. Revealing your own political beliefs on Twitter may frustrate editors who want your reporting to appear neutral, but for you, it may be the quickest way to build an audience or land a higher-paying job at some other outlet. The downside is that as the public loses faith in an institution’s ability to mold its members, it also loses faith in the institution. Why should I trust the New York Times’s reporting if I know it’s done by the same people I see saying foolish things on Twitter all day? (Of course, the same point applies to all publications, not just the New York Times.)
Levin argues that a version of this dynamic is playing out in essentially every major institution in American life, from Congress to the universities to journalism to the legal profession, with the result that public faith in our institutions is collapsing across the board. And if he is somewhat fuzzy as to what caused this change, citing post-Watergate transparency reforms in the case of Congress and the rise of the internet and social media in the case of journalism, his basic diagnosis rings true.
As to what can be done about our institutions, Levin is modest, almost to a fault. He suggests that we can “only really break the cycle [of institutional degradation] by consciously changing our attitudes about the institutions we are a part of, and by reforming those institutions to better form us.” It’s good advice, but throughout the book, Levin puts considerably more emphasis on the attitude-changing than on the reforming, the possible contours of which are left blank. That’s too bad, since the institutional deformations he describes are the result not of bad attitudes but bad incentives, to which no one is fully immune. How to fix those incentives would seem to be the first question that any would-be reformer should answer, and Levin leaves the reader wondering what his own answer might be.
Park MacDougald is Life and Arts editor of the Washington Examiner magazine.

Texto completo: I’ve never read Little Women. Raised as a male, I was given a set of rigidly gendered directives: Never cry; keep a bullfrog under your coonskin cap at all times; if you must read, read something manly and improving, such as Ragged Dick or The Years of Lyndon Johnson.
Well, that was then. Having spent 681 minutes watching every Little Women movie I could get my hands on — 681 minutes in the company of the March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, festooned with kittens, surfeited with punch and pickled limes, and pleading softly for relief — I’m reformed.
Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, the latest in a century of adaptations of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel about four sisters in Civil War-era Massachusetts, has already become a culture-war conversation piece. New York Times critic Janet Maslin tweeted that she’d “been told by 3 male friends who usually trust me that they either refuse to see [Little Women] or probably won’t have time.” The news that some men didn’t see their filmgoing choices as subject to the dictates of feminist allyship was upsetting to a certain section of Twitter, and it launched a long and tedious discussion in America’s culture pages about what sorts of stories men will consume and admire.
Yet men really should pay to see this film. Any source material, no matter how treacly it seems, can come throbbingly alive in the right hands. I had struggled through the 1933 (directed by George Cukor), 1994 (directed by Gillian Armstrong), and 2017 (BBC) versions of Little Women. Not even such sublime beauties as Katharine Hepburn, Winona Ryder, or Maya Hawke (a replica of her mother, Uma Thurman) could salve my boredom, though I did relish Claire Danes’s ugly-crying, deathbed turn as Beth. And even I was entranced by Gerwig’s film.
Gerwig’s Little Women succeeds not for the reasons offered by its feminist champions: by illuminating the ostensibly dull domestic concerns neglected by pop culture or by offering a model for future generations of independent girls. It triumphs for the old-fashioned reason that it’s a flawlessly written, acted, and shot film, a sensory feast so toothsome that you’d never share it with the poor Hummels down the lane.
The film’s challenge to March family newcomers is that it’s told out of sequence, with the action alternating between 1868 and 1861. It opens in ’68 with Jo (Saoirse Ronan), the headstrong protagonist of the novel, submitting herself and her manuscript to the scrutiny of a magazine editor, Mr. Dashwood (Tracy Letts, who plays Ronan’s father in Gerwig’s 2017 Lady Bird). Advancing past his paternalistic skepticism, she sells her first story, and we see her, in gender-fluid attire, racing against a black tide of behatted, mustachioed men through the streets of old New York City.
This film is about the writer’s life, down to details such as Jo’s ink-spotted hands and her anxiety while Mr. Dashwood judges her work. In one priceless scene, a German professor, Friedrich Bhaer, critiques Jo’s work with "who, me?" condescension: “I thought you wanted honesty. Has no one ever talked to you like this before?” (Louis Garrel as Bhaer looks more like a broke, dissipated young adjunct than like the respectable, aged academic of every other adaptation.) We see Jo shaking out a hand cramp while writing, Jo covering her floor with a grid of loose pages — these are superb illustrations of the dreaded Writing Process.
In Gerwig’s hands, domestic life in 1861 is anything but tedious. It is loud, frenetic, and kaleidoscopically colorful. In many scenes featuring all four sisters, lines are fired off one after another, giving the dialogue a hypnotic, antiphonic quality. There’s plenty of dancing, stamping, leaping about, hugging, air fencing, mock and real fighting; the full-tilt physicality of Jo and Laurie (Timothee Chalamet) projects youth and energy like nothing I’ve seen in years. The film is filled with patterned wallpaper, fantastic costumes, and elaborate arrangements of food or flowers. Florence Pugh, who plays Amy, is back in the psychedelically floral mise en scène of 2019’s horror movie Midsommar, minus the nightmares.
Gerwig’s versatile cast carries off both comedy and tragedy with subtlety and grace. Mr. Laurence (Chris Cooper) slumped on his staircase, squeezing his fist as he fights back tears at the memory of his dead daughter, is unforgettable, as is Jo's and Beth’s (Eliza Scanlen) seaside reckoning with mortality. Such moments of throat-clenching sadness are offset by, say, Laurie’s drunken outburst at a ball or his cluelessly insulting Meg (Emma Watson) for wearing a dress he dismisses as “fuss and feathers.” This adaptation features by far the funniest delivery of the famous line, “Your one beauty!”, as Jo takes off her bonnet to reveal that, having sold most of her hair, she now resembles Rosemary’s Baby-era Mia Farrow.
Gerwig resists feminist sermonizing beyond what’s there in her source material. Her audience is already aware that marriage is an economic proposition and that “women have minds and souls as well as just hearts.” Her Little Women is about girls, but not only girls. It’s about the evanescence and fragility of youth. It’s about ambitions and dreams in full, arrogant bloom (“The world will never forget Jo March!”) before some of them, at least, wither on the vine.
It’s a reminder that possibilities aren’t endless. It’s a reminder that one’s choices, including the choice to be stubborn or have a grandiose sense of self “too noble to curb, too lofty to bend," have consequences.
“Life is too short,” Jo says, “to be angry at one’s sisters.” But life isn’t short at all. Childhood is. If youth-obsessed Hollywood and the death-fearing public find Little Women hard to savor, don’t blame it on sexism. With its painfully grown-up knowledge of what aging means, it’s anything but a children’s movie.

Texto completo: Joe Scarborough took aim at liberals after a New York Times opinion writer said ABC's The View had "a Meghan McCain problem."
"The Left owns most of American popular culture. And yet the existence of one moderately conservative woman poses a threat to civil discourse. Good Lord. What a joke," the MSNBC host said Thursday on Twitter. "The Left kissed up to John McCain every time he spoke truth to Trump but can’t handle his daughter speaking her own mind when it doesn’t fit neatly into a progressive world view? Open your mind."
TweetTweet
Shamira Ibrahim, a culture writer, wrote an article for the New York Times, where she called the conservative host "the privileged product of conservative nepotism, capitalism and the American military-industrial complex."
McCain, 35, responded to Ibrahim by saying it showed the New York Times despises conservatives. "@nytimes⁩ - everyone already knows how much you despise red state, pro life, pro #2A conservative women, and wish we would all just go away," she said.
Tweet
The daughter of former Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain is the only conservative on The View. She frequently finds herself in intense policy disagreements with her more liberal fellow hosts.
Scarborough defended McCain, despite leaving the Republican party over two years ago. Both television hosts are staunch critics of President Trump.

Texto completo: Indicted businessman Lev Parnas said he did not speak directly with President Trump about a pressure campaign against Ukraine that sought to benefit Trump politically, despite earlier reports to the contrary.
Last November, CNN reported that Parnas told close associates he had spoken to Trump. "At one point during the party that night, Parnas and Fruman slipped out of a large reception room packed with hundreds of Trump donors to have a private meeting with the President and Giuliani, according to two acquaintances in whom Parnas confided right after the meeting," CNN wrote.
"Eventually, according to what Parnas told his confidants, the topic turned to Ukraine that night," the article continued. "According to those two confidants, Parnas said that 'the big guy,' as he sometimes referred to the President in conversation, talked about tasking him and Fruman with what Parnas described as 'a secret mission' to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter."
The New York Times told a different story Wednesday, reporting: "Mr. Parnas said that although he did not speak with Mr. Trump about the efforts, he met with the president on several occasions and was told by Mr. Giuliani that Mr. Trump was kept in the loop."
Parnas's decision to go public has led to congressional Democrats demanding that he and other key players in the pressure campaign be called to testify in next week's Senate impeachment trial.

Iran blinks

Texto completo: After the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s military and terrorist mastermind, Iranian leaders vowed to retaliate against the United States. And they did, firing 16 missiles at two bases housing American troops in Iraq. No U.S. soldiers were killed, though several missiles came close. But an Iranian official said his country had not sought American casualties. It looked like Iran had blinked in its latest confrontation with the U.S.
Meanwhile, President Trump announced toughened sanctions against Iran, whose economy had already been devastated by earlier sanctions. Iran also got bad news from Britain, France, and Germany, which threatened sanctions of their own unless Iran stopped violating the 2015 nuclear deal.

There’s an unavoidable conclusion in all of this: advantage Trump, Iran’s chief foe. The president’s critics had been surprised by two of his actions. The first was what the president called the elimination of “the world’s top terrorist.” He followed that by changing his strategy. He advocated “a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place.” Rather than war, he called for a halt to the U.S.-Iran conflict and said he wants Iranians to “thrive and prosper.”

Is a deal possible? Trump has asked for negotiations with Iran before. Iran wasn’t interested. But Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is desperate to avoid an all-out war with America. It would be a fight Iran couldn’t win and one in which the regime would likely be removed or destroyed.

Trump is a special problem for Iran’s leaders. He sounded warlike when he tweeted about attacking Iran’s cultural sites, but he talked like a peacemaker in his speech after the Iranian missile assault. Iranians are bound to be confused. And Trump likes it that way. As early as the 2016 campaign, he said he wouldn’t, as president, want to signal to America’s enemies what he might do next.
There is a way for the U.S. and Iran to meet and talk seriously and very privately, according to Robert Satloff, the executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He posed this question in the Washington Post: “What if U.S. officials took advantage of the moment to ask a trusted third party — say, the Omanis or the Swiss — to test whether Tehran’s leaders were ready for a quiet diplomatic initiative to achieve what the White House has long said was the objective of its ‘maximum pressure’ campaign: a better, broader agreement with Iran than the narrow nuclear deal the administration quit in 2018?”

An earlier episode in which Iran blinked “may be instructive,” Satloff wrote. In 1988, an American warship accidentally shot down an Iranian airliner, killing 290. Fearing the U.S. was on the verge of fully supporting Iraq in its war with Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini agreed to a painful ceasefire.

Now, Iran needs the U.S. to lift its economic sanctions and pledge not to use military force or threaten the regime’s survival. To get this, “the price will be a broader agreement than the 2015 nuclear deal … to include verifiable restrictions on Iran’s missile program and its training, funding and arming of proxies, terrorist groups and Shiite militias,” Satloff wrote.

Neither the media nor Democrats are likely to hasten such a deal. They’ve adopted the narrative that Trump recklessly ordered the killing of Soleimani, risking a full-blown, bloody U.S.-Iran war. The New York Times reported that Pentagon officials were “flabbergasted” when Trump decided to take out Soleimani and has referred to his “approach to Iran” as “mercurial.”

But two events may have a more positive influence: 1) the missile attack on military bases without American deaths and 2) Iran’s decision not to turn over the task of attacking Americans in Iraq to proxies.

Retired Gen. Jack Keane, whose advice is taken seriously by Trump, has the best explanation of why there were no U.S. casualties. The retaliatory attacks on the two bases were designed, by the choice of particular missiles, to make casualties as unlikely as possible. The Iranians knew that casualties “would produce an overwhelming American response,” Keane told me.

And “they knew they were dealing with a different president,” Keane said. Killing one American had prompted a strong response. Had even a handful of soldiers died in the missile attacks on the two bases, the blowback ordered by Trump would likely have been far more furious and fatal.

Meghan McCain rips New York Times over opinion piece saying she’s a ‘problem’ on The View

Texto completo: Meghan McCain trashed the New York Times over an opinion article calling for her to be removed from The View.
Shamira Ibrahim, a culture reporter, claimed that The View “has a Meghan McCain problem.” Ibrahim called McCain “exhausting,” adding, “The problem is, with Ms. McCain still on the show, there’s not much to enjoy.”
Ibrahim’s editorial follows two weeks of questions circulating McCain’s role on the show. Her co-host, Abby Huntsman, announced that she was leaving the show to run her father’s campaign in Utah, but many have reported that she wanted to escape the show’s hostility. McCain also had a viral spat with Whoopi Goldberg after the longtime host told her, “Girl, please stop talking.” McCain even took a personal break from the show after feuding with her co-hosts last week.
McCain pushed back on Ibrahim’s editorial, despite her rough few weeks on the show. She tweeted, “Everyone already knows how much you despise red state, pro-life, pro #2A conservative women, and wish we would all just go away.”
Tweet
Megyn Kelly also came to McCain's defense, tweeting, "The hatred for conservative women by the 'woke' is ever apparent and totally undermining to their demands that ppl take them seriously. So empathetic ... unless you don’t think exactly as they do."
Tweet
Ibrahim’s post noted that there is a Change.org petition to give McCain the boot from the show. The petition calls for McCain to be replaced by Ana Navarro, a regular guest host on the show who also markets herself as conservative. While some may not like McCain, she has been a key part of the show’s rebirth since Barbara Walters left the program, including an increase in viewership. Even the New York Times called The View the “most important political TV show in America” in May and cited McCain for playing a “large part in the show’s recent relevance.”

Does a candidate appeal to suburban moms (Gwyneth Paltrow), techies (Elon Musk), or climate activists (Jane Fonda)? I have a hunch that the most predictable celebrities support the most predictable candidates — of course, John Legend and Chrissy Teigen are all in for Elizabeth Warren — but the endorsements of other candidates hint that they might actually have an appeal that extends beyond Hollywood elites. Read on to discover who does this best.
Joe Biden
Joe Biden suffers from a general lack of celebrity endorsements, but he has received the stamp of approval from a couple of other old, white guys: All in the Family actor Rob Reiner and Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin.
Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, have donated to Biden. George Takei, known for playing Mr. Sulu in the original Star Trek series, has also donated. Last spring, however, Takei pleaded with fellow Democrats not to speak ill of any candidate. That sounds like the kind of thing you’d have to say if you supported Biden.
Michael Bloomberg
Judge Judy became Bloomberg’s first celebrity endorsement just this month. “No one comes close to Mike Bloomberg's executive achievement, government experience, and impactful philanthropy,” she said. “His steady leadership will unite our country and bring us through these very challenging times.” In other words, the judge is just ready for a nanny state.
Pete Buttigieg
Pete Buttigieg has a strangely high number of celebrity endorsements for a guy from Indiana. They include Jenna Fischer, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, and Mandy Moore. He’s received donations from Gwyneth Paltrow, Ellen DeGeneres, Jennifer Aniston, and Ryan Reynolds, who also donated to Warren.
MacFarlane said he’s all in for Buttigieg because “whether he wins this round or not, it’s likely this guy will be President one day.”
Amy Klobuchar
Jane Fonda, actress and oft-arrested climate activist, has donated to both Klobuchar and Warren. The Minnesota senator doesn't have a lot of love from celebrities, but then again, she is polling no higher than 4%.
Bernie Sanders
For a crotchety old man, Bernie Sanders sure knows how to attract "the youths." The Bernie Bros now include Cardi B, the rapper who really hates taxes and big government and has political aspirations of her own. The Vermont senator has also received donations from actress Shailene Woodley and support from model Emily Ratajkowski.
Then, there’s the endorsement of crotchety old man Danny DeVito. Actor John Cusack supports Sanders because he “will not lie.” Singer Jason Mraz endorsed Sanders even though he’s “tired of seeing old white guys in the White House” because “we need someone to keep draining the swamp.” By expanding it to the rest of the United States, apparently.
Actor and Sanders fan Danny Glover told the New York Times that he’s not sure how much influence celebrities have. “I honestly don’t know, but I don’t abdicate my responsibility as a citizen because I make movies and people like to go to my movies,” he said. “And there are other people supporting him I know — Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon — we can’t wait to get together and campaign for Bernie.”
Elizabeth Warren
Elizabeth Warren is not just the favorite candidate of the liberal media. Turns out, she’s got a crowd of celebrity fans, too. These include vocal anti-Trump couple John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, Rosie O'Donnell, Jonathan Van Ness of Queer Eye, Roxanne Gay, and, apparently, the Elle magazine editorial board. Actress Scarlett Johansson also endorsed the Massachusetts senator, which makes sense, considering they have both pretended to be someone else.
Andrew Yang
Nicolas Cage would steal the Declaration of Independence for Andrew Yang. Okay, that’s a joke, but the actor’s support for Yang is not. Cage, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo, Generation Z heartthrob Noah Centineo, and tech entrepreneur Sam Altman have all donated to Yang, according to the presidential candidate. Yang even has the support of Elon Musk and Donald Glover, a.k.a. Childish Gambino.
As the Washington Examiner previously reported, the list goes on:
In recent weeks, the Yang campaign announced support from actor Steven Yuen of The Walking Dead, Golden Globe-winning actress Teri Hatcher of Desperate Housewives, actor Dane DeHaan of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, comedian Ken Jeong of Community and The Hangover, and director and screenwriter James Gunn of Guardians of the Galaxy and Dawn of the Dead.
Yang’s most interesting celebrity endorsement has to be the nonpolitically correct Dave Chappelle. The comedian will be campaigning for Yang in South Carolina.
Andrew Yang’s celebrity endorsements span various industries, ages, genders, ethnicities, and plenty of other relevant demographics. He has broad appeal, but it’s too bad that it’s still so small. As for the winner of the best celebrity endorsements, Dave Chappelle was right on this one: “I'm Yang Gang.”

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg said that he was not familiar with internet jokes calling him "Mayo Pete" and lightened the conversation with some of his opinions about the condiment.
"Do I want to know?" the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor and Democratic presidential candidate said in an interview when asked how he counters "Mayo Pete" memes.
Teenagers and younger voters have taken digs at Buttigieg by calling him "Mayo Pete," a reference that accuses him of being bland and highlights the white candidate's struggle to earn support from minority voters. Some videos on Twitter and Tik Tok parodying Buttigieg supporters performing a choreographed dance to High Hopes by Panic! at the Disco closed with "Mayo Pete."
"I get the white part," Buttigieg said.

[Opinion: Pete Buttigieg and the black vote: two things Democrats aren't allowed to say]
Buttigieg, 37, brushed off assertions that his policy proposals are not transformative enough.
"There will always be some folks who say, 'It’s not real,'" he said. "'Healthcare reform isn’t real unless you obliterate the entire private industry. College isn’t real unless even the child of a billionaire can go without paying a penny in tuition. The climate change thing doesn’t count unless it’s trillions more dollars than it is.' And that’s just not how I measured the bigness of an idea."
Later in the interview, Buttigieg discussed his decision to come out as gay and a New York Times editorial board member remarked that it makes him "less mayo."
"Hopefully it’s at least a better flavor. I don’t know," Buttigieg said. "I actually hate flavored mayo — they do this avocado stuff now and it — because I only use mayo when I’m making tuna salad. And I want it as straightforward as possible."
When asked what he would be most likely to fail at as president, Buttigieg quipped that he was "tempted to go with a condiment reference, but I’m going to behave."
Instead, he turned the conversation back to the disparity between conversations on social media and conversation he has on the ground with voters.
"I would not be surprised if it continues to be the case that doing what I view to be the right thing as president is not just politically costly in general but may cost me the hearts and minds of those who are disproportionately represented online," Buttigieg said.
"I just might get canceled," he added.

DOJ investigating leaks on Russian document that influenced how Comey handled Clinton emails

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey appears to be the subject of another leak investigation.
Federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., are investigating a years-old leak to the media about a dubious Russian intelligence document that factored into Comey's handling of the FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server, according to a New York Times report on Thursday.
Two reports in the spring of 2017, one from the New York Times and the Washington Post, are under scrutiny by law enforcement officials. Prosecutors are looking into Daniel Richman, Comey's friend and adviser, who leaked the FBI chief's notes about his private conversations with President Trump in 2017 after Comey was fired.
The document, obtained by hackers working for Dutch intelligence officials and provided to the FBI, included what appeared to be an email between Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was the Democratic National Committee chairwoman at the time, and Leonard Benardo, an official with George Soros's Open Society Foundations, in which the former suggested that then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch would ensure Clinton would not be prosecuted for her use of a private email server to conduct government business.
Comey, concerned that Russia could leak the document if Lynch played a leading role in deciding whether to charge Clinton, held a news conference in July 2016 and stated the FBI recommended charges not be pressed against Clinton.
Both Wasserman Schultz and Benardo have denied being in contact, raising the prospect that the document was fake.
In his memoir, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, Comey said "unverified" information discovered by the U.S. government in 2016 from a classified source "would undoubtedly have been used by political opponents to cast serious doubt on the attorney general’s independence in connection with the Clinton investigation."
Also weighing on his mind he held the press conference, according to Comey, was how Lynch asked him to call the investigation a "matter" and the controversial June 27, 2016 tarmac meeting Lynch had with Bill Clinton.
In an April 2018 statement responding to Comey's book, Lynch denied ever coordinating with Democrats on a message for the emails investigation and, in a not-too-subtle jab at Comey, said she "followed the Department’s long-standing policy of neither confirming nor denying the fact of an ongoing investigation."
Comey stirred controversy again when he announced to Congress the FBI was reopening the Clinton emails investigation less than two weeks before the 2016 election. He again closed the investigation, citing no changes in the FBI's view on the matter, a couple days before the Nov. 8 election, but Clinton and her allies have long blamed the optics of what Comey did for contributing to her loss to candidate Donald Trump.
In a report released last fall, Comey was harshly criticized by the Justice Department inspector general for violating FBI policy for his efforts to disclose his notes memorializing his conversations with Trump without authorization in the hopes of sparking a special counsel investigation. He was criminally referred to the Justice Department for his conduct, but the agency declined to prosecute.
The new investigation into the leak of classified information began in recent months, but it is not clear whether prosecutors have impaneled a grand jury or how many witnesses have been interviewed.
Lawyers for Comey and Richman declined to comment. The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington and the Justice Department did not immediately return the Washington Examiner's request for comment.

Daily on Healthcare: The drugged driving conundrum

THE DRUGGED DRIVING CONUNDRUM: States are struggling with how to prevent people from getting stoned and then getting behind the wheel.
Though there are conflicting studies over whether the legalization of marijuana in states leads to more traffic accidents, one of the big themes during a House subcommittee hearing on cannabis Wednesday was that lawmakers wanted to strike the right balance between relaxing rules on marijuana without also introducing a slew of other public health problems.
One of those problems is the possibility of impaired driving. It’s a tough one to handle because police officers don’t have a similar test for marijuana-impaired driving as they do for alcohol. Plus, there isn’t a consistent amount of THC, the high-inducing chemical in marijuana, for every product that’s out there, whether joints, vapes, edibles, or even when taken medicinally.
“It has a very long halflife and it accumulates in the fatty tissues in our body,” Dr. Nora Volkow, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said of marijuana during the hearing. Someone can get high and then drive hours later after they’re no longer intoxicated, but high levels of THC will still show up during a drug test. In fact, THC will show up in a urine test a month after someone has smoked weed.
That means that the tests we have now can tell that someone had marijuana within the past month, but it’s indistinguishable from whether they even smoked during the past day. The tests can’t actually tell whether a person is currently under the influence of marijuana, which makes it harder for police officers to enforce rules against driving high. In contrast, alcohol blood levels indicate how much someone has had to drink and then levels decline as that person gets sober.
Some companies are working on finding better ways to detect marijuana. Startup Hound Labs in California, for example, said that their breathalyzers under development are able to show whether someone used marijuana in the past three hours.
But for now, law enforcement officers are left with a lot of imprecision. All states criminalize driving while under the influence of drugs, but to different extents. "Per se" laws, for example, specify that people must have a certain level of THC in their blood, and other laws focus on making sure the driver is actually impaired at that time by reporting poor driving or slurred speech.

HHS PROPOSES REPEAL OF OBAMA-ERA REFERRAL RULE: The Department of Health and Human Services posted a proposed rule Thursday that would no longer obligate religious organizations who get grants from the department to refer people elsewhere for services they won’t provide. “By compelling religious organizations, but not secular organizations, to post special notices and make referrals, the alternative-provider requirements placed burdens unequally on religious organizations and cast unwarranted suspicion on them. By singling out religious organizations for unique regulatory burdens, the requirements infringed the organizations’ religious liberty rights,” HHS wrote.
CMS REJECTS WYOMING MEDICAID WAIVER: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services denied a waiver application that would have allowed all air Wyoming ambulance travel — done by helicopter — to be paid for by Medicaid, regardless of whether the people airlifted had private health insurance. The proposal was meant to limit surprise medical bills, which are common following air ambulance rides, but CMS said the plan wasn’t budget-neutral and that “using the Medicaid administrative structure to provide services to other individuals in the state as a mechanism to avoid the application of federal aviation law is a clear departure from the core, historical mission of the Medicaid program to provide health coverage to the Medicaid-eligible population.” Air ambulance providers and hospitals in the state opposed the waiver.
Meanwhile, federal efforts on air ambulances are underway: The first advisory committee meeting for Health and Human Services and Transportation officials took place on Wednesday and is continuing into Thursday. The group will be recommending ways to improve the disclosure of charges and fees from air ambulances
AHIP WANTS SCOTUS TO TAKE UP OBAMACARE: America’s Health Insurance Plans, which represents insurers, wants the Supreme Court to take up Obamacare, but didn't take a position on timing. In a brief filed Wednesday, AHIP urged the justices to uphold the healthcare law and wrote that a delay on hearing the case would deny them “much needed clarity.”
SURGEON GENERAL IS THE LATEST FED TO OBJECT TO SUPERVISED INJECTION SITES: Surgeon General Jerome Adams said at a Cato Institute event Wednesday that needle exchanges were a better answer to solving the opioid epidemic and reducing infectious diseases than the use of supervised injection sites: "I'm not bashing any particular person or group ... but the truth is, I have looked at the data, and I have seen little to no data suggesting they are overall more effective than expanding syringe services programs."
BLOOMBERG VOWS TO OUTLAW E-CIGARETTES: Michael Bloomberg has vowed to ban flavored e-cigarettes and to lower the amount of nicotine in tobacco products so they'll be less addictive. “Today one in four high school students are addicted to vaping and it’s a brand new thing. It’s so bad,” he said on “The View” Wednesday. Bloomberg criticized President Trump’s approach to vaping. Trump initially proposed stricter regulations on the industry, but then pulled back by allowing menthol and tobacco flavors to stay on the market. Bloomberg said: “The Trump administration, bowing to pressure from the tobacco industry as well as political pressure, has broken its promise to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from the market.”
FLORIDA SENATE BILL WOULD REQUIRE PARENTAL CONSENT FOR ABORTIONS: Kelli Stargel, a Republican, introduced a Senate bill that would require minors seeking an abortion to get parental consent first, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Florida law already requires minors to notify parents that they will undergo an abortion. Stargel’s bill has support from Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said in his State of the State address: “I hope that the Legislature will send me this session the parental consent bill that last year was passed by the House but not by the Senate.” Last year, the bill passed in the House by a vote of 69-44, largely along party lines, but stalled in the more moderate Senate. Stargel herself was a teen mom and said the bill is meant to “strengthen” families.
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN ACKNOWLEDGES ALCOHOLISM AFTER ‘SERIOUS’ FALL: Arizona Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick, 69, acknowledged that her alcohol dependence was the cause of a recent fall, which has prompted her to seek treatment. Kirkpatrick has served in Congress three times – first in 2009, then for two terms from 2013 to 2017. She lost in 2016 to Sen. John McCain but recently won her seat in 2018. She said her office will be “fully operational” while she is in treatment. "My positions on all recorded votes will be submitted to the Congressional Record and made publicly available," she said.

Texto completo: We’ve spent a remarkable amount of time this week discussing whether there’s sexism in politics.
Hahahahaha
OK, no need to be cynical. Let’s look on the positive side first. If you are around Elizabeth Warren’s age of 70, you’ve had the incredible luck to live through a period of history in which American women’s rights and opportunities have been transformed. There are still people alive who were born when women couldn’t vote. Now we’ve got Nancy Pelosi giving a herd of male leaders their marching orders in Congress.
This doesn’t mean all the battles are won. We’ve got only nine female governors, and a lot of people of both sexes really don’t believe the country will elect any female president.
How you look at this depends a lot on why you think Hillary Clinton lost. Yes, she did get 2.8 million more votes than Donald Trump. But we can’t spend the day bewailing the existence of the Electoral College.
Back to the question. Why do you think she lost?
“Sexism.”
“Failure to campaign in Wisconsin.”
“She won! She won! She won! She ——”
Sorry about that sharp elbow, but I told you we weren’t going there. Next you’re going to be moaning about Al Gore.
“Al Gore won!”
That’s it. Unless you have a special interest in the election of Benjamin Harrison.
“Grover Cleveland was robbed!”
You understand we need to move on here, right? Personally, I’ve always suspected that Clinton lost — to the degree that she lost — not so much because of her gender as because people just wanted a change. She’d been a starring player in two eight-year administrations. It was pretty clear what we were going to get in another Clinton presidency, and it wasn’t going to be anything dramatically new.
(This is what happens when you get a little bit bored with life and decide you want to juice things up. You spend $50,000 on a new sports car and then drive it into a restaurant takeout window. Or far worse, you elect Donald Trump.)
The whole can-a-woman-be-president issue came up during this week’s debate. Warren had one of her best moments when she pointed out that the male candidates with whom she shared the stage had collectively lost 10 elections, while the women hadn’t lost a single one.
And besides, she added, she was the only person onstage who had defeated an incumbent Republican in the past 30 years. Bernie Sanders — who contributed seven of those losses — quickly volunteered that he had beaten a Republican incumbent in 1990. Which Warren, despite her career as a primary-school teacher, claimed was not within the past 30 years.
Joe Biden didn’t point out that he beat a Republican incumbent to win his Senate seat in 1972. This is worth mentioning since some people worry that one of the Democrats’ leading candidates seems to kind of be living in the past.
About Joe Biden. This is his third run for president. Who among us could forget 2008, when he came in fifth in Iowa and dropped out? Or 1988, when he — OK, you did forget 1988. Totally understand.
Biden hasn’t had any super disasters in the debates. Well, there was the time in October when he said: “I would eliminate the capital gains tax — I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate, of 39.5%.” And that time in November when he spoke out against violence against women, adding that “we have to just change the culture ... and keep punching at it and punching at it.” Details, details.
This last performance was pretty clean and Biden got fairly good reviews, many of which boiled down to how he’d gotten through the evening “without taking major damage.”
Can we all agree that no female candidate could ever get away with stuff like that and then win praise for not saying anything stranger?
When it comes to gender bias, in the past Biden agreed that Clinton faced it to an “unfair” degree. Then he added, “That’s not going to happen with me.”
His campaign later claimed that his statement did not, um, mean what it sort of sounded like it meant.
So, about sexism in politics. Absolutely there, especially at the highest levels. But dissolving rapidly in places where women are proving what terrific vote-getters they are. We have 26 women in the Senate now — nearly half the all-of-American-history total. Seventeen are Democrats.
This little detail gives us an opportunity to recall the days when the Republican Party was progressive enough to have serious arguments about whether a woman could win the presidency. Remember the glorious Sen. Margaret Chase Smith? She ran for the nomination in 1964, when she was 66. A columnist for the Los Angeles Times argued that she was too old and added that when women hit the ideal age for running in their late 40s or early 50s, they are utterly unfit for office, since they are undergoing the “physical changes and emotional distress” of menopause.
So you have to admit things have been getting better. For women, that is. We’ve still got Donald Trump. Sorry, nation.

Texto completo: Washington • Congress on Thursday gave final approval to President Donald Trump’s revised North American Free Trade Agreement, handing the president his second trade victory of the week as House lawmakers prepared to read aloud charges of high crimes and misdemeanors on the Senate floor.
The 89-10 vote in the Senate on implementing legislation for the revised United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will send the measure to Trump, who is expected to sign it next week.
The bipartisan vote in support of the trade deal offered a striking contrast to the other big congressional initiative underway: Trump’s impeachment trial.
Within an hour of senators approving the measure, the seven impeachment managers were set to begin the ceremonial process of presenting the impeachment articles on the Senate floor.
The unusual show of bipartisan agreement came just one day after Trump signed a long-awaited trade deal with China, giving the president two trade wins in a single week.
Yet the lasting legacy of his presidency may be the competing narrative of a president who has achieved big economic wins while facing accusations of misdeeds while in office. Voters will now have to choose between a president who has lived up to his populist campaign promises to rip up and replace old trade deals with one who is accused of pressuring Ukraine by withholding financial aid to boost his reelection campaign.
While USMCA sailed through both the House and Senate, its approval was far from guaranteed a year ago, when Trump initially signed an agreement with Mexico and Canada.
A core group of House Democrats, in communication with their Senate counterparts, spent months negotiating new language that ultimately strengthened labor, environmental, pharmaceutical and enforcement provisions. The length of those negotiations pushed the House vote to December, less than 24 hours after the chamber voted to impeach Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Lawmakers initially suggested that a Senate vote on the pact would be delayed until after the trial, which will begin in earnest Tuesday and in effect halt all legislative work in the Senate. But when Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California decided to delay sending the articles of impeachment to the upper chamber, senators seized the opportunity to start the procedural maneuvers for the trade pact.
“Our farmers and ranchers expect us to move on this,” Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a prominent advocate for the deal’s passage, said at a news conference Tuesday.
“Folks back home, they don’t care what’s going on in this bubble surrounding impeachment. They just simply want to know: Are we doing the work that’s important to them?” she said.
Within nine days, six Senate committees had given the implementing legislation seals of approval, allowing for the vote to occur Thursday morning before the impeachment trial formally began.
“Undaunted by those who set to throw him out of office since day one, President Trump forges ahead for the good of the American people,” Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said. “Passage of USMCA is better late than never.”
The bipartisan support for the deal came at a moment when partisan politics have stymied most legislative efforts. In part because of the Democratic stamp on the pact’s terms, Democrats joined Republicans in voting for the deal — including opponents of the original NAFTA and others typically adverse to trade pacts.
“I never thought I’d be voting for a trade agreement during my Senate tenure that I wrote a big part of,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who cast his first vote for a trade agreement in a quarter-century after labor enforcement language that he and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., crafted was included in the final agreement.
In 1993, NAFTA passed the Senate on a 61-38 vote, and the deal has since been criticized by lawmakers across Capitol Hill for enabling the flow of U.S. jobs to Mexico. A substantial part of the new agreement is dedicated to updating that original text and adding revised guidelines for food safety, e-commerce and online data flows as well as anti-corruption provisions.
But there are significant changes in the deal negotiated by Trump’s trade staff and Democrats, including higher thresholds for how much of a car must be made in North America in order to avoid tariffs. It rolls back a special system of arbitration for corporations that has drawn bipartisan condemnation, and also includes additional provisions designed to help identify and prevent labor violations, particularly in Mexico.
Support from a number of prominent labor voices, including the AFL-CIO’s first endorsement of a trade agreement in 18 years, helped firm up the support of Democrats like Brown, Wyden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The most ardent Republican critic of the deal was Sen. Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania, who Wednesday railed against it as “a badly flawed agreement, an agreement that restricts trade rather than expanding trade.” A majority of Democratic opposition was rooted in the deal’s lack of climate change provisions, with Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Chuck Schumer of New York among those voting against the pact.
“When it comes to climate change, the agreement still contains many of the same flaws of the original NAFTA, which I voted against,” Schumer said in a statement Thursday.
Harris has expressed similar concerns, saying in a statement earlier this week that “by not addressing climate change, the USMCA fails to meet the crises of this moment.”

Watchdog says Trump administration broke law in withholding Ukraine aid

Texto completo: Washington • The Trump administration violated the law in withholding security assistance aid to Ukraine, a nonpartisan federal watchdog agency said on Thursday, weighing in on a decision by President Donald Trump that is at the heart of the impeachment case against him.
The Government Accountability Office said the White House’s Office of Management and Budget violated the Impoundment Control Act when it withheld nearly $400 million for “a policy reason,” even though the funds had been allocated by Congress. The decision was directed by the president himself, and during the House impeachment inquiry, administration officials testified that they had raised concerns about its legality to no avail.
“Faithful execution of the law does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,” the GAO wrote. “The withholding was not a programmatic delay.”
The impoundment law limits a president’s power to withhold money that has been allocated by Congress, requiring that he secure approval by the legislative branch if he wishes to do so.
The White House budget office promptly rejected the report’s conclusions.
“We disagree with GAO’s opinion,” said Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the budget office. “OMB uses its apportionment authority to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the president’s priorities and with the law.”
[ Read more: Shades of Ukraine’s withheld aid? Sen. Mitt Romney, others question why money for Lebanon was delayed. ]
The report, on its own, does not result in any action, although its release just as Trump’s impeachment trial is getting underway is certain to fuel additional questions about the impact of his actions.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a vocal critic of Trump’s decision to block the funds, on Thursday called the GAO report a “bombshell legal opinion.” It “demonstrates, without a doubt, that the Trump Administration illegally withheld assistance from Ukraine and the public evidence shows that the president himself ordered this illegal act,” he wrote on Twitter.

Thomas L. Friedman: Trump’s code of dishonor

Texto completo: Iran’s Qassem Soleimani was an engine of mayhem in the Middle East. His business model was to go to Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq and recruit Arab Shiites to kill Arab Sunnis (and Americans and Israelis) and to create pro-Iranian statelets inside Iran’s Arab neighbors to weaken them from the inside. I followed this man closely. No one should mourn his passing.
So why do I still question the wisdom of his assassination? Because it was done without a clear strategic or moral framework. And the biggest lesson I learned from covering the U.S. interventions in Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan is: When administrations are not constantly forced to answer hard questions from the outside about what they’re thinking strategically and morally — when questioners are dismissed as unpatriotic — the administrations’ inside thinking gets sloppy, their intelligence gets manipulated and trouble follows.
Never assume that people who are in charge know what they are doing just because they are in charge.
What is President Donald Trump’s strategic framework? One day, without any consultation with allies or our commanders, he ordered U.S. troops out of Syria, where they were serving as a critical block on Iran’s ability to build a land bridge to Lebanon and were a key source of intelligence. In the process, he abandoned our most important allies in fighting ISIS: the Syrian Kurds, who were also creating an island of decency in their region, where islands of decency are the most we can hope for.
And then, a few weeks later, Trump ordered the killing of Soleimani, an action that required him to shift more troops into the region and tell Iraqis that we’re not leaving their territory, even though their Parliament voted to evict us. It also prompted Iran to restart its nuclear weapons program, which could well necessitate U.S. military action.
But it also may have set in motion forces of popular discontent in Iran that will further delegitimize the regime — a good thing. So what’s our priority: take advantage of Iran’s weakened regime to secure a better nuclear deal or urge its people to topple it? And how will we react if the regime mows down Iranians we’ve encouraged to rise? Not clear at all.
But Trump also has no moral framework. He ordered the killing of Soleimani — a depraved Iranian warrior — just a few weeks after he gave a moral pass to a depraved U.S. warrior.
How so? Guess who the Trumps had over to Mar-a-Lago during the Christmas holidays — and who they didn’t invite? They welcomed Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher and his wife. During the summer, Gallagher was tried in a military court on war crimes. A member of his platoon told investigators, “You could tell he was perfectly OK with killing anybody that was moving.”
That assessment was published by The Times a few days after the Trumps warmly received the Gallaghers. It was part of a trove of leaked combat video, text messages and confidential interviews with members of SEAL Team 7 that revealed in chilling detail why Gallagher, their platoon commander, had been on trial for his actions in Iraq.
Here is how The Times described some of Gallagher’s military exploits in 2017: His unit had captured and wounded a young ISIS fighter — “a scraggly teenager in a tank top with limbs so thin that his watch slid easily off his wrist.” They sedated him and performed an emergency procedure to help him breathe.
“Then, without warning, according to colleagues, Chief Gallagher pulled a small hunting knife from a sheath and stabbed the sedated captive in the neck.” Gallagher “later posed for a photograph holding the dead captive up by the hair” and shared the deer-kill photo with others.
Gallagher was eventually turned in for this and other incidents by his fellow SEALs. He was charged with 10 offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
Weeks after Gallagher stabbed the ISIS captive, according to an Associated Press report in June from his trial, two SEALs testified that he “gunned down a young girl and an old man in Iraq in 2017 from his sniper’s perch, though neither witnessed him pulling the trigger. The SEALs said shots came from the tower where Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher was posted and they watched through their scopes as the civilians fell to the ground.”
“Dalton Tolbert,” AP continued, “said he and another sniper were in a neighboring tower in Mosul, on June 18, 2017, and had fired warning shots to scatter civilians by the Tigris River because the Islamic State was operating in the area. An old man in a white tunic began running and then Tolbert heard a third shot come from the neighboring tower where Gallagher was positioned and saw the man fall. Over the radio, he heard Gallagher say: ‘You guys missed him, but I got him.’”
The article also reported: “Another witness, Joshua Vriens, said on another day that he saw Gallagher shoot at a group of adolescent girls in floral hijabs, hitting one in the stomach and sending two scattering. Vriens said he watched through his scope as a fourth girl dragged the wounded girl over a berm and under a bridge to escape.”
Gallagher’s defense got him acquitted because no witness reported seeing him actually pull the trigger in those incidents and because, as The Times reported, a medic testified that he watched Gallagher stab the prisoner in the neck, “but that the stab wound did not appear to be life-threatening” and that afterward the medic pressed his thumb over the captive’s breathing tube until he died.
Furious Navy prosecutors said the medic never suggested in six interviews that he had suffocated the captive. “They said he changed his story after receiving the grant of immunity,” The Times wrote.
The Navy still demoted Gallagher for posing with the dead captive. That was until some Gallagher pals and Fox News got Trump to reverse the punishment, restore his rank — and block the Navy from upholding its moral code by stripping Gallagher of his Trident pin, signifying his membership in the elite SEALs.
For Trump, the idea that in war or diplomacy there would be an ethical code that we’d impose on ourselves is an utterly alien concept. Trump has never lived by any code in any context — not in real estate and not as president.
Codes are for suckers and sissies in Trump’s view. He thinks that what makes American soldiers great is that they’re killers. And his view is let killers be killers. And anyway, for Trump, if an Iraqi girl wearing a hijab got shot by accident, who cares, they’re all scum anyway.
As Andrew Sullivan put it in an essay on this subject in New York magazine last week: “A president who believes a war criminal is among the finest fighters the U.S. has and suggests he will pardon him after his trial is, quite simply, unique in the history of the U.S.”
But Gallagher’s SEAL teammates, by calling him out, said that what makes our military unique and respected is that we operate by a code and that code operates even in the most heated of firefights. That code is our moral framework under pressure, and by holding each other to it we keep our unit and our country strong.
That’s why they blew the whistle. But Trump hates whistleblowers who take seriously their oath to defend the Constitution. That’s why the same president who invited the cowardly Gallagher and his wife to Mar-a-Lago — not the heroic SEALs who had the courage and integrity to step forward to defend their code, our code — was the same president who used the cowardly Rudy Giuliani to secretly push out the high-integrity U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who had the courage to defend our code in diplomacy and try to prevent the spread of corruption in Kyiv.
Why does it all matter, you ask? Ask the family of the next American soldier captured by terrorists after his captors declare, “We’re going to do to your soldier just what Trump excused Gallagher for doing to one of ours.”

Texto completo: Would a female Democratic nominee have a harder time beating Donald Trump than a male one?
I can’t tell you, because I don’t have a crystal ball and because it’s a stupid question, its answer dependent on which female candidate you’re talking about, on how she runs her campaign, on the twists and turns of the national conversation between now and November.
But I can tell you this: Either of the two women among the six candidates on the stage in Des Moines on Tuesday night would give Trump a serious run for his money. Both have earned the right to take him on. Both would be formidable presidents.
And both made clear, with commanding performances, how absurd it is that this country hasn’t yet shattered the highest glass ceiling of all.
I’m focusing on Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar because during the most electric stretch of this seventh debate of the Democratic primary, the focus was indeed on them — or, rather, on the idea that their party couldn’t risk nominating one of them at a juncture when getting rid of a Republican incumbent has seldom, if ever, been so important.
You know the back story. According to media reports over recent days, Warren and Bernie Sanders met 13 months ago to discuss their nascent presidential campaigns and he told her he didn’t believe a woman could win the 2020 election. Sanders denies saying that.
He denied it again on Tuesday night, and Warren declined to get into a back-and-forth about that conversation. What she did instead was more effective — and certainly more stirring: She drew a contrast between the two women and the four men who had made the cut for this debate, which was the final one before the Iowa caucuses and had the fewest candidates so far.
That contrast was perfect, and got better still when Klobuchar chimed in, because what the two women said brilliantly cast them not as trailblazers who had something extra to prove, not as outsiders who had finagled a way in, not as underdogs urging voters to take some extraordinary leap of faith, not as high-minded gambles. They turned the stubborn, sexist notion that their presence and presidential ambitions were exotic on its head, citing yardsticks by which they were demonstrably superior to their male rivals.
“I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people’s winning record,” Warren, a second-term senator from Massachusetts, said. “Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections.” She didn’t name the men or the elections, but Joe Biden is the veteran of two previous, miserably unsuccessful campaigns for the presidency. Pete Buttigieg lost bids to become the treasurer of Indiana and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In contrast, Warren noted, “The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are the women — Amy and me. And the only person who has beaten an incumbent Republican any time in the past 30 years is me.”
Klobuchar, a third-term senator from Minnesota, said you don’t need to be male to win just as you don’t need other qualities pronounced necessary or optimal by some unnamed, amorphous committee of pronouncers. “You don’t have to be the skinniest person in the room,” she said. “You don’t have to be the loudest person. You have to be competent.”
“And when you look at what I have done,” she added, “I have won every race, every place, every time. I have won in the reddest of districts. I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas.” That, she added, was why she had “the most endorsements of current Iowa legislators and former Iowa legislators in this race.”
I don’t mean to romanticize Warren and Klobuchar. Warren’s boast about vanquishing a Republican incumbent? That incumbent was Scott Brown, whose victory in a special election in deep blue Massachusetts was considered something of a freak occurrence to begin with.
And when Klobuchar began to tick off the names of women recently elected to high posts, she suddenly froze, unable to remember who the governor of Kansas was, though she’d just said, “I’m very proud to know her.” (Her name is Laura Kelly.)
I’m also not saying that Warren or Klobuchar would be the party’s best bet. I don’t know who would be. I’m just saying that on a night when the viability of women aiming for the White House went from subtext to text, these two women found words — not just in addressing that issue but also in talking about prescription-drug prices, climate change, nuclear weapons and more — that exposed the bigotry and shamefulness of doubts about female candidates.
Otherwise the seventh debate was sleepily like many of the first six: Biden seemed to be campaigning for a third Barack Obama term, and his sentences were less straight lines than knots. They didn’t build toward a conclusion so much as sag until they finally gave out. Warren said “corruption” every chance she got. Sanders called for revolution and correctly emphasized that many trade and foreign-policy positions that other Democrats came around to he embraced from the start.
Buttigieg pivoted from the question at hand to a practiced soliloquy that almost always had something to do with turning the page and a new generation. Tom Steyer insisted that no one cared about the environment as much as he did. And Klobuchar talked about so many different pieces of legislation with her name on them that you had this image of her racing around the Capitol with an outstretched pen, stopping all aides who passed by and scrawling her signature on any paper they were carrying.
One new wrinkle was Warren’s clear and proud positioning of herself to Sanders’ right on trade and on health care. She was making the case for herself as a progressive who would favor incremental fixes if those were the only available improvements and who could be a unifier; she suggested that Sanders lacked that potential. Buttigieg, meanwhile, was more determined than ever to mention and reach out to voters of color, from whom he enjoys little support.
But what most distinguished the debate was the way in which gender came to the fore.
There was a memorable moment when Sanders sought to correct Warren on her 30-year claim, noting that he’d defeated a Republican in 1990, and she did some quick, out-loud arithmetic to determine that 1990 was, well, 30 years ago! Mansplaining met mathematics.
Warren also said this: “Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have outperformed men candidates in competitive races. And in 2018, we took back the House; we took back statehouses, because of women candidates and women voters.”
“Back in the 1960s,” she added, “people asked, ‘Could a Catholic win?’ Back in 2008, people asked if an African-American could win. In both times the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate and we changed America. That’s who we are.”
It was a self-serving edit of history, sure, and it put the most positive gloss possible on the nation’s character. But that didn’t make it any less important. Or any less inspiring.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.

We were on the way to ballet rehearsal. It’s my favorite 30 minutes of the day. It’s a chance to break away from work, and to touch base with my only child. She’s 14 now. And it won’t be long before she’s driving herself. I treasure these moments.
“So,” I asked her. “How was school today?”
“We were arguing about whether we’re more likely to die from World War III or climate change,” she said.
Her response stopped me cold, but I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised.
With the dogs of war straining at the leash, the missiles flying in Iran, and our bellicose and unstable commander-in-chief lurching from one scarcely believable justification to the next, the prospect of another American forever war on the other side of the globe didn’t seem all that far-fetched.
First up, I disabused her of the notion that any of her classmates might be drafted, reassuring her that there was no such movement afoot on Capitol Hill. Nor would there likely ever be one. The American military remains an all-volunteer force comprised not of the nation’s elite, but of the sons and daughters of Main Street America. Trump’s voters. Some of my daughter’s classmates — if they ever heed the call to serve — may well be among them.
She seemed relieved at that news. Talking to her about the threat of climate change was another matter entirely.
it seemed to me there were decades remaining before the Earth might ever be rendered uninhabitable because of climate change, I offered. Which didn’t mean that we shouldn’t do all we can right now, I added.
“But Australia is burning,” she countered, her brown eyes wide with alarm, anger creeping into the edges of her voice.
She had me there. I’d seen the photos of scorched koalas and dead kangaroos. The endless walls of flame. It’s difficult to find the words to describe the scale, and the scope, of the ecological and human catastrophe that’s unfolding on the other side of the world.
As of this writing, NPR was reporting that a hellish “megafire” comprising an unfathomable 1.5 million acres, an area three times larger than any known brush fire in California, had taken shape in New South Wales and Victoria, the country’s most populous states.
That’s on top of the 135 bushfires in southeastern Australia that have left at least 26 people dead, killed more than 1 billion animals and damaged or destroyed nearly 3,000 homes.
Writing in The New York Times, columnist Paul Krugman observed that, in a more rational time, the fires, which have been partially a result of climate change, “would have represented a turning point.”
“After all, it’s exactly the kind of catastrophe climate scientists long warned us to expect if we didn’t take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions,” he wrote. “In fact, a 2008 report commissioned by the Australian government predicted that global warming would cause the nation’s fire seasons to begin earlier, end later, and be more intense — starting around 2020.”
And all this got me to thinking about the world that we’re bequeathing to my daughter and her classmates.
While much is better about the planet, there’s still much to be concerned about. And the threat of an uninhabitable globe should lead us to a united search for solutions, not juvenile taunts hurled at a teenager by one of the most powerful people on Earth. Even one dead child in an elementary school classroom should motivate us to find ways to reduce violence, not watch hopelessly as more bodies pile up.
I’m still firm in my belief that it’s not too late for us to shrug off all that divides us, and to work together to fight these existential threats.

Texto completo: PARIS — Oxford Hills Technical School Junior Culiandra Nero has been an artist for most of her formative years. And a competitive one too, as she is one of seven high school students to win The New York Times’ Learning Network cartoon contest. The contest had 850 submissions from around the country.
<img class="wp-image-13995774 size-large" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/Nero1-0120-1024x861.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="861" />
“Our teacher posts different contests on our online classroom,” said Nero. We can choose whether to enter and then work on it on our own time. She is always available to give advice and that kind of thing. I had some free time after school so I decided to do it.”
The theme of the contest was to draw a cartoon based on news events occurring last October. Nero chose the impact that the political situation in Hong Kong had on the National Basketball League in the U.S., specifically to show the irony of NBA player LeBron James’ statements about Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey’s support for Hong Kong protesters. It includes a depiction of China’s Xi Jinping as Winnie the Pooh.
The cartoon can be viewed along with the other six winners and honorable mention/runner-up submissions at: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/02/learning/editorial-cartoon-contest-2019.html.
Nero also recently submitted work in another contest, the Scholastic Arts & Writing competition, and is waiting to hear results. Last year she won a silver award in that competition and was runner-up in Maine’s Congressional Arts Competition.
The next challenge for Nero is a local one, at Oxford Hills Technical School’s Annual Tech Challenge on January 21, where she will showcase her advertising designs. In 2019 Nero did well enough at the Tech Challenge to compete at the state level and represent Maine at the national competition.
Art has always flowed from Nero’s fingers.
“I started drawing when I was small,” she said. “I’ve always like creating, and art was the most accessible outlet for me.”
Nero joined the Gifted and Talented Program at Paris Elementary School when she was in the fourth grade. Once she reached Oxford Hills Middle Schools she continued her craft, joining the Art Club.
She is currently in her second year of Oxford Hills Technical School’s graphic design program and plans to major in art in college. Besides illustration, Nero also works with photography and typography.
<img class="wp-image-13995834 size-large" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/Nero2-0120-1024x791.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="791" />
The big benefit to the accolades Nero is collecting now will be listing them on her college applications. She is looking at east coast schools with top quality art programs, like the Rhode Island School of Design or Ringling College of Art & Design in Florida.
“But I’ve been encouraged to consider schools in California too,” Nero said.
In the future Nero would like to forge a career in illustration, either as a storyboard or concept artist. Studying on the west coast matches her goals to work in the entertainment industry.
“Culiandra is super talented,” said teacher Virgina Valdez. “And no matter what I ask of her, she is always on top of it.”

Trump brushes off Parnas claims as Senate impeachment trial begins

Texto completo: President Donald Trump said Thursday that he did not know Lev Parnas, an indicted business associate of Rudy Giuliani who claims the President knew all about Giuliani's efforts to oust the U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine, as well as behind the scenes work to get Ukraine to announce investigations related to Joe Biden, in order to help Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election bid.
"I don't know him. I don't know Parnas," the President said a number of times to reporters at the White House.
"I don't know him at all. Don't know what he's about," Mr. Trump added.
But in interviews with MSNBC, CNN, and the New York Times, Parnas has said the President is not telling the truth about his efforts to put pressure on the leader of Ukraine.

"He's lying." Lev Parnas, Rudy Giuliani's associate who stands at the center of the impeachment inquiry, says about President Trump's claim that that they have never met.https://t.co/qLwZHVZuBB pic.twitter.com/cI0DCQUK3N
— New Day (@NewDay) January 16, 2020
Documents and electronic messages provided by Parnas to the House Intelligence Committee in recent days included a letter that Rudy Giuliani wrote in May 2019, asking for a meeting with the newly-elected Ukraine President, in which Giuliani said he was 'private counsel to President Donald J. Trump.'
"I don't know anything about the letter," President Trump said, praising Giuliani's time as mayor but not addressing what he did for Trump in Ukraine with Parnas and others.
Also denying any knowledge of Parnas's claims was Vice President Mike Pence.
"I don’t know the guy," Pence told reporters during a visit to Florida on Thursday, as the Vice President said the claim by Parnas that Pence knew about pressure being put on the Ukraine leader was 'completely false.'
Democrats used those denials to question why Pence's office has refused to declassify further impeachment answers from a State Department official detailed to his office.

If the Vice President believes all of the witnesses who testified before the House contradict Mr. Parnas, why won’t he let the public see the supplemental testimony of his own staffer, Jennifer Williams?
There is no reason it should be classified. Release it, Mr. Vice President. https://t.co/tfQ7uIHOdG

Some Democrats have raised the possibility of asking to hear testimony from Parnas in the Trump impeachment trial, though any request for witness testimony must get a majority of Senators.
As of now, most Republicans remain hotly opposed to any new witnesses, arguing the Senate should not have to find evidence which the House did not uncover.
"That's not our job," said Sen. David Perdue (R-GA). "Our job is to look at what they brought us and decide if that rises to the level of impeachment."
Perdue was part of the ceremonial first day of the Senate impeachment trial - just the third time a President has faced such a challenge in U.S. history.

Después de muerto, siguen las denuncias contra Jeffrey Epstein por tráfico sexual de menores de NY a Islas Vírgenes

Texto completo: El millonario Jeffrey Epstein abusó sexualmente de niñas y realizó tráficos sexuales con menores como víctimas durante años en islas del Caribe de su propiedad, según una demanda judicial anunciada por la fiscal general de las Islas Vírgenes estadounidenses , Denis N George.
Epstein murió por suicidio el pasado mes de agosto cuando se encontraba detenido en una cárcel de Nueva York tras ser imputado por delitos sexuales similares: en concreto, por crear una red de tráfico sexual de menores y abusar de decenas de ellas entre 2002 y 2005. La nueva acusación amplía ahora el alcance de las acciones delictivas de las que es sospechoso.
George dijo este miércoles a los reporteros que Epstein estableció una “compleja red” corporativa en las Islas Vírgenes estadounidenses a través de la cual “llevó a cabo y ocultó conductas criminales” con niñas tan pequeñas como de “13 años de edad”.
La actividad delictiva de Epstein en este territorio no incorporado de Estados Unidos se produjo durante casi dos décadas, al menos hasta 2018, señala la Fiscalía. Epstein utilizó un círculo de asociados para traficar con niñas y mujeres, muchas de ellas latinoamericanas a las que captaba al prometerles un futuro como modelos y movía con visas fraudulentas. Así mismo, usaba bases de datos para rastrear su disponibilidad y proximidad.
La demanda agrega que los asociados de Epstein participaron y ocultaron sus actividades ilícitas a cambio de dinero y actos sexuales de las jóvenes víctimas.
“La denuncia habla por sí misma”, comentó George. Por ello, las autoridades buscan “una rendición de cuentas”, agregó.
El millonario utilizó supuestamente para sus tráficos y abusos su isla privada en este archipiélago, llamada Little Saint James Island, que compró en 1998 y donde construyó una mansión.
En 2016, el millonario adquirió también la Great Saint James Island, ubicada cerca de la primera. Presuntamente también la utilizó para su red criminal, ya que, según George, le sirvió para la “expansión de su actividad criminal y el encubrimiento de lo que ocurría en Little St. James, y claramente es un ejemplo de cómo Epstein y sus socios frecuentemente violaban las leyes”.
En un episodio detallado en la demanda, aunque sin fecha, se habla de una menor que intentó huir a nado de la isla de Epstein tras ser obligada a participar en actos sexuales con él y otros. La niña fue interceptada y mantenida cautiva en la isla después de que el millonario confiscó su pasaporte, según la demanda.
Demanda contra el patrimonio
La nueva demanda, que agrega que Epstein también realizó proyectos de construcción ilegales en Gran Saint James, se presentó por la vía civil contra el patrimonio del millonario y otras seis entidades. Busca confiscar cientos de millones de dólares de las pertenencias del magnate en las Islas Vírgenes, incluidas las dos islas privadas, valoradas en 86 millones de dólares.
El gobierno de las Islas Vírgenes estadounidenses podría utilizar los activos confiscados del patrimonio de Epstein para indemnizar a sus víctimas apunta The New York Times.
Los administradores del patrimonio de Epstein, que tenía 66 años cuando murió, no hicieron comentarios sobre las acusaciones principales, según NBC News.
Antes de su muerte, el millonario y su abogado negaron las acusaciones que se le atribuyeron al detenerlo y encarcelarlo en Nueva York, cargos referidos a delitos supuestamente cometidos en esa ciudad y en Florida y que le podrían haber costado hasta 45 años de prisión.
Sobre las circustancia de su suicidio se desarrollan actualmente algunas investigaciones federales.

Texto completo: T aos quilt-maker Emily Zopf died Thursday (Jan. 9) at 4 p.m. It was the 37th anniversary of her marriage to Bob Bresnahan, a founder of Renewable Taos and a trustee at Kit Carson Electric. Bresnahan said they had a very happy marriage.
"A Celebration of the Life and Art of Emily Zopf" is planned Friday through Monday (Jan. 17-20) at the Stables Gallery of the Taos Center for the Arts, 133 Paseo del Pueblo Norte. As part of the celebration, a memorial will take place Saturday (Jan. 18) from 3-5 p.m.
Zopf was frugal and an extraordinary conservationist, Bresnahan said. They built furniture and a timber frame house together. They were both protectors of the environment and lived a low carbon lifestyle complete with solar panels that powered their home and their Tesla EV.
Zopf loved the outdoors and she and Bresnahan walked in the mountains every day until she was overcome by the cancer that she fought for three years.
She was a laboratory scientist and she talked with her husband, a former business consultant, about lab processes, quality assurance and computer systems nearly every day she worked at Holy Cross, Bresnahan said.
When they married Bresnahan said they vowed that they would never go to bed angry. They kept that vow and always resolved the inevitable conflicts in a marriage with a hug, a kiss, and an expression of their love for each other before getting in bed each night.
Each morning beginning in 1998, when Bob retired from his last job at Nike, they did The New York Times crossword puzzle together. While Bob is no slouch, he noted, Emily was much better at all kinds of puzzles. She was a straight A student in high school, college and graduate school. She was valedictorian of her high school and of her class at the laboratory science program at Oregon Health and Science University.
Tempo asked Bresnahan about Zopf's quilts and what went into making them.
What first attracted Emily to quilt-making?
Emily was born to make quilts. Her mother, Dorothy Zopf, was the author of "Surviving the Winter: The Evolution of Quilt-making in New Mexico," a Southwest Book Award-winning book on quilt-makers in New Mexico. Dorothy belonged to many quilt groups in Taos including one she organized that met for many years at the Martinez Hacienda each Friday. Dorothy was a high school art teacher in Yellow Springs, Ohio, the home of Antioch College. Unlike Dorothy's bed quilts, all Emily's art quilts were designed to be hung on walls like paintings.
Can you tell us about the imagery? Where does it come from?
Emily was inspired by everything from landscapes to the marble floor in the Pisa Cathedral. She created several quilts patterned on brick walls she photographed in Seattle and Portland. Her most outstanding quilt was titled "Nisqually" and was based on the Nisqually River delta where the Nisqually flows into Puget Sound just north of Olympia Washington. She modeled another quilt on the side of Queen Anne Hill in Seattle above Lake Union.
The quilt was based on photos taken during azalea and rhododendron season. Many of these quilts were featured in juried shows and appeared in various books on art quilts. "Nisqaully" hangs in a home in the Sea Ranch in Northern California. Another quilt hangs in the faculty lounge at the University of Washington. Her brick and stone quilts were shown at the American Craft Museum's Young Artist Show in New York. Most of the quilts in this show are part of my collection and hang in our home in Tienditas, a little beyond Valle Escondido in the mountains east of Taos.
We know that quilts are often created using scraps of cloth from many sources. Can you tell us what goes into Emily's work?
Emily experimented with commercial fabrics but could not achieve the effect she wanted. So she bought plain colored fabric and fashioned hand stamps with string, stone or cork to create the natural effects that she was looking for. She would dip the stamps in paint, often using three different patterns and colors to stamp a long piece of fabric.
Then, she would cut the fabric into pieces and assemble them on a wall lined with felt fabric. Once she achieved the effect she was looking for she would take the pieces down in order and put them together on a sewing machine. Many of the quilts look quite abstract but they bear a startling resemblance to the landscapes they were based on.
How long did it take Emily to start and finish a quilt?
Emily worked on "Nisqually," her masterpiece, for six months. It started with walks through the delta. Then came photos in different seasons. Then a set of stamps that capture different aspects of the delta vegetation and seascape. Then she would print strips of fabric with several stamps and colors, then arrange them all on a felt-covered wall; then she would piece them all together on a sewing machine - then designing the back and adding the quilting between the pieced front and the back, and finally quilting the surface, which is a delicate and risky process since it can either enhance or nearly destroy the overall effect she tried to reach.
After a few finishing details the quilt is ready to hang and display. A standard-sized hand-printed quilt typically took two months when all the inspiration and design work is included.
When were the quilts in the show created?
Emily was one of the founders of the Contemporary Quilt Guild in Seattle. Many of her quilts were made in a fabric design studio at the University of Washington. Others were made in her home studios in Olympia and Portland Oregon. All were made in the 1990s.
The exhibit of the artist's collection will be on view Friday from 4-7 p.m. and Saturday through Monday from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m. For more information, call the venue at (575) 758-2052.

Museum scandal has Kenney rethinking

Texto completo: MAYOR Jim Kenney, who holds an ex officio position on the board of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, on Wednesday called for the institution to revamp its personnel policies after the scandal involving its former assistant director of interpretation Joshua R. Helmer.
Kenney made his wishes known in a statement responding to an Inquirer request for comment in the matter. He, however, declined to address specifics on how the museum handled the case, which was first reported Friday by the New York Times.
Kenney spokesperson Deana Gamble said, "The [Kenney] Administration did express to PMA leadership that it should review and strengthen its policies regarding anti-fraternization and sexual harassment, and require training for all staff."
The mayor takes such issues "very seriously," Gamble said.
The Times reported that Helmer had entered into relationships with subordinate female museum staffers while dangling possibilities for professional advancement. He worked at the Art Museum from 2013 to 2018 and then became executive director of the Erie Art Museum.
On Monday, the Erie museum posted a notice on its Facebook page that Helmer, 31, is "no longer employed" there.
Helmer declined to talk with the Times about his relationships. "That's personal information," he told the newspaper. "You keep your personal life private."
The Art Museum has not commented on the matter publicly, except in a written statement by director and CEO Timothy Rub. "We will be engaging outside consultants to conduct a close review of our workplace environment, our policies and programs, including training activities so we understand how we can be better in the future," the statement said.
Hundreds of current and former staffers of the museum have signed a statement standing in solidarity with the women who spoke out and calling for structural change.
Gamble said the city "was made aware of the matter shortly before the New York Times published the article. The mayor is not familiar with the specific circumstances of the accusations to comment on how PMA handled the case."
As part of their elected positions, Kenney and City Council President Darrell L. Clarke are ex officio board members for the museum. PMA's art and operations are overseen by a private nonprofit, but the museum occupies city-owned buildings.
Clarke was unaware of the complaints against Helmer until the story published, spokesperson Joe Grace said. "We'll be looking very carefully at this situation and this matter moving forward."

U.S.-China trade deal welcomed in state

Texto completo: Farmers and agricultural businesses in Minnesota applauded the trade deal President Donald Trump signed Wednesday with China, but many said they hoped he would open trade further with the world's second-largest economy.
"It's positive. It's moving in the right direction," said Bill Gordon, a farmer near Worthington, Minn., and leader in the American Soybean Association who attended the signing ceremony.
"This is what we needed, we needed to get in the same room and talk," he added. "Now we've signed the deal. Now we need to implement it."
With it, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He took a step to calm a trade war that began in the steel industry in the spring of 2018 and spread across many others.
China committed in the deal to purchasing an additional $200 billion in U.S. goods and services by 2021. Of that, China will import about $12 billion in agriculture products this year and another roughly $20 billion next year.
China is also expected to ease, but not eliminate, some tariffs it has placed on U.S. goods when it retaliated to barriers on steel imposed by the U.S.
The U.S. will maintain the bulk of its $360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. And Washington may take other steps if Beijing does not
follow through on the terms of the deal.
"Today we take a momentous step, one that has never been taken before with China, toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade with China," Trump said at the White House ceremony. "Together we are righting the wrongs of the past."
The pact marks a shift in U.S. trade policy. Rather than lowering tariffs and other economic barriers to allow for the flow of goods and services to meet market demand, the deal leaves tariffs in place and stipulates that China buy $200 billion worth of specific products within two years. Instead of trying to change China's approach, the agreement leans into it by requiring Beijing to buy set amounts of certain goods and services.
Agriculture leaders in Minnesota Wednesday were cautiously optimistic, but they expressed discomfort with the policy shift.
Restoring market signals to trade with China should be a priority, said John Griffith, senior vice president of global grain marketing and renewable fuels for Inver Grove Heights-based CHS Inc.
"The agricultural targets in the agreement are a significant shift upward, and that is a positive for agriculture," Griffith said in a statement. "I'm hopeful execution against those targets can be done in the most market-based approach possible to provide appropriate signals to farmers, the market and ag supply chain."
Mike Steenhoek, director of the Iowa-based Soy Transportation Council, said the deal "provides farmers some optimism" but warned that a one-off does little for U.S. farmers, and the future predictability of Chinese soybean purchases is "essential" to the trade relationship.
"Many of us will be particularly attentive to not just expected volumes of soybeans and agricultural products to be exported to China, but, just as important, the predictability and reliability of those volumes," Steenhoek said in a statement.
The deal does not resolve structural issues surrounding China's approach, such as its pattern of subsidizing and supporting key industries that compete with U.S. firms, like solar and steel. U.S. businesses blame those economic practices for allowing cheap Chinese goods to flood the U.S. market, putting domestic firms out of business.
Instead, like the presidents who preceded him, Trump plans to rely on allies and the World Trade Organization to try and push China to change its ways.
The agreement also fails to address cybersecurity and China's tight controls over how companies handle data and cloud computing. China rejected U.S. demands to include promises to refrain from hacking U.S. firms in the text, insisting it was not a trade issue.
The administration has said it will address some of these changes in the next phase of the negotiations.
Before the deal was signed Wednesday it was already under fire from top Democrats. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader from New York, criticized it for failing to address China's state-owned enterprises and industrial subsidies. He suggested that President Xi Jinping was privately laughing at the United States over the weakness of the deal and that China has "taken President Trump to the cleaners."

Texto completo: A true believer who claimed he was carrying out Donald Trump’s instructions.
A loyal fixer who regularly attacked Trump’s enemies.
And a federal defendant, who, after a dramatic and public change of heart, blamed his actions on Trump.
Lev Parnas, meet Michael Cohen.
Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has a lot in common with Cohen, Trump's former attorney and problem-fixer.
Both have been involved in political scandals as they faced criminal charges. Both have tried to cooperate with prosecutors in order to get leniency in their cases. And both have expressed regret for having trusted Trump.
Parnas, a Soviet-born businessman, helped Giuliani pressure Ukrainian officials to announce an investigation into the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential Democratic opponent in this year's presidential race.
Now, facing federal charges that could land him in prison, Parnas has turned over documents that could prove critical in the Senate impeachment trial scheduled to begin Tuesday.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , the lead manager for the House, said Thursday his team would consider whether to press the Senate to allow Parnas to testify.
Parnas said in recent media interviews that it's time to tell the truth about Trump's involvement in the effort to get the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation into Biden's family.
The articles of impeachment against Trump accuse him of withholding a White House visit and nearly $400 million in military funding unless Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that investigation.
But Parnas' Road-to-Damascus moment also appears aimed at winning leniency in the criminal case that accuses him of scheming to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars to U. S. political campaigns and candidates. Parnas has pleaded not guilty.
Parnas' defense attorney, Joseph Bondy, did not respond to messages seeking comment. However, he told The New York Times: "We very much want to be heard" in the Southern District of New York, where Parnas has been charged.
"We very much want to provide substantial assistance to the government," Bondy said.
Will prosecutors listen?
“This was clearly his audition to get on the government’s team and provide substantial assistance,” David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami, said.
"Although the information he is providing to Congress has really nothing to do with what he is charged with, he is nevertheless making a case that his cooperation with the impeachment inquiry should be worth some consideration in his pending criminal case," Weinstein said.
Cohen turned over evidence against Trump; it didn't win him leniency
If Cohen's experience is any guide, federal prosecutors in New York won't necessarily agree to designate Parnas a cooperating witness and ask a judge for leniency.
Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to orchestrating payments to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, both of whom claimed to have had sexual affairs with Trump. Cohen told Congress and prosecutors he did so at Trump’s direction. Trump denied their claims.
Cohen also admitted he had lied to Congress, deceived banks from which he sought loans, violated campaign finance laws and lied to the government to avoid paying taxes.
He offered to cooperate with prosecutors, and in early 2019, he turned over documents that appeared to implicate Trump in the hush money scheme. In congressional testimony, Cohen painted a damning portrait of his former boss, calling Trump a “racist,” a “con man” and a “cheat. ”
But none of it convinced prosecutors to recommend a lesser punishment, in part because Cohen wouldn't reveal everything he knew.
To avoid a similar fate, Parnas would have to come clean about his role in the alleged campaign finance scheme and provide details about others who were involved. That includes the three co-defendants who joined him in entering not-guilty pleas.
New York prosecutors made those conditions clear in a December 2018 legal memo filed shortly before Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.
"In order to successfully cooperate with this office, witnesses must undergo full debriefings that encompass their entire criminal history, as well as any and all information they possess about crimes committed by both themselves and others," they wrote.
Cohen now is battling for a reduction in his sentence. Prosecutors oppose it.
Glen Kopp, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor, noted that both Cohen and Parnas have found themselves simultaneously embroiled in criminal cases and political firestorms. Both appeared to seek "credit in the criminal context for cooperation in another context," he said.
“Just because you’re helpful in one entity doesn’t mean SDNY will consider you sufficiently cooperative from their standpoint," Kopp said. The Southern District of New York "requires complete reckoning. There can be nothing held back. For some people, they draw a line on certain things. For SDNY, that’s not acceptable. ”
Parnas says Trump, Pence and Barr knew of scheme, but is he credible?
Parnas gave Congress thousands of pages of records that provided details of his and Giuliani's efforts to press Ukrainian officials for an investigation of Biden's family, as well as the secret drive to oust Marie Yovanovitch as the U. S. ambassador to Ukraine. He also asserted that Trump knew what he and Giuliani were doing.
But there are questions about Parnas' credibility and apparent gaps in the evidence he has turned over.
During an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Parnas alleged that Trump "knew exactly what was going on" as he and Giuliani worked on the president's behalf in Ukraine. He contended that Vice President Mike Pence also knew, and he asserted that Attorney General William Barr "was basically on the team. "
However, Parnas told The New York Times that he stated Trump knew about the scheme because Giuliani assured him of it.
In response, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, "These allegations are being made by a man who is currently out on bail for federal crimes and is desperate to reduce his exposure to prison. "
Speaking to reporters Thursday, Trump again said he doesn't know Parnas. Bondy responded by tweeting a video showing his client with his arm around the president at a Mar-a-Lago event.

Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, said Parnas "will say anything to anybody who will listen in hopes of staying out of prison. "
The Department of Justice said Parnas' statements about Barr were "100% false. "
And Giuliani? “I pay no attention to him,” he said in a text message to USA TODAY on Thursday. “He’s lying. ”
A formal effort to cooperate with prosecutors could also require Parnas to undergo a full debriefing on a checkered history of civil lawsuits. The cases include a New Jersey family trust's effort to recover more than $678,000 Parnas owes for a movie loan.
The movie, tentatively titled "Anatomy of an Assassin," was never produced. The Pues Family Trust has spent years pursuing Parnas for the money. It recently even tried to seize the bail money his family posted in the campaign finance scheme case.
Rudy Durand, a California-based writer and film producer, testified as a witness for the family trust. He testified "that at one time he liked and trusted Lev, but that he later found him to be a con artist," according to a 2015 federal court decision in the case.
However, Bruce Udolf, a former federal prosecutor who served as an associate independent counsel in the Clinton Whitewater investigation, said Parnas is no different than any other key witness to wrongdoing.
"There is an old saying among prosecutors: ‘Swans don’t swim in the sewers,'" Udolf said. "That applies here. Usually, these are the kind of people you need to prove your case. "

Texto completo: The House impeachment hearings ended a month ago, but congressional Democrats aren't done inviting bureaucrats to share their negative opinions of President Donald Trump. Now it's the turn of the Government Accountability Office.
Traditionally GAO does its best to serve its congressional bosses. This is not a swipe at these particular swamp dwellers. Yes, the current head of GAO was nominated by President Barack Obama after a congressional commission presented a list of candidates. But the Supreme Court has explicitly found that GAO is subservient to the legislative branch. The 1986 decision is called Bowsher v. Synar. GAO staff try their best to satisfy requests from legislators.
At the urging of Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Maryland), GAO now says that Trump administration delays in sending aid to Ukraine were illegal. For people who aren't students of the Washington bureaucracy, it should be noted that few people consider GAO the authoritative word on legal issues. The Justice Department and ultimately of course the federal courts make the big calls.
In a new letter GAO's general counsel argues that even though the Trump administration made aid for Ukraine available last September 12—before the Sept. 30 deadline for obligating funds—it still should have happened earlier. It's not entirely clear which date would have made GAO happy but in the agency's view the White House did not have an unavoidable "programmatic delay" which prevented funds from going to Ukraine.
Just for the sake of argument, let's assume that GAO is correct now. Wouldn't the logic of this decision also apply to Vice President Joe Biden's famous withholding of Ukraine aid until the local prosecutor investigating his son's company was fired?
Since this latest GAO missive is being used by those arguing for the removal of a President, it's also worth reviewing a few recent episodes which did not result in the removal of a President.
In 2014 the Associated Press reported :
The Pentagon broke the law when it swapped Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a prisoner in Afghanistan for five years, for five Taliban leaders, congressional investigators said Thursday.
The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said the Defense Department failed to notify the relevant congressional committees at least 30 days in advance of the exchange - a clear violation of the law - and used $988,400 of a wartime account to make the transfer. The GAO also said the Pentagon's use of funds that hadn't been expressly appropriated violated the Antideficiency Act.
"In our view, the meaning of the (law) is clear and unambiguous," the GAO wrote to nine Republican senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and various committees. "Section 8111 prohibits the use of 'funds appropriated or otherwise made available' in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2014, to transfer any individual detained at Guantanamo Bay to the custody or control of a foreign entity' except in accordance" with the law.
It's also difficult to remember any ceremonial pens or somber walking of impeachment articles after Eric Lipton and Michael D. Shear of the New York Times reported in 2015:
The Environmental Protection Agency engaged in "covert propaganda" and violated federal law when it blitzed social media to urge the public to back an Obama administration rule intended to better protect the nation's streams and surface waters, congressional auditors have concluded.
The ruling by the Government Accountability Office, which opened its investigation after a report on the agency's practices in The New York Times, drew a bright line for federal agencies experimenting with social media about the perils of going too far to push a cause. Federal laws prohibit agencies from engaging in lobbying and propaganda.
"I can guarantee you that general counsels across the federal government are reading this report," said Michael Eric Hertz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York who has written on social media and the government.
This column can't guarantee that any U.S. citizens remember where they were the moment they learned about another Associated Press report in 2016. According to the A.P.''s Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar:
The Obama administration failed to follow its own health reform law in a $5 billion dispute over compensating insurers for high costs from seriously ill patients, Congress' investigative arm says.
The opinion from the Government Accountability Office is a setback for the White House and bolsters Republican complaints that administration officials bent the law as problems arose carrying out its complex provisions.
As for today's opinion, the relevant facts were known to Members of the House when they drafted their impeachment articles. If duly elected officials in neither party were willing to allege the President broke the law, why should we take the opinion of the bureaucrats?

Health Care Tax Obscene

Texto completo: One of most enduring, economically and socially damaging, and frustrating facts about life in the United States is how expensive health care is here. Not only does U.S. health care cost far more than in other advanced economies, but compared with the nations that spend less, we have worse or equivalent health outcomes. U.S. life expectancy now lags behind that of all the advanced economies.
An MRI scan that cost $1,400 here went for $450 in Britain and $190 in Holland. Thirty tablets of a drug to reduce the risk of blood clots (Xarelto) cost $380 here, $70 in Britain, $80 in Switzerland and $60 in Holland. Hospital admission for angioplasty is $32,000 here, $15,000 in Australia, $12,000 in Britain, $7,000 in Switzerland, $6,000 in the Netherlands.
Add the latest outrage: surprise medical billing, when even well-insured patients can owe thousands of dollars, because someone treating them was out of their insurance network.
Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton summarized the problem by labeling it an $8,000-a-year health-care tax. This is the difference in costs between what we pay for health care and what people in other countries pay. As Case put it: “We can brag we have the most expensive health care. We can also now brag that it delivers the worst health of any rich country.”
Why call this expense a tax? Well, if you want health coverage, you can’t escape it. But even if you don’t - good luck with that - you still can’t escape the tax, as both employer- and government-provided health care extract payments through lower paychecks and public financing.
Case and Deaton may be erring on the low side. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development puts per-person spending in the United States at $8,950 a year. That compares with $5,060 in Germany, $3,470 in Canada and $3,140 in Britain.
We do little, relative to other systems, to control costs. But we do a fair amount to make health care more expensive.
Our private insurance costs far more than single-payer systems like Canada’s, and more than countries with private but heavily regulated insurers like Germany. OECD data show that as a share of health spending, our administrative costs are three times that of Canada’s and twice that of Germany’s. Getting our administrative costs closer to those in other countries would require regulating private insurers and expanding public coverage, but it could save us at least 10% of our total health-care bill.
Next, we pay twice as much as everyone else to health-care providers and for prescription drugs, $3,000 per family per year. We pay more than twice as much for medical equipment, a bit less than $1,500 per family. Doctors and dentists cost us close to an extra $750 per family per year.
Government policy protects providers. When it comes to manufactured goods, policymakers push for “free trade” and competition. But when it comes to health-care providers, authorities turn explicitly protectionist.
We have maintained or increased barriers that make it difficult for qualified foreign physicians to practice in the United States. We also prevent physicians’ assistants and nurse practitioners from doing many tasks for which they are competent. There is a similar story with dentists and dental hygienists.
Other countries directly control drug prices. In France, the government determines whether a new drug is an improvement or a copycat, and the government negotiates drug prices. When sales exceed the cap, the manufacturer must rebate most of the difference to the government.
We give drug companies and medical equipment manufacturers’ patent monopolies and allow them to charge whatever they want. We don’t even let the government negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare.
This is fixable. It would take regulating costs, reducing reimbursements to providers and increasing competition.
The pharmaceutical industry’s rationale for cost-exploding patents is that it helps incentivize research. But it would take a fraction of the savings from reducing protectionism to replace research with publicly supported research (for which we already spend $40 billion a year).
Allowing foreign doctors whose training meets our standards to more easily practice here would bring physicians’ pay in line with international standards. Our doctors pay much more for their education than doctors trained elsewhere, so part of this structure would also require reducing the domestic cost of medical education and alleviating some of the debt burden that U.S.-trained doctors have acquired.
Increasing competition also would require using antitrust measures to push back on consolidations of hospital groups and medical practices. An analysis by The New York Times of 25 metro areas found that hospital mergers have “essentially banished competition.”
Even if we succeed in raising competition and reducing protectionism, health care will still be too expensive for many low- and moderate-income families. Like every other wealthy country, we will need to get on a path to universal coverage. But if we can significantly reduce our current health-care tax, the savings will be large enough to extend quality, affordable coverage to every American.

Texto completo: BLOOMINGTON  Illinois Wesleyan University junior Megan Baker worries "all the time" about whether the information she is reading is true.
"Especially with social media, and how active young people are on social media, I think we always have to be skeptical about the information we see and make sure it comes from reliable sources," she said.
That was the message from a Founders Day speech Wednesday from Jim Kirk, publisher and executive editor of Crain's Chicago Business, who keynoted the IWU event with "The Future of Journalism in the Fake News Era."
"I thought it was a really timely speech. It ties in with (IWU's) annual theme 'Fact or Fiction' perfectly," said Baker. "I think it's important to constantly remind people to think critically about the information they consume."
Kirk, a graduate of Illinois State University, is a former editor of the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Sun-Times. Founders' Day honors the 30 civic and religious leaders who came together in 1850 to establish the university.
In his speech, Kirk asked attendees to raise their hands if they thought news stories described by Kirk were fake or real. The audience correctly identified two of three examples.
"I use these examples to demonstrate the state of play when it comes to fake news versus real news from traditional news sources," said Kirk. "In countless newsfeed forms on Twitter, Facebook and increasingly on Instagram, both real and false information sometimes spill together, making it unclear (to readers) whether they are true or false.
"The traditional news industry, the one that has been trusted with truth-telling for hundreds of years, is in uncharted territory, battling untrue news and its effect on the industry," said Kirk. "At the end of the day no one wants to be lied to and no one wants to share something that is inherently false. But as an industry we need to come together to make it easy for readers to see the difference."
Transparency is key, said Kirk, such as sharing more information on the news-gathering process, including how many people and sources reporters talked to, and documents used to put stories together. That information can demonstrate the thoroughness of the reporting and lend credibility to stories.
"These kinds of conversations are really important," said Chris Coates, Central Illinois editor for The Pantagraph. "News organizations need to lean forward, explain how we do our jobs and show our audience that we're people, too. That's a dialogue we need to be having every day."
There is no shortage of people who want news and want to be informed, said Kirk.
Even though "the advertising picture looks grim, The New York Times added 273,000 new online readers in the third quarter alone," Kirk said. "The New York Times audience is now its biggest in history with a total number of print and digital subscribers at 4.9 million.
"I think, obviously, a lot of work has to be done on building a new business model that can support journalism," said Kirk. "I think we're seeing some innovative models that include both new infusions of cash from new investors as well as possible non-profit kinds of funding for specific journalistic projects. I think it is going to be a mix of all sorts of things for the future."
The future of print journalism has been debated for years, "but I think journalism will survive," said Kirk. "It will just evolve into some other platforms that we now currently are starting to see."
No matter the platform, journalists' most important role will always be "speaking the truth to power," he said.

3 suspected neo-Nazi members arrested before Virginia gun rally

Texto completo: Three suspected members of a neo-Nazi hate group were arrested Thursday ahead of a pro-gun rally in Richmond, Virginia, where the men reportedly discussed traveling with weapons, federal prosecutors said.
Meanwhile, a judge ruled late Thursday that Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's temporary ban on weapons at the state Capitol was legal after two gun-rights groups sued.
Prosecutors say the men, operating around Maryland and Delaware, were members of The Base, a violent hate group committed to creating a white ethno-state. The New York Times reported that The Base has become a growing concern for the FBI as the group recruits more people.
The FBI took the men into custody Thursday morning and they appeared before a federal judge in the afternoon in connection with firearms and alien-related charges, prosecutors said in a news release. They were identified as Brian Mark Lemley, Jr. , 33; William Garfield Bilbrough IV, 19; and Patrik Jordan Mathews, 27.
The arrests come a day after Northam declared a state of emergency in Richmond from Friday through Tuesday and temporarily banned all weapons, including firearms, near the state Capitol after he says law enforcement received credible threats of violence made by out-of-state hate groups and militia planned for the rally.
Lemley and Mathews are also accused of purchasing around 1,650 rounds of ammunition this month.
At the hearing Thursday, Assistant U. S. Attorney Thomas Windom said Bilbrough "has personally compared The Base favorably to al-Qaida. "
Windom said the man discussed traveling to Ukraine to fight alongside "nationalists" and showed the judge a photograph of him participating in a military-style training camp with other members of The Base.
Lemley and Mathews' lawyers declined to comment. Bilbrough’s attorney, Robert Bonsib, said he was "underwhelmed" by a prosecutor’s arguments for keeping his client detained.
Lemley previously served in the U. S. Army and Mathews was a combat engineer in the Canadian Army Reserve. According to The New York Times, Mathews was dismissed over his ties to white supremacists.
According to criminal complaints, Lemley and Bilbrough face charges of transporting and harboring aliens and conspiring to do so. Lemley also faces charges of transporting a machine gun and disposing of a firearm and ammunition to an alien unlawfully present in the United States.
Mathews is charged with transporting a firearm and ammunition with intent to commit a felony and being an alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition, a criminal complaint says.
In Virginia, momentum has grown against Democrats' proposed gun regulations, mostly through a wave of localities declaring themselves "sanctuaries" for the Second Amendment.
More than 100 counties, towns and cities say through the resolutions they will not enforce unconstitutional laws, but legal experts, including Virginia's attorney general, say those resolutions hold no legal weight.
Democrats and Northam have full control of state government for the first time since 1993 and have pushed for the new legislation.
Northam and his supporters say the bills — which include limits on some firearm purchases, universal background checks and a "red flag" law — aim to protect Virginians. Detractors say the proposals would infringe on their Second Amendment rights.
The Virginia Citizens Defense League had called on people to descend on the state Capitol with their firearms to try to persuade legislators to scrap or weaken the bills. The group and many other pro-gun media have used fiery language of "tyrants" trying to seize firearms.

Resumen: With its first-in-the-nation caucuses, Iowa has played a major role in selecting Democratic nominees in recent decades, to the consternation of some.

Texto completo: Dear reader:
The Iowa caucuses are now just 19 days away. Which means that soon, we might get some clarity on who is likely to become the Democratic nominee.
Or not.
Politico’s Bill Scher makes an interesting case that Iowa will matter “less than ever” in 2020. He notes that the candidates themselves have spent less time in Iowa compared with previous cycles – and more time in states like California, which will vote on Super Tuesday.
This is all the intended result, he says, of changes made in 2008 to the primary schedule by the Democratic National Committee, placing South Carolina and Nevada right after Iowa and New Hampshire, with a “quasi-national primary” shortly thereafter.
“The sheer breadth of the Super Tuesday map, along with the compressed timetable, has persuaded candidates to crisscross the country, hunting for votes as well as dollars,” Mr. Scher writes.
Others aren’t buying the notion that Iowa’s clout is on the wane. The Hawkeye State has played a pivotal role in choosing the Democratic nominee going back to Jimmy Carter because of the momentum it typically gives winners. Barack Obama’s win there over Hillary Clinton in 2008 propelled his candidacy forward in a way that’s hard to overstate. The same was true for John Kerry in 2004 (a year that had an even more condensed timetable, with a “mini” Super Tuesday just one week after New Hampshire).
The New York Times’s Ross Douthat argues that a victory by former Vice President Joe Biden in Iowa next month might well “wrap up the nomination.” A first-place finish by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would likely set up a two-person race between Senator Sanders and Mr. Biden. Perhaps the only outcome in Iowa that wouldn’t at least narrow the field significantly, Mr. Douthat writes, would be a “somewhat random-seeming one” or “a de facto four-way tie.”
As we’ve noted before, this cycle bears many similarities to 2004 – with the top four candidates closely bunched in polls, and voters seeming to prioritize ‘electability’ above all else. If those parallels continue, it’s easy to envision Iowa once again launching the eventual winner.

LITTLE SU-SPENCE; Dinwiddie knew Kyrie &amp; Kevin were coming

Texto completo: N o matter what happens with this intriguing star duo of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant in Brooklyn, Spencer Dinwiddie will have played an integral role in its formation.
Dinwiddie has been coy about his recruiting efforts, but there is plenty of evidence suggesting that, at the very least, his connection and pitch to Kyrie Irving carried weight.
And while the rest of the NBA was trumping up the Knicks as the destination of free agent superstars, the Nets locker room knew better because of Dinwiddie.
"Spence knew," Ed Davis, a member of the Nets last season who is now with the Utah Jazz, told the Daily News. "My locker was right next to Spencer's too so we used to talk all the time. And he was saying that early [that Durant and Irving were coming to the Nets]. So we knew it was a good chance."
How early was Dinwiddie saying this?
"Early bro, like before All-Star break," Davis said.
Dinwiddie is, in many ways, an unlikely coordinator of a superteam. A second-round pick out of Colorado, Dinwiddie required a G-League stint to prove he deserved a second NBA contract. The 26-year-old isn't part of a banana boat crew or a Team USA clique. But his personality is unique and gravitating. Dinwiddie can explain why he relates to Vegeta (a character in the Japanese anime series, 'Dragon Ball Z') and create a business model of selling crypto bonds tied to his earnings. According to the New York Times, Dinwiddie and Irving connected as students of a Harvard business course during the summer of 2018.
Plus, Dinwiddie developed into a helluva basketball player.
"I've had a tough life, I think people can identify with it. A little quirky. I'm consistent, though. I think people can respect that at the end of the day," Dinwiddie said. "You can be quirky but you always have to be yourself.
"I'm just me so I think people respect it and I make friends that way."
Asked about telling Davis last season that Durant and Irving were coming to Brooklyn, Dinwiddie smiled and said, "I miss Ed."
Forming a super duo is one thing, winning with it is the difficult part. Durant is shelved indefinitely because of the Achilles tear, although he's never been officially ruled out for the season and a return is always possible. According to coach Kenny Atkinson, Durant, who is now seven months post-surgery, is "progressing fantastically."
In the meantime, the Nets are trying to sort through their three-headed guard monster of Irving, Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert. It's a duel task of working with each other and getting out of each other's way. Wednesday's loss to the Jazz was just the trio's second game all together after Irving and LeVert returned from long injury absences.
There were promising moments - especially from Irving (32 points on 12-of-19 shooting) - but the Jazz was too big and physical.
"It's an adjustment," Irving said. "You have guys that you respect and you want to give them a lot of space and create different opportunities for one another and we just have to figure out a way to play better off one another."
In many ways, recruiting Irving also meant Dinwiddie was recruiting a reduced role for himself. With Irving and LeVert injured for over a month, Dinwiddie controlled the ball and was making a push for an All-Star appearance. He'll still get opportunities with his teammates back healthy, but the reality is there are only so many possessions and shots within 48 minutes.
Dinwiddie probably knew this dynamic was a possibility a year ago.
"We're just going to go with the flow," Dinwiddie said. "We're just going to go with whoever is hot in the moment."

Pelosi delay a 'successful failure'

Texto completo: This had to be one of the most successful failures - one of the most triumphant defeats - in modern political history.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi clearly failed in the stated aim of her four-week delay in sending impeachment articles to the Senate: to withhold the articles and the naming of impeachment managers until, as she put it last month, "we see the process that is set forth in the Senate." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell didn't reveal his impeachment resolution and made no commitment to bring forth witnesses or documents.
But Pelosi's delay seems to have blunted any hope President Trump's defenders had of dismissing the charges without a trial.
Credit the delay. Public attention to the dispute and to former Trump national security adviser John Bolton's willingness to testify makes it more difficult for Republicans to dismiss the charges. It also left time for investigators to obtain notes and phone records of indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas; released in part Tuesday night, they show, among other things, that people working with Giuliani apparently had Marie Yovanovitch, then the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, under surveillance.
The biggest benefit of the 28-day delay, though, could not have been predicted when Pelosi sent the nation on this path. Many of the behaviors that got Trump impeached have returned in other guises for all to see:
He took the nation to the verge of war with Iran based on a lie: that his assassination of a top Iranian general was justified by an "imminent" threat, specifically a planned attack against four U.S. embassies. When the world learned that Trump had fabricated it, he claimed "it doesn't really matter" whether there is an imminent threat before he engages in hostilities - an assault on congressional authority to declare war. He is simultaneously preparing to assault congressional power of the purse. As the Washington Post's Nick Miroff reported, Trump plans to divert an extra $7.2 billion for a border wall - five times the amount Congress authorized - by siphoning money away from military construction and counternarcotics efforts. Trump's 2016 political benefactor, Russia, has been caught interfering in the 2020 election to help Trump. Russia's military spy agency, the GRU, hacked Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden served and that was at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. Trump tried to force Ukraine to give him politically helpful dirt on the Bidens - and now Russia appears ready to oblige. After the past four weeks, Senate Republicans will have a more difficult time disregarding the consequences of excusing Trump's wrongdoing. They're knowingly blessing his claims of unilateral power to make war and spend taxpayer dollars and leaving him in a position to owe reelection to the same man who helped him win a first term: Vladimir Putin.
Pelosi announced her official surrender in the Capitol basement Tuesday morning, later naming the impeachment managers Wednesday and sending the article to the Senate. During a news conference after the Tuesday meeting, Sheryl Gay Stolberg of the New York Times pointed out that Pelosi failed to get McConnell's commitments. "So what's changed?"
The Democratic caucus chairman, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), argued the stall "created space" for three Republican senators - Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Mitt Romney (Utah) - to support witness testimony. Only one more Republican vote is needed to hear from witnesses such as Bolton.
Will vulnerable Republicans still try to quash testimony about Trump withholding Ukrainian security for political dirt - even now that Russia has violated Ukrainian sovereignty to steal precisely the sort of dirt Trump sought? Jeffries suggested blocking testimony would look like "a coverup" by "Moscow Mitch and the Senate Republicans."
Nearby, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) held a news conference declaring Pelosi's delay a dud: "No one questions about what she gained, it was nothing."
McCarthy went on to claim Pelosi withheld the articles to help Joe Biden defeat Bernie Sanders - renewing a Democratic conspiracy from 2016, he alleged, when "emails came out to show that ... Sanders was cheated."
Emails came out? Incredibly, McCarthy was citing emails stolen by Putin when the Democratic National Committee was hacked by the GRU - the same Russian military outfit that just hacked Burisma.
Add that to the many benefits of Pelosi's delay: exposing the utter perfidy of McCarthy, relying on Russians' 2016 dirty work on Trump's behalf even as those same spies were just caught trying to help Trump in 2020.
Surely a few Senate Republicans, now in the spotlight, will feel pressure to show more integrity.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump signed an initial trade deal with China on Wednesday, bringing the first chapter of a protracted and economically damaging fight with the world's second-largest economy to a close.
The pact is intended to open Chinese markets to more U.S. companies, increase farm and energy exports and provide greater protection for U.S. technology and trade secrets. China has committed to purchasing an additional $200 billion worth of U.S. goods and services by 2021 and is expected to ease some of the tariffs it has placed U.S. products.
But the agreement preserves the bulk of tariffs that Trump has placed on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, and it maintains the threat of additional punishment if Beijing does not live up to the terms of the deal.
"Today we take a momentous step, one that has never been taken before with China, toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade with China," Trump said at a ceremony at the White House. "Together we are righting the wrongs of the past."
The deal caps more than two years of tense negotiations and escalating threats that at times seemed destined to plunge the United States and China into a permanent economic war. Trump, who campaigned for president in 2016 on a promise to get tough on China, pushed his negotiators to rewrite trade terms that he said had destroyed American industry and jobs, and he imposed record tariffs on Chinese goods in a gamble to get Beijing to accede to his demands.
The resulting pact marks a significant turning point in U.S. trade policy and the types of free trade agreements that the United States has typically supported. Rather than lowering tariffs and other economic barriers to allow for the flow of goods and services to meet market demand, this deal leaves a record level of tariffs in place and forces China to buy $200 billion worth of specific products within two years.
To Trump and other supporters, the approach corrects for past trade deals that enabled corporate outsourcing and led to lost jobs and industries. To critics, it is the type of managed trade approach that the United States has long criticized, especially with regard to China and its control over its economy.
Rather than trying to change China's approach, it leans into it by requiring Beijing to buy set amounts of certain goods and services.
And it does not resolve more pernicious structural issues surrounding China's approach, particularly its pattern of subsidizing and supporting key industries that compete with U.S. firms, like solar and steel. U.S. businesses blame those economic practices for allowing cheap Chinese goods to flood the U.S. market, putting domestic firms out of business.
But the agreement has plenty of critics in both parties, who say that Trump's tactics have been haphazard and economically damaging and that the agreement leaves many important economic issues unresolved.

Texto completo: Matthew Cherry, a Chicago native and NFL-retiree turned entertainment sensation, received an Oscar nomination for his short animated film "Hair Love," an incredibly charming, tear-jerking story about a black father doing his young daughter's hair for the first time.
"Hair Love," which has an accompanying picture book that became a New York Times bestseller, was released this summer in theaters with "The Angry Birds Movie 2," and came out in December 2019 on social platforms. The film has received more than 10.8 million views on YouTube alone.
The academy receives a lot of flak for its many nomination snubs, but I'm glad it got this one right.
In the film, the little girl, who we know as Zuri, has a palpable excitement for a marked day on her calendar. "Is it picture day?" I initially wondered, since a Thursday was the denoted day. Zuri slides on an outfit already laid out, then approaches her bathroom sink with a wide-tooth comb in hand, ready to tackle the full head of hair we soon see is hidden underneath her bonnet.
She pulls up her favorite hair influencer on a video streaming website and finds one for the occasion. Then, we're taken to a flashback of a woman, presumably Zuri's mother, doing the child's hair in the style she just eyed.
"It just took a little bit of work, and a whole lot of love," the mother, voiced by actress Issa Rae, says.
Zuri attempts and fails miserably, shocking her father to the point of having him drop a basket full of laundry to the ground. After his own multiple attempts and failures, Zuri's dad tries to resolve the issue by shoving a red beanie on top of her untamed curls. She runs out of the room in tears after she sees how she looks.
Hair is sacred for little black girls: It's a bonding experience laced with rites of passages typically passed down through our mothers; the memories we create in those bonds make the perfect content to easily connect with other black women and to swap stories with our girlfriends.
Black men don't usually get to partake in this experience by default, for they too have equally special rituals among themselves within the walls of the black barbershop.
Naturally, the roles of black mothers and fathers have been siloed when it comes to caring for their sons' and daughters' hair. In nuclear black families -- mom, dad, son, daughter -- rarely do these roles cross.
In a society where there are many stereotypes about black men as fathers, Zuri's dad offers a refreshing take.
"Hair Love" is not a story about a little black girl falling in love with her natural hair but of a black father displaying his love for his daughter through doing her hair in the midst of his own intimidation and ignorance.
Zuri's hair is special to her not for vanity's sake, but for the memories she and her mother created together while doing it. Her hair is not just hair then, but a tender extension of her heart.
By her father acknowledging this through taking the time to learn how to do her hair, it allowed him to enter a new chamber of Zuri's heart once solely occupied by her mother. The father has now earned a new level of trust that goes beyond the security of Zuri knowing her dad will make her look pretty; she knows her dad will make the effort to invest in her, even when he's out of his comfort zone.
Hair, in this instance, serves as a way to make the child feel loved, proud and confident. That will always be in the job description of both parents.

Texto completo: The wildcat miner had something to prove: processing gold ore with liquid mercury was perfectly safe. So he drank some of the toxic chemical, choosing the promises of gold fever over the pain of mercury poisoning.
"I have no worry about mercury," bragged the fast-talking Syarafuddin Iskandar, 58. "I drank it. We gave it to the cows and the buffaloes. They drank it. Nothing happened. There's no problem."
His stunt has made him famous in the gold fields of Sumbawa, an Indonesian island 100 miles east of Bali where makeshift mining camps dot the jungle hills. But it also illustrated the stark choice the illegal miners here face. To earn a living they effectively poison themselves, their communities and the environment by using mercury, an outlawed but popular way to extract gold from ore.
For decades, Syarafuddin and thousands of small-scale miners like him have worked illegally in West Sumbawa on land the government leases to large mining companies. The outlaw miners pay nothing for rights to the land but reap as much as $6 million a month in gold.
About 1 million small-scale gold miners operate across Indonesia, the world's largest island nation, and the outlaw industry presents a vexing paradox.
The use of mercury in the wildcat camps results in devastating effects on health and the environment. The heavy metal is well known as a slow-acting poison that seeps into the food chain, causing birth defects, neurological disorders and death. But because the mines are a short-term boon to the economy -- employing people who might otherwise live in crushing poverty -- the government is reluctant to shut them down.
The competing interests of the local people, the government, environmentalists and large mining companies that control land where wildcat miners operate are now coming to a head in West Sumbawa. This time a large mining company is taking steps, which it says are meant to protect the environment.
Last year, officers from a feared Police Mobile Brigade Corps, armed with assault rifles, climbed through dense jungle to shut down the mountaintop camps of dozens of outlaw miners.
The miners had squatted there for years, using mercury that poisoned the soil and a nearby stream. The site was previously controlled by Newmont Goldcorp, an American company and one of the largest mining businesses in the world.
The police ordered the miners to dismantle their camps, cut up their equipment with a chain saw and block the mine entrances with debris. The wildcatters seethed as the miners were forced to destroy their operations.
"We are crushed that they are closing this mine because we have no other way to make a living," said one outlaw mine operator, Zaenal Abidin, who had employed two dozen men to work his claim.
The environmental group Nexus3 Foundation estimates that 850 gold mining sites have become mercury contaminated hot spots and that half a million people suffer from mercury poisoning nationwide.
The rare police crackdown was prompted by the mining company, PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara.
Amman Mineral acquired the vast land concession and huge Batu Hijau open-pit copper mine from Newmont in 2016 during a push by the government to assert national control over mineral resources.
With a pipeline that dumped massive amounts of mine waste into the sea, Newmont gained a reputation for damaging the environment.
Closing the unauthorized mines is part of a campaign by Amman Mineral to stop illegal mining and uncontrolled mercury use on the former Newmont concession and another, known as Indotan, that it oversees 20 miles north.
"Initially, we thought of it as just illegal pillaging of resources," said Amman Mineral's director, Alexander Ramlie. "But when we looked deeper at it, we realized it is a more serious social problem. They are creating an environmental disaster."
The vast majority of West Sumbawa's 7,000 wildcat miners are on the Indotan site, which Amman Mineral's partners recently took over in a separate deal.
Much of the mining takes place in the hills above Lake Taliwang, a shallow lake northeast of Taliwang town.
A 2016 study found that so much of the miners' mercury reached the lake that eating just one lake fish could exceed a person's mercury allowance for a week. A second study that surveyed miners found that many had high mercury levels and some were experiencing early symptoms of mercury poisoning, such as finger tremors and sleep disturbances.
But in the absence of government warnings or enforcement of the ban on mercury use, it is easy for miners to dismiss the idea that it is hazardous.
Wildcat miners have been operating for decades on the Indotan concession, where they have established permanent communities and an industrial-scale village for processing ore. The miners operate openly without fear that the police will interfere. On one road, they have set up a checkpoint to control access to their diggings.
Some government, police and military officials also are said to profit from the illicit gold trade, which is estimated at $5 billion a year.
The miners will fight any attempt to drive them off the land without providing other jobs, said Anton, a Sumbawa native who owns mines and mills. Like many Indonesians, he uses one name.
Wearing flashy 22-carat necklaces made from gold his mine produced, he questions why big companies like Newmont and Amman Mineral get lucrative mining concessions while he and his fellow miners are branded as illegal.
"Why do you allow the outsiders to operate while we, the locals, are forbidden from doing the work?" he asked.
The mine bosses and their workers have good reason not to give ground. Miners in the Taliwang region reported making an average of 15 times more from gold mining than from other occupations, according to the survey of 55 miners.
Officials said the illegal operations are the second-largest contributor to the economy of West Sumbawa Regency, after Amman Mineral's legal operation.

Texto completo: Apple is privately preparing for a legal fight with the Justice Department to defend encryption on its iPhones while publicly trying to defuse the dispute, as the technology giant navigates an increasingly tricky line between its customers and the Trump administration.
Timothy Cook, Apple's chief executive, has marshaled a handful of top advisers, while Attorney General William Barr has taken aim at the company and asked it to help penetrate two phones used by a gunman in a deadly shooting last month at a naval air station in Pensacola, Florida.
Executives at Apple have been surprised by the case's quick escalation, said people familiar with the company who were not authorized to speak publicly. And there is frustration and skepticism among some on the Apple team working on the issue that the Justice Department hasn't spent enough time trying to get into the iPhones with third-party tools, said one person with knowledge of the matter.
Apple declined to comment on the issue Tuesday. Late Monday, after Barr had complained that the company had provided no "substantive assistance" in gaining access to the phones used in the Pensacola shooting, Apple said it rejected that characterization. It added that "encryption is vital to protecting our country and our users' data."
At the heart of the tussle is a debate between Apple and the government over whether security or privacy trumps the other. Apple has said it chooses not to build a "backdoor" way for governments to get into iPhones and to bypass encryption because that would create a slippery slope that could damage people's privacy.
Cook publicly took a stand on privacy in 2016 when Apple fought a court order from the FBI to open the iPhone of a gunman involved in a San Bernardino, California, mass shooting. The company said it could open the phone in a month, using a team of six to 10 engineers. But in a blistering, 1,100-word letter to Apple customers at the time, Cook warned that creating a way for the authorities to gain access to someone's iPhone "would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect."
The San Bernardino case was bitterly contested by the government and Apple until a private company came forward with a way to break into the phone. Since then, Cook has made privacy one of Apple's core values. That has set Apple apart from tech giants like Facebook and Google, which have faced scrutiny for vacuuming up people's data to sell ads.
The Pensacola gunman's phones were an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 7 Plus, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Those phones lack Apple's most sophisticated encryption.
Security researchers said tools from at least two companies, Cellebrite and Grayshift, have long been able to bypass the encryption on those iPhone models.
Cellebrite's and Grayshift's tools exploit flaws in iPhone software that let them remove limits on how many passwords can be tried before the device erases its data, the researchers said. Typically, iPhones allow 10 password attempts. The tools then use a so-called brute-force attack, or repeated automated attempts of thousands of pass codes, until one works.
Security researchers speculated that in the Pensacola case, the FBI might still be trying a brute-force attack to get into the phones. They said major physical damage may have impeded any third-party tools from opening the devices. The Pensacola gunman had shot the iPhone 7 Plus once and tried destroying the iPhone 5, according to FBI photos.

A new layer to McDonald's role in US history

Texto completo: 'Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America'
By Marcia Chatelain, Liveright, 324 pages. $28.95
Say the name McDonald's, and what comes to mind? Tasty hamburgers or hardened arteries? Entry-level jobs or dead-end McJobs? Responsive community outreach or mercenary corporate power?
In "Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America," Marcia Chatelain has written a smart and capacious history suggesting that McDonald's should summon all of those thoughts, and then some.
The cover image on her book encapsulates the multiple layers of the story she tells. On first glance it simply looks like a photograph of two people smiling in front of a McDonald's as one helps the other register to vote, but on closer inspection the picture has been manipulated to look grainy and frayed. The history in this book is similarly hopeful and fraught, recounting a "somewhat bizarre but incredibly powerful marriage between a fast-food behemoth and the fight for civil rights."
Fast food is now so cheap and readily available that its consumption is associated more with straitened circumstances than with affluent ones, but that wasn't always the case. Chatelain, a history professor at Georgetown and the author of "South Side Girls," about the experiences of black girls in Chicago during the Great Migration, recalls the early days of restaurant franchising in the 1940s and '50s, when fast-food chains emerged as emissaries of the American dream -- with all the complexities of race and money that entailed.
Roadside restaurants generally started out as a suburban phenomenon, many of them clustered in Southern California, catering to the mostly white beneficiaries of the postwar boom. By 1954, these restaurants included a few outlets owned by the McDonald brothers, when a milkshake machine salesman named Ray Kroc offered to help them expand. Kroc eventually took over the business in 1961. The Greensboro, North Carolina, sit-ins had taken place the year before, and civil rights activists began to turn their attention toward roadside restaurants like McDonald's, which either refused service to black people in the Jim Crow South or forced them to place their orders at separate windows.
As Chatelain describes it, those early battles between McDonald's and civil rights activists mainly revolved around who got served and who got hired. Later, activists began to petition for black ownership of franchises located in black neighborhoods, a demand that McDonald's was initially slow to meet but eventually pursued out of shrewd self-interest. After the uprisings that followed Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in April 1968, when a number of white franchisees and employees fled their stores, the corporation set out on a nationwide search to do something it had never done before: enlist a black franchise owner.
This turning point is where Chatelain's book really takes off, as she documents how McDonald's came to play a growing role in black communities, offering not only food and jobs but also sponsorships ranging from funds for the local Little League team to grants for the NAACP. Today, the online portal 365Black.com showcases the company's cultural efforts, including a gospel tour and an event featuring the rapper 2 Chainz.
But the partnership between the civil rights movement and the McDonald's Corp. bristled with compromises and contradictions from the beginning. Chatelain includes a memorable anecdote about Ralph Abernathy, King's successor as the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who toured the country in 1969 and rejected the idea that opening up modes of production to black entrepreneurs meant that benefits would inevitably trickle down.
"I don't believe in black capitalism," Abernathy declared. "I believe in black socialism." Yet when visiting Chicago, he accepted a $1,300 donation for the SCLC from McDonald's. Chatelain describes it as the first of many donations from the corporation to civil rights organizations, which increasingly yoked "King's dream to Kroc's dream, despite the two men's hopes for the world being miles apart."
The discrepancy between Abernathy's words and deeds is the kind of hypocrisy that might get him denounced by political purists nowadays, but Chatelain is less accusatory. Throughout this impressively judicious book, she is attuned to the circumstances that encouraged increasingly intricate ties between McDonald's and black communities across the country. This isn't just a story of exploitation or, conversely, empowerment; it's a cautionary tale about relying on the private sector to provide what the public needs, and how promises of real economic development invariably come up short.
Chatelain is critical of the fast-food industry, showing how it was the undisputed beneficiary of government largesse. A highway system bisected communities and created captive markets, offering McDonald's opportunities for growth in the 1970s, when the growth of suburban outlets was flagging as gas prices started to rise. Franchisees could take advantage of federal loans, which Chatelain calls "corporate welfare to the inner city."
She's frank about her own experiences of McDonald's: "For most of my life, I have eaten there and enjoyed it." Her sense of perspective gives this important book an empathetic core as well as analytical breadth.
"History encourages us to be more compassionate toward individuals navigating few choices," Chatelain writes, "and history cautions us to be far more critical of the institutions and structures that have the power to take choices away."

Texto completo: The first time Matthew Bremer saw the listing for the church he would eventually buy in Phillipsport, New York, it arrived like so many unwanted emails, as inbox-clogging spam. But rather than immediately hitting delete he scrolled down the email while eating lunch and was intrigued by what he saw: a simple white clapboard church dating to 1823 that was so untouched by time its only bathroom was an outhouse.
"It was this sort of perfect, almost child's drawing of the idea of a church," said Bremer, 51, the founder of Architecture in Formation, a Manhattan-based firm. "The white Colonial box."
Fantasizing about converting it into a private country escape, he and a friend took the two-hour drive north from New York City for a look.
"It was in this bucolic setting," he said, and had impressive architectural bones, as well as 14-foot-tall, triple-hung, divided-light windows that gave it a magical sense of light.
The following weekend, he returned with his partner, Shaun Skura.
"I was like, 'You're crazy,' " said Skura, 40, a relationship manager at LinkedIn. "However, I also saw instant potential, and I knew he would do something extraordinary with it."
The reality at the outset, Skura added, was clear: "We knew it was going to take a lot of blood, sweat and tears."
Before committing to buying it, Bremer wanted to be sure that the church could legally be converted to a private residence and that a septic system could be added so they could have indoor bathrooms.
After studying the half-acre property, he came to the conclusion that there was nowhere he could reasonably add a septic system. But he noticed an awkward vacant lot across the street with only a billboard for Shadowland Stages, a theater in nearby Ellenville.
"I reached out and said, 'Hey, is there any way that we could share this property,' " Bremer said. Eventually he struck a deal with the theater that allowed him to buy the property to use for his septic field for next to nothing, with the promise that the billboard would remain.
Then he spent the better part of the following year working on getting his unconventional plans approved by local authorities.
"It took a somewhat masochistic architect to go through and get four very specific variances to legalize the disused church to a residence," Bremer said.
Two years after he first visited the 2,200-square-foot church -- a United Methodist Church that had been vacant for several years -- Bremer finally felt confident that a conversion was possible and bought it for $100,000, in the spring of 2017.
He and Skura had contractors largely dismantle it down to the enormous structural timbers, in order to add the insulation, HVAC, plumbing and electrical systems it needed.
"It was ostensibly an old pole barn, uninsulated," said Bremer, who sought to keep the basic character of the building intact while "channeling Donald Judd, Gordon Matta-Clark and a little bit of John Waters."
In addition to adding the basic systems the building needed, they cut a hole in the floor for a staircase leading to the basement, which previously had only an outside entrance. On the lower level, they carved out three bedrooms and a bathroom with a subterranean shower illuminated by a ground-level skylight.
Upstairs, they designated the altar as the dining area and cut a large opening in the wall, to create an enormous picture window that also reveals some of the building's original framing. They tucked a stainless-steel kitchen under the loft, which they converted to an office and media lounge with a retractable projection screen. And they built a second bathroom behind the kitchen with a one-way mirror that allows occupants to look out over spice jars to see activity in the main living space.
Because there was no fireplace, they suspended a shapely steel Fireorb -- a product more commonly associated with modernist glass boxes than old clapboard churches.
"I'm interested in how we, as a culture, have sort of moved beyond binaries of sacred and profane, and public and private," Bremer said. "Of course, when converting a church, all of that comes to the fore."
To furnish the place, Bremer and Skura repurposed many of the pews as headboards and footboards for beds. They scoured vintage stores and flea markets to find pieces like a large Harvey Probber sectional sofa and a walnut-and-galvanized-tin bathtub, which they installed in the open living space. To finish it off, they collected smaller, whimsical curiosities, including an old elevator sign from Macy's and a black-velvet Jesus painting.
After about a year and a half of construction, during which they spent more than $500,000, the couple moved in just before Christmas in 2018, and invited about a dozen friends to celebrate.
"We had nothing set up, and the table wasn't there, but we had a giant Christmas dinner with a lot of friends," Bremer said. "It was sort of the christening."
Still, the project, he conceded, isn't completely finished. After rebuilding the exterior entrance to the basement as a black box holding a neon sign that reads "House of Dog" -- Bremer's employees gave him the sign as a 50th birthday gift, in tribute to the couple's Italian greyhound, Geoffrey -- he is considering building a few more black boxes in the landscape.
"One is a swimming pool, one is a raised planter bed and one is an outdoor shower," he said.
"We will be working on it forever," he added. "It's the perfectly unfinished, forever project."

Texto completo: Matty Maher, the patriarch of only the third family to steward the venerable dive bar McSorley's Old Ale House since it opened in the East Village of Manhattan in the mid-19th century, died Saturday in Queens. He was 80.
The cause was lung cancer, his daughter Teresa de la Haba said.
Maher, who could trace his career at McSorley's to a bit of end-of-the-rainbow serendipity in Ireland, began by tending bar at the saloon in 1964 as an Irish immigrant.
He graduated to manager as the beer hall, surrounded by neighborhood blight near the Bowery, tottered at the brink of bankruptcy; survived the loss of a gender discrimination case in 1970 that forced McSorley's to delete the last two words of its durable slogan vowing "Good Ale, Raw Onions, and No Ladies"; and endured a Health Department ordinance that, while it banned smoking, had the unintended consequence, Maher said, of encouraging customers to drink more.
The bar was immortalized early in the 20th century by the paintings of John Sloan of the Ashcan School (one, displayed at the 1913 Armory Show, was said to have been priced at $500 and failed to sell) and by Joseph Mitchell's 1940 profile in The New Yorker titled "The Old House at Home," the bar's name when it was opened by John McSorley about 1854.
Mitchell had distinguished McSorley's as a "dark and gloomy," unpretentious and "utterly democratic" place where malt and wet hops contributed to "a thick musty smell that acts as a balm to jerky nerves."
Maher was perfectly cast as the publican.
"He was a five-foot-eight spark plug," author and journalist Rafe Bartholomew wrote in a memoir, "Two and Two: McSorley's, My Dad, and Me" (2017), "with the Irish gift of gab, a belly laugh that could fill the front room and an explosive temper when he needed it."
When an amateur historian challenged McSorley's reputation as New York's oldest Irish pub, Maher commissioned a regular customer, Bill Wander, to turn the tables and prove the bar's date of birth, which he did.
In 1936, the McSorley family sold the bar to Daniel O'Connell, a patron and police officer, who left it to his daughter, Dorothy Kirwin. In 1964, while vacationing near Kilkenny, Ireland, Kirwin's husband, Harry, was stranded with a flat tire when who should come along to offer help but 25-year-old Matty Maher.
Harry Kirwin promised Matty a job at McSorley's if he ever moved to New York. He accepted the offer, set off for America and ultimately, in 1977, bought the bar and the building it occupies, at 15 East Seventh St. near Cooper Square, from the Kirwins' son.
Matthew Dennis Maher was born Nov. 8, 1939, in Kilkenny to Patrick and Ellen (Fogarty) Maher. His father was a farmer, his mother a cook.
After leaving school at 14, he worked for a farmer, drove a delivery truck for a local meat company and caught foxes, providing them to wealthy landowners for hunts.
He married Teresa Mary Brady of County Meath, Ireland. She and de la Haba survive him, along with four other daughters, Ann Marie Pullman, Kathy Isaakidis, Adrienne Noyes and Maeve McNamara, and 12 grandchildren. Maher, who died at Flushing Hospital, lived in the Malba section of northern Queens.
Though he retired years ago, Maher, like McSorley's itself, was a font of froth and fact about the bar and its memorabilia, which includes a sawdust-sprinkled floor, a pair of Harry Houdini's escape-proof handcuffs, a wanted poster for "the Murderer" John Wilkes Booth and an icky accumulation of wishbones that dangles from a gas lamp over the bar.
Maher would explain that the turkey furcula tradition dated to World War I, when departing doughboys, after finishing their last full meal stateside, would hang the bones above the bar as a good luck wish that they would return safely.
As a bartender, manager and owner, he was philosophical, often reminding family and friends, "It's not what you become in life but what you overcome."
In 1970, after Mayor John V. Lindsay signed legislation barring discrimination in public places because of gender, altercations erupted at McSorley's between longtime customers and female newcomers.
"I'm afraid it will be this way for a few days," Maher told The New York Times. "They're a little upset, you see."
It took a little longer, until 1986, in fact, until McSorley's added a women's restroom. Still, Maher said, the bar somehow survived.
"That was the end of an era," he said, "but it hasn't changed McSorley's." If anything, he said, publicity over the lawsuit benefited business.
"When I started working for him full time 26 years ago, I was McSorley's first female bartender and a little nervous going in -- wondering what the old-timers would say or think," his daughter Teresa said. (Her husband, Gregory, is an artist and bartender there, too.) "But my father said these words to quell my concerns: 'Teresa, just tell them you're about your father's business.' And so, I am. And continue to be

Epstein abused, trafficked girls in Caribbean until 2018, suit alleges

Texto completo: New evidence shows Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused and trafficked hundreds of young women and girls on his private Caribbean island as recently as 2018, significantly expanding the scope of his alleged conduct, a top law enforcement official said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.
Epstein, a wealthy financier who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail last year, was bringing girls as young as 11 and 12 to his secluded estate in the Virgin Islands, known as Little St. James, and kept a computerized database to track the availability and movements of women and girls, the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit, which was filed by Denise George, attorney general of the Virgin Islands, broadened the dimensions of the wrongdoing in which Epstein was said to have engaged. He had been charged by Manhattan prosecutors in July with sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in New York and Florida, but they did not point to any actions beyond 2005.
In August, Epstein hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was being held awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. The circumstances surrounding his death are now the subject of at least three federal investigations.
In the weeks before Epstein killed himself, he and his lawyers vigorously denied the criminal charges. His lawyers had previously said he had been law-abiding since his 2008 conviction in Florida for solicitation.
The new accusations argue that Epstein ran a decadeslong sex trafficking scheme that had a primary nexus in the Virgin Islands.
Epstein used a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude, using fraudulent modeling visas to transport them across state lines and international borders, the lawsuit said. He tracked their availability and proximity using the database, court documents said.
In one instance, according to the lawsuit, one young girl attempted to swim off Epstein's island and escape after she was forced to engage in sex acts with one of his co-conspirators.
The girl was found and held hostage on Epstein's island after he confiscated her passport, the suit said.

Texto completo: TODAY-JAN. 24
>> Festival highlights the art of clowning
Enjoy a week of “clowning comedy” with the Aloha Haha Festival, with shows in Chinatown and on the University of Hawaii-Manoa campus over the next nine days.
Anna Walden, a performer in the festival, said the shows are rooted in the teachings of Philippe Gaulier, a famous clown and teacher based in France who is considered a “guru” of clowning worldwide — as transmitted by Aitor Basauri, a disciple of Gaulier from Spain, who has been teaching clowning here for the last five years.
This is not clowning that you would see at a circus. “We think of clowning as the traditional painted face, red nose and big shoes,” Walden said. “But really, clowning for us is a preservation of innocence. It’s working from a place of ‘blank canvas,’ and usually we lean towards comedy, but it can be a great source of tragedy and drama as well.”
A central production is “Haha Hawai‘i (The Show),” which was developed locally over the last few years. It’s an “attempt to bring back humor and laughter to the island, and to empower people through laughter,” Walden said. “We touch on the creation of Hawaii and the colonization of Hawaii, and we talk about Rap Reiplinger’s ‘room service.’ It’s a celebration of local culture and a direct look at what we’ve lost over time.”
Shows include Walden’s “Pearl City Sunshine,” on stage today. It’s inspired by her grandfather, who died recently after a long and eventful life. “He grew up in Chinatown, he was orphaned because one of his parents was Japanese and the other Chinese, he saw Pearl Harbor, he participated in the Korean War,” Walden said. “(The show) deals with telling the story of his life, but through my perspective.”
Also on the schedule today: award-winning one-man show “Tiramisu” with visiting artist Michael Burgos of Virginia. He’s been described as “part mime, part clown, part zany, part goof-off” who has “perfected a unique comic persona.”

>> Women play “Men on Boats”
Kevin Keaveney founded Kailua Onstage Arts to present plays that Oahu’s older theater groups weren’t doing. KOA’s next show, Punjabi-American playwright Jaclyn Backhaus’ “Men on Boats,” is a good example.
The story is a retelling of American military officer John Wesley Powell’s 1869 voyage of exploration through the Grand Canyon — but Backhaus requires that it be performed by an all-female cast.
“’Men on Boats’ upends what would otherwise be a standard adventure yarn,” Keaveney said. “It teases out threads that question our assumptions of gender roles and the drive to be first, and a frontier that has been both mythologized and forgotten.”
Backhaus doesn’t require that her all-female cast be directed by a female. Keaveney is delighted to be able to direct.
“I have always loved stories of the Old West,” he explained. “I was raised on a steady diet of, first, traditional John Wayne/Lone Ranger Westerns and, later, revisionist Westerns which criticized the white man’s destruction of Native America’s land and people. This play seems to go a step further, in that it’s able to recognize both the underlying heroic qualities of pioneers as well as the negative impact of Manifest Destiny, and do it all without hitting you over the head with a message.”
The play’s author has good reasons for requiring that “Men on Boats” be performed by females playing males, Keaveney said. “The hard-living adventurous explorers that she had written in her play were characters that were normally not available for women to play,” he said. “However, the joy of this casting is not limited to a levelling of the playing field. Because the contrast between the actor and the character being portrayed is presented as a matter of fact, the end result is a shift of focus onto qualities of courage, curiosity, and comradeship that we all share.”

>> Americana music takes heart with Jason Isbell
Grammy winner Jason Isbell brings his rich blend of storytelling, sentimentality and country rock to Blaisdell Concert Hall this weekend.
The Alabama native has been performing since his teen years and started performing with the Southern alternative rock band Drive-by Truckers in his early 20s, writing a lovely tune, “Goddamn Lonely Love” for them. They parted ways in 2007.
It took five years for his career to rebound with his single “Alabama Pines,” which won Song of the Year at the 2012 Americana Awards. That was also the year Isbell went to rehab for a drinking problem; he’ll mark 7 years of sobriety next month.
Isbell’s 2013 album “Southeastern” rose to No. 5 on the Billboard Indie Chart and was praised by Bruce Springsteen and John Prine, who told Rolling Stone magazine: “I really haven’t heard anybody that different in probably 30 years.”
With songs about lost love, lost dreams, lonely rural towns and even lonelier people — one of the songs from his 2017 album “The Nashville Sound” is titled “Last of My Kind” — Isbell has been called “one of America’s thoroughbred songwriters” by the New York Times. He won two Grammys from his 2015 album “Something More than Free.”
Isbell will be performing with his band, The 400 Unit, pictured below, including vocalist and fiddle player Amanda Shires, to whom Isbell is married, with guitarist/vocalist Sadler Vaden, bassist Jimbo Hart, keyboard player Derry DeBorja, and drummer Chad Gamble.

>> Musical maverick headlines Soulgasm
Soulgasm, the long-running dance monthly, brings an internationally respected musician, composer, DJ and performer to the decks this week.
Mark de Clive-Lowe straddles cultures by nature. He’s described himself as a “half-Japanese half-New Zealander” who was born in New Zealand and graduated from high school in Japan, where he spent his free time haunting jazz clubs. Eventually, he dedicated himself to electronic dance music, spending 10 years in London immersed in drum-and-bass, house and broken-beat genres.
He’s played piano and keyboards since he was a youth, and has released both jazz albums and beats-propelled music blending electronic sounds, hip-hop, funk, jazz and world music, collaborating with popular performers including Lauryn Hill, Sheila E. and Jody Watley.
As a DJ, De Clive-Lowe fills dance floors with his live, “re-mix” approach to performance, playing keyboards to complement his selections. He co-founded a club night, “Church,” in Los Angeles in 2010, and has released two albums of music from the club. His 2016 album “#Bluenoteremixed Vol. 1” takes the approach to new heights, recorded live as Clive-Lowe remixed samples from the venerable Blue Note Records catalog, joined by guest musicians.

Texto completo: Editor's Note: The following story contains graphic language that readers may find offensive.
STEVENS POINT – A Stevens Point man running against incumbent City Council member David Shorr has a history of making inflammatory posts on social media that he said are wholly meant as satire.
The posts that Corey Kealiher, 41, said are satire include those making light of the genocide of Native Americans, sexual assault and school shootings. Two posts appear to express displeasure at the lack of law enforcement deaths in recent police shootings in Pennsylvania and Florida. Kealiher is campaigning for the District 2 council seat on the east side of Stevens Point.
Kealiher described himself on his LinkedIn as a comedy content creator. He said in an interview he identifies as a libertarian. He runs two comedy and satire websites and a YouTube comedy sketch channel, which are associated with the social media accounts, that mock President Donald Trump, liberals, conservatives and other topics or groups of people.
Kealiher said in an interview the posts on his accounts, which use the handle "hoopydoo" and his real name, do not reflect what he believes and that his accounts on Twitter and Gab, a conservative alternative to Twitter, were "100% satire."
"I promise I'm not an alt-white, women-hating Nazi or whatever else any of that comes off as — a cop hater. It's 100% satire," Kealiher said in an interview.
Kealiher said he performs web and social media marketing services through PinPoint Local of Stevens Point. He said he also has a history of volunteer and charity work in the community, such as assisting special needs adults with Creative Community Volunteer Services in Plover for almost 14 years, the YMCA's adaptive recreation programs and the Wisconsin-Nicaragua Partners of the Americas.
He said he doesn't have any animus toward police and has friends who work in law enforcement. He said he separates those postings from his personal life. He called the posts "satire for satire's sake" and that he used the strong language for "shock value," understanding people will find some of his posts offensive.
"The real tragedy in the #miramarshooting is that not one cop was shot," Kealiher tweeted on Dec. 6, 2019.
The shooting Kealiher commented on took place on Dec. 5, when robbers stole a UPS truck in Miramar, Florida, prompting a police chase that ended with four people dead, including the UPS driver and a bystander motorist, The Associated Press reported.
Kealiher said the purpose of his posts in the aftermath of police shootings is to make both sides look completely ridiculous at the same time.
"So, when you go on Twitter at a really inflammatory time like that, you're going to get essentially two positions: You're going to have the people on the left saying total abuse of justice, whatever, trigger-happy cops, that kind of thing. And you're going to have the people on the right basically saying exactly the opposite," he said.
The motivation for his posts, he said, comes from how ferocious modern politics has become. In general, he picks the controversial topic of the day, he said.
"I mean, when you go on any form of social media and people are just at each other's throats about stuff, to me, you have two options. You can get either angry and offended by it or you can think of some way to laugh at it and make light of it," Kealiher said in an interview. "Those are really the only options you have and that's the way I've chosen to go with it."
Kealiher's other post about law enforcement came earlier in 2019 after a police standoff in Philadelphia left six officers injured.
"#PhiladelphiaShooting is why I'm 100% against gun control. How would people be able to shoot cops?" Kealiher tweeted on Aug. 14, 2019.
In posts to both Twitter and Gab, Kealiher talked about Facebook suspending him multiple times. His first post on Gab in 2017 said an anti-gay slur was "one of the most beautifully crafted insults ever devised."
"I'm really just here because I want to be able to say 'f-----' again. Not as a slur against gays, of course, it's just one of the most beautifully crafted insults ever devised, and its (sic) not fair that Facebook turned it into another N-word. I miss whipping 'f-----' out when it's called for...," Kealiher posted on the Gab on Sept. 29, 2017.
Kealiher also posted a transgender-pedophilia joke on Twitter on March 11, 2017.
He said he wasn't sure how people are supposed to interpret those posts and how they might reflect what kind of job he'd do on the City Council because they're satire and the posts don't represent him personally.
"A lot of it is dark humor. I know it's out there. I guess if you want to make it an issue, that's fine. Most people don't know, even care," Kealiher said.
In a January 2019 Gab post, he said Facebook suspended him for hate speech for a joke about Muslims flying planes.
Kealiher made posts on Gab and Twitter that make light of the systematic killing of Native Americans in U.S. history, including comments about Christopher Columbus' brutal treatment of indigenous people and the Trail of Tears.
Some 2018 posts on his Twitter and Gab accounts include posts making light of rape, sexual assault and the #MeToo movement. Other posts include comments about celebrating International Women's Day by masturbating to favorite porn actresses and saying polygamy was the answer to a New York Times opinion piece where the author discusses what she sees as persisting gaps in the division of parenting labor between husbands and wives.
"The clear answer for a more 'fair share' in the division of labor is polygamy. If one wife can't handle the housework on her own, take on another wife to give her a hand. Maybe a third wife to rub your feet and make you a sandwich while the other two are busy with the chores. See, there's a simple solution to everything," Kealiher posted on Gab on May 5, 2019.
Kealiher made posts about school shootings in the immediate aftermath of such shootings.
"Is the problem too many guns to shoot, or too many kids to shoot? #GunControlNow ? Or #BirthControlNow ?" Kealiher tweeted on May 19, 2018.
Ten people died in a high school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, on May 18, 2018.
Two months before the Texas shooting, 17 people were killed and another 17 were injured at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14, 2018. Kealiher posted several tweets joking about school shootings, gun control and nationwide student walkouts in the days and weeks after the shooting.
"The only thing there is to stop a bad kid with a gun is a good kid with a gun! #GunReformNow," he posted on Gab on Feb. 15, 2018.
The race between Kealiher and Shorr will be one of two contested elections for Stevens Point City Council when voters go to the polls on April 7.
Keahiler told the Stevens Point Journal he didn't think he needed to delete all those posts before he decided to run for office, even though he knew some voters won't understand or accept the satire.
"I know better too," he acknowledged. "I know better because of the way people react on social media."
After the interview, Kealiher deleted his Gab account and changed posts from his Twitter account to protected, making them viewable only to people he lets follow him. He also changed the bio of the profile on his @hoopydoo Twitter account to explicitly state the posts were parody and satire.
Shorr, the two-term City Council incumbent, said he was aware of some of the comments Kealiher made on Facebook but did not see his comments on Twitter or Gab until the Stevens Point Journal asked about them Monday.
"It's hard to know what to make of all of those statements and it's hard to see how he would represent everyone in this community having said so many ugly things about different kinds of people," Shorr said.
Shorr said he did not plan to make a campaign issue out of Kealiher's comments. He said he will instead focus on his own record.
Kealiher said he has no plans to run a negative campaign against Shorr.

Texto completo: Deregulation has been
costly for Americans
Arguing for unregulated markets, Anthony O'Brien gets it wrong in his Jan. 5 op-ed lecturing Sen. Warren on how she "gets it wrong on capitalism." ("Your View by Lehigh economics prof: What Elizabeth Warren gets wrong about capitalism.")
Deregulation has been a key, and terribly costly, strategy in the neo-liberal regime we have lived under for 40 years. The historical record refutes O'Brien's claim.
As documented in the book "America: What Went Wrong?," trucking deregulation killed more than 100 "once-thriving" trucking companies, with a loss of 150,000 jobs. Airline deregulation knocked out 12 airlines, with a loss of more than 50,000 jobs. Today's airline consumers put up with cramped seating, excess charges, local airport closings, etc.
Deregulation of the savings and loan industry produced hundreds of closures in the 1980s and a taxpayer-funded bailout. Deregulation of the banking industry led to the crash of 2007-2008, which caused the loss of millions of jobs, banks "too big to fail" and more taxpayer-funded bailouts.
Because of the threat of unregulated competition, entrenched corporations extract from government favorable regulations, tax breaks, subsidies and bailouts. They also seek to control the market by buying out/merging with competitors, ultimately producing oligopoly if not monopoly.

Dieruff basketball
coach deserves credit
I attended the Dieruff versus Parkland basketball game recently and came away impressed with the job that Dieruff coach Jamil Newsome is doing. I saw a disciplined, scrappy, undermanned squad hold Parkland to a tie at halftime before eventually succumbing to a superior team in the end.
It should not go unnoticed there are some good things working on the east side of Allentown.

We all should vote
in our own self interest
How can the next election be about the children when their parents don't vote? I am a committed voter who raised children while emphasizing the importance of voting, but only one child votes regularly. They are in their late 20s. They don't vote for their children. I am tired of "vote for the benefit of those who cannot."
I am voting for me - where I want to see my taxes go on the local, state and federal level; I vote to see my politicians act on what they campaigned on. I vote because I want the country to be better for me, now, to live in with my children and their children. I vote because I am leading by example to those parents who don't vote.
I am showing the young adults I know that one vote can make a difference. And I continue to tell them "think globally, act locally." I will bring change because I vote for me.

It's a mistake to limit
president's war powers
I just watched Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, delivering her weekly press conference. Democrats says the Soleimani air strike was an escalation of war. They are continuing to work on laws to limit our president's war power as this is being printed.
I can't believe these Democrats are going to tie the hands of our president to defend America.

Wild showed intestinal
fortitude on impeachment
It's stated in Article 2, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution that bribery by a president is an impeachable offense. Mick Mulvaney said on national TV that Trump did ask for a quid pro quo, and then he said to get over it.
It's sad that the country is being run by an individual who neither believes in, nor abides by, the Constitution. U. S. Rep. Susan Wild had the intestinal fortitude, apparently something that Republicans are lacking, to vote for impeachment. She will be getting my vote in November.

Why are we still
fighting in Afghanistan?
People do not mind that we are still in Afghanistan. Does anybody know why? We have lost over 2,400 personnel and untold amounts of money. For what?
Even if we do win ... whatever ... will it have been worth it?
I understand our president would like us to use some of this money to help build the wall between us and Mexico. Why? And from what I have read, President Trump would like to put weapons in space. I am sure that the military-industrial complex is drooling over the possibilities of the amount of money to be spent on that.
Speaking of Afghanistan, they are using AK-47s and improvised explosive devices while we are using million- and billion-dollar weapons. How much progress have we made?
President Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex. He must be rolling over in his grave.

Trump administration
ignores science
Decisions made by government officials should be based on fact-based information, not on the prejudices of the officials making those decisions. Apparently, that is not the case in the Trump administration. I would encourage everyone to read a New York Times article entitled "Science Under Attack: How Trump is Sidelining Researchers and Their Work."
It reports that in three years, the Trump administration curtailed vital scientific research, particularly in areas dealing with the environment and public health. Many officials appointed by Trump to lead agencies responsible for protecting Americans are former lobbyists for fossil fuel and chemical companies.
In many instances, Trump uses "deregulation" as a cover. This goes well beyond ridding our government of wasteful spending. It is a devastating attack on using fact-based knowledge to make critical decisions that affect the health and safety of Americans.
Our government should be promoting the general welfare, not working hand in glove with entities that couldn't care less about our well-being.

Texto completo: President Trump said he ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani to prevent an imminent attack on Americans. Critics of the administration argue proof of that threat hasn't been offered, and even if it existed there must have been other ways to prevent American deaths without increasing tensions with Iran.
Do you think the killing of Soleimani was justified?
General had links
to attacks that
killed Americans
I think the attack on Soleimani was justified. He had links to numerous terrorist attacks that resulted in American deaths. It was just a matter of time until he struck again.
Ed Prescott
Upper Milford Township
It's hard to believe Trump about
reasons for attack
When Sean Spicer faced the cameras on Jan. 21, 2017, to make the patently false statement that Trump's inauguration crowds were the largest in history, we suspected that President Trump would be a ceaseless gusher of half-truths, distortions and lies. And so he has been. The Washington Post's fact checker has tallied over 15,000 lies so far.
The fear we've had is that some day Trump would lie at a time when truth really mattered. And that day has come.
The killing of Soleimani threatened to blow up Iran. For now, the major casualty seems to be the passenger jet that jittery Iranian troops apparently shot down by mistake. But the full damage to come is still unknown.
Trump's explanations keep shifting. His secretary of defense denied knowing about the "four planned embassy attacks" that Trump cited. It's been reported that Trump wanted to assassinate Soleimani since last summer and was waiting for an excuse, which came when an Iraqi-born American contractor was killed in a mortar attack indirectly linked to Soleimani.
Those of us who don't trust Trump have been waiting for him to have his "wag the dog" moment: ordering a military action to distract from his impeachment. Since we can't believe Trump's word, we can't know if this killing, which has created chaos across a whole region, was justified.

We must trust
our president
Trump's decision to take out this Iranian general and terrorist leader was totally justifiable. The man was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people - Americans, Iraqis and others. Few people will shed tears for Soleimani.
Obviously, the Trump administration did have information that Soleimani was preparing for an immediate attack to kill many more people, including Americans. This is shortly after Iranians stormed the United States embassy in Iraq. When these decisions are made, it's not always possible to have a meeting with everyone in Washington to decide what to do. We also can't tell the whole world about all the details prior to carrying out the mission.
We must trust our elected president and his administration to do the right thing when the opportunity presents itself. I do not believe that the Trump administration in any way is looking to start a war with Iran. Iran has committed several acts of war, shooting down an American drone, hijacked oil tanker ships, etc.
Trump has not overreacted to these acts, since no one was killed in them. I believe this shows a lot of strength by our president after these warlike actions from Iran. One of the main jobs for any United States president is to protect American citizens and armed forces personnel from foreign adversaries.
Bob Halsey
LowerMacungieTownship
Killing brings risk
of cyberterrorism
As a civilian with no access to high-level military intelligence, I cannot assess whether the killing of Gen. Soleimani prevented "an imminent attack on Americans." Many people with military and diplomatic experience in the Middle East have publicly stated that the world is a bit safer after Soleimani's death. Even if the attack was justified, we need to think about possible responses from Iran and other hostile states.
Presumably President Trump is pursuing a three-part strategy concerning Iran, consisting of economic, diplomatic and military elements. This strategy will likely continue unless and until Iran stops funding terrorist activities and stops developing nuclear weapons.
The killing of Soleimani appears to carry some risks. Many in Iran see this attack as a de facto declaration of war and are crying for revenge.
What concerns me more than the prospect of either a nuclear or conventional war with Iran are widespread and prolonged cyberattacks. Acts of cyberterrorism could cripple our infrastructure and disrupt our lives for extended periods of time.
I was disheartened to learn that China, Russia and Iran held joint naval drills in the Gulf of Oman last month. That may have been nothing but saber rattling. But we should hope and pray that those two nations do not cooperate with Iran in cyberattacks. After all, China and Russia have the financial and technological resources that Iran could use. In the meantime, I pray for more diplomacy and fewer bombings.
John Servis

Death is unlikely
to stop terror attacks
My fellow writers will give opinions of the political climate created after our president ordered the bombing. I think it's important to discuss the timing to assess its justification.
Some background facts are appropriate:
1979: Iran/U.S. hostage crisis had a strong effect on Trump.
1988: U.S. accidentally shot down an Iranian passenger jet, killing 290 people.
2012: Trump predicted President Obama would attack Iran to win reelection.
Last 90 days: The president promised campaign dollars and personal support for the reelection campaigns of senators loyal to him during impeachment hearings.
Last 30 days: According to the New York Times, President Trump told associates he would appease the GOP war hawks by choosing the assassination option with Iran. The president previewed his decision to bomb murderous Gen. Soleimani with hawkish GOP Senators Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton.
Do you believe that Gen. Soleimani's death will stop any Iranian planned or supported future attacks? That's nonsense.

Texto completo: WAUSAU – Early forecasts show that snow is expected this weekend in Wausau, and for the first time in more than a century, you can rest easy about packing some of it up and throwing a snowball at your friend.
Wausau city officials voted Tuesday night to change the language of the now-famed "snowball ordinance," making it legal to throw snowballs on city property once again. It will likely take effect by the end of the week, said City Council President Lisa Rasmussen.
A city ordinance technically banned snowball fights. It was a small part of a larger ordinance that bans people from throwing objects such as stones, arrows and yes, even snowballs, on city-owned property.
Gary Gisselman was the single "no" vote on changing the ordinance. He said "snowball" was a good word to have, and the city knows how it's enforced even if others don't.
It was originally believed to be adopted in 1962. However, City Attorney Anne Jacobson did some more digging and said it's been on the books since at least 1884 that you can't throw snowballs on public property, even with slightly different language.
The City Council decided to reconsider the law after some negative national headlines this past holiday season. It first began when a television station published a story the day before Thanksgiving, which then got picked up elsewhere. Barstool Sports called Wausau "the worst town in America" for outlawing snowball fights.
Inaccuracies popped up in the early stories, which suggested that the ordinance was recently adopted. Negative social media posts began to spiral. Mayor Robert Mielke received a threat from someone in Ohio, Rasmussen said, that was credible enough to forward to the police. The story itself snowballed.
"In a time where extreme words and actions happen all too easily and quickly, what might have started as a lighthearted story on a slow news day became anything but that," Rasmussen said.
The police department and City Hall cleared up any confusion and inaccuracies about the snowball ordinance with a video last month. The "ban" is rarely enforced. Police have written citations under the ordinance only about 10 times in the last 15 years, Deputy Chief Matt Barnes said.
Barnes then threw a snowball right at the back of Mielke's head. (He wasn't cited for the incident.)
After the city's video gained traction online, the Associated Press wrote a story about a potential end to the snowball ordinance. It was picked up by newspapers like the Chicago Tribune and the Minneapolis Star Tribune, both of which published it late last month.
Then the New York Times published its own story about the snowball ordinance and the police department's video, making Wausau a national Christmas story.
You might also have seen the story on Fox6 News Milwaukee, CBS News, TIME Magazine and more.
Rasmussen said that whether the revised ordinance passed or not, its application and level of enforcement wouldn't change.
"Listing it specifically has created this narrative about Wausau banning snowball fights, which was never the intent," Rasmussen said.
The full text of Wausau ordinance 9.08.020 used to read:
"No person shall throw or shoot any object, arrow, stone, snowball or other missile or projectile, by hand or by any other means, at any other person or at, in or into any building, street, sidewalk, alley, highway, park, playground or other public place within the city. This subsection shall not apply to archery ranges under the supervision of the park and recreation committee, nor shall it apply to the bow hunting provisions within 9.08.010."
The new text of the ordinance removes the word "snowball." It also adds "including without limitation, any." It reads:
"No person shall throw or shoot any object, including without limitation, any arrow, stone, or other missile or projectile, by hand or by any other means, at any other person or at, in or into any building, street, sidewalk, alley, highway, park, playground or other public place within the city. This subsection shall not apply to archery ranges under the supervision of the park and recreation committee, nor shall it apply to the bow hunting provisions within 9.08.010."

Black Mountain filmmaker collects oral histories on substance abuse and recovery

Texto completo: In January, Pack Memorial Library in Asheville hosts an oral history exhibition that explores the history of substance use and recovery in Southern Appalachia. The exhibition was created by documentary filmmaker John Kennedy, of Black Mountain, who has spent the past two years collecting oral histories from individuals who are currently using substances or who are in recovery.
"Let Us Now Listen" was unveiled at Pack Memorial Library on Jan. 10 and runs through January. The exhibit features recorded oral histories and portraits by professional photographers.
Photography is by Jeremy Wilson, Scott Sturdy, Keith Wright and Tony Shivers.
The exhibition is a partnership between Kennedy, Pack Memorial Library, Buncombe County Health and Human Services, Department of Health, and the Mountain Area Health Education Center.
Kennedy has collected 53 stories to date with a goal of 100 stories representing a diverse group of men and women who are active or former substance users from across Western North Carolina. These stories explore the intersections between drug use, mental health, sex work, and trauma.
The collection also explores the empowerment and hope that can be found in community-based syringe services, peer support, and treatment.
"Once people began to trust me enough to share their stories, I visited them in their homes, workplaces, cars, benches in a park — wherever they would see me," Kennedy said.
"I invited each of them to answer the same two questions: (1) what do you want to share about your experience and (2) what do you want the outside world to know about your experience? Then I listened."
Michelle Henson, a peer support specialist in recovery from substance use, has transcribed recordings of these interviews that range in length from 20 minutes to 2 hours. Excerpts from these interviews are included in the exhibition.
"When we break the silence, we break the cycle in our own lives and help others who still suffer," says Ginger Malcom, one of the storytellers.
These stories provide an intimate and personal look at the data collected on the opioid epidemic by the Buncombe County Health and Human Services, Department of Health, which will be on display as a story map.
About the oral historian John Kennedy is a master at listening. In 2017, he produced a documentary for PBS "Frontline," with The New York Times, about individuals leaving the prison system called "Life On Parole." In 2018, he directed and produced a 14-part video series for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Southern Poverty Law Center's "Teaching Tolerance" program about community traditions and better health outcomes. Kennedy has also directed and produced short documentary pieces for Open Society Foundations, the UN Millennium Campaign, and the Global Fund. His journalism has appeared in USA Today, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and other publications. He has also received international attention for his art activism. Kennedy named this exhibit "Let Us Now Listen" in honor of James Agee's collection of Southern Appalachian oral histories from the Great Depression entitled "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men." Agee's work inspired Kennedy to always look for the beauty in people's stories.

Texto completo: New evidence shows Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused and trafficked hundreds of young women and girls on his private Caribbean island as recently as 2018, significantly expanding the scope of his alleged conduct, a top law enforcement official said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.
Epstein, a wealthy financier who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail last year, was bringing girls as young as 11 and 12 to his secluded estate in the Virgin Islands, known as Little St. James, and kept a computerized database to track the availability and movements of women and girls, the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit, which was filed by Denise George, attorney general of the Virgin Islands, broadened the dimensions of the wrongdoing in which Epstein was said to have engaged. He had been charged by Manhattan prosecutors in July with sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in New York and Florida, but they did not point to any actions beyond 2005.
In August, Epstein hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was being held awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. The circumstances surrounding his death are now the subject of at least three federal investigations.
In the weeks before Epstein killed himself, he and his lawyers vigorously denied the criminal charges. His lawyers had previously said he had been law-abiding since his 2008 conviction in Florida for solicitation.
The new accusations argue that Epstein ran a decadeslong sex trafficking scheme that had a primary nexus in the Virgin Islands.
Epstein used a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude, using fraudulent modeling visas to transport them across state lines and international borders, the lawsuit said. He tracked their availability and proximity using the database, court documents said.
In one instance, according to the lawsuit, one young girl attempted to swim off Epstein's island and escape after she was forced to engage in sex acts with one of his co-conspirators.
The girl was found and held hostage on Epstein's island after he confiscated her passport, the suit said.

Texto completo: Newly revealed surveillance video circulating on social media appears to show two missiles slamming into a Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed, killing all 176 people aboard minutes after takeoff from Tehran a week ago.
Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, told USA TODAY it's possible the plane would have survived the first hit.
"It's conceivable that if they hadn't fired the second shot, the outcome might have been different," Goelz said. "The second shot was the kill shot that took them out."
The video was verified by The New York Times and Storyful, a social media company owned by the parent of The Wall Street Journal. USA TODAY has not independently verified the authenticity of the video.
The blurry video appears to show a missile launching from a site near Imam Khomeini International Airport and hitting the plane, moments before the second one hits. In flames, the plane circles back to the airport. It crashed minutes later, just missing a village near the airport.
The video might explain why the plane's transponder failed before the crash.
U.S. officials identified the weapon as the Gauntlet, a Russian-made SA-15 surface-to-air missile system. Goelz said he is not surprised that it took two missiles to take down the plane.
"A single missile designed to take down fighter planes would not ordinarily take down a 737," Goelz told USA TODAY. "This was not 'Top Gun,' not a two-seat plane. I don't know if the (737) pilots could have made a safe landing, but they could probably have controlled it a little bit."
For three days, the Iranian military rejected claims that Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down. Then Saturday, the military issued a statement saying the plane was accidentally shot down after being misidentified as a cruise missile "due to human error at a time of heightened U.S. threats of war."
The news triggered angry protests across the country, and news of a second missile could further inflame Iranians outraged by the government's handling of the tragedy.
Fahim Masoud, Middle East regional intelligence manager for the risk assessment firm WorldAware, said the plane disaster exposed the incompetence of the regime and its military forces. It also reflected the government's fears of an overwhelming U.S. strike, he told USA TODAY.
"The second missile strike will definitely trigger outrage both inside and outside Iran," Masoud said. "This incident will haunt the Iranian regime and Iranians for years to come.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have promised a thorough investigation. Most of the passengers were Iranian or Canadian, and representatives of those countries met with Ukrainian authorities Tuesday to share information on the crash.

Texto completo: Conor McGregor knew it was time to turn things around before it got too late.
McGregor, the former UFC two-division champion, had his fighting career put on hold in 2019 as he dealt with an array of legal issues, drawing comparisons to legendary heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson.
In 1992, Tyson was convicted of raping 18-year-old beauty pageant Desiree Washington and served three years in prison, which derailed his boxing career.
Fast-forward to 2019. In late March, The New York Times reported that McGregor was the subject of a sexual assault investigation in Ireland. Nearly seven months later in October, the newspaper reported that McGregor was being investigated for a second alleged sexual assault in his home country. He has denied the allegations made against him.
McGregor's year also included pleading guilty to assault after he was caught on camera sucker-punching a man in an Irish pub. One month before that incident, McGregor was caught on camera smashing a man's cellphone after he tried to take a photo of McGregor outside a Miami hotel; McGregor later settled out of court, and charges were dropped.
While McGregor admits that he might've been headed down a similar path as Tyson, he's confident he has put everything behind him ahead of his octagon return Saturday against Donald Cerrone at UFC 246.
"Now here's the thing: Yeah, definitely Mike Tyson has had his ups and his downs, and his money management has kind of led him to be in a position he shouldn't have really been in. But if you look at Mike now, he's got his money, he's got his weed thing going, he's well for himself. But, yeah, I don't want to go down that path," McGregor told Severe MMA. "I didn't want to go down that path, and maybe I was heading down that path a little bit, so just listening to myself, listening to the close people around me that I respect, and just making amends with things.
"I know what I need to do. I knew what I needed to do and what I shouldn't have been doing. I just listened to myself and followed my orders, and it's just made me a better individual, just a better man. I'm just in a much better place."
As McGregor's fame and fortune have grown – thanks to his 2017 "Money Fight" with Floyd Mayweather and success of his Proper Twelve whiskey – there's been a notion that he is surrounded by "yes" men who have failed to stop him from a potential career downfall.
But McGregor, who has reunited with his team, including his old boxing coaches from Crumlin, heavily dismisses that notion.
"Oh, that's baloney," McGregor said. "I hear the way people try to twist the narrative. Like I said, those narratives that people try and spread have been irritating me, and that's the kind of thing that causes me to react, and I get angry. The disrespect … it's meaningless. These people do not know what they're talking about. Like, how dare they say the people in my camp are 'yes' men?
"The people in my camp are actually masters, tacticians, master tacticians, across all ranges. Leaders among men are in my camp. It's all baloney, so I just stopped paying attention to all that, and it's just like – trust me when I tell you I do not have 'yes' men. We're all on this journey together."

'Almost, Maine' affirms the power of truth and the wonder of love Portland Stage reprises the popular play about a fictional town, with the playwright, John Cariani, in a starring role.

Texto completo: It's always a good time for love. But especially now, says Sally Wood, who directs "Almost, Maine," which opened this week at Portland Stage.
The play, written by Mainer and Tony-nominated Broadway actor John Cariani, has a celebrated history with the theater. It debuted at Portland Stage in 2004, becoming the most popular play in the theater's history and one of the most-produced plays in American theater. Portland Stage artistic director Anita Stewart brought it back for Maine's bicentennial year, with Cariani in a starring role as an actor.
Cariani, who was born in Massachusetts and grew up in Presque Isle, wrote "Almost, Maine" to celebrate the common lives of common people, and particularly common people who live rurally. It's a fictional play set in a fictional town, but it's about the people he grew up with and places like Presque Isle.
Wood thinks it's a perfect play for our times because its central message is one of love and empathy. Our world needs more of both, she said.
"There is a gentleness to this play, I think," she said. "There is a respect for a class of people that sometimes doesn't get a whole lot of respect or thought. That's what I love about this play. It's about people who are just trying to get by, for whom there appears nothing significant about their lives. They are not the governor of the state or something like that, but there is magic within them. I love that. It makes makes me feel that my life has the capacity for magic, too."
The play is told in a series of eight vignettes, each dedicated to a couple in various stages of falling in and out of love on a cold, starry night in a faraway place. The characters are full of wonder, hope and desire, and are trusting and vulnerable. They refuse to live with cynical hearts. It's a love story, even if Cariani's story doesn't always end happily. "Everybody is dealing with life, love and death," Cariani has said about his play. "That's why I wrote 'Almost, Maine.' "
In an interview last fall after Portland Stage announced the revival, Cariani told the Press Herald, "I want Mainers to know that 'Almost, Maine' is not just a good play for Maine. It's a good play for all. The stories about rural people and their hardscrabble lives are always told as if they are in the past. Hardscrabble lives exist in the present, and we don't pay a whole lot of attention to them in American art and culture," he said. "But just because your life is hard, that doesn't mean it's 100 percent sad. There is a lot of hope in hard lives, and that's what we need to remind people who are sad and trying to be happy."
Since its debut in Portland in 2004, the play has been staged across America and across the world, with more than 4,000 productions. It's been especially popular with high school drama departments and community theaters, because of its hopeful message and because it's a relatively simple play to produce with opportunities for many actors. Most professional theater companies produce the play with four actors, but it can be produced with as many as 20. And there's no foul language in the play.
Despite the play's popularity, it has had trouble with some big-city critics, which Cariani attributes to the jaded nature of people who live in cities. They sometimes find the play off-putting because of the lack of cynicism in the characters, he thinks.
A review in the New York Times of an off-Broadway revival in 2014, which included Cariani in the cast, seems to reflect the dismissive attitude that Cariani is talking about. With faint praise, the reviewer called the play "a higher-concept and more clever version" of movies like "Love Actually" that never transcends the romantic-comedy genre "and its core audience." The reviewer praised Cariani's writing as "so earnest and thoughtful ... that's it's hard not to let the cheese slide."
In addition to Cariani, the Portland Stage version includes Raymond McAnally, Kathy McCafferty and Samantha Rosentrater. Other than McAnally, they've all acted in the show before. After committing to act in "Almost, Maine," Cariani was cast in the Broadway revival of "Caroline, or Change," which begins rehearsals in early February. Because of that, Portland actor Dustin Tucker will cover for Cariani for the performances on Feb. 5, 6 and 7.
Tucker, who lives in town, has been attending rehearsals and running lines with the cast. "We've made clear, Dustin is not understudying John," Wood said. "He is replacing John. I want him to have his own take on this as well. Dustin is so good. He's going to be so much fun, and it will be a different show when Dustin is a part of it."
In Maine, Cariani is best known for the plays he has written. Elsewhere, he is known for his acting and, lately, his singing. He received a Tony Award nomination for his performance in "Fiddler on the Roof" in 2004, and more recently starred in "The Band's Visit" and "Something Rotten!"
Wood has directed two other plays by Cariani, "Last Gas" and "Love Sick," both at Portland Stage. When she signed on as director for "Almost, Maine," Wood was excited. For a brief moment, that excitement turned to anxiety when she considered the pressure of expectation that comes with a play like "Almost, Maine."
"Just don't screw it up," she said to herself.
As rehearsals began, she realized that wasn't likely. This play is as popular as it is, the director said, because it holds up well.
"I trust the story," Wood said. "John wrote a beautiful story."

DEMS TO PROBE 'ALARMING' UKRAINE TEXTS

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A House committee chairman said his panel will investigate what he says are "profoundly alarming" text messages that have raised questions about the possible surveillance of former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch before she was ousted by the Trump administration last spring.
House Democrats on Tuesday night released a trove of documents they obtained from Lev Parnas, a close associate of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. The messages show that a Trump donor named Robert F. Hyde disparaged Ms. Yovanovitch in messages to Mr. Parnas and gave him updates on her location and cellphone use.
Rep. Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Wednesday that the messages are "profoundly alarming" and "suggest a possible risk" to Ms. Yovanovitch's security in Kyiv before she was recalled from her post.
Putin's power shake-up
MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a constitutional overhaul Wednesday to boost the powers of parliament and the Cabinet, a move signalling Mr. Putin's intention to carve out a new position for himself after his current term ends.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev submitted his resignation hours after Mr. Putin discussed the constitutional amendments during his state of the nation address.
The Russian leader thanked Mr. Medvedev for his service but said the prime minister's Cabinet had failed to fulfill all of its objectives. In televised remarks, Mr. Putin said Mr. Medvedev would take up a new position as a deputy head of the presidential Security Council.
Mr. Medvedev, a longtime close associate of Putin's, has served as Russia's prime minister since 2012. He spent four years before that as president in 2008-12, becoming a placeholder when Mr. Putin had to switch into the prime minister's office because of constitutional term limits on the presidency.
Plane hit by 2 missiles
Security camera footage verified by The New York Times shows that two missiles fired 30 seconds apart took down Flight 752, killing all aboard.
The New York Times has verified security camera footage on Tuesday that shows, for the first time, that two missiles hit Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 on Jan. 8. The missiles were launched from an Iranian military site around 8 miles from the plane.
The new video fills a gap about why the plane's transponder stopped working, seconds before it was hit by a second missile.
An earlier Times analysis confirmed what Iran later admitted: that an Iranian missile did strike the plane. The Times also established that the transponder stopped working before that missile hit the plane. The new video appears to confirm that an initial strike disabled the transponder, before the second strike, also seen in the video, around 23 seconds later.
Neither strike downed the plane immediately. The new video shows the airliner on fire, circling back toward Tehran's international airport.

Texto completo: You have to be good to write bad.
Excuse me, I meant to type "badly" there. Or did I? I'm not sure anymore. I've just spent hours combing through the entries to the Bad Writing Contest, an old Pittsburgh newspaper tradition that I've resurrected after a 29-year hiatus.
Sometimes something is so bad it's good, like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" or "Dolemite" or Necco Wafers. When I put out the call to readers, tens were elated.
"Thank your for re-instituting the Bad Writing Contest," Roy Kim of West View wrote. "I miss it terribly, even though I have no recollection of it ever existing."
A veritable plethora (nearly all plethoras are "veritable," I've noticed) of poorly practiced prose poured propitiously from Pennsylvania. I felt like a man holding a single plastic bag and trying to clean up after a Kenny Chesney concert.
So I've decided to play this exactly like "Jeopardy! Greatest of All Time." That is, apart from the small difference of our top prize being a million dollars lighter. And that we anticipate 14.4 million fewer viewers.
I will spend several columns presenting the best of the worst I've been offered, and will ask you, gentle readers, to email your decisions on who sank most to this occasion. I will then, of course, ignore all votes.
To review the Jan. 5 set-up, I unabashedly ripped off one Jeremy Das, of Loughborough, England, who won the crime/detective prize in the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest with this gem:
Realising that his symptoms indicated a virtually undetectable, fast-acting neurotoxin, CIA coroner Quinn Abner frantically wrote up the details, lay on the floor and, as a professional courtesy, did his best to draw a chalk outline of himself.
PG readers were invited to either extend that narrative or come up with a fresh one by Jan. 31. I'll begin today with readers who chose to build the kind of extension that shouldn't get an occupancy permit. Please note I have edited entries down to their nubs, confident I only made them worse.
.
This rudimentary chalk outline, resembling the route of out-of-town drivers navigating bike lane protocol, did not go well due to his grossly corpulent figure, the shakes of someone coming off a three-day bender on Carson Street, and his alligator arms which incidentally had nothing to do to his parsimonious habits when it came time to pick up a check. (Tim Brown, Deutschtown)
* * *
Quinn was fiercely ambidextrous (he could wax poetic and his Buick simultaneously), but he ran out of chalk. Despondent, he thought of his unemployed neighbor, Tallulah, who had been the meat station attendant at a vegan laundromat. Tallulah was proud of her ham croquettes, which were as perfectly round as bowling balls but lacked finger holes. She intended to bring them to her networking luncheon (the croquettes, not the balls) and it worked: Marvin hired Tallulah as a teller for PNC. Becoming an expert at serving lattes through those drive-up tubes while also assessing late fees, Tallulah rocketed through the fiberglass ceiling (the elimination of glass having prevented millions of female head lacerations) by becoming Head Teller at the PNC branch inside a Sewickley pawn shop. Emboldened by her new PNC title, Tallulah petitioned the courts to change her last name to "Bankhead." And the rest is Hollywood history, dahling. (Dale Abraham, North Side)
* * *
Chalk! Sweet, white, delicious chalk. The chalk brought to mind thoughts of childhood, and the many hours Quinn had spent volunteering to clap erasers together in Mrs. Applebaum's first-grade classroom, which had 18 children in it, up until his best friend, Gregory, was maimed in the sledding accident. After that, the class had only 17 kids in it. "Anyway, what is it about chalk?", Quinn chuckled to himself as he lay writhing in agony. Was it the smell of chalk that summoned this flood of memories, which were as vivid as the HD picture on the new 55-inch Samsung television that Quinn had just installed over the holidays? Or was it the fact that, at 21, 14 years to the day after the sledding accident, in that very same dust-scented classroom, he had lost his virginity to a newly-divorced Mrs. Applebaum? (Bill Toland, Baldwin borough)
* * *
As he removed his shoes and socks and began to self-attach his body tag, Quinn wondered if his pending doom may have been hastened by a deadly holiday disease, like mistletoe, or the return of the '50s scourge, toelio. He slid himself into the freezer compartment like a Japanese salaryman squeezing into a Capsule hotel, and locked the door. As he waited for the neurotoxin and lack of oxygen to kill him, his symptoms subsided and he realized that he'd be dying for no reason. He cried out, but the soundproof freezer made it a mute point. (Jay Lynch, Upper St. Clair)

Texto completo: At least 77 people have been killed and 94 injured in northeast Pakistan after a series of avalanches destroyed and buried houses, local officials said Wednesday.
The avalanches were triggered by heavy snowfall in the Neelum Valley, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, according to local authorities.
Dozens of houses had been wrecked and buried by the snow, with most of those killed and injured in their homes when the avalanches hit, said Ahmad Raza Qadri, state minister for disaster management and rehabilitation, on Tuesday.
The death toll may continue to rise, as there are fears that many people may still be trapped.
In the aftermath, desperate villagers conducted a search-and-rescue attempt to find those buried in the avalanche, carrying shovels and wading into the deep snow.
Emergency personnel are also on the ground responding to the crisis. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Tuesday he had asked the national disaster agency, the military and federal ministers to provide humanitarian assistance to the affected residents.
Several of the injured victims were airlifted by army helicopters to the region's capital, Muzaffarabad, for treatment, and more helicopters will airdrop food and essential supplies to residents cut off by snow.
In a tweet on Tuesday, the region's Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider Khan extended his condolences to those affected, adding that his administration would "leave no stone unturned to alleviate the sufferings of (the) affected population."
The avalanches come during one of the harshest winters in 20 years. Daily life in Pakistan-administered Kashmir had been severely affected, with roads blocked by snow, communication services down, and disruptions to electric power supplies.
Abdul Rahman Sheikh, 62, said an avalanche had buried his home and seven others in his village on Monday. He dug through the snow until midnight to rescue his family, recovering his daughter-in-law - who survived with injuries - and the frozen bodies of eight other family members. He decided to bury the dead first.
"I have eight dead bodies lying in the open. If I send her to the hospital, who will look after her there? And if I go along with her, who will bury the eight bodies?" Mr. Sheikh asked mournfully.
Asif Iqbal, a 25-year-old teacher, said he heard a rumble and a crash Monday afternoon and looked outside to see rooftops of nearby houses barely peeking up from the snow.
"People were screaming and calling for help,'' Mr. Iqbal said. "A schoolgirl from my school was buried alive under one avalanche, and we could only hear her calling for us to save her."
"We had no tools to rescue her and were waiting for a miracle," he continued. "Someone brought a shovel, and we dug a hole in the broken roof of her home and rescued her after three hours. It's nothing but a miracle."
Abdul Rahman, 29, an imam from Bakwali Bala, said he and several others had gathered their families at a house that they thought was a safe distance from avalanche-prone areas. Mr. Rahman said the women and children in their families were told to stay at the house while the men went to neighboring villages to help.
"Suddenly a strong wind blew, and we heard the familiar roar of the avalanche," he said. "But we could not see anything as it was dark, and the village was covered with fog.
Separately, in the country's southwestern province of Balochistan, 16 people have died in 48 hours this week due to rain- and snow-related incidents, said Imran Zarkoon of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.
The powerful avalanches have also affected Indian-controlled areas of the disputed region, with at least 10 people killed on Tuesday, officials said.
The New York Times contributed.

Texto completo: Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda are back in a new season of "Grace and Frankie" on Netflix. And on Freeform, "grown-ish" begins its junior year.
What's Streaming
GRACE AND FRANKIE Stream on Netflix. Lily Tomlin eats takeout noodles with a pair of tongs. Jane Fonda alternates between sips of a margarita and a shot of tequila. These are a couple of the charmingly indulgent things that happen in the new, penultimate season of this warm comedy series. "Grace and Frankie" stars Fonda and Tomlin as frenemies who become inseparable after their husbands (played by Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston) fall in love with each other. One of the main story lines in the new season involves Fonda and Tomlin's characters inventing a device meant to help people lift themselves off toilet seats.
ALADDIN (2019) Stream on Disney Plus; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Aladdin, Jasmine and the singing blue Genie got a whole new multimillion-dollar budget to tell their story in this live-action remake of Disney's 1992 cartoon musical, based on a story from "The One Thousand and One Nights." The new version casts relative newcomers -- Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott -- as the street thief Aladdin and Princess Jasmine, whose love story is accompanied by some new music from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the songwriting duo behind "Dear Evan Hansen." Massoud and Scott are also accompanied by Will Smith, who takes various digital forms as the wish-granting Genie. All of them are bizarre. (Smith's genie, Massoud told The New York Times last year, has "a little bit of 'Hitch' in it; it's got a little bit of 'Bad Boys' in it; a little bit of 'The Pursuit of Happyness' -- it's got a little bit of everything.") In his review for The Times, A.O. Scott wrote that this "Aladdin" update "may not be the worst product of the current era of legacy intellectual property exploitation (it's likely that the worst is yet to come), but like most of the others it invites a simple question: Why?"
What's on TV
GROWN-ISH 8 p.m. on Freeform. In Thursday night's episode of "grown-ish," Zoey Johnson, the eldest child in the family at the center of ABC's "black-ish," heads into her third year of college -- and her third season as the subject of her own spinoff show. In the previous season, Zoey (Yara Shahidi) navigated a year that ended with a consequential kiss. The new season begins with a junior year homecoming party.
NEW YORK, NEW YORK (1977) 8 p.m. on TCM. The year after he starred in Martin Scorsese's "Taxi Driver," Robert De Niro traded his handguns for a saxophone, playing a musician in love in "New York, New York," Scorsese's jazzy musical. The film's plot follows a saxophonist (De Niro) and a pop singer (Liza Minnelli) who fall in love. TCM is showing it alongside Scorsese's MEAN STREETS (1973), airing at 11 p.m., which finds the director on more familiar, gangster-held ground. Those who saw "The Irishman" and want to see De Niro play a young criminal without the aid of digital effects can turn here.

When the Past Roars Into the Present

Texto completo: Revisiting the era of Prohibition let me indulge an obsession and uncovered parallels to today.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Like many Americans today, I have a bit of an obsession with the Roaring '20s. I spent a happy spring wandering around Paris and finding all the spots where Hemingway, Fitzgerald and their gang of expats hung out. I've been known to throw on beaded headbands and fringed dresses for Jazz Age-themed lawn parties. Even my go-to summer cocktail -- a lavender-infused bee's knees -- dates to the days of speakeasies and bathtub gin.
I'm lucky enough that my job involves taking obsessions like this and digging into them in deeper and more interesting ways. In 2018, The New York Times started the process of digitizing the some 6 million photo prints in our archives. These images, many unpublished for decades, date back more than 100 years. For the last year, I, along with others on the archival storytelling team, have been resurfacing photographs from the past and examining how they intersect with the present. As we entered this new decade -- a new '20s -- the anniversary of Prohibition seemed to be the perfect opportunity to do just that.
When most people think of the 1920s, it's the glitzed-up, Gatsby-tinged, Hollywood version that comes to mind. But the decade was also a time of turmoil and transition marked by rising anti-immigrant sentiments and a vast gulf between conservative, rural populations and those in big cities.
Many Americans resented the temperance movement and didn't believe that Prohibition would ever actually happen or be enforced. When reality did set in, the outcry would not have been out of place on Twitter today. An editorial in The New York World on Jan. 16, 1920, the last boozy night, declared, "After 12 o'clock tonight, the Government of the United States as established by the Constitution and maintained for nearly 131 years will cease to exist." Just add a hashtag and you've got yourself the makings of a viral tweet.
We tend to think of history as a done-and-dusted thing, but the people who are living through historical events don't know that they're going to end up on a textbook timeline, or as a theme for parties and fodder for Halloween costumes. We don't know where the demarcations of an era are until we've moved beyond their frame.
The people of 1920 didn't know that the 18th Amendment would be repealed just 13 years later. To many of them, it felt like the end of the world.
When working on an archival story, I always start with The Times's own vast text archive, which is available online. I can search by keyword or I can look by date and digitally scroll through entire issues from the days surrounding the start of Prohibition.
Historians like David Wondrich and Daniel Okrent helped me expand the scope of my research. Some of their advice was specific, pointing me to newspapers like The San Francisco Chronicle, which vividly covered Prohibition preparation. Other times it was a half-remembered anecdote about a woman who bought a liquor store's entire inventory and moved it to her basement that sent me down a research rabbit hole. My sources also included the New York Public Library, Newspapers.com and Chronicling America, a Library of Congress database that provides free digital access to more than 3,000 U.S. newspapers dating from 1789 to 1963.
Memoirs and biographies are also valuable, especially for more personal anecdotes. The woman with the well-stocked basement? That would be Charlotte Hennessey Smith, the mother of the actress Mary Pickford. Stories like hers are my favorite things to discover when digging into a historical period: They bring alive the people of the past not as fusty characters out of a textbook but as three-dimensional human beings who had inside jokes and went on rants about politics and refused to be denied their whiskey.
Our photo editor, Jessie Wender, found images that allowed us to expand the narrative beyond the confines of the text, including the creative ways people smuggled alcohol and repurposed brewery equipment, as well as the dangers of counterfeit liquor.
And when we went to scan many of these prints, we took care to capture their ragged borders, creases and notes from editors past.
Because the photos in our archive are not just images. They are artifacts.

Texto completo: Readers offer advice for the candidates: Don't go negative, focus on the president's shortcomings, name your team.
To the Editor:
Re "Gender and War Dominate Debate by 6 Democrats" (front page, Jan. 15):
I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and, as Bernie Sanders has pointed out, she received three million more votes than Donald Trump, proving that a woman can win the popular vote.
It is disappointing that Elizabeth Warren, facing polls that show she may no longer be in the lead, has resorted to playing the "gender card" by making allegations that Mr. Sanders questioned a woman's electability at a private meeting in 2018.
For most Democrats, the most important thing in this election is defeating Mr. Trump. The polls show that Bernie Sanders, among others, can beat Mr. Trump. But there would be nothing wrong with raising for discussion the difficulties, in the real world, that a democratic socialist would face in the general election.
The same is true with respect to a woman candidate, or, for example, if there were one in the race, the difficulties an atheist would face, regardless of how competent. Ms. Warren appears to be developing a track record of going negative when the polls start to bring bad news.
John M. O'Connor
Montclair, N.J.
To the Editor:
Re "Elizabeth Warren Says Bernie Sanders Sent Volunteers 'Out to Trash Me"' (news article, Jan. 13):
Not even friendships are sacred in the political arena, as Bernie Sanders's campaign claims that Elizabeth Warren is unable to bring any new voters to the Democratic Party. Of course, mudslinging is nothing new. But Mr. Sanders's attempt to tear Ms. Warren down, in efforts to build himself up, speaks more about Mr. Sanders's negativity than it does about Ms. Warren's alleged shortcomings.
And while Mr. Sanders may believe that all is fair in love, war and politics, polls may find Democrats rallying around Ms. Warren as a result. We are 10 months away from the presidential election, and this is only the beginning of what is yet to come.
JoAnn Lee Frank
Clearwater, Fla.
To the Editor:
The last Democratic debate before the Iowa caucuses underscored the candidates' essential unity and agreement on such key concerns as national security and climate change, which should be seen as the most compelling and convincing issues for Democrats in their quest for victory in November. The references to President Trump, however, were overshadowed by the kind of bickering and rehashing of domestic policy that characterized past debates.
Mr. Trump has been giving the Democratic contenders a growing gift of reasons to attack him directly and to limit to one term the damage he has inflicted on our institutions, values and standing on the world stage.
It's past time for the Democratic hopefuls to call more attention to Mr. Trump's reckless foreign policy, disdain for the environment and a host of other issues and not lose sight of the central goal of the 2020 election -- to reverse the harm this president has caused before it's too late.

To the Editor:
I watched the most recent presidential debate and turned off the TV at the end with the same feeling I had after previous debates. I liked all the Democratic contenders but still have no favorite candidate. Most of my friends who are committed Democrats say the same thing: We'll vote for anyone who can beat President Trump.
I suggest that the Democratic candidates consider announcing their team in advance of the primaries and caucuses. Name your vice-presidential running mate now. Tell us who your first nominee for the Supreme Court will be. Name your cabinet picks. By choosing your team now you'll provide voters with a better appreciation of the kind of president you'll be. You can excite the electorate with bold choices (example: Barack Obama for Supreme Court).

To the Editor:
To all the people who didn't vote in 2016 because you didn't like Hillary Clinton: Look what you (and the rest of us) got. Please don't let that happen again. Any one of the candidates trying to get the Democratic nomination would be so much better than President Trump.

Texto completo: The fallout continues from an inspector general's findings that the bureau botched wiretap applications in the Russia investigation.
WASHINGTON -- The F.B.I.'s plan to fix problems with its national security surveillance do not go far enough, an expert in surveillance law told a secretive court on Wednesday.
Steps that the bureau listed in a filing last week fail to adequately ensure that judges receive a complete and accurate portrait of the facts about suspects before deciding whether to let the F.B.I. invade their privacy, David S. Kris, an expert in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, told the court in a 15-page brief.
"The F.B.I.'s proposed corrective actions are insufficient and must be expanded and improved in order to provide the required assurance to the court," Mr. Kris wrote. The court appointed him to critique the F.B.I.'s proposal to overhaul how it goes about seeking national security wiretaps after an inspector general report about the Trump-Russia investigation last month revealed flaws in the process.
In his most significant additional proposal, Mr. Kris suggested that the court consider ordering the F.B.I. to change its policy on who signs the factual affidavit that accompanies a wiretap application in a counterintelligence or counterterrorism investigation. An agent based at the field office running the case should sign it, not a supervisor at F.B.I. Headquarters in Washington, as is currently the case, Mr. Kris said.
The idea is that if the responsible officials are closer to and more directly familiar with cases, they will be more likely to spot errors or omissions in the draft document that case agents compile.
"This would represent a major change in practice, with potentially profound consequences, because it would tend to shift responsibility away from F.B.I. Headquarters in particular cases," Mr. Kris wrote. "It therefore should not be undertaken lightly. The F.B.I.'s recent failures, however, are egregious enough to warrant serious consideration of significant reform."
An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Kris's filing.
The conflict follows the release last month of scathing findings about FISA wiretap applications targeting Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, in the report by the Justice Department's independent inspector general detailing his examination of aspects of the Russia investigation.
While the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, found no conspiracy by high-level F.B.I. officials to sabotage Mr. Trump out of political bias -- contrary to the narrative that Mr. Trump and his allies have pushed -- they did uncover serious problems in the Page wiretap applications.
The F.B.I. cherry-picked the evidence about Mr. Page, including omitting important facts that raised doubts about its suspicion that he might be a secret Russian agent. The Justice Department passed that misleading summary of the facts on to the FISA court.
Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that political bias -- as opposed to gross incompetence or confirmation bias -- was behind the bungling. But he rejected as unsatisfactory the explanation that the agents were busy on other aspects of the Russia investigation.
The F.B.I. filing last week described 12 steps the bureau is taking to make sure that any potentially relevant and mitigating information reaches the court in future applications, like enhancing training and expanding verification forms and checklists that agents must fill out.
Mr. Kris also made a series of smaller suggestions to improve those ideas, like imposing a deadline for the F.B.I. to carry out one of its proposed changes, which the bureau had not included in its filing, and ordering it to provide regular updates on its progress.
Mr. Kris has written extensively about FISA, a notoriously complex law, and he led the Justice Department's National Security Division in the first term of the Obama administration. He was appointed to help the court analyze the F.B.I.'s proposal by Judge James E. Boasberg, an Obama appointee selected by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. of the Supreme Court to serve as the FISA court's presiding judge starting this year.
President Trump criticized the selection of Mr. Kris over the weekend in a dispute that traces back to a 2018 memo attacking the Page FISA applications by Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and a staunch Trump ally. He was then the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
Mr. Kris criticized Mr. Nunes's memo at the time as "dishonest" and "disgraceful and dangerous nonsense." But Mr. Nunes's allies have portrayed Mr. Horowitz's findings as vindicating him, and on Jan. 12, Mr. Nunes told Fox News that Mr. Kris had a history of "defending dirty cops" and labeled his appointment "another misstep," calling for the FISA court to be abolished.
Mr. Trump echoed the attack in a Twitter post, writing: "You can't make this up! David Kris, a highly controversial former DOJ official, was just appointed by the FISA Court to oversee reforms to the FBI's surveillance procedures. Zero credibility. THE SWAMP!"
Complicating matters, however, some claims about the F.B.I. in Mr. Nunes's memo, which Mr. Kris critiqued, were substantially different from the problems the inspector general later uncovered and condemned.
For example, Mr. Nunes's major claim was that the Justice Department had cited political opposition research financed by Democrats -- the so-called Steele dossier -- without identifying its funders or telling the court that the information had political origins.
But when the applications were declassified, it turned out that investigators included a lengthy footnote telling the court that the material had been gathered by someone whose employer was most likely looking for information that would harm Mr. Trump's campaign.
Despite its criticism of the F.B.I.'s handling of the Steele dossier in other respects, the report explained that investigators drafted this footnote to inform the court about the potential bias and portrayed the fact that it did not name Christopher Steele's clients as standard procedure.
Last month, Mr. Kris reassessed his criticism of Mr. Nunes in light of the report. Mr. Kris said he continued to believe that Mr. Nunes's specific claim about whether the F.B.I. deceived the court about the Steele dossier's political origins was "extremely misleading and inappropriate, especially for an oversight committee chairman."
But he acknowledged that in broader strokes, "the inspector general's report shows that there were significant failures in the FISA applications, and some of those failures relate to Nunes's other criticisms."

'Just Another Hurdle': In Symbolic Victory, Virginia Is 38th State to Pass the E.R.A.

Texto completo: Virginia's move is symbolic, and crosses the threshold of three-quarters of states needed for ratification. Yet the fate of the E.R.A. is far from decided.
RICHMOND, Va. -- Virginia on Wednesday became the 38th state to approve the Equal Rights Amendment, a symbolic victory for those who for generations have been pushing for a constitutional guarantee of legal rights regardless of sex.
Virginia's decision does not seal the amendment's addition to the United States Constitution. A deadline for three-quarters, or 38, of the 50 states to approve the E.R.A. expired in 1982, so the future of the measure is uncertain, and experts said the issue would likely be tied up in the courts and in the political sphere for years.
But the symbolism of the action in Virginia was significant after a struggle that had been raised, hard fought and, at times, forgotten over nearly 100 years.
"It's just another hurdle, another level of that ceiling that's cracked," said Daphne Portis, 58, an E.R.A. activist who clutched photos of female leaders -- Shirley Chisholm, Bella Abzug and Gloria Steinem -- as she watched the debate among lawmakers in Richmond.
Women packed the galleries of the State Capitol as the debate unfolded, many of them wearing sashes that read, "Equal rights for women." Some members of the House of Delegates, which for the first time in its 401-year history is led by a woman, Eileen Filler-Corn, brought their young daughters to witness the vote.
The E.R.A. was first proposed in 1923, though Congress did not pass it until 1972. To approve the amendment, ratification was needed in 38 states by 1979; the deadline was later extended to 1982. By then, though, only 35 states had done so. For years, and especially during the 1970s, the issue was a matter of intense national debate, the topic of legislative fights and political campaigns. But it faded some as the deadline passed and the national conversation seemed to move on.
The E.R.A. promised equal rights to women, and was aimed at improving pay equity for them, strengthening domestic violence and sexual harassment protections, and blocking discrimination against pregnant people and mothers. The bill reads, in part: "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."
In recent years, new efforts emerged to reignite the E.R.A., amid the MeToo movement, efforts to protect abortion rights and as Democrats won control of some statehouses. Slowly, leaders pushed toward the 38-state threshold despite questions about what it would really mean for the amendment's fate decades after the deadline.
In 2017, Nevada became the 36th state to approve the E.R.A., and a year later, Illinois passed it. That left Virginia, a state that failed to pass the E.R.A. last year, considering it again this year, and with a State Legislature newly dominated by Democrats.
On Wednesday, the vote was 59-40 in the House and 28-12 in the Senate. The governor, Ralph Northam, a Democrat, has said he supports the measure.
John McGuire, a Republican lawmaker who said he had repeatedly voted against the E.R.A. over the years, described the measure as a relic of an earlier time. "The E.R.A. is outdated, it's expired and it harms women," he said.
But supporters, like Jennifer Carroll Foy, a Democratic legislator, saw the moment as historic and the measure as timely.
"The question is, which side of history do you want to be on?" she said before the vote. "The world is watching -- your mothers, your sisters, your daughters."
Yet many roadblocks remain.
This month, the Justice Department released an opinion concluding that Virginia's efforts to ratify the E.R.A. had come too late, given the 1982 deadline, and that the entire legislative approval process must be restarted for a proposed amendment to be legally binding. That conclusion however, is only advisory, and the matter is expected to ultimately be decided by federal courts.
Further complicating the matter, five states have over the years rescinded their approvals of the E.R.A. The significance of those decisions, though, was also murky; in some past situations, when states sought to annul legislative votes in support of constitutional amendments, initial approvals were counted anyway, including for the 14th and 15th amendments.
Typically, constitutional amendments do not have ratification deadlines. One amendment, the 27th Amendment, was ratified in 1992 -- more than two centuries after Congress passed it. Democrats in the House of Representatives and the Senate have introduced legislation to extend the deadline tied to the E.R.A., although it is unclear whether passage would make it legally enforceable.
Eileen Davis, 65, the founder of Women-Matter, a feminist group, and an advocate for passage of the E.R.A., said she found out in about 2010 that Virginia had never passed the measure, and decided to go to Richmond to alert legislators.
"I was naïve. I thought I would bring it to the powers-that-be and they would take care of it," she said. "But nobody knew what the E.R.A. was."
"I thought it was like an "I like puppies bill," she said. "But I ran into the attitude that, 'We've always done it this way."
But in November, Democrats won control of both chambers of the State Legislature for the first time in 25 years and decided that passage of the E.R.A. would be one of their primary objectives.
Opponents of the E.R.A. said they feared it would upend gender norms, ushering in an age in which women would be subject to the military draft and boys and girls would share locker rooms, bathrooms and sports fields. They also said they had concerns about the effects the amendment might have on abortion restrictions.
"Laws protecting women's interests will be undercut by the radical language of the E.R.A. that strips away from women their unique place in the law," said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, an anti-abortion group that opposes the E.R.A. Ms. Hawkins added that "the most profound change will be creating a constitutional foothold for abortion."
But Ms. Davis said her efforts were not designed to safeguard legal abortion rights. She said she simply wanted equality for women.
"One of the things I'd tell legislators is that someone's going to make a movie about this, and I don't think you want to have to explain to your granddaughter why you didn't support equality for women," she said.

Texto completo: The former Duke star, who is in his rookie season for the Pelicans, is set to play his first regular-season N.B.A. game on Jan. 22.
The Zion Williamson era is finally set to begin in New Orleans.
Williamson, the most anticipated N.B.A. prospect since LeBron James, is expected to make his rookie debut at home for the New Orleans Pelicans on Jan. 22, David Griffin, the team's executive vice president of basketball operations, said on Wednesday. The Pelicans will face the Spurs that night.
Griffin told reporters that Williamson's first game would depend on his performance in an "intense" practice in the coming days and official clearance by doctors.
"This process has been one that has been really, really good. We've learned a lot more than we've probably taught him, frankly," Griffin said. "He's getting to the point where we actually believe that he's as ready as he believes he is."
There had been much speculation about when Williamson would play -- or if he would be able to take the court at all this season. He had surgery in October to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee, and the Pelicans initially estimated it would be six to eight weeks till he returned, which would have been in early December. No setbacks were announced.
On Wednesday, Griffin expressed exasperation at the speculation and said the team had never considered sitting Williamson for the whole season.
"It's frustrating only from the standpoint of trust with the player and with our family here internally," Griffin said. "Those decisions weren't even reached until this morning."
Griffin said that Williamson likely would not play games on consecutive nights, but he would not be limited in how many minutes he could play. His playing time will be determined based on how he looks on the court, Griffin said.
The expectations for the 19-year-old former Duke University phenom have been sky-high since he was in middle school. Williamson already had begun to make good on the lofty hopes during the preseason, when he averaged 23.3 points and 6.5 rebounds while shooting 71.4 percent from the field in four games.
At 15-26, the Pelicans are the second-worst team in the Western Conference after several rotation players in addition to Williamson missed extended time with injuries. At one point, the Pelicans had lost 13 games in a row, four of them by fewer than 5 points and two in overtime. But they have come around of late, winning nine of their last 13 games.
The Pelicans have been kept afloat by the improvement of players like Brandon Ingram, who has emerged as a legitimate star, and Lonzo Ball. Ingram is averaging 25.1 points, 6.8 rebounds and 4.2 assists, while Ball, after struggling to start the season, has increased his production to the tune of 17.3 points, 8.4 assists and 7.4 rebounds in seven January games.
If Williamson does indeed make his return against the Spurs, he will have just missed a matchup with the breakout rookie star of the season: Grizzlies guard Ja Morant.
Memphis, which will face New Orleans on Monday, has been the most surprising team of the season. The Grizzlies are competing for a playoff spot when they were expected to be in contention for one of the high lottery picks reserved for the league's worst teams. Morant, a 20-year-old who was picked No. 2 overall in June's draft, right behind Williamson, has become one of the N.B.A.'s must-see stars.
To the surprise of many, it is Morant, not Williamson, who has cemented himself as the front-runner in the Rookie of the Year race before the midpoint of the season. Morant has been impressive, even against superstar veterans like Rockets guard James Harden and Lakers forward LeBron James. Earlier this season, Morant told The New York Times that he welcomed the challenge.
"It's my job now to play against the best, so I know I'm going to see the best," Morant said. "Obviously, you grow up watching them and now you're playing against them, and it's kind of like a 'wow' moment. But I've still got to take care of business."
But Williamson, and the Pelicans, still have a chance to make their mark on the year. An unusually fluid playoff race in the conference means the eighth seed is still within reach for New Orleans, making Williamson's addition to the lineup now even more critical. Entering Wednesday night's games, the Pelicans were four games back of a postseason berth with half the season remaining. Nine of New Orleans's next 10 games are against prospective playoff teams, including Milwaukee, Boston, Utah and Denver.

Texto completo: The president asked administration officials to help kill the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to a new book from two Washington Post reporters.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump wanted to strike down a law that prohibits companies from bribing foreign officials, calling the ban "so unfair" to American companies, two Washington Post reporters recount in a new book.
In the spring of 2017, Mr. Trump was at a briefing with Rex W. Tillerson, then the secretary of state, and aides in the Oval Office. At the mention of a bribery allegation, Mr. Trump "perked up" and told Mr. Tillerson that he wanted his help in scrapping the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the authors write.
That law, enacted in 1977 and heavily enforced since around 2005, prohibits companies that operate in the United States from bribing foreign officials to obtain or retain business. It has become a major factor in corporate decision-making about operations abroad.
Mr. Trump said that it was "just so unfair that American companies aren't allowed to pay bribes to get business overseas," according to the book, "A Very Stable Genius," by Philip Rucker and Carol D. Leonnig.
"I need you to get rid of that law," Mr. Trump told Mr. Tillerson.
Mr. Tillerson explained to the president that he could not simply repeal the legislation, according to Mr. Rucker and Ms. Leonnig. He pointed out that Congress would need to be involved in any effort to strike it down.
Undeterred, Mr. Trump told Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser, to draft an executive action to repeal the law. Mr. Tillerson, the authors write, later caught up with Mr. Miller in the hallway, where Mr. Miller said he had some skepticism about whether that plan for unilateral executive action could work.
The anecdote meshes with the president's past views of the anti-corruption law. In a 2012 CNBC appearance, he called it a horrible rule and said that "the world is laughing at us" for enforcing it.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department began enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act more concertedly about 15 years ago. It has led to huge fines for companies, including the engineering conglomerate Siemens and Brazil's state-owned energy company Petrobras.
Critics of the government's pursuit of cases under the law have argued that regulators are reading its language too expansively, holding back business.
Skeptics have included Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, whom Mr. Trump nominated to the position in early 2017. Mr. Clayton was an author of a 2011 paper that argued that the United States' anti-bribery policies tended "to place disproportionate burdens on U.S. regulated companies in international transactions," hurting American competitiveness.
Despite such criticisms and Mr. Trump's misgivings, top administration officials have pledged to uphold the law.
"We will continue to strongly enforce" anti-corruption laws, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, said in a speech in April 2017. "Companies should succeed because they provide superior products and services, not because they have paid off the right people."
And under the current attorney general, William P. Barr, who was confirmed last year, enforcement actions have continued to rapidly roll in.
"The past three years have shown that very little has changed," said Joshua D. Roth, a lawyer specializing in these issues at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, despite early expectations that enforcement might fall off under the Trump administration. "What some of us were forecasting really didn't materialize."
The administration has made other moves that dovetail with the president's disdain for anti-bribery laws.
Early in his administration, Mr. Trump signed a measure from Congress striking down a rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission that would have required oil, gas and mining companies listed on United States stock exchanges to disclose how much they were paying to foreign governments.
After that decision, Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, and former Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, the lawmakers who had sponsored the original legislation directing the commission to enforce that rule, wrote that Congress and the Trump administration had "abdicated American leadership in fighting corruption around the world."
A Republican bill that would have permanently repealed the law underlying that energy-industry rule did not come up for a vote on the House floor before Democrats took over the chamber in January 2019.

Texto completo: "You called me a liar," Bernie Sanders responded, as the candidates' sudden clash injected new uncertainty into the Democratic presidential race.
DES MOINES -- The sudden clash between Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders over gender and honesty injected new uncertainty into the Democratic presidential race, after the broadcast on Wednesday evening of a recording that showed Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders trading accusations that each had called the other a "liar."
With less than three weeks before the first-in-the-nation caucuses in Iowa, the breakdown of a longstanding nonaggression pact between the two leading liberals in the race cast doubt on whether Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, or Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, can unite the Democratic Party's liberal wing.
Polls in Iowa and New Hampshire have found all of the top candidates -- Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- bunched up in the earliest Democratic contests, though Mr. Biden has held a steady national lead, helped to a great degree by divisions on the left.
The rupture, which has already angered supporters of both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, could heighten Democratic anxieties and inject negativity into the race in Iowa, where Democrats had a history of rewarding positive behavior from presidential candidates.
"I think you called me a liar on national TV," Ms. Warren told Mr. Sanders after the presidential debate in Des Moines on Tuesday night, referring to their earlier dispute onstage over whether he told her in a private 2018 meeting that a woman could not be president. The New York Times described details of their exchange on Wednesday afternoon, and CNN broadcast an audio recording that night.
According to the audio, Mr. Sanders responded, "What?"
"I think you called me a liar on national TV," she said again.
"You know, let's not do it right now," he said. "If you want to have that discussion, we'll have that discussion."
Ms. Warren replied, "Anytime."
"You called me a liar," Mr. Sanders said. "You told me -- all right, let's not do it now."
Tom Steyer, the billionaire businessman, approached Mr. Sanders in the middle of the exchange.
"I don't want to get in the middle," Mr. Steyer said. "I just want to say, 'Hi, Bernie."'
Both the Warren and Sanders campaigns declined to comment on Wednesday.
The exchange onstage between the two progressives, surrounded by onlookers but wrapped up in their intensely personal rivalry, marked their most direct confrontation in the entire 2020 election. And in some respects, it represented a kind of inevitable concession to reality: If Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders share an ideological cause, up to a point, they cannot ultimately share a presidential nomination. For Ms. Warren, taking on Mr. Sanders face-to-face risked further angering the far left, sections of which have already turned on her for the rivalry with Mr. Sanders. And while Ms. Warren was praised for addressing the subject of gender head-on during the debate, even some of her supporters acknowledge that tackling sexism so prominently could risk leaving primary voters uneasy about the implications of nominating a woman.
Progressives fear the public division will benefit the moderates in the race -- and, more broadly, threaten the movement they have tried to build. Leading progressive groups spent hours Wednesday trying to craft joint statements of unity while their leading political figures were in a public fight.
"I am hoping that volunteers and grass-roots groups can help bridge the gap that has opened between Warren and Sanders around their 2018 conversation," said Larry Cohen, a longtime friend and adviser to Mr. Sanders who serves as chairman of Our Revolution, the organization that spun out of the 2016 Sanders presidential campaign. "We remain focused on racial and gender justice, health care, climate crisis, good jobs, student debt and free college, the spiraling military budget and more. I don't see a path forward on those issues in the Senate or at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee without cooperation when the time comes."
Many progressive leaders pointed to the 2004 primary as a cautionary tale, when feuding between the more liberal candidacies of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont helped the more moderate Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts win the Iowa caucus after a summer slump.
"It's absolutely critical that progressives focus their fire on the corporate wing of the party to not allow a repeat of the 2004 election," said Neil Sroka, communications director for Democracy for America, a liberal group founded by Mr. Dean after his unsuccessful primary run.
For Mr. Sanders, there is little upside to a drawn-out clash with Ms. Warren, particularly over matters of gender and sexism. While Mr. Sanders's hard-core base has rallied to his side, much of the Democratic electorate still harbors feelings of resentment toward Mr. Sanders for his conduct toward Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential primaries.
And in a conflict heavily focused on which candidate is telling the truth, Ms. Warren faces a real risk: Several studies have shown that voters punish women more harshly than men for real or perceived dishonesty.
Depictions of female candidates as calculating or conniving are political mainstays. As long ago as 1984, opponents launched "authenticity" attacks against Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to appear on a major party's presidential ticket. This pattern endures regardless of who is telling the truth, these studies conclude, and regardless of either candidate's intentions. If voters conclude that Ms. Warren is lying, it is most likely to hurt her more than it will hurt Mr. Sanders if voters conclude that he is lying.
It is unclear whether either candidate may be inclined to perpetuate the feud in public. It is telling that Ms. Warren's most pointed comment to Mr. Sanders came after the formal debate concluded, and that Mr. Sanders responded not by escalating the fight but by deferring it to another time.
By the time CNN aired the footage on Wednesday night, the two candidates had not spoken about the exchange, people familiar with their whereabouts said, though they were expected to be in close contact when the Senate convenes Friday.
CNN executives initially said they did not believe the exchange had been captured by the network's microphones. The network said its journalists located a recording late on Wednesday after reviewing audio from the microphones that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren had been wearing onstage.
Over the weekend, Ms. Warren said she was "disappointed" in Mr. Sanders after Politico reported that his campaign had distributed a script to volunteers suggesting she appealed mainly to highly educated voters. On Monday, CNN reported that Mr. Sanders had told Ms. Warren in a private meeting in 2018 that he thought a woman could not win the presidency; Mr. Sanders vehemently denied it.
"I thought a woman could win; he disagreed," Ms. Warren said in a statement on Monday.
On Tuesday, the issue burst forth onto the debate stage in a remarkable moment before a national audience that captured the recent friction between the two senators.
"I didn't say it," Mr. Sanders insisted, about her characterization of his 2018 remarks. Ms. Warren disputed that, then called him her friend before pivoting to make the case that of the six candidates onstage, only the women had won all of their elections.
After the debate, Mr. Steyer repeatedly insisted that he did not hear the back-and-forth between the two liberals.
"I was just saying good night to the two of them," he told reporters during a brief exchange in the debate spin room at Drake University. "I didn't hear anything."
Reid J. Epstein and Sydney Ember reported from Des Moines, and Alexander Burns from New York. Reporting was contributed by Michael M. Grynbaum, Maggie Astor and Astead W. Herndon from New York, and Lisa Lerer from Washington.

'BagelGate' Serves Up a Full Platter of Tasty Puns After de Blasio's Toasty Tweet

Texto completo: Toasted bagel? Roasted mayor.
Picking a favorite bagel on National Bagel Day is bound to get any New York City mayor into trouble with some portion of his 8 million constituents, who are bound to have differing hard-held opinions.
But Bill de Blasio, following a failed presidential campaign, managed to cause a particularly unusual uproar.
In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio declared his love for a bagel that fits his political persona: the Bagel Hole bakery in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which serves a chewy and celebrated variety in the leafy neighborhood where the mayor raised his family.
Then he crossed into treacherous territory for bagel aficionados: He said his go-to bagel was whole wheat with extra cream cheese. Toasted.
New Yorkers first responded with indignation, asserting that a good bagel should never be toasted.
Scorn immediately followed: Bagel Hole does not, in fact, toast its sacred treats.
Mr. de Blasio quickly deleted the post, and added a corrected version that removed all mention of the word toast.
He seemed to take the kerfuffle in stride, responding to one critic: "What can I say, I must have a hole in my memory."
The toasted tumult, which was christened BagelGate on social media, spawned salty bagel puns and started a conversation about finding the best bagel in a city known for its culinary hegemony.
There were smears, or perhaps schmears, against his choice and some defenders cried, "No one has lox on the subject."
Elected officials saw an opportunity to step into the bagel leadership vacuum. Keith Powers, a city councilman in Manhattan, offered a more popular pick: "Everything bagel, not toasted, Ess-A-Bagel" -- another popular bakery in Manhattan.
Brad Hoylman, a state senator, posted a poll: "O.K., New York, it's time to answer the essential question of the day: Is toasting a bagel a crime?" As of late afternoon, "Yes, toasting is a crime" was losing to "No, I like ruining bagels."
It was not the first dining gaffe for Mr. de Blasio, who was born in New York but grew up outside Boston.
In 2014, he was famously caught eating pizza with a fork in Staten Island. He was chastised for not eating the slice with his hands, but defended his decision.
"In my ancestral homeland, it's more typical to eat with a fork and knife," said Mr. de Blasio, whose mother was Italian.
Eating on the campaign trail is a rite of passage for candidates, but it can backfire. An ally of the mayor, Cynthia Nixon, was criticized for her bagel preference in 2018 when she ran for governor (unsuccessfully) against Andrew M. Cuomo. She ordered a cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese, lox and capers -- an odd choice she described as "sweet and salty."
Twitter can be equally perilous. Another New York City mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, made a series of strange posts that mostly fell flat on Twitter on Tuesday night during the Democratic presidential debate.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign said it was not hacked and instead was "having a little fun" since its candidate did not appear at the debate.
The question of whether bagels should be toasted has been debated in New York City for years. One famed bakery, Murray's Bagels, announced in 2015 that it would toast a bagel upon request, though its leaders believed the step was not necessary.
The Bagel Hole bakery in Park Slope is a bit sacrosanct about its nontoasting policy. Its website says it offers only "hand rolled, old style bagels" baked to a crisp golden brown.
"There's no need to toast the bagel," said Philip Romanzi, the owner of Bagel Hole, who was overseas on Wednesday and missed out on most of the bagel controversy. "Truthfully, if it's a fresh bagel, it doesn't taste good after you toast it."
Mr. Romanzi then offered a compromise more befitting a politician. "Maybe," he allowed, "you toast it the next day."

Tax Benefit For Poor Areas, Boon to Rich, Is Investigated

Texto completo: The Treasury Department's watchdog said it was looking into the Opportunity Zone program, a multibillion-dollar tax break that is supposed to help low-income areas.
A federal tax break meant to help poor communities that became a windfall for wealthy investors is being investigated by the Treasury Department, the agency's deputy inspector general said on Wednesday.
The inquiry is being conducted at the request of three Democratic lawmakers, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri and Representative Ron Kind of Wisconsin.
The lawmakers made their request after articles in The New York Times and ProPublica raised questions about the Opportunity Zone tax break.
The legislation, part of the 2017 tax overhaul, is supposed to encourage new investment in poor neighborhoods, leading to new housing, businesses and jobs. However, wealthy investors are piling into the initiative, including developers with ties to the Trump administration.
Last year, The Times reported how money eligible for the tax break -- supported by both Democrats and Republicans -- was going to luxury projects in affluent neighborhoods, including deals that were underway long before the tax break took effect.
In October, The Times described how the financier Michael Milken stood to benefit from a move the Treasury Department made over the objections of some agency officials to permit a census tract in Nevada to qualify for the Opportunity Zone tax break. Mr. Milken is a longtime friend of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's.
"Despite these warnings from staff, Secretary Mnuchin instructed Treasury officials to allow the otherwise ineligible tract to qualify for the incentive," the lawmakers wrote in seeking the inquiry. "If the Treasury Department provided a stamp of approval as a political favor, it is not only unacceptable, but in complete violation of the congressional intent of the Opportunity Zones."
The Treasury's internal watchdog expects "to complete our work and respond to the congressional requesters in early spring," Rich Delmar, the department's deputy inspector general, said in a statement.
Other potential beneficiaries of the Opportunity Zone tax break, The Times reported last year, were billionaire financiers like Leon Cooperman; Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor; Richard LeFrak, a New York real estate titan who is close to the president; and the family of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser.
The initiative allows people to sell stocks or other investments and delay capital gains taxes for years -- as long as they put the proceeds into projects in federally certified opportunity zones. Investors can avoid federal taxes on any profits from those projects.
In late December, the administration finished the program's regulations. Officials said the regulations gave investors more clarity and flexibility on how to deploy their money, and push more funds into designated areas.
NBC News earlier reported the news of the inquiry.

Texto completo: A new California privacy law gives consumers the right to see and delete their data. But getting access often requires giving up more personal details.
The new year ushered in a landmark California privacy law that gives residents more control over how their digital data is used. The Golden State isn't the only beneficiary, though, because many companies are extending the protections -- the most important being the right to see and delete the personal data a company has -- to all their customers in the United States.
In the fall, I took the right of access for a test drive, asking companies in the business of profiling and scoring consumers for their files on me. One of the companies, Sift, which assesses a user's trustworthiness, sent me a 400-page file that contained years' worth of my Airbnb messages, Yelp orders and Coinbase activity. Soon after my article was published, Sift was deluged with over 16,000 requests, forcing it to hire a vendor to deal with the crush.
That vendor, Berbix, helped verify the identity of people requesting data by asking them to upload photos of their government ID and to take a selfie. It then asked them to take a second selfie while following instructions. "Make sure you are looking happy or joyful and try again" was one such command.
Many people who read the article about my experience were alarmed by the information that Berbix asked for -- and the need to smile for their secret file.
"This is a nightmare future where I can't request my data from a creepy shadow credit bureau without putting on a smile for them, and it's completely insane," Jack Phelps, a software engineer in New York City, said in an email.
"It just seems wrong that we have to give up even more personal information," wrote another reader, Barbara Clancy, a retired professor of neuroscience in Arkansas.
That's the unpleasant reality: To get your personal data, you may have to give up more personal data. It seems awful at first. Alistair Barr of Bloomberg called it "the new privacy circle of hell."
But there's a good reason for this. Companies don't want to give your data away to the wrong person, which has happened in the past. In 2018, Amazon sent 1,700 audio files of a customer talking to his Alexa to a stranger.
The right to have access to personal data is enshrined in the new California Consumer Privacy Act. The law is modeled in part on privacy regulations in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R. Soon after Europe's law went into effect, in May 2018, a hacker gained access to the Spotify account of Jean Yang, a tech executive, and successfully filed a data request to download her home address, credit card information and a history of the music she had listened to.
Since then, two groups of researchers have demonstrated that it's possible to fool the systems created to comply with G.D.P.R. to get someone else's personal information.
One of the researchers, James Pavur, 24, a doctoral student at Oxford University, filed data requests on behalf of his research partner and wife, Casey Knerr, at 150 companies using information that was easily found for her online, such as her mailing address, email address and phone number. To make the requests, he created an email address that was a variation on Ms. Knerr's name. A quarter of the companies sent him her file.
"I got her Social Security number, high school grades, a good chunk of information about her credit card," Mr. Pavur said. "A threat intelligence company sent me all her user names and passwords that had been leaked."
Mariano Di Martino and Pieter Robyns, computer science researchers at Hasselt University in Belgium, had the same success rate when they approached 55 financial, entertainment and news companies. They requested each other's data, using more advanced techniques than those of Mr. Pavur, such as photoshopping each other's government ID. In one case, Mr. Di Martino received the data file of a complete stranger whose name was similar to that of Mr. Robyns.
Both sets of researchers thought the new law giving the right to data was worthwhile. But they said companies needed to improve their security practices to avoid compromising customers' privacy further.
"Companies are rushing to solutions that lead to insecure practices," Mr. Robyns said.
Companies employ different techniques for verifying identity. Many simply ask for a photo of a driver's license. Retail Equation, a company that decides whether a consumer can make returns at retailers like Best Buy and Victoria's Secret, asks only for a name and driver's license number.
The wide array of companies now required to hand over data, from Baskin Robbins to The New York Times, have varying levels of security expertise and experience in providing data to consumers.
Companies such as Apple, Amazon and Twitter can ask users to verify their identity by logging into their platforms. All three give a heads-up via email after data is requested, which can help warn people if a hacker got access to their account. An Apple spokesman said that after a request is made, the company uses additional methods to verify the person's identity, though the company said it couldn't disclose those methods for security reasons.
If consumers can't verify their identity by logging into an existing account, Mr. Di Martino and Mr. Robyns recommend that companies email them, call them or ask them for information that only they should know, such as the invoice number on a recent bill.
"Regulators need to think more about the unintended consequences of empowering individuals to access and delete their data," said Steve Kirkham, who worked on Airbnb's trust and safety team for five years, before founding Berbix in 2018. "We want to prevent fraudulent requests and let the good ones go through."
It is on regulators' minds. The California law requires businesses to "verify the identity of the consumer making the request to a reasonable degree of certainty" and to have a more stringent verification process for "sensitive or valuable personal information."
Mr. Kirkham said Berbix requested the first selfie to test whether a person's face matched their ID; the second selfie, with a smile or some other facial expression, ensures that someone isn't simply holding a photo up to the camera. Mr. Kirkham said Berbix ultimately deleted the data collected within seven days to a year, depending on the retention period requested by the company that hires the firm. (Sift deletes its data after two weeks.)
"It's a new threat vector companies should consider," said Blake Brannon, vice president of product at OneTrust, another company that helps businesses comply with the new data privacy laws. OneTrust offers the 4,500 organizations using its service the option to create several levels of identity verification, such as sending a token to someone's phone or verifying ownership of an email address.
"If I'm requesting something simple or lightweight, the verification is minimal, versus a deletion request," Mr. Brannon said. "That will require more levels of verification."
Mr. Kirkham of Berbix said the verification process discouraged some people from making the data request at all.
"A lot of people don't want to give more information," Mr. Kirkham said. "Their assumption is that you will do something nefarious with it."
He added: "But that's the irony here. We require additional information from people to protect them. We want to make sure you are who you say you are."

Texto completo: M.L.B. found that Beltran was a key part of the Astros' plan to steal pitching signs. But since he was a player, he wasn't punished, and it could give the Mets a path toward keeping him.
Carlos Beltran was the only player named in Major League Baseball's report on its investigation into illicit sign-stealing by the Houston Astros in 2017, and that was for a reason.
The report, which was released on Monday and has led to the firing of three people, indicated that virtually all of the Astros' players were involved in, or at least aware of, the scheme to tell batters which pitches would be coming from opponents.
But according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation who requested anonymity to discuss details that had not been made public, Beltran was named because he was a central figure at the outset of the operation, in which electronic equipment was used illegally to steal the opposing catchers' signs.
A.J. Hinch, the Astros' manager, Jeff Luhnow, Houston's general manager, and Alex Cora, the Boston Red Sox manager who was a bench coach for the Astros in 2017, all lost their jobs as a result. Cora was let go by the Red Sox on Tuesday night, one day after the Astros owner Jim Crane fired Hinch and Luhnow.
M.L.B. also suspended Hinch and Luhnow from baseball until the end of the 2020 World Series. Cora has not been punished yet by M.L.B. because the league is still investigating his behavior as the manager of the Red Sox in 2018. That investigation is separate from the Astros probe and expected to take a few weeks.
Beltran's case is different, but still presents a thorny situation for the Mets, who hired him on Nov. 1 to be their next manager.
Even though the investigation found that Beltran was intimately involved in the sign-stealing scheme, he will not face any penalty from M.L.B. because he was a player on the 2017 Astros. Rob Manfred, the M.L.B. commissioner, elected not to punish him or any of the other players in return for their cooperation in the investigation. Beltran was said to have been forthright with investigators, according to the person with knowledge of the inquiry.
M.L.B. also said in its statement that it would have been "both difficult and impractical" to punish the players because they were not in official leadership roles at the time, unlike Hinch, Luhnow and Cora. The report cited a 2017 memo in which Manfred warned teams that managers and general managers would be held accountable for any electronic sign-stealing.
The Mets declined to comment to The New York Times, and Beltran also did not respond to a request for comment.
Therefore Beltran, even though he is a manager now, could slip through unscathed by league punishment. The Mets, however, could still decide to impose some form of punishment of their own. Pressure to do so could mount in the coming days based on how the Astros and the Red Sox responded to the suspensions of their managers.
It could be awkward to have Beltran managing the Mets without consequence when Cora and Hinch -- who was far less involved in the scheme than Beltran was -- have both been suspended and fired.
The Mets have another, more basic issue -- their own decision-making. After Beltran was hired, the Mets announced a plan to transfer the ownership of the team from their three primary executives -- Fred Wilpon, Saul Katz and Jeff Wilpon -- to Steve Cohen in a process that is supposed to be completed in no more than five years. It is not known when Cohen will move into a more prominent role in the decision-making process, or what his feelings on Beltran are.
In November, Beltran told The New York Post that he had not been involved in the Astros' scheme. That has now been contradicted by M.L.B.'s findings. The league's report said that Beltran, who was in his final year as a player in 2017, was at least a consultant in the affair.
"Approximately two months into the 2017 season, a group of players, including Carlos Beltran, discussed that the team could improve on decoding opposing teams' signs and communicating the signs to the batter," the report said.
But Beltran was more than just a typical player. He turned 40 that year, and was in his final season of a 20-year career worthy of Hall of Fame consideration when he is eligible in 2022.
He was an influential and respected leader on the 2017 Astros and, according to the person with knowledge of the investigation, he was closely involved, along with Cora, in the initial setup of the scheme. It is not clear whether he was a part of the day-to-day execution of the plan.
Beltran, who spent the 2019 season as a special adviser with the Yankees, is also known as an expert at stealing signs through the more traditional, and legal, methods -- without the assistance of electronics. Those include spying on catchers while on the basepaths and then relaying their signals to the batter with subtle gestures.
M.L.B. officials felt some level of understanding for younger players who may have been coerced into participating or did not understand the implications of the scheme, and thus they decided against naming them. But that sympathy did not apply to a veteran like Beltran who helped orchestrate the plan.
Still, Beltran was technically a player, and for that reason he escaped league sanctions. Anything more is up to the Mets.

A Tape of Super Bowl I Is Sitting in a Vault. A Kickstarter Can Bring It Out. Two filmmakers want to bring the lost footage to the masses—and they say they will take the NFL to court to make it happen

Texto completo: The Kansas City Chiefs and Green Bay Packers will play in their respective conference championship games on Sunday with a tidbit of historical trivia on the line: If they both win, two of football's oldest franchises would meet in the Super Bowl for the first time since the inaugural NFL-AFL championship event in January 1967. Around 100 million people will watch.
Yet even after more than half a century, and despite fervent interest, the ability to see the original television broadcast of Bart Starr leading the Packers to victory over the Chiefs is nearly impossible. Only one known copy of the footage exists, owned by Troy Haupt, a 50-year-old nurse anesthetist in North Carolina's Outer Banks. The tape, which Haupt found on quadruplex reels in his mother's attic in Pennsylvania, remains unseen by the public because of a well-documented legal standoff between Haupt and the NFL.
Now, with Haupt's blessing, two filmmakers want to change that—and they say they will take the NFL to court to make it happen.
Jeremy Coon, a producer and editor on the 2004 movie "Napoleon Dynamite," and his collaborator Tim Skousen, recently launched a Kickstarter with the goal of bringing the lost Super Bowl I footage to the masses. If they raise $1.5 million, Coon and Skousen will not only complete their documentary about the saga, which is already in production, but they will also buy the tape from Haupt, who is participating in the film and has agreed to sell. If that happens, they plan to stream the game online for free before Super Bowl LV in February 2021, knowing full well that the NFL would likely send an army of lawyers to try to stop them.
"It's too easy for the NFL to put pressure on the little guy," Skousen said. "But thousands of little guys who are their biggest fans is a lot harder."
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said, "We are not aware of this latest endeavor, but we continue to reassert our rights to enforce and protect our intellectual property."
In February 2011, The Wall Street Journal first reported the story of the shocking discovery of a Super Bowl I tape. CBS and NBC, which both aired the game, didn't preserve their footage, making any surviving copy the Holy Grail of sports TV. Before the tape's discovery, Sports Illustrated valued the artifact at more than $1 million. That article, seen by a friend in 2005, informed Haupt that the tapes stashed away at his childhood home were worth something.
When Haupt surfaced with the tapes that his father recorded, he expected the NFL to pay that much to secure an important piece of its history that seemed lost forever. Instead, it offered $30,000, refused to budge and made it clear that the league would sue if Haupt did anything with his treasure.
NFL Network showed a reconstruction of Super Bowl I stitched together from the archives of NFL Films in 2016. Haupt's tape, restored by the Paley Center for Media in New York, continues to sit in a vault and will stay there until Haupt can reach a resolution.
"I had hoped the NFL would work with us, but we never wanted to go after their multibillion-dollar legal department," Haupt said. "Our family is not set up to do that kind of thing."
Enter Coon and Skousen. They first learned about the tape from a 2016 New York Times article that first named Haupt as its owner. Before that, Haupt only allowed his attorney to speak about an unidentified client with the recording in his possession.
Coon and Skousen began working on their film about three years ago and essentially funded it themselves, securing interviews with people like Packers offensive lineman Jerry Kramer, Chiefs defensive back Fred Williamson and Jack Whitaker, the Super Bowl I announcer for CBS who died in August at age 95. They say they can finish the film if they raise $50,000 and produce a better, more polished version for $200,000.
"If we don't do something, nothing will change," Coon said. "The NFL will not do the right thing unless they're pressured."
Therefore, Coon and Skousen want to buy the tape, and Haupt says he has agreed to sell it to them for $750,000—the first time he has made it available for purchase to anybody other than the NFL or CBS. They opted to turn to crowdfunding, because, they said, traditional networks and distributors expressed fear of legal action by the NFL.
The $1.5 million they hope to collect would include a legal defense reserve. They say nearly all the money they raise will go into the project and buying the tape, not their own pockets.
"The NFL can make things difficult," Coon said. "But that's why we have a legal fund, so that we can go the distance."
Before progressing too far, Coon and Skousen contacted David Nimmer, an expert on copyright law. Nimmer assured them that he believed they could successfully argue in court that the NFL doesn't hold a copyright on Haupt's Super Bowl I tape.
Nimmer cited the Copyright Act of 1976, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1978. In an interview for Coon and Skousen's documentary, Nimmer says that that because the "NFL did not bother to preserve any of its pre-existing copies," the league could "no longer say that there were any copies 'that are fixed in a tangible medium expression'—they had been destroyed."
"And for that reason," Nimmer continues, "applying the exact language of the 1976 act, there is no federal copyright protection for Super Bowl I."
Haupt always hoped it wouldn't come to this and that the NFL would decide it wanted the tape and pay what he and independent appraisers see as a fair price for it. He no longer believes that will ever happen.
Then Coon and Skousen came along and offered a life raft: If they raised the money, they would deal with the potentially lengthy and expensive legal battle, something his family lacks the desire and resources to do. Ultimately, Haupt hopes the entire world will one day see the last surviving broadcast footage of Super Bowl I—and that he won't have to spend years in court to turn that dream into a reality.
"They're not any good just sitting in a vault somewhere," Haupt said. "We want the public to see it."

Texto completo: Find out how to see more than a million snow geese as they feast in NorCal's plentiful rice fields. And our Palm Springs-based political reporter breaks down all you need to know ahead of the Golden State's March 3 primary.
It's Wednesday's news.
But first, a California mom creates a 3-D, AR app to get your littles using the loo. "Let's get this potty started" (VIDEO).
I'm Arlene Martínez and I write In California, a daily roundup of news from across USA TODAY Network newsrooms and beyond. Signing up is fast, fun and free.
Can no-party people vote in the presidential primary?
Yes, the state's 5. 4 million voters who registered "No Party Preference" can cast a ballot in the presidential primary for the Democratic Party, the America Independent Party and the Libertarian Party. Where they won't be able to weigh in are the Republican Party, the Green Party and the Peace & Freedom Party. That's because each party sets its own rules and decides whether to hold an "open" or "closed" primary (can you imagine if the Libertarians closed theirs? Anyway).
If you're registered with a political party — a Republican or Democrat, for example — candidates for president will automatically appear on your ballot. But if you're not one of those voters, you have to request what's called a crossover ballot to vote in a party primary. Now you're wondering what a crossover ballot even is. Political reporter Sam Metz not only answers that but these questions as well:
Am I registered to vote?
Who is on the ballot?
Who can vote in the presidential primary elections?
What's the big deal about crossover ballots and how do I request one?
I'm super busy. What if I forget to request one?

Texto completo: Freedom House urges democracies to resist influence operations

BEIJING " Democratic governments should wise up to " and try to thwart " China's attempts to shape the global narrative about its actions at home and abroad, Freedom House said in a report published Wednesday that warns of the campaign's corrosive effects on public debate.
Not content with pervasive censorship and state control of almost all media at home, the ruling Communist Party under President Xi Jinping has dramatically stepped up its efforts to disseminate its version of events.
'China is trying to promote itself as an international model,' said Sarah Cook, senior research analyst for China at Freedom House and the author of the report, 'Beijing's Global Megaphone.' That has especially been the case since Xi declared in 2016 that 'propaganda reports must extend their tentacles' to reach readers and viewers everywhere.
'Beijing has a large toolbox for influencing media around the world and its tactics have been evolving, especially since 2017,' Cook said.
This includes officials' increasingly aggressive pronouncements on Twitter and more-covert efforts, such as the Russian-style disinformation campaign conducted in Taiwan.
Freedom House is among the American human rights organizations penalized by China in retaliation for the United States' support for protesters in Hong Kong. Others include the National Endowment for Democracy and Human Rights Watch.
At home, the Chinese media environment is dominated by state-run organizations that laud Xi and put Beijing's spin on the news. Such narratives typically present the internment of more than a million Muslims in reeducation camps in western China as a 'deradicalization' initiative, or the view that anti-China sentiment in Hong Kong and Taiwan is the work of 'shadowy forces' from the United States rather than an organic response to Beijing's illiberalism. Unwelcome news " such as criticism of Xi or the party " is omitted from conventional media or deleted from the Internet.
But in the past three years, party authorities have aggressively taken those efforts abroad. Chinese propaganda now reaches into every part of the globe, even as Beijing claims not to meddle in other nations' domestic affairs.
George Washington University academic David Shambaugh estimates that China has been spending as much as $10 billion a year on sharpening its 'soft power,' although state media would account for only part of that sum, the report notes.
In the television realm, China Global Television Network, the international unit of the state broadcaster, now has English, Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian channels, available in more than 170 countries and regions.

By exerting economic leverage, China has been able to place its news channels in cable packages in Africa, sometimes at the expense of international networks such as the BBC and CNN, and include its programming on mainstream channels in countries such as Portugal, where the 'China Hour' featuring content from Chinese state media airs during prime time, the report said.
In the print sphere, China is not constrained by the brutal economics of the global newspaper market. The China Daily, its English-language paper, is available on newsstands in New York City and in congressional offices in Washington, on flights in Africa and in hotels in Asia.

Aware that the audience for the China Daily might be limited, Beijing has adopted a practice it calls 'borrowing the boat to reach the sea' to place its content in advertorial 'China Watch' supplements in respected newspapers, including The Washington Post, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Similar inserts have appeared in papers in Spain, Britain, Australia and India.
In between human interest stories about pandas and food, these media outlets have run reports claiming that Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters carry American-made grenade launchers or social media posts on the supposed terrorist threat posed by China's Uighur people.
Xinhua, the state news agency, also provides copy to media outlets throughout the world, including in Italy, Bangladesh, India, Nigeria, Egypt and Thailand. Sometimes, the articles are free.
After China persuaded the Solomon Islands to abandon Taiwan as a diplomatic partner last year, officials invited journalists from the Pacific state for a highly choreographed, all-expenses-paid trip conducted through interpreters and designed to wow them.
'The size of their staff numbers and the digital system they were using were, to us, the equivalent to going to the moon,' Dorothy Wickham, founder of Melanesian News Network, wrote of the group's visit to China's state broadcaster.

But how effective are these efforts? The answer to this question is mixed, Freedom House concluded.
'Some aspects of Beijing's initiatives have been remarkably effective and carry serious political and economic implications,' the report said, noting a sharp improvement in Xi's public image in surveys in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia.
The campaign has had success in Muslim-majority countries such as Indonesia, where China has used media outreach and economic largesse to stifle criticism of its repression of Uighurs.
But there has also been pushback, the report said. Britain's media regulator has launched eight investigations into whether CGTN violated broadcasting rules in the past two years, and certain state media journalists in the United States now must register as foreign agents.
But Freedom House warned that, while there are limits to the campaign's effectiveness at present, China's strategies could prove highly influential in the longer term, especially in developing countries where media outlets are happy to accept free content.
'The potential future impact of Beijing's practices should not be underestimated,' the report concludes.
It urged governments and civil society actors to protect media freedom and guard against the 'harmful influence' of the Chinese Communist Party.
'Such action may require considerable political will, as certain measures designed to uphold media freedom and fair competition in the long term will be opposed by Beijing and could hinder Chinese investment in the short term,' the report said. 'But it is increasingly clear that allowing the authoritarian dimensions of CCP media influence campaigns to expand unchecked carries its own costs.'

Roberts must hold senators to their oath

As he presides over the impeachment trial of President Trump, Chief Justice John G.-Roberts Jr. does not need to act like a potted plant " nor should he. In fact, Roberts as presiding officer has the ability to force senators to be true to their oath to 'do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws.'
Under the Senate's standing rules, the presiding officer has the power to issue 'orders, mandates, writs, and precepts,' to 'direct all the forms of proceedings while the Senate is sitting for the purpose of trying and impeachment' and to 'rule on all questions of evidence including, but not limited to, questions of relevancy, materiality, and redundancy of evidence.' To emphasize the limits of Roberts's role, some commentators argue that these seemingly broad powers are actually quite constrained, because the Senate majority retains the power to overrule Roberts.
But that does not make the chief justice's role a nullity. Certainly, were Roberts to rule to admit evidence at the request of the House managers, a Republican senator could object and request a vote. With their majority in the Senate, the Republicans could easily prevail and have evidence excluded. Because the Senate has the final word in impeachment, the House managers have no ability to appeal " at least not to a higher court. But imagine how such a move would influence the proceeding. Would Republican senators really want to demonstrate such unprecedented partisanship, overruling the conservative, Republican-appointed chief justice and lending credence to assertions that they are running a rigged trial and burying relevant evidence?
Roberts has attempted, at times, to position the administration of justice and the role of the judiciary as being above the fray of partisan politics. That desire argues for a more assertive role from the chief justice at the impeachment trial, not less. Now more than ever, Roberts must live up to his own vision of dispensing justice by ruling to admit evidence that will advance the goal of seeking the truth.
In doing so, he would be playing a familiar and impartial role one for which he is well suited. During ordinary court proceedings, judges determine whether evidence is admissible based on whether it is relevant and important to the consideration of the legal issues; they determine whether evidence should be excluded because, for example, it is privileged or unduly prejudicial.
The chief justice as presiding officer should follow such standards in determining how to rule on any demands to admit evidence, allow witnesses to testify or obtain documents. To take one potential example, the president has said he would seek to assert executive privilege to prevent former national security adviser John Bolton from testifying, 'for the sake of the office.' The chief justice would seemingly be well situated to determine in the first instance whether and how executive privilege applies in the setting of an impeachment trial.
It would be interesting to see how Republican senators would respond to a ruling by the chief justice that they consider adverse to the president's interests. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has shown no compunction about stating that he does not want witnesses to testify, a stance at odds with his argument in the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. 'It's not unusual to have a witness in a trial. It's certainly not unusual to have a witness in an impeachment trial,' McConnell said then, calling a request for three witnesses a 'modest' number. Indeed, there has never been an impeachment trial that reached a verdict " for a president or a lesser officer " without witnesses.
But for other Republican senators, especially those facing difficult reelection campaigns, voting to overturn a decision by the chief justice might be a daunting prospect " and rightfully so. As Republican former representative Thomas Campbell, who sat on the House Judiciary Committee during the Clinton impeachment, put it in the New York Times, 'How would a senator feel about overruling a judgment on the merits by the chief justice? I think 'hesitant' would be the adjective I'd use.'
Those of us who believe the Constitution requires a fair trial " that the Senate oath to uphold 'impartial justice' is not meaningless verbiage " must hope that 'hesitant' will not be the word historians will use to describe how the chief justice performed his role. Doing little would be ducking his constitutional responsibility, not fulfilling it.

McGregor plays it cool ahead of fight with Cerrone

Texto completo: Conor McGregor arrived roughly 15 minutes early for the start of his pre-fight news conference Wednesday in Las Vegas, where the fiery Irishman is set to face Donald 'Cowboy' Cerrone on Saturday in the headline bout of UFC 246.
Such a prompt appearance may have been the first indication this was not going to be the circus atmosphere McGregor (21-4 MMA, 9-2 UFC) so often has courted during his rapid ascent to becoming one of the most recognized figures in mixed martial arts.
The former two-division champion known as much for his verbal sparring as for his decorated combat sports résumé proceeded to heap praise on his opponent, speaking virtually expletive-free. That choice bucked the odds, at least according to some Las Vegas bookmakers, during the half-hour event at the Palms.
'I'm very, very grateful and just very honored and happy to be here on U.S. soil, back on United States soil, back here in Las Vegas,' McGregor said. 'I've had so many amazing moments here in America, you know, and I'm very grateful for this country, and I'm very honored to be here and to perform for the people.'
Circumstances inside and outside the octagon certainly may have compelled McGregor, 31, to take a far more muted approach heading into his first MMA fight since October 2018, when he lost via submission in the fourth round to Khabib Nurmagomedov in Las Vegas, which preceded a retirement announcement in March 2019.
That humbling result followed what was billed as 'The Biggest Fight in Combat Sports History,' a boxing match in August 2017 between McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Jr., the undefeated 11-time, five-division boxing champion. Mayweather won in a stoppage in the 10th round.
McGregor also has faced questions about sexual assault allegations revealed in separate New York Times reports. The most recent report details a complaint by a woman in her 20s who alleges McGregor sexually assaulted her in a vehicle parked outside a Dublin pub.
McGregor has denied the charges, and fans booed when he was asked again to address them during Wednesday's news conference that was open to the general public in addition to media.
UFC President Dana White, who served as the moderator of the news conference, denied the sexual assault charges would have any impact on the scheduled five-round fight at T-Mobile Arena.
'I'm certainly more grown, I'm more experienced, and I've been through certain things that have helped shape me as a man like us all on this journey of life,' an almost stoic McGregor said. 'If you were to ask my family, my people who know me, I am no different.
'I'm certainly a bit more focused this camp and a bit more aware.'
Part of that focus includes abstaining from alcohol during this training camp. McGregor revealed his recent sobriety in an interview with ESPN and discussed it further during the subdued news conference in which he and Cerrone came off more as longtime friends than heated combatants.
McGregor, who said he has not had a drink in the past three to four months, admitted to drinking throughout training camp leading to his fight against Nurmagomedov, even to the point where he refused to stop during fight week.
McGregor also repeatedly called the 36-year-old Cerrone (36-13 MMA, 23-10 UFC) a worthy opponent who has earned top billing in the sport after fighting 49-times.
'Although there will be blood spilled on January 18, it will not be bad blood,' said McGregor, who ended the night with a face-to-face standoff with Cerrone, providing the most drama in an otherwise unconventional news conference, at least by McGregor's standards.
'You're not going to get your clickbait,' Cerrone said to reporters.

Texto completo: Wayne State University's annual Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Tribute will take place Tuesday, January 21, 2020 at the Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Music Center. The Tribute brings together the metro Detroit community to celebrate and honor the life and legacy of Dr. King. This year's featured guest is W. Kamau Bell.
W. Kamau Bell is a sociopolitical comedian who is the host and executive producer of the Emmy Award winning CNN docu-series United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell. He recently made his Netflix debut with a new stand-up comedy special, Private School Negro. Kamau has a book with the easy-to-re-member title The Awkward Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell: Tales of a 6' 4", African American, Heterosexual, Cisgender, Left-Leaning, Asthmatic, Black and Proud Blerd, Mama's Boy, Dad, and Stand-Up Comedian.
Kamau has hosted three critically acclaimed podcasts: Kamau Right Now!, Politically Re-Active, and Denzel Washington is The Greatest Actor of All Time Period. Kamau is on the advisory board of Hollaback! and Donors Choose and is the ACLU Celebrity Ambassador for Racial Justice. The New York Times called Kamau "the most promising new talent in political comedy in many years." Kamau has been nominated for multiple NAACP Image Awards and a GLAAD award, and he was featured on Conde Nast's 'Daring 25' list for 2016. The SF Weekly called Kamau "smart, stylish, and very much in the mold of politically outspoken comedians like Dave Chappelle," though he was mostly just excited that they called him "handsome." The New Yorker said, "Bell's gimmick is intersectional progressivism: he treats racial, gay, and women's issues as inseparable." Kamau is also known for his criminally short-lived FX & FXX comedy series, Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell. Kamau still finds time to travel to college campuses around the country, per- ' forming his his one man show that inspired Totally Biased, The W. Kamau Bell Curve: Ending Racism in About an Hour.
Kamau's writing has been featured in The New York Times, Vanity Fair, The Hollywood Reporter, CNN.com, Salon, The LA Review of Books, The Establishment. (One time, on his website, Kamau wrote about getting kicked out of The Elmwood Cafe in Berkeley on his birthday because they thought he was harassing his wife. Listen to his appearance on This American Life for all the details.) Kamau's debut as a director will happen this fall with the release of the A+E documentary Culture Shock: Chris Rock's Bring The Pain.

Texto completo: Classical music is slow to change, but change is happening. According to the classical music website Bachtrack, which last week released its look back at 2019, there are more women conductors than ever. And more women composers. More variety in operatic repertoire, and more contemporary music being performed.
Beethoven is still the most-performed composer, and with 2020 his 250th birthday year, that won’t change anytime soon. In 2019, over 13 percent of all classical concerts featured a work by Beethoven.
Meanwhile, over 24 percent of concerts in the USA included works by living composers. We’re second in the world, after Sweden.
It’s just beginning
Since the calendar flipped on Jan. 1, the Twin Cities has been a nexus of new music. We can’t remember ever hearing as much new music as we have so far this year – or missing as much, because we can’t be in two places at once.
The Minnesota Orchestra rang in the New Year with British composer Hannah Kendall’s “The Spark Catchers.” The following week brought the orchestra’s annual MusicMakers concert (formerly Future Classics), where all the music was new, all the composers were young and three were women. This weekend’s concerts will feature music from the canon by Mahler, Debussy and Ravel, but the conductor will be Simone Young, one of eight women included in Bachtrack’s list of top 100 conductors.
With violinist and Artistic Partner Pekka Kuusisto playing and conducting, the SPCO opened 2020 with two U.S. premieres: of Nico Muhly’s violin concerto “Shrink” and young Swedish female composer Andrea Tarrodi’s “Paradisfåglar II – Birds of Paradise.”
Future concerts by both the Minnesota Orchestra and the SPCO are peppered with new music. The Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra prides itself on commissioning and premiering new works; it had a long relationship with Dominic Argento. Next up for the MSO: the March 29 world premiere of the large orchestra version of Russian-born composer Polina Nazaykinskaya’s “Fenix.”
Outside the concert halls, many smaller venues are featuring new music. On Jan. 9, Icehouse hosted the third annual SongSlam, a night of all-new art songs by emerging classical music composer/performer teams. That night, we had an early listen at a new work by a new production company, Orpheus Music Project: a music-drama based on a historical novel by New York Times best-selling author Sharyn McCrumb, interwoven with selections from the requiem mass. It will premiere in concert at the Ordway Concert Hall in Fall 2020,
Last weekend, the new music ensemble Zeitgeist presented St. Cloud State University professor Scott L. Miller’s latest virtual reality work, “The Blue in the Distance,” a combination of film, poetry, electroacoustic and live music. Saturday brought us to the Hook and Ladder for the fourth installment of “Outpost,” an excellent new music/spoken word series created by Minnesota Orchestra violist Sam Bergman and soprano Carrie Henneman Shaw. All of the music there was by living composers, including two works for soprano and bassoon, a combination we couldn’t imagine until we heard it in person. And the Hook’s theater was filled to capacity.
Also sold out: Sunday’s Liquid Music concert with Kuusisto and Muhly, an experience both exquisite and intimate. Two friends playing music they love (including works by Philip Glass and Arvo Pärt, both listed among Bachtrack’s Top 10 contemporary composers for 2019), before a rapt audience in a comfortable room with excellent sound. (At least, it sounded great where we were sitting – we could hear every whisper from Kuusisto’s violin – and a friend in the back row said it sounded good there as well. And this was an acoustic performance.)
What to see and hear in the new year
Coming up (and this list is nowhere near comprehensive): Minnesota Opera will open the modern opera “Flight” on Jan. 25 and present the world premiere of “Edward Tulane” in March. Its Project Opera program will offer the new (2017) one-act “Belongings” starting Feb. 8. On Feb. 21-23, 113 Composers Collective will premiere an experimental opera, “The Golden Ass,” at Nautilus Music-Theater, home to much new music in the making.
On Feb. 4, the chamber music ensemble Accordo will give a concert that has become an annual audience favorite: silent films shown with original music by Stephen Prutsman. Also on this year’s program: “Make the revolution irresistible,” a new work by deVon Russell Gray, the Schubert Club’s composer-in-residence. On Feb. 19, the Schubert Club’s Mix series will present Russian Renaissance, grand prize winners of the 2017 M-Prize Competition, the world’s largest prize for chamber music.
Feb. 21 and 22 will bring the ninth annual Cedar Commissions, with all new work by six Minnesota composers. Zeitgeist’s Early Music Festival will explore the music of Frederic Rzewski from April 16-19. The legendary Kronos Quartet and Terry Riley, one of the most influential composers in American music, will be at the Walker on April 25.
Many people consider jazz America’s classical music, and many vociferously don’t. If you enjoy and appreciate jazz, it doesn’t really matter which side of that spat you’re on. Just don’t try to tell us that Maria Schneider’s music, for instance, isn’t as profound, serious and sophisticated as anything being composed by a living composer of classical music and/or opera. The Minnesota-born multiple Grammy winner will perform with her orchestra at Hopkins Center for the Arts on April 21. She’ll be touring behind her new double album, “Data Lords.”
Good places to hear new jazz are Icehouse on Mondays, where composer, bandleader and trombonist JC Sanford is curating the month of January. (Other 2020 curators with months of their own include Liz Draper, Michelle Kinney and Erik Fratzke.) And Mac Santiago’s Jazz Central Studios almost any night of the week. And Khyber Pass Café on Thursdays. And the Black Dog on Saturdays, where Steve Kenny keeps the music coming. And Studio Z, where Zacc Harris curates the Jazz at Studio Z series. And the Dakota, where Kneebody will play on Jan. 22, and Atlantis Quartet on Feb. 5, and Bill Frisell on March 2, and Benny Green on April 22, and Charles Lloyd on April 28.
Cutting-edge guitarist Mary Halvorson will bring Code Girl and Thumbscrew to the Walker’s Performing Arts series on Feb. 8. Kamasi Washington will play First Avenue’s Fitzgerald Theater on March 4, Brad Mehldau on April 8. Crooners is finding success with tribute shows and classic jazz, but it also brings new music to its Dunsmore Jazz Room, like the Chris Speed Trio on New Year’s Day and, coming up, Brazilian guitarist Badi Assad on Jan. 28 and Red Planet with Bill Carrothers on Feb. 10.
It’s a new year, and the new music has only just begun.

Warren’s biggest idea: Show that government works

Texto completo: In January 1937, near the end of Franklin Roosevelt’s first term, Life magazine published a map of the United States spread over two full pages. The headline read: “What President Roosevelt Did to the Map of the U.S. in Four Years with $6,500,000,000.”
Scattered around the map were dozens of small drawings, each showing a project funded by Roosevelt’s stimulus program. They included the Triborough Bridge, Manhattan’s Midtown tunnels, bridges on Cape Cod, the Kansas City Civic Auditorium, the Los Angeles Aqueduct and the Grand Coulee Dam. A few of the drawings summarized broader projects, like “2 U.S. aircraft carriers” and “120 U.S. airports.”
Since taking office in 1933, Roosevelt hadn’t only rescued the country from the Great Depression. He had made sure that the country knew he had rescued it. His projects were big, tangible and unmistakably the work of the federal government. The projects changed how Americans thought about government.
In recent decades, Democrats have too often forgotten this lesson. They have created policies that quietly improve people’s lives, like tax credits or insurance subsidies. The problem with this approach is that it does little to build popular support for government action.
Put it this way: How many projects can you name from Barack Obama’s stimulus program? Can you name any project or agency that Bill Clinton created?
One of the politicians who’s most interested in the subject happens to be running for president: Elizabeth Warren.
While the rest of the Obama administration was pushing a financial reform bill that was impenetrable to most Americans, Warren insisted on an idea with Rooseveltian simplicity. It became the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which tries to protect people from being cheated or deceived by banks.
During a recent interview with her, I mentioned that she seemed to believe that bigger ideas were sometimes easier to accomplish than more modest ones. “I do,” she replied. Big ideas can inspire people; tax credits do not.
I don’t agree with all of Warren’s ideas (see: Medicare for All), but I think she is onto something important here.
The best way to improve the image of government is not through soaring speeches by politicians. It’s through a version of the old journalism cliché: Show, don’t tell.
Right now, the government often does the opposite. Many programs are hidden in the tax code.
The next Democratic president, whoever it is, shouldn’t repeat this mistake. In climate policy, this would mean putting more emphasis on a green-jobs program than on a hated carbon tax. In education, it could mean creating a “public option” for pre-K.
Years after Roosevelt created Social Security, one of his advisers suggested to him that funding it with a new tax — the payroll tax — had been a mistake during the depression. Roosevelt responded that the tax transformed the politics of Social Security, making it feel like a savings program rather than welfare.
“I guess you’re right on the economics,” Roosevelt told the adviser. But “those taxes aren’t a matter of economics — they’re straight politics.” As the president explained, “With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program.”

Biden wins big from Sanders and Warren spat

Texto completo: During the January presidential debate, CNN managed to do the unthinkable. They treated a Democrat like he was a Republican.
Despite his vehement denial, that Bernie Sanders told Elizabeth Warren a woman couldn't win the presidency was treated as fact by the network, and even after the Massachusetts senator rudely refused to shake the socialist's hand after the event, the rest of the marquee media came out to bat for Warren.
Going into the debate, the commentary ranged from dishonest — The Cut argued that Warren has "tried not to talk about" sexism — to the delusional.Tweet
Uh, okay.
But even after Warren further undercut her credibility during the debate by refusing to call Sanders a liar, the coverage didn't focus on whether Warren was honest. It was all about sexism.
Once again, the takes ranged from the inane — Frank Bruni proudly declared that "Warren and Klobuchar [taught] the boys a lesson" about sexism — to the insane.
Tweet
Naturally, the Bernie bros are apoplectic, and because they're the Bernie bros, they're going to overshoot in the vile and frequently (yes) sexist manner that they tend to. The only actual innocent in the story will be Sanders, who will be smeared as a sexist twice over, first thanks to a media-bolstered and politically charged lie, and second for his own grotesque followers.
The only candidate who benefits from this is Joe Biden. Despite being a year younger than Bernie, he comes off as the only adult at the top of an exceedingly petty and pathetic primary.
Warren and Bernie's squabble and "the handshake" will be the last debate memory before the Iowa caucuses. Both senators will now be stuck in the Capitol for President Trump's impeachment trial, so that's the last impression. All the while, Uncle Joe can coast the way he has for a year: above the fray, bumbling and bubbly all the way.

Report reveals Bolton book will talk Ukraine after Trump floated executive privilege

Texto completo: Amid the debate over whether John Bolton will testify about Ukraine in President Trump's Senate impeachment trial, a new report revealed he will open up about the matter in a forthcoming book.
Trump's former national security adviser is nearing the completion of his book, which is expected to expand on "at least some of what he saw" in regards to Trump pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, according to the New York Times.
The book, published by Simon & Schuster, will also touch on controversies related to Russia and Venezuela, and some top Trump officials are said to be subject to unkind descriptions.
Bolton's former aide, Fiona Hill, testified that Bolton opposed the Ukraine pressure campaign, saying he wanted no part of what he described as a "drug deal" that fellow Trump administration officials were "cooking up."
Bolton, who left the White House in September — Trump said he was fired, while Bolton said he quit — announced last week he is willing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial if called by lawmakers.
The Senate is poised to consider calling witnesses, which could include Bolton, after the House has sent two articles of impeachment over to the upper chamber.
Trump, who is charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, indicated last week he might use executive privilege to block Bolton from speaking.

Anti-vaxxers surge past rate allowed by herd immunity: Gallup

Texto completo: For herd immunity, in which a population has a high percentage of people immune or vaccinated to protect against the spread of a disease, to protect against polio and diptheria, no more than 15% of a population can forgo vaccination. For measles, no more than 8% can.
But, in the past 20 years, Gallup found the amount of people who view vaccination as very important has plummeted from 94% to 84%, meaning that not only has the rate of nonvaccination surged past the protection threshold of herd immunity but also that the problem is slated to compound and explode.
More than 9 in 10 senior citizens still believe in the importance of vaccinations, but just 85% of 50-65-year-olds do, and only 4 in 5 30-49-year-olds do. Even more disturbingly, the problem is astoundingly worse with parents of the children most vulnerable to vaccine-preventable illnesses. Whereas 87% of people without children under 18 believe in the importance of vaccinating, just 77% of those with children do.
The problem isn't terribly gendered, with women maintaining a three-point lead over men in their adherence to vaccination. But the problem is educational and alarmingly political.
Nine in 10 people who at least graduated college view vaccination as very important, but only 84% of high school graduates do. Strangely enough, that figure is even lower for those who attended but did not graduate college.
Democrats hold the average belief of the nation from 20 years past. Only 8% of them don't believe that vaccinations are vital. In contrast, a horrific 21% of Republicans do not believe in the importance of vaccinating.
The implications of these findings are fatal. If 20% of millennials aren't vaccinating their children, we're shattering the protection of herd immunity as we speak. The New York Times broke down the consequences.
Of 10,000 people who get measles, 2,000 will end up in the hospital and up to 30 children will die. Of 10,000 people who get the flu, 14 will die. Of 10,000 women who get cervical cancer, which is caused by vaccine-preventable HPV, more than a third will die within five years.
For all the hysteria about our petty politics, anti-vaxxing has laid the groundwork for an epidemic resurgence of medieval proportions. Don't say the polling didn't warn you when it comes to your door.

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren's campaign sure seems chatty.

The Massachusetts senator's team appears to have leaked the supposed details of a private conversation Tuesday evening between Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. If true, this would mark the second time this week that Warren's people have fed the press details of a private conversation between her and Sanders.

On Tuesday, following a 2020 primary debate in which Warren and the debate moderators teamed up to accuse Sanders of having once said that a woman could not win the presidency, a charge the Vermont senator vehemently denies, the two senators faced-off privately in a tense moment that was captured on camera but with no sound.

On Wednesday, hours after the heated discussion, the New York Times published a report dishing on the alleged details of the senators' private conversation.

The article reads:
People familiar with the exchange said Ms. Warren walked over and told Mr. Sanders that she was concerned that, during the debate, he had mischaracterized a conversation they had in 2018 about whether a woman could win the presidency. She has accused him of saying that a woman could not; he has denied that remark. Appearing frustrated, Mr. Sanders asked to discuss the matter at a different time, said the people, who insisted on anonymity to discuss a sensitive, private conversation. He pointed his finger toward her, then back at himself, before turning and walking away.
Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told the Washington Post Wednesday that Warren approached the Vermont senator to discuss a specific issue and that Sanders indeed said they would discuss it later. The specific issue Warren wanted to discuss, however, is not clear.

I have a strong suspicion, though, that the additional details reported by the New York Times were fed to them by the Warren campaign, which would be the second time this week that the Massachusetts senator's people have probably leaked one of her private conversations with Sanders to the press.

On Monday, CNN was first to report that Sanders allegedly told Warren in 2018 that a woman could not be president. CNN’s story relies entirely on anonymous sources, including “two people Warren spoke with directly soon after the encounter” and “two people familiar with the meeting.”

In other words, the Warren campaign fed the story to CNN.

It is possible Sanders's people leaked additional details of his conversation Tuesday evening with Warren to the New York Times, but why? Why leak anything other than a total reiteration of his public position that he said no such thing about women being president? Why leak details favoring Warren's position? Why do it anonymously after Shakir already went on the record with the Washington Post?

It is possible that fellow Democratic candidate Tom Steyer, who was awkwardly present for Warren's and Sanders's face-off, provided the New York Times with details of their conversation, but that also seems unlikely for the simple reason that he has nothing to gain from it.

The only person who stands to gain anything from the version of events published is Warren, whose campaign has shown already it has no problem leaking these sorts of things to the press.

They have leaked one conversation to the news media. Why not two?

Texto completo: When the candidates discuss health care, you’re bound to hear some of them talk about consumer “choice.” If the nation adopts systemic health reform, this idea goes, it would restrict the ability of Americans to choose their plans or doctors, or have a say in their care.
It’s a good little talking point, in that it makes the idea of changing the current system sound scary and limiting. The problem? It’s a P.R. concoction. And right now, somewhere in their plush corporate offices, some health care industry executives are probably beside themselves with glee, drinking a toast to their public relations triumph.
I should know: I was one of them.
To my everlasting regret, I played a hand in devising this deceptive talking point about choice when I worked in various communications roles for a leading health insurer between 1993 and 2008, ultimately serving as vice president for corporate communications. Now I want to come clean by explaining its origin story, and why it’s both factually inaccurate and a political ploy.
Those of us in the insurance industry constantly hustled to prevent significant reforms because changes threatened to eat into our companies’ enormous profits. We were told by our opinion research firms and messaging consultants that when we promoted the purported benefits of the status quo that we should talk about the concept of “choice”: It polled well in focus groups of average Americans (and was encouraged by the work of Frank Luntz, the P.R. guru who literally wrote the book on how the Republican Party should communicate with Americans). As instructed, I used the word “choice” frequently when drafting talking points.
But those of us who held senior positions for the big insurers knew that one of the huge vulnerabilities of the system is its lack of choice. In the current system, Americans cannot, in fact, pick their own doctors, specialists or hospitals — at least, not without incurring huge “out of network” bills.
Not only does the current health care system deny you choice within the details of your plans, it also fails to provide many options for the plan itself. Most working Americans must select from a limited list made by their company’s chosen insurance provider (usually a high-deductible plan or a higher -deductible plan). What’s more, once that choice is made, there are many restrictions around keeping it. You can lose coverage if your company changes its plan, or if you change jobs, or if you turn 26 and leave your parents’ plan, among other scenarios.
This presented a real problem for us in the industry. Well aware that we were losing the “choice” argument, my industry colleagues spent millions on lobbying, advertising and spin doctors — all intended to muddy the issue so Americans might believe that reform would somehow provide “less choice.” Recently, the industry launched a campaign called “My Care, My Choice” aimed in part at convincing Americans that they have choice now — and that government reform would restrict their freedom. That group has been spending large sums on advertising in Iowa during this presidential race.
This isn’t the first time the industry has made “choice” a big talking point as it fights health reform. Soon after the Affordable Care Act was passed a decade ago, insurers formed the Choice and Competition Coalition and pushed states not to create insurance exchanges with better plans.
What’s different now is that it’s the Democrats parroting the misleading “choice” talking point — and even using it as a weapon against one another. Back in my days working in insurance P.R., this would have stunned me. It’s why I believe my former colleagues are celebrating today.
The truth, of course, is that Americans now have little “choice” when it comes to managing their health care. Most can’t choose their own plan or how long they retain it, or even use it to select the doctor or hospital they prefer. But some reforms being discussed this election, such as “Medicare for all,” would provide these basic freedoms to users. In other words, the proposed reforms offer more choice than the status quo, not less.
My advice to voters is that if politicians tell you they oppose reforming the health care system because they want to preserve your “choice” as a consumer, they don’t know what they’re talking about or they’re willfully ignoring the truth. Either way, the insurance industry is delighted.
I would know.

Minimum wage raises could lower suicide rates, study says

Texto completo: Raising the minimum wage could lower the suicide rate, according to a study published last week, delivering labor advocates a tantalizing new finding about the broader effects of wage changes even as some experts said other factors could explain the decrease.
More than 47,000 Americans died by suicide in 2017, and with other so-called deaths of despair — drug overdoses and alcoholism — it has grown into a slow-motion public health crisis. The phenomenon is difficult to study, and researchers have struggled to find effective prevention strategies.
The new study examined suicide rates from 1990 through 2015 across all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and measured how they changed as the minimum wage increased. The researchers focused on adults between 18 and 64 years old with a high school education or less — a group more likely than others to be affected by changes in the minimum wage.

When controlling for changes in a state’s economy and welfare policies, the researchers estimated that a $1 increase in the minimum wage corresponded with a 3.5% decrease in the suicide rate for those with a high school education or less. Without some of the controls, the decrease in the suicide rate was 6%. The effect was most pronounced during times of high unemployment.
“The real world is a living natural experiment,” said John Kaufman, a doctoral student in epidemiology at Emory University and the lead author of the study, which was published Jan. 7 in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.
“Yes, there are possible alternative explanations to what we saw, but these aren’t crude associations, these aren’t mere correlations,” he said. “We designed the study to account for multiple types of alternative explanations.”
The study echoed other findings about the nonfinancial effects of minimum wage increases. They have been linked to less chronic disease in adults, lower premature mortality and fewer cases of child maltreatment, said Yannet Lathrop, a researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit organization based in New York that supports workers’ rights.
Two 2019 studies also associated raising the minimum wage with lower suicide rates.
Kaufman’s research drew national attention in recent days, coming as suicide rates continue to climb and a movement to raise minimum wages sweeps across the country. Democrats in the House pushed through a bill in July that would more than double the federal minimum wage, raising it to $15, and dozens of states and cities have enacted similar wage increases.
“Raising the minimum wage by $1 could’ve prevented thousands of suicides a year,” Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a leading progressive candidate in the presidential race, said in a tweet about the study. “We will end the 40-year assault on the working class and the suffering it has caused for our people.”
Some politicians raised questions about the study’s findings.
A spokesman for Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who leads a congressional committee that has examined suicides, told The Washington Post last week that the office had a different interpretation.
“Our reading,” said the spokesman, Conn Carroll, was that the paper showed that a higher “state minimum wage over the federal minimum wage is correlated with less suicide.”
“By this logic, if we raised the federal minimum wage while keeping state minimum wages constant, suicide would go up!” he said. “Or, we could really reduce suicide by eliminating the federal minimum wage entirely thus creating a huge gap between state minimum wages and the federal one. These seem nonsensical.”
Carroll declined to answer further questions seeking clarification.
Kaufman said that he did not expect the study to draw so much attention, and that it was part of a series examining changes in economic policy — unemployment programs and tax credits, for example — and how they affect people’s health.
“My approach is, when there’s a disagreement, there’s room to learn,” he said. “But only if people recognize that maybe they don’t know everything.”
Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said the study’s findings made sense. But she said she was concerned about not knowing what specifically drove decreases in the suicide rate.
“Are we adequately controlling for everything else?” she said. “Do we know that when people have high minimum wages, they tend to go to the doctor more? They seek more help for depression?”
She said policymakers focusing on suicides may be ignoring potential costs of raising minimum wages, such as a reduction in hours worked.
Dr. Mark Olfson, a professor at Columbia University who studies the effect of socioeconomic factors on suicide rates, said he did not find the results of Kaufman’s study persuasive.
He said looking at large groups of people, instead of homing in on specific individuals, allows for other factors to affect the suicide rates — even if the study tried to control for some of them.
“It introduces room for spurious associations or associations that are hidden in their overall finding,” Olfson said.
He said that when taking into account the margin of error, the change the researchers found in the suicide rate was too small to make solid conclusions.
“You make sound public policy decisions in part based on strong empirical evidence — at least that’s the hope,” he said. “Studies that don’t meet some basic standard, really, I don’t think have much of a role in the discourse.”
But Margot Kushel, the director of the Center for Vulnerable Populations at the University of California, San Francisco, said there would most likely be no other way to study the effect of minimum wage on suicide. Kushel, who is also a professor of medicine, said the study was “well done,” noting that it was not the first to link minimum wage increases to decreases in suicide.
“When you start to see so many well-done studies pointing in the same direction, it has to get you to think there may be something here,” she said.
She said researchers can “never adjust for all confounders.”
To Fran Marion, a shift manager at a McDonald’s in Kansas City, Missouri, who has been pushing for a higher minimum wage, the study’s findings were not surprising.
She said she knew workers who had died by suicide and who were stressed about providing for themselves or their families. She said she herself had been depressed when she struggled to pay for her health care or healthy food for her children.
“I’ve been in those dark places, too,” she said, “where I don’t want to wake up or I just want to give up because I’m tired of struggling.”

Texto completo: The New York Times has verified security camera footage Tuesday that shows, for the first time, that two missiles hit Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 on Jan. 8. The missiles were launched from an Iranian military site around 8 miles from the plane.
The new video fills a gap about why the plane’s transponder stopped working, seconds before it was hit by a second missile.
An earlier Times analysis confirmed what Iran later admitted: that an Iranian missile did strike the plane. The Times also established that the transponder stopped working before that missile hit the plane. The new video appears to confirm that an initial strike disabled the transponder, before the second strike, also seen in the video, around 23 seconds later.
Neither strike downed the plane immediately. The new video shows the airliner on fire, circling back toward Tehran’s international airport. Minutes later it exploded and crashed down, narrowly missing the village of Khalaj Abad.
The Times has confirmed that the new video was filmed by a camera on the roof of a building near the village of Bidkaneh, 4 miles from an Iranian military site. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Revolutionary Guard’s airspace unit, said that missiles were launched from a base near there.
Iran’s military blamed human error for the strike, and said the plane had been misidentified as a cruise missile flying over Tehran. But the plane’s flight path would suggest otherwise. It was climbing at around 2,000 feet per minute on its ascent from the airport when the first missile was fired, according to a Times analysis of flight data.
Flight activity from Tehran’s international airport was normal on the morning of Jan. 8, the flight data showed, and Flight 752 followed its regular route. It was one of 19 planes that took off from Tehran in the hours after Iran launched missiles at military bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops.
The new video was uploaded to YouTube by an Iranian user around 2 a.m. Tuesday.
The date visible on the footage is “2019-10-17,” not Jan. 8, the day the plane was downed. We believe this is because the camera system is using a Persian calendar, not a Gregorian one. Jan. 8 converts to the 18th of Dey, the 10th month in the Persian calendar. Digitally that would display as 2019-10-18 in the video. One theory is that the discrepancy of one day can be explained by a difference between Persian and Gregorian leap years or months.

Salt Lake City’s Spy Hop Productions receives $25,000 award

Texto completo: The Lewis Prize for Music, a new philanthropic organization focused on fostering music education and career development in young people, announced its first slate of winners Tuesday and they include Spy Hop Productions of Salt Lake City.
A total of $1.75 million will be awarded to the leaders of nine organizations in eight states. The prize, which is split into three categories and includes both long-term and single-year support, was founded in 2019 by philanthropist Daniel Lewis.
“My vision is to ensure opportunities to learn, perform and create music are available to all young people,” said Lewis in a statement. “Ideally, this would be happening in every school, but that isn’t the case, especially in low-income and historically marginalized communities.”
Spy Hop, which partners with schools and arts- and community-based organizations to offer music mentorships in Salt Lake City, was one of two recipients of a $25,000 Finalist Award, which is for one year.
The Accelerator Award, which provides $500,000 for multiyear support, was given to Community MusicWorks, which provides classical music educational programs in Providence, Rhode Island; My Voice Music which brings songwriting, recording and performance mentorships to mental health treatment and detention centers in Portland, Oregon; and The David’s Harp Foundation, a San Diego-based organization that works to develop job skills through music with youth in the juvenile justice system.
Brandon Steppe, the founder of the David’s Harp Foundation, said that the grant will go toward hiring a program coordinator dedicated to connecting with youth as they transition out of incarceration.
“What we’ve noticed is that when these young people come from being incarcerated back into the community, there’s a gap in our service there,” he said in a phone interview. He added that the rest of the money will go toward building “arts-based diversionary programming in the community,” in an effort to keep youth out of the juvenile justice system.
Winners of the Infusion Award, which provides $50,000 over one year, include programs aimed at inspiring Native American music educators and composers, bringing traditional Mexican music education to the children of immigrants, providing music and entrepreneurship training for young musicians of color in Detroit and building support for the next generation of New Orleans brass band musicians.
Project 440, which offers entrepreneurial training for young musicians in Philadelphia and Spy Hop Productions, which partners with schools and arts- and community-based organizations to offer music mentorships in Salt Lake City, each received $25,000 for one year through the prize’s Finalist Award.

Texto completo: html> In January 1937, near the end of Franklin Roosevelt’s first term as president, Life magazine published a map of the United States spread over two full pages. The headline read: “What President Roosevelt Did to the Map of the U.S. in Four Years with $6,500,000,000.”
Scattered around the map were dozens of small drawings, each showing a project funded by Roosevelt’s stimulus program. They included the Triborough Bridge, Manhattan’s Midtown tunnels, bridges on Cape Cod, schools in South Carolina, dorms at Texas Tech, the Kansas City Civic Auditorium, the Los Angeles Aqueduct and the Grand Coulee Dam. A few of the drawings summarized broader projects, like “2 U.S. aircraft carriers” and “120 U.S. airports.”
Since taking office in 1933, Roosevelt hadn’t only rescued the country from the Great Depression. He had made sure that the country knew he had rescued it. His projects were big, tangible and unmistakably the work of the federal government. The projects changed how Americans thought about government.
In recent decades, Democrats have too often forgotten this lesson. They have created technocratically elegant policies that quietly improve people’s lives, like tax credits or insurance subsidies. The problem with this approach is that it does little to build popular support for government action.
Put it this way: How many projects can you name from Barack Obama’s stimulus program? Can you name any project or agency that Bill Clinton created?
Clinton and, even more so, Obama, were successful presidents. Yet their administrations were still hindered by a certain naïveté. Officials sometimes tried to perfect policy design while proudly ignoring political impact, as if the two could be separated in a democracy.
Republicans don’t suffer from this naïveté. Again and again, they push policies meant to affect politics, such as campaign finance deregulation, voting restrictions and labor union constraints. Republicans understand a concept that political scientists refer to as “policy feedback” — namely, that policy can influence politics in ways that make future policy changes more or less likely.
In the last several years, policy feedback has finally started getting more attention in progressive circles. And one of the politicians who’s most interested in the subject happens to be running for president: Elizabeth Warren.
While the rest of the Obama administration was pushing a financial reform bill that was impenetrable to most Americans, Warren insisted on an idea with Rooseveltian simplicity. It became the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which tries to protect people from being cheated or deceived by banks.
Warren’s presidential agenda has several other easily understandable ideas, like a $200-a-month increase in Social Security benefits, a price reduction for insulin and other popular drugs, the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student debt and a wealth tax. During a recent interview with her, I mentioned that she seemed to believe that bigger ideas were sometimes easier to accomplish than more modest ones. “I do,” she replied. Big ideas can inspire people; tax credits do not.
I don’t agree with all of Warren’s ideas (see: Medicare for All), but I think she is onto something important here. Creating a new era of progressive change — to take on problems like climate change and extreme inequality — depends on persuading more Americans that government is a force for good.
The best way to improve the image of government is not through soaring speeches by politicians. It’s through a version of the old journalism cliché: Show, don’t tell. “You want people to be able to see the way government is helping them,” Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist, says, “and have a stake in defending it.”
Right now, the government often does the opposite. Many programs are hidden in the tax code, as Suzanne Mettler of Cornell explained in her book “The Submerged State.” Upper-middle-class families receive thousands of dollars from the mortgage-interest deduction without thinking of it as a government benefit. Lower-income families sign up for the earned-income tax credit by visiting a tax preparation company, which can make the benefit appear to come from H&R Block, rather than Uncle Sam.
The Obama stimulus remains the canonical example. Out of a well-intended desire to get Americans to spend more of their stimulus tax cut, the administration snuck the money into people’s paychecks, rather than sending one-time checks (as George W. Bush had done in 2001) that families might have saved.
Economically, it worked. Spending rose, helping to end the financial crisis. Politically, it was a dud. Many Americans gave Obama little credit and voted for Republicans in the 2010 midterms, virtually killing his larger legislative agenda. The stealth tax cut was a smart idea, but it needed to be paired with more salient forms of stimulus, like those projects on the Life Magazine map.
One reason that modern-day Democrats have pursued technocratic policies is the desire to win some Republican votes in Congress. Yet those votes almost never materialize. Today’s Republican Party is too radical. Democrats are then left defending complex programs — like Obamacare’s private exchanges — rather than simple, popular ones — like an expanded Medicare, open to all who want it.
The next Democratic president, whoever it is, shouldn’t repeat this mistake. In climate policy, this would mean putting more emphasis on a green-jobs program than on a hated carbon tax. In education, it could mean creating a “public option” for pre-K. In every area, it also means making sure that government functions well.
Public policy really does have the potential to shape public opinion. Years after Roosevelt created Social Security, one of his advisers suggested to him that funding it with a new tax — the payroll tax — had been a mistake during the depression. Roosevelt responded that the tax transformed the politics of Social Security, making it feel like a savings program rather than welfare.
“I guess you’re right on the economics,” Roosevelt told the adviser. But “those taxes aren’t a matter of economics — they’re straight politics.” As the president explained, “With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program.”

Texto completo: Are you the sort of person who salivates at the prospect of watching a seven-hour Hungarian movie in a theater? We have found your people.
Actually, odds are that if you are a fan of classic, foreign and experimental film in Madison, you've already discovered the UW Cinematheque, the free on-campus film series that programs a mix of diverse films with one common denominator - they wouldn't otherwise screen on a movie theater in Madison.
Cinematheque programmer Jim Healy released the spring 2020 series Friday afternoon, which includes the Madison premiere of "63 Up," the latest and supposedly final installment of the long-running documentary series, the final film by the late French director Agnes Varda, and a retrospective of the work of filmmaker Chantal Akerman.
And, yes, that seven-hour Hungarian film, Bela Tarr's opus "Satantango."
All screenings are free and open to the public, but Cinematheque, a production of the UW-Madison's Communications Arts Department, accepts and encourage donations. Seating is free on a first-come, first-served basis.
Here are a few highlights from the upcoming season, which kicks off Jan. 30. All screenings are at 4070 Vilas Hall, 821 University Ave., unless otherwise noted.
Jan. 30 and Jan. 31, 7 p.m.
"Cunningham 3-D" - The Cinematheque fires up its 3-D projector for the Madison premiere (and likely only screenings) of this documentary about choreographer Merce Cunningham, who worked with John Cage and Andy Warhol, among others.
Feb. 1, 1 p.m.
"Satantango" - Set aside the day to see Bela Tarr's 450-minute masterpiece, called the "cinephile's Mount Everest" in a new restored print. There'll be a short intermission and a 90-minute dinner break.
Feb. 7, 7 p.m.
"Varda by Agnes" - The late director clearly meant her final film, screening here in its Madison premiere, to be a parting gift to her fans, a free-associative and playful journey back through her six-decade film career and the passions of her life.
Feb. 21, 7 p.m. and Feb. 22, 2 p.m.
"63 Up" - Every seven years, filmmaker Michael Apted revisits the same group of people as they grow older, creating an important and moving series of documentaries that chronicles the passing of time. This latest installment may be the most poignant; according to a recent New York Times Magazine article, due to Apted's health issues, it will likely be the last.
Feb. 27, 7 p.m.
"The Great Escape" - John Sturges' entertaining thriller about World War II POWs who orchestrated a daring prison break (which gets a sly reference in Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood") returns to the big screen in a restored print, with a talk by film scholar Dana Polan.
Feb. 28, 7 p.m.
"Kiss of the Spider Woman" - Hector Babenco's 1985 film about two inmates (William Hurt and Raul Julia) in a South American prison who form a deep and unexpected bond returns in a special 35mm print. In a special bonus, audience members will get a free copy of the original Manuel Puig novel while supplies last.
Feb. 29, 7 p.m.
"Battle of the Century" and more restored Laurel & Hardy - This season's Cinematheque is full of restored films from the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and the crown jewel may be this collection of four short films by the classic comedy duo of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. 1929's "Battle," featuring the duo's most epic pie fight, was thought lost until a print was discovered in 2015.
March 21, 7 p.m.
"Brawl in Cell Block 99" - The Cinematheque is presenting all three films by writer-director S. Craig Zahler, whose films mix disturbing violence, rich dialogue, leisurely pacing and button-pushing politics, like this film starring Vince Vaughn as a brutal ex-con. Zahler's co-composer on all three films is UW-Whitewater professor Jeff Herriott, who will appear at this screening to talk about his work with Zahler.
April 19, 2 p.m.
"Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai Du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles" - Chantal Akerman's influential masterpiece follows the routines of a single mother's life over 200 minutes, making the mundane ring with meaning. This film is screening at the Chazen Museum of Art, 750 University Ave.
April 24, 7 p.m.
"The Cotton Club Encore" - Released in 1984, Francis Ford Coppola's Jazz Age drama was maligned by critics and ignored by audiences upon release. Now, Coppola has re-edited the film and inserted several never-before-seen sequences, which many present-day critics say has created an entirely different and much-improved film.

Texto completo: “Nos insultaron con este video”, “paren de fomentar esto que no tiene pies ni cabeza”, “ahora el mundo va a pensar que los latinos somos subnormales como los del video”, “vaya manera de querer arruinar el idioma español”…
Estos fueron algunos de los comentarios que recibimos hace un año tras publicar un video en nuestro canal de YouTube titulado “Por qué quiero que me llamen ‘latinx'”.
* ¿Qué significa ser “latinx” y por qué es un término más usado en Estados Unidos que en Latinoamérica?
Además de los cientos de comentarios con tono y palabras similares, el material recibió más de 800 clicks de “No me gusta” , comparado con 154 de “Me gusta”.
Está claro que el internet no debe considerarse un barómetro fiel de lo que pasa fuera de allí, en lo que llamamos realidad.
Pero estas caldeadas reacciones virtuales nos hicieron pensar en por qué ese término enfurece y hasta ofende tanto a algunos.
“Latinx”, pronunciado látinex en español, pretende acabar con la definición binaria que denotan los sustantivos “latino” y “latina”, y que el plural “latinos” sea reemplazado por “latinxs” y se desprenda del género masculino.
* “English Only”: el movimiento que quiere limitar la presencia del español en Estados Unidos
La palabra ha sido incluida en diccionarios en inglés como los de Oxford y Cambridge pero no en el de la Real Academia Española (RAE).
Importantes diarios como el New York Times y la Radio Pública Nacional de EE.UU. la usan con frecuencia y universidades prestigiosas como Harvard tienen “estudios latinx”, en lugar de “estudios sobre los latinos en EE.UU.”.
Website de la Universidad de HarvardLa Universidad de Harvard es una de las prestigiosas instituciones académicas en EE.UU. en usar “latinx” de manera oficial.
A menudo se la incluye en un listado de palabras del “lenguaje inclusivo”, que tanto en Estados Unidos como en Latinoamérica provoca un fuerte debate entre académicos, activistas y el público general.
El término “latinx”, además, es por lo general aceptado y promovido entre personas LGBTQ (lesbianas, gays, transexuales y queer) como un identificador libre de género e incluso como una posición política.
“Creo que es importante aceptar este cambio, más que todo para respetar. ¿Qué nos cuesta a nosotros cambiar la manera en que decimos una palabra para que otra gente se sienta incluida?”, argumentaba en el video de BBC Mundo sobre el tema Ismael Castro, un joven de Los Ángeles.
Hay que señalar que las definiciones de Oxford y Cambridge atribuidas al término tienen como contexto geográfico Estados Unidos.
* “¡Hey ‘frén’, préstame un ‘cuara’!”: las curiosas palabras en el español de Panamá que reflejan la histórica presencia de EE.UU. en el país
Ambas instituciones la asocian con personas que viven en EE.UU. y que vienen, o sus familias provienen, de Latinoamérica.
Pero, pese a que la “x” al final dificulte su pronunciación en español, el término se ha extendido a nuestra región de manera informal.
Aunque se le atribuye su lugar de origen a Estados Unidos, “latinx” no es una palabra que se escuche con frecuencia en el habla cotidiano, según explica la socióloga Cristina Mora, de la Universidad de Berkeley en California (EE.UU.).
* Latinx, la generación que quiere “hacer grande” al español en EE.UU. (y desafía a Trump)
Pero en el entorno de las universidades, el panorama cambia.
“Todos mis alumnos la usan, en las investigaciones aparece, en los eventos, en las redes sociales. Creo que muchos quieren respetar el hecho de que el género puede ser no-binario y adoptan esta palabra como postura política “, indica.
Getty ImagesLa unión de consonantes al final de “latinx” dificulta su pronunciación en español.
La pregunta sobre quién tiene el derecho de crear nuevas palabras, dice, es impulsada por la política.
“ ¿Quién dice que activistas LGBTI no pueden incluir un nuevo término en el lenguaje? “, dice Mora, quien en su libro Making Hispanics (2014) explica las razones socio-históricas que llevaron al uso de las categorías “latino” e “hispano” en EE.UU.
* ¿A quién consideran latino en Estados Unidos? (y por qué es más complicado de lo que quizá imaginas)
“Hispano y latino también son términos inventados e institucionalizados en Estados Unidos y hay quienes prefieren identificarse como lo uno o como lo otro, o como ambos. Las etiquetas son reflejos naturales de lo que pensamos de nosotros mismos “.

El término “latinx”, además, es por lo general aceptado y promovido entre personas LGBTQ (lesbianas, gays, transexuales y queer) como un identificador libre de género e incluso como una posición política.

Texto completo: El acuerdo comercial que Estados Unidos y China firmaron este miércoles ha dejado una pregunta abierta: ¿asoma un ganador en la disputa entre los dos pesos pesados de la economía mundial?
A simple vista, ambas partes parecen satisfechas con el trato, presentado como la primera fase de uno mayor a negociarse a futuro.
* 3 cosas en las que China y Estados Unidos nunca se pondrán de acuerdo
“Este es el trato más grande que existe en cualquier parte del mundo, por lejos”, dijo el presidente de EE.UU., Donald Trump, al firmar el pacto en la Casa Blanca.
En la ceremonia estuvieron el vice primer ministro chino, Liu He, así como varios miembros del gobierno y líderes empresariales de EE.UU. a los que el Trump mencionó uno a uno, con comentarios que fueron desde las tasas de interés hasta el golf.
El acuerdo alcanzado “es bueno para China, para EE.UU. y para el mundo entero”, sostuvo el presidente chino, Xi Jinping, en una carta a Trump leída por Liu delante de las banderas de ambos países.
Getty ImagesTrump se ha quejado de las prácticas comerciales de China desde antes de que tomara posesión del cargo en 2016.
Wall Street registró alzas récord tras la firma de un documento que parece poner paños fríos a una guerra comercial entre ambas potencias que pesaba sobre la economía global desde 2018.
Pero el acuerdo deja varios temas pendientes, parece lejos de acabar de forma definitiva con la disputa entre Washington y Pekín , y algunos cuestionan sus costos.
“Pasamos años de aranceles, de impacto a la economía y de incertidumbre para los inversionistas y el resultado no es nada que no se hubiera obtenido previamente sin la guerra comercial”, le dice a BBC Mundo Jorge Guajardo, exembajador de México en China y actual consultor de la empresa McLarty Asociados en Washington.
De hecho, Pekín cedió en algunas áreas pero evitó hacerlo en determinados pilares de su avance económico global en los últimos tiempos.
Por ejemplo, el acuerdo dejó fuera los subsidios chinos a determinadas industrias, como advirtieron algunos interesados.
“ El acuerdo no hace absolutamente nada para reducir los subsidios de China a sus fabricantes. Todos esos ‘hombres y mujeres olvidados’ en las fábricas estadounidenses han sido, una vez más, olvidados”, indicó Scott Paul, presidente de la Alianza para la Manufactura de EE.UU., en su cuenta de Twitter.
Getty ImagesLa ciberseguridad y el manejo de data por parte de China son algunos de los temas que quedaron pendientes.
Otro tema sin acuerdo es la ciberseguridad, pese a que Washington buscaba garantías de Pekín contra el hackeo de empresas, aunque China sí aceptó abstenerse de exigir las compañías estadounidenses acceso a su tecnología para operar en su mercado.
Trump se comprometió por su lado a reducir algunos aranceles que aplicó a productos chinos.
Son precisamente los gravámenes de Trump a las importaciones chinas otro factor de controversia interna en EE.UU. ya que sus costos están siendo transferidos a empresas o consumidores locales y no totalmente a Pekín como prometió el presidente.
Más aún, algunos expertos advierten que el pacto de Trump para vender más productos estadounidenses a China se aparta de la vieja política de Washington de dejar que esos asuntos los resuelva el libre mercado y difícilmente podrá alterar por sí mismo el déficit comercial que tanto inquietaba al presidente.
Eswar Prasad, profesor de política comercial en la Universidad Cornell, señaló que varias de las concesiones de China afectan áreas donde sus reformistas buscaban cambios y su economía tenderá a fortalecerse con un aumento de la competencia en sectores como la banca o una mayor protección de la propiedad intelectual.
“Mientras que Trump y su equipo celebran su ‘victoria’ sobre China, no esperen mucha fanfarria de nadie más”, escribió Prasad en el diario The New York Times este miércoles.
“El acuerdo comercial limita algunos daños a corto plazo para la economía (de EE.UU.), pero China podría terminar siendo el ganador cuando el polvo se asiente”.

Texto completo: “Nos insultaron con este video”, “paren de fomentar esto que no tiene pies ni cabeza”, “ahora el mundo va a pensar que los latinos somos subnormales como los del video”, “vaya manera de querer arruinar el idioma español”…
Estos fueron algunos de los comentarios que recibimos hace un año tras publicar un video en nuestro canal de YouTube titulado “Por qué quiero que me llamen ‘latinx'”.
* ¿Qué significa ser “latinx” y por qué es un término más usado en Estados Unidos que en Latinoamérica?
Además de los cientos de comentarios con tono y palabras similares, el material recibió más de 800 clicks de “No me gusta” , comparado con 154 de “Me gusta”.
Está claro que el internet no debe considerarse un barómetro fiel de lo que pasa fuera de allí, en lo que llamamos realidad.
Pero estas caldeadas reacciones virtuales nos hicieron pensar en por qué ese término enfurece y hasta ofende tanto a algunos.
“Latinx”, pronunciado látinex en español, pretende acabar con la definición binaria que denotan los sustantivos “latino” y “latina”, y que el plural “latinos” sea reemplazado por “latinxs” y se desprenda del género masculino.
* “English Only”: el movimiento que quiere limitar la presencia del español en Estados Unidos
La palabra ha sido incluida en diccionarios en inglés como los de Oxford y Cambridge pero no en el de la Real Academia Española (RAE).
Importantes diarios como el New York Times y la Radio Pública Nacional de EE.UU. la usan con frecuencia y universidades prestigiosas como Harvard tienen “estudios latinx”, en lugar de “estudios sobre los latinos en EE.UU.”.

“ El acuerdo no hace absolutamente nada para reducir los subsidios de China a sus fabricantes. Todos esos ‘hombres y mujeres olvidados’ en las fábricas estadounidenses han sido, una vez más, olvidados”, indicó Scott Paul, presidente de la Alianza para la Manufactura de EE.UU., en su cuenta de Twitter.

Otro tema sin acuerdo es la ciberseguridad, pese a que Washington buscaba garantías de Pekín contra el hackeo de empresas, aunque China sí aceptó abstenerse de exigir las compañías estadounidenses acceso a su tecnología para operar en su mercado.
Trump se comprometió por su lado a reducir algunos aranceles que aplicó a productos chinos.
Son precisamente los gravámenes de Trump a las importaciones chinas otro factor de controversia interna en EE.UU. ya que sus costos están siendo transferidos a empresas o consumidores locales y no totalmente a Pekín como prometió el presidente.
Más aún, algunos expertos advierten que el pacto de Trump para vender más productos estadounidenses a China se aparta de la vieja política de Washington de dejar que esos asuntos los resuelva el libre mercado y difícilmente podrá alterar por sí mismo el déficit comercial que tanto inquietaba al presidente.
Eswar Prasad, profesor de política comercial en la Universidad Cornell, señaló que varias de las concesiones de China afectan áreas donde sus reformistas buscaban cambios y su economía tenderá a fortalecerse con un aumento de la competencia en sectores como la banca o una mayor protección de la propiedad intelectual.
“Mientras que Trump y su equipo celebran su ‘victoria’ sobre China, no esperen mucha fanfarria de nadie más”, escribió Prasad en el diario The New York Times este miércoles.
“El acuerdo comercial limita algunos daños a corto plazo para la economía (de EE.UU.), pero China podría terminar siendo el ganador cuando el polvo se asiente”.

Texto completo: “Nos insultaron con este video”, “paren de fomentar esto que no tiene pies ni cabeza”, “ahora el mundo va a pensar que los latinos somos subnormales como los del video”, “vaya manera de querer arruinar el idioma español”…
Estos fueron algunos de los comentarios que recibimos hace un año tras publicar un video en nuestro canal de YouTube titulado “Por qué quiero que me llamen ‘latinx'”.
* ¿Qué significa ser “latinx” y por qué es un término más usado en Estados Unidos que en Latinoamérica?
Además de los cientos de comentarios con tono y palabras similares, el material recibió más de 800 clicks de “No me gusta” , comparado con 154 de “Me gusta”.
Está claro que el internet no debe considerarse un barómetro fiel de lo que pasa fuera de allí, en lo que llamamos realidad.
Pero estas caldeadas reacciones virtuales nos hicieron pensar en por qué ese término enfurece y hasta ofende tanto a algunos.
“Latinx”, pronunciado látinex en español, pretende acabar con la definición binaria que denotan los sustantivos “latino” y “latina”, y que el plural “latinos” sea reemplazado por “latinxs” y se desprenda del género masculino.
* “English Only”: el movimiento que quiere limitar la presencia del español en Estados Unidos
La palabra ha sido incluida en diccionarios en inglés como los de Oxford y Cambridge pero no en el de la Real Academia Española (RAE).
Importantes diarios como el New York Times y la Radio Pública Nacional de EE.UU. la usan con frecuencia y universidades prestigiosas como Harvard tienen “estudios latinx”, en lugar de “estudios sobre los latinos en EE.UU.”.
Website de la Universidad de HarvardLa Universidad de Harvard es una de las prestigiosas instituciones académicas en EE.UU. en usar “latinx” de manera oficial.
A menudo se la incluye en un listado de palabras del “lenguaje inclusivo”, que tanto en Estados Unidos como en Latinoamérica provoca un fuerte debate entre académicos, activistas y el público general.
El término “latinx”, además, es por lo general aceptado y promovido entre personas LGBTQ (lesbianas, gays, transexuales y queer) como un identificador libre de género e incluso como una posición política.
“Creo que es importante aceptar este cambio, más que todo para respetar. ¿Qué nos cuesta a nosotros cambiar la manera en que decimos una palabra para que otra gente se sienta incluida?”, argumentaba en el video de BBC Mundo sobre el tema Ismael Castro, un joven de Los Ángeles.
Hay que señalar que las definiciones de Oxford y Cambridge atribuidas al término tienen como contexto geográfico Estados Unidos.
* “¡Hey ‘frén’, préstame un ‘cuara’!”: las curiosas palabras en el español de Panamá que reflejan la histórica presencia de EE.UU. en el país
Ambas instituciones la asocian con personas que viven en EE.UU. y que vienen, o sus familias provienen, de Latinoamérica.
Pero, pese a que la “x” al final dificulte su pronunciación en español, el término se ha extendido a nuestra región de manera informal.
Aunque se le atribuye su lugar de origen a Estados Unidos, “latinx” no es una palabra que se escuche con frecuencia en el habla cotidiano, según explica la socióloga Cristina Mora, de la Universidad de Berkeley en California (EE.UU.).
* Latinx, la generación que quiere “hacer grande” al español en EE.UU. (y desafía a Trump)
Pero en el entorno de las universidades, el panorama cambia.
“Todos mis alumnos la usan, en las investigaciones aparece, en los eventos, en las redes sociales. Creo que muchos quieren respetar el hecho de que el género puede ser no-binario y adoptan esta palabra como postura política “, indica.
Getty ImagesLa unión de consonantes al final de “latinx” dificulta su pronunciación en español.
La pregunta sobre quién tiene el derecho de crear nuevas palabras, dice, es impulsada por la política.
“ ¿Quién dice que activistas LGBTI no pueden incluir un nuevo término en el lenguaje? “, dice Mora, quien en su libro Making Hispanics (2014) explica las razones socio-históricas que llevaron al uso de las categorías “latino” e “hispano” en EE.UU.
* ¿A quién consideran latino en Estados Unidos? (y por qué es más complicado de lo que quizá imaginas)
“Hispano y latino también son términos inventados e institucionalizados en Estados Unidos y hay quienes prefieren identificarse como lo uno o como lo otro, o como ambos. Las etiquetas son reflejos naturales de lo que pensamos de nosotros mismos “.

Krugman: Trump’s plot against health care continues

Texto completo: Make no mistake: Health care will be on the ballot this November. But not in the way ardent progressives imagine.
Democrats running for president have spent a lot of time debating so-called “Medicare for All,” with some supporters of Bernie Sanders claiming that any politician who doesn’t demand immediate implementation of single-payer health care is a corporate tool, or something. But the reality is that whatever its merits, universal, government-provided health insurance isn’t going to happen anytime soon.
I say this because even if Democrats take the Senate in addition to the White House, the votes for eliminating private health insurance won’t be there; nor will the kind of overwhelming public support that might change that calculus. In practice, any of the Democratic candidates — even Sanders — will, if victorious, end up building on and improving Obamacare.
On the other hand, if Donald Trump wins, he will probably find a way to kill Obamacare, and tens of millions of Americans will lose health coverage.
Let’s talk for a minute about Obamacare. There’s a sort of perverse alliance between Republicans and some progressives, both of whom are determined, albeit for different reasons, to see the Affordable Care Act as a failure.
These downbeat assessments are made easier by the fact that the Affordable Care Act left much of its implementation up to the states, and that national performance has been held down by states that have done their best to sabotage health reform.
But look at states that have tried to make the law work, and what you see is a huge if incomplete policy success. Take the case of California. In 2010, before the ACA went into effect, 21% of nonelderly Californians were uninsured, above the national average. By 2016 the uninsurance rate had dropped to 8%. And Californians with preexisting medical conditions saw an enormous improvement in their health and financial security.
Now, 8% uninsured is still too many, and even those with insurance often face high out-of-pocket costs. But relatively minor improvements in the law, especially a modest increase in the generosity of insurance subsidies, could substantially improve both the quality and the quantity of coverage.
Does pointing out the possibility of incremental progress mean giving up on a truly universal system? No. By all means let’s make something more ambitious, such as Medicare for All, a long-term goal. But this goal shouldn’t stand in the way of policies that would immediately benefit millions of Americans, and save thousands of lives.
And while we debate the ideal health system, we mustn’t forget that Trump and his allies are as determined as ever to undo the progress we’ve made.
It’s true that so far repeated Republican attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act have failed. In 2012, the Supreme Court rejected claims that the whole law was unconstitutional. In 2017, a Republican-controlled Congress narrowly failed to repeal Obamacare. And a variety of narrower efforts to undermine health reform and send insurance markets into a “death spiral” have fallen short: Markets seem to have stabilized, and one by one, states that initially rejected Medicaid expansion have been relenting.
But the people who want to take away your health care haven’t given up.
The latest attempt is a lawsuit claiming that the 2017 tax cut, which reduced the penalty for not having insurance to $0, somehow made the entire Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It’s a ludicrous claim, both in terms of substance — would the law suddenly become constitutional if the penalty were a penny? — and because it’s clear that this was not legislators’ intention.
But the Trump administration has joined the suit, and a partisan Republican judge has indeed ruled that the Affordable Care Act as a whole should be struck down.
Clearly, this case is headed for the Supreme Court. But Trump doesn’t want it heard until after the election.
Why does Trump want to leave this court case hanging? Partly because his side would probably lose. As I said, the lawsuit is ludicrous, although, given the partisanship of Republican-appointed judges, it might prevail anyway.
Beyond that, however, Trump’s political health care strategy is to flat-out lie about what he has done and is trying to do. On Monday he made the breathtakingly dishonest claim that he is “the person who saved preexisting conditions” — breathtaking because he has tried at every stage to remove the protections for Americans with preexisting conditions created by the Affordable Care Act.
And while Trump, who lies constantly, often seems to pay little penalty for those lies, this one — which touches the lives of millions of voters — would be thrown into sharp relief if the case were heard by the Supreme Court. He wants to take away your health care, but he doesn’t want you to see him doing it until the election is behind him.
So that’s the real health care issue this year. Will it be expanded coverage under a Democrat — it probably doesn’t matter much which one — or will it be tens of millions of newly uninsured Americans under Trump?

Texto completo: El acuerdo comercial que Estados Unidos y China firmaron este miércoles ha dejado una pregunta abierta: ¿asoma un ganador en la disputa entre los dos pesos pesados de la economía mundial?
A simple vista, ambas partes parecen satisfechas con el trato, presentado como la primera fase de uno mayor a negociarse a futuro.
* 3 cosas en las que China y Estados Unidos nunca se pondrán de acuerdo
“Este es el trato más grande que existe en cualquier parte del mundo, por lejos”, dijo el presidente de EE.UU., Donald Trump, al firmar el pacto en la Casa Blanca.
En la ceremonia estuvieron el vice primer ministro chino, Liu He, así como varios miembros del gobierno y líderes empresariales de EE.UU. a los que el Trump mencionó uno a uno, con comentarios que fueron desde las tasas de interés hasta el golf.
El acuerdo alcanzado “es bueno para China, para EE.UU. y para el mundo entero”, sostuvo el presidente chino, Xi Jinping, en una carta a Trump leída por Liu delante de las banderas de ambos países.
Getty ImagesTrump se ha quejado de las prácticas comerciales de China desde antes de que tomara posesión del cargo en 2016.
Wall Street registró alzas récord tras la firma de un documento que parece poner paños fríos a una guerra comercial entre ambas potencias que pesaba sobre la economía global desde 2018.
Pero el acuerdo deja varios temas pendientes, parece lejos de acabar de forma definitiva con la disputa entre Washington y Pekín , y algunos cuestionan sus costos.
“Pasamos años de aranceles, de impacto a la economía y de incertidumbre para los inversionistas y el resultado no es nada que no se hubiera obtenido previamente sin la guerra comercial”, le dice a BBC Mundo Jorge Guajardo, exembajador de México en China y actual consultor de la empresa McLarty Asociados en Washington.
De hecho, Pekín cedió en algunas áreas pero evitó hacerlo en determinados pilares de su avance económico global en los últimos tiempos.
Por ejemplo, el acuerdo dejó fuera los subsidios chinos a determinadas industrias, como advirtieron algunos interesados.
“ El acuerdo no hace absolutamente nada para reducir los subsidios de China a sus fabricantes. Todos esos ‘hombres y mujeres olvidados’ en las fábricas estadounidenses han sido, una vez más, olvidados”, indicó Scott Paul, presidente de la Alianza para la Manufactura de EE.UU., en su cuenta de Twitter.

Questions of racism linger as Harry, Meghan step back

Texto completo: By Jill Lawless and Leanne Italie
The Associated Press
LONDON - When accomplished, glamorous American actress Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in 2018, she was hailed as a breath of fresh air for Britain's royal family. That honeymoon didn't last.
Now the couple wants independence, saying the pressure of life as full-time royals is unbearable. And a debate is raging: Did racism drive Meghan away?
When Prince Harry, who is sixth in line to the throne, began dating the "Suits" actress - daughter of a white father and African American mother - the media called it a sign that Britain had entered a "post-racial" era in which skin color and background no longer mattered, even to the royal family.
U.K. Labour Party lawmaker Clive Lewis, who like Meghan has biracial heritage, says the royal rift shows that Britain still has a problem with "structural racism."
"We can see it with Meghan Markle and the way that she's been treated in the media, we know that this is a reality of the 21st century, still," Lewis told Sky News. "After 400 years of racism, you can't just overturn it overnight."
Frederick W. Gooding, an assistant professor of African American studies at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas, said it would be "disingenuous" to claim race had not been a factor in Meghan's treatment.
"She was always going to be an outsider," he said. "There was always going to be this barrier because of her race."
From the start, some in the media wrote about Meghan using racially loaded terms. One tabloid columnist referred to her "exotic" DNA. A Daily Mail headline described her Los Angeles roots as "(almost) straight outta Compton" and claimed she came from a "gang-scarred" neighborhood. A TV host described Meghan as "uppity."
Meghan was criticized for everything from eating avocados - which the Daily Mail claimed fuel "human rights abuses, drought and murder" - to wearing dark nail polish, apparently an etiquette faux pas.
Morgan Jerkins, a senior editor at Zora, a Medium.com site for women of color, said that because Meghan was "an outsider, culturally, racially, and socioeconomically, she has been the royal family's scapegoat."
Others point out that Meghan is hardly the first royal to get a rough ride in the media. The press and the royal family have an intense and often toxic relationship going back decades. Harry's mother, Princess Diana, was snapped by paparazzi wherever she went. When she and Prince Charles admitted that their marriage was in trouble, her private life became public property.
Diana was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997 while being pursued by photographers. Prince Harry, who was just 12 when his mother died, said in October he feared "history repeating itself. ... I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces."
After Diana's death, a chastened British press mended its ways - a bit. The media left young William and Harry alone in exchange for carefully staged interviews and photo opportunities as they grew up. That practice has continued with the three young children of William and his wife, Kate.
But in many ways little really changed. Royal stories still sell newspapers and generate clicks. That has meant intense - and even illegal - scrutiny. In the early 2000s, tabloid reporters hacked the voicemails of Prince William and royal staff members in pursuit of scoops.
Younger female royals are routinely judged on appearance, demeanor and habits. Prince William's wife was relentlessly scrutinized for years: dismissed as dull, accused of being lazy for not having a full-time job, and dubbed "waity Katy" before William proposed.
Still, Meghan's treatment has sometimes seemed harsher. Last year the Daily Mail ran photos of a pregnant Meghan cradling her bump under the headline: "Why can't Meghan Markle keep her hands off her bump?" Months earlier the same paper had described a pregnant Kate as "tenderly" cradling her bump.
British Home Secretary Priti Patel denied Meghan has suffered from racist media coverage,
"I'm not in that category at all where I believe there's racism at all," Patel, who is of Indian heritage and whose parents emigrated to Britain from Uganda, told the BBC. "I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity, where people of any background can get on in life."
But others say the media double standard Meghan faced is evidence that talk of "post-racial" Britain is wildly premature.
"Her treatment has proved what many of us have always known: No matter how beautiful you are, whom you marry, what palaces you occupy, charities you support, how faithful you are, how much money you accumulate or what good deeds you perform, in this society racism will still follow you," writer Afua Hirsch, author of the book "Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging," wrote in the New York Times.
That feeling was echoed by Hayley Oliver, a recent Virginia Tech graduate who wrote a college essay about how Meghan and other mixed-race women are treated in popular culture. She said Meghan had years of charitable work, including advocacy for women's healthcare and gender equality worldwide that preceded her marriage into the royal family.
"What about her in those roles?" said Oliver, who is also biracial and says she's inspired by Meghan for the stances she takes. "When you see someone who looks like you. ... it makes it easier to imagine yourself in that situation or the possibility of where you could go."
While Britain is by most measures less racist than it used to be, non-white Britons are still over-represented among the poor and imprisoned, and under-represented at the top of well-paid professions, including politics, journalism and the law. Britain's 2016 decision to leave the European Union - a move fueled in part by concerns about immigration - was followed by an increase in cases of racist abuse reported to police.
Meghan acknowledged in an October interview that she had been unprepared for the intense media scrutiny she would get as a member of the royal family. She told ITV journalist Tom Bradby that before she married Harry, "my British friends said to me, 'I'm sure he's great, but you shouldn't do it, because the British tabloids will destroy your life.'"
"And I very naively ... I didn't get it," she said.
Unlike other members of the royal clan, Meghan and Harry have pushed back. As long ago as 2017, Harry criticized "the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments."
Now the couple has had enough. They plan to move part-time to Canada, withdraw from royal media-coverage arrangements and seek financial independence. The queen has reluctantly agreed to let them become semi-detached royals in order to avoid a damaging family split.
The racism debate will rage on. Writing in The Guardian, British columnist Nesrine Malik said she doubted it would have much positive effect.
She argued that the racism debate had become a "pantomime, in which everyone - people of color, tabloid journalists, TV hosts - is playing well-rehearsed parts."
"Britain's conversation about race endlessly repeats itself, first as tragedy, and for ever thereafter as farce," she wrote.

Texto completo: The note is an ink scribble on letterhead from the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Vienna. On the first page, at the top, there’s a highlight star, and then a summary of the enterprise’s main point: “get Zalensky to Announce that the Biden case will Be Investigated.”
The writer? Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudolph Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer. The note is part of a batch of documents provided by Mr. Parnas and released by House Democrats on Tuesday that provide new details about who wanted what, and what they asked for in return, during President Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine. If nothing else, the material has roiled the impeachment process against the president on the eve of his Senate trial, increasing pressure for senators to hear new witnesses and view new documents during their proceedings.
The new documents also contain menacing messages regarding Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine since   removed by President Trump. Whether the messages reflected a real surveillance and targeting campaign against former Ambassador Yovanovitch, directed by Robert Hyde, a Trump donor now running for U.S. Congress in Connecticut, remains unclear. But the material may help explain why she was removed suddenly from her post and told to immediately return to the United States as a matter of her own security. Here are three questions about the newly released documents.
Who was Rudy Giuliani working for in Ukraine?
One of President Trump’s main defenses throughout the impeachment process has been that whatever he did, he was trying to benefit the U.S. as a whole, not himself. This is meant to counter the charge that he was urging Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s role in the country, and son Hunter Biden’s job at the energy company Burisma, for his personal political benefit.
In his July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine, for instance, Mr. Trump said “do us a favor.” He has insisted that the “us” refers to the U.S. Some of the documents released Tuesday call this into question. The first note scribbled by Mr. Parnas, for instance, refers only to “Announce” in regards to an investigation of the “Biden case.” There’s no mention of actually carrying it out, or engaging in any larger fight against bribery and graft in a nation dogged by those problems in the past.
More to the point, the documents contain a letter to President-elect Zelenskiy dated May 10, 2019, in which Mr. Giuliani requests a brief meeting – “no more than a half-hour of your time.” In the letter’s first paragraph, the former New York City mayor says not once, but twice, that he is President Trump’s “private counsel,” and will be representing President Trump as a private citizen, not the chief executive of the United States.
“This is quite common under American law because the duties and privileges of a President and a private citizen are not the same,” Mr. Giuliani wrote. This makes it harder for the president to argue that in his contacts with Mr. Zelenskiy he was representing the United States in general, particularly as he urged other officials dealing with Ukraine to just work with Mr. Giuliani, as testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and others made clear during the House impeachment inquiry.
The May 19 letter also said explicitly that President Trump had “knowledge and consent” of Mr. Giuliani’s actions.
“There is no fobbing this off on others. The president was the architect of this scheme,” said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on Wednesday.
Was Ambassador Yovanovitch really in danger?
Perhaps the most shocking revelation contained in the Parnas papers deals with alleged threats against Ms. Yovanovitch’s personal safety.
Encrypted messages to Mr. Parnas from Mr. Hyde, a former Marine, implied that the ambassador was under surveillance, with her communications possibly tapped, and that Mr. Hyde and his associates were just waiting for a go-ahead to do her personal harm.
“They will let me know when she’s on the move,” said Mr. Hyde at one point, referring to alleged compatriots in Ukraine. “They are willing to help if you/we would like a price,” Mr. Hyde added.
Listed as head of a GOP consulting firm, Mr. Hyde is a new face in the impeachment story. His social media is full of pictures of him with President Trump, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and other Republican Party leaders.
A lawyer for Mr. Parnas, Joseph Bondy, denied that his client was involved in any scheme to follow or harm the U.S. ambassador, and said that the emails reflected Mr. Hyde’s “dubious mental state.” Mr. Hyde himself deflected them on Wednesday with expletive-filled posts indicating the emails were composed in jest.
However, if senior officials learned of the emails and took them seriously, it could explain why Ms. Yovanovitch was removed abruptly from her post and told to take the next plane out to the U.S. as a matter of her own safety.
The document cache also contains messages written in Russian from Yuri Lutsenko, Ukraine’s top prosecutor at the time, to Mr. Parnas, in which he urges Mr. Parnas to force out Ms. Yovanovitch if he wants cooperation on the Bidens. Mr. Lutsenko was an ally and appointee of then-President Petro Poroshenko, who lost to President Zelenskiy in an election in spring 2019. He loathed Ms. Yovanovitch because she had been critical of him and supported an independent anti-corruption bureau.
“And here you can’t even remove one fool,” Mr. Lutsenko wrote to Mr. Parnas at one point, referring to Ms. Yovanovitch. 
“She’s not a simple fool ... but she’s not getting away,” Mr. Parnas replied.
What happens next?
On their own the details of the communications between Mr. Parnas and his associates are very unlikely to change votes in the upcoming Senate trial or public opinion about impeachment proceedings. (If serious, the threats to Ambassador Yovanovitch could have important legal and political ramifications of their own.)
But as political scientist Jonathan Bernstein wrote Wednesday, House Republicans who have voted to exonerate President Trump, and Senate Republicans who plan to, have to be worried, at least a bit.
“Because if new ugly details are still emerging, who’s to say that more won’t turn up later?” Bernstein points out.
Since President Trump was impeached by the House on Dec. 18, 2019, The New York Times has published an extensive look at the maneuvering behind the withholding of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, moving responsibility for the decision closer to the Oval Office. The legal site Just Security obtained hundreds of pages of unredacted emails related to the aid decision, documenting alarm in the Pentagon at the action and concern that the White House was forcing the Department of Defense into collaboration on an aid block about which DoD officials had legal concerns. 
Now there are the Parnas papers. Mr. Parnas has only recently been legally cleared to hand over material to Congress, his lawyers note. House officials note that more will likely be made public soon.

Texto completo: Before a New York billionaire rolled into a soybean farm south of my hometown this week, the last time a politician of any stature drove into Wells, Minn., came when Jesse "The Body" Ventura -- then a suburban football coach and mayor of Brooklyn Park -- arrived in a gas-guzzling RV outfitted with action figures and festooned green banners.
I actually think Ventura made a better show of the trip, though. Why? Because he showed up downtown.
What a politician discovers by appearing at a farm with towering grain bins rivaling the City of Oz and standing beside a six-figure Case IH tractor is something he certainly can't get in lower Manhattan. Wells is, after all, in the heart of farm country, a place depended on by Trump for his first election and all but ground into with sharp elbows from the top rope by the professional wrestler of a president in his trade wars with China, Europe, Mexico and Canada. They deserve attention.
But Minnesota farmers also enjoyed record-breaking profits just under a decade ago, and what's been on a steady decline ever since I can remember is our small-town downtowns.
I grew up the son of the band director and an English teacher a block from downtown. When I was home for Christmas I could tick off on two hands the institutions that have left our home since the early 1990s: the hospital, the bank, Gunther's grocery store. The latest disappearance? The drugstore was sold to Thrifty White and has now stopped using the soda bar where concrete workers and the small-town attorney would munch on 25-cent toast and sip cheap coffee and talk about the weather and which billionaire politicians were flying to town next. What replaces it is now a Casey's gas station, a Dollar General and a Subway -- but nothing downtown. And the heart of our town -- the school -- has now moved east of town. Grass covers the giant crater where the school sat across from St. Casimir's Catholic church.
And while the "2,200 [people] or so" in Wells talked about in the New York Times story that carried my hometown as a dateline may sound big by remoter standards, I winced remembering when that population barked at the heels of 3,000 people. Sure, the farm crisis threatens, but it's just one more blow in a series of body blows that has seen my town slowly retracting since I was born in 1984.
Which all goes back to Bloomberg's visit.
Yes, he echoed a billboard in a farmer's field off Interstate 90 calling farming the "backbone" of America. He shook the hand of the farmer's daughter who shared her excitement with the local television reporter. But watching the footage and swelling with pride at seeing my hometown listed -- along with Chicago and Akron, Ohio -- as one of Bloomberg's "campaign stops," I also felt cheated that he didn't actually reach town, or stop into the school and talk about economic development, or chat with members of the Rifle & Pistol Club, or even pose for an awkward photograph with my neighbor Chuck, who works countless jobs and sells horseradish sauce out of his basement and has an opinion on robocalls and maybe even Ukraine, just ask him.
No, we don't want to forget the farmer, who holds these towns up no doubt, but the problems that galvanized rural Americans to vote in the last election are something bigger than just crop prices.
Maybe next time Bloomberg can take some questions from the media, too? The town's newspaper (the Wells Mirror) recently consolidated with the paper in neighboring Kiester (the Courier-Sentinel). But they might still want to hear from a future president? Or even a guy worth $60 billion?
The oddest feeling was that watching the thing felt like time travel. That a man worth $58 billion and my hometown even exist in the same country in the same decade feels mind-boggling. And that's sad. It shouldn't feel estranged when a man seeking the vote of the common man and woman shows up to our town, seeking their votes. It certainly shouldn't feel like a different planet, let alone a country.

Study Shows That ‘muscle Confusion’ — Constantly Varying Your Workouts — Really Can Be Beneficial, But Probably Not In The Way You Might Think

Texto completo: Here are a few questions to consider as you plan your 2020 exercise routines: Are your muscles confused? Should they be? And just how do we confuse our muscles anyway?
These concerns are at the heart of a timely new study of what happens when we add variety to our gym workouts and, in the process, “confuse” our muscles. The study finds that shifting, quicksilver workouts can yield some benefits that more rote regimens do not, but the benefits may not be the ones that most of us would expect.
Anyone who pays attention to fitness trends (or perhaps to politics) has probably heard the term “muscle confusion.” It was invented and popularized in the past decade by the creators of various weight-training regimens, particularly P90X, which was a favorite of the former congressman and vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan.
P90X and similar weight-training programs advise participants to alter their routines all the time, threading in different combinations of exercises and rarely, if ever, repeating any particular workout. The rationale for this inconstancy is that unfamiliar routines should perplex and discombobulate our bodies and muscles and prevent them from settling into a groove or reaching a training plateau. Instead, our muscles will supposedly respond to the unfamiliar demands of the workouts by continuing to adapt.
In essence, this theory claims that confused muscles, exposed to changing workouts, gain more size and strength than complacent muscles cycling through the same routines, even if people are lifting equivalent amounts of weight.
That idea has some appeal and many proponents but little independent scientific backing.
So, for the new study, which was published in December in PLOS One, a group of researchers from Spain and the United States who have long been interested in the effects and specifics of resistance training decided to try to confuse a few muscles and see what would happen.
They began by recruiting 19 healthy young men who already lifted weights, although none were bodybuilders. The researchers wanted volunteers familiar with most weight-training exercises and possessed of fit muscles.
They tested each volunteer’s current strength and checked the size of his leg muscles using ultrasound and also asked him to complete an online questionnaire about his interest in and motivation for exercise.
They then divided the volunteers into two groups and sent them to a university gym. There, one group began a standard, supervised weight-training routine, consisting of various upper-body and lower-body exercises, such as the bench press, dead lift and leg extension, performed on alternate days, for a total of four workouts a week.
Members of this group performed the same exercises in the same order each week, increasing their weight loads as the lifting grew easier but not otherwise varying their routine.
Those in the other group, though, were provided with a special app for their phones that created a new workout each session, picking randomly from a database of 80 possible exercises. Members of this group performed the same number of upper- and lower-body exercises and lifted approximately the same amount of weight in each session as those in the other group, but their workouts varied day to day, with almost no overlap from one session to the next.
These routines continued for eight weeks, after which the men returned to the lab for new tests of their muscles’ size and strength and a repeat of the online questionnaire about their motivation to work out.
The researchers then compared results and found that it is not easy to confuse a muscle. Overall, the men’s gains in muscular size and strength were almost exactly the same, whether they had maintained the same routines or often switched them up.
There was one notable difference between the groups, however. Those men completing the ever-changing workouts reported feeling much more motivated to exercise at the study’s end than the other group.
What these findings suggest is that muscles are not deterred or bored by unvarying routines, said Brad Schoenfeld, an associate professor of exercise science at Lehman College in New York and a co-author of the study. “They adapt to load,” he said, whether that load arrives through the same exercise or a different one each time.
But minds are not muscles and could be influenced by novelty, he said. “The differences in motivation scores at the end were substantial,” he said, suggesting that “from a purely motivational standpoint, variety matters.”
Of course, this study was small, short term and involved only fit, young men with gym experience. Whether the muscles and minds of women, older people or anyone new to weight training would respond similarly is uncertain.
The study also deliberately looked at “polar opposites” in its workouts, Schoenfeld said, from a routine with “no variation at all” to one that changed every time.
He suspects that “it’s likely that a middle ground,” in which we swap out one or two familiar exercises for new ones, might be a reasonable way to help inspire us to return to the gym, even if it never confuses our muscles.

Here's why that Delta jet poured fuel over schoolchildren
The Delta pilots who bombarded elementary school playgrounds with jet fuel before making an emergency landing in Los Angeles on Tuesday failed to notify air traffic control of the need to dump fuel and did not dump it an an optimal altitude, the FAA said Wednesday. Scores of people were on the ground when the fuel was released, including students at multiple schools who were treated for eye and skin irritation, Los Angeles County fire officials said. Peter Goelz, a former managing director for the National Transportation Safety Board, said it might be too early to judge the decisions of a pilot trying to ensure the safety of his passengers and crew. "When you have a problem that threatens the aircraft and you have to get rid of fuel, you get rid of it fast," Goelz said. Releasing the fuel was probably “not an easy call," he said.
Trump's impeachment trial stage is set
Remember the impeachment of President Trump? That’s still a thing, and it’s really heating up. The House voted Wednesday to send articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate, accusing him of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Trump’s future rests in the hands of the Republican-majority Senate, which is likely to begin a trial on whether to remove the president from office next week. Next. Week. A two-thirds majority of the Senate would be required to convict and remove Trump, which is unlikely in a chamber where Republicans outnumber Democrats 53 to 47.

Video reportedly shows second Iranian missile hit doomed plane
Surveillance video circulating on social media appears to show two missiles slamming into a Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed, killing all 176 people aboard in Tehran a week ago. The blurry video, verified by The New York Times and Storyful, appears to show a missile launching from a site near Imam Khomeini International Airport and damaging the plane moments before a second missile struck, further crippling the aircraft. The plane crashed minutes later. For three days, the Iranian military rejected claims that Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down. Then Saturday, the military issued a statement saying the plane was accidentally shot down "due to human error at a time of heightened U. S. threats of war. " The news triggered angry protests across the country, and news of a second missile could further inflame Iranians outraged by the government's handling of the tragedy.
Dark smoke is circling Earth, and it's coming from Australia, NASA says
If there was any question that the fires in Australia aren’t a global issue, NASA has something to show you. Images from the agency show a trail of bushfire smoke making its way around the world. According to NASA, the unprecedented masses of smoke created by the fires returned to their continent of origin after drifting across the Pacific Ocean and orbiting the globe. The fires have claimed at least 28 lives since September, destroyed more than 2,600 homes and scorched more than 25. 5 million acres of land, mostly in the state of New South Wales.

Texto completo: Here are a few questions to consider as you plan your 2020 exercise routines: Are your muscles confused? Should they be? And just how do we confuse our muscles anyway?
These concerns are at the heart of a timely new study of what happens when we add variety to our gym workouts and, in the process, “confuse” our muscles. The study finds that shifting, quicksilver workouts can yield some benefits that more rote regimens do not, but the benefits may not be the ones that most of us would expect.
Anyone who pays attention to fitness trends (or perhaps to politics) has probably heard the term “muscle confusion.” It was invented and popularized in the past decade by the creators of various weight-training regimens, particularly P90X, which was a favorite of the former congressman and vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan.
P90X and similar weight-training programs advise participants to alter their routines all the time, threading in different combinations of exercises and rarely, if ever, repeating any particular workout. The rationale for this inconstancy is that unfamiliar routines should perplex and discombobulate our bodies and muscles and prevent them from settling into a groove or reaching a training plateau. Instead, our muscles will supposedly respond to the unfamiliar demands of the workouts by continuing to adapt.
In essence, this theory claims that confused muscles, exposed to changing workouts, gain more size and strength than complacent muscles cycling through the same routines, even if people are lifting equivalent amounts of weight.
That idea has some appeal and many proponents but little independent scientific backing.
So, for the new study, which was published in December in PLOS One, a group of researchers from Spain and the United States who have long been interested in the effects and specifics of resistance training decided to try to confuse a few muscles and see what would happen.
They began by recruiting 19 healthy young men who already lifted weights, although none were bodybuilders. The researchers wanted volunteers familiar with most weight-training exercises and possessed of fit muscles.
They tested each volunteer’s current strength and checked the size of his leg muscles using ultrasound and also asked him to complete an online questionnaire about his interest in and motivation for exercise.
They then divided the volunteers into two groups and sent them to a university gym. There, one group began a standard, supervised weight-training routine, consisting of various upper-body and lower-body exercises, such as the bench press, dead lift and leg extension, performed on alternate days, for a total of four workouts a week.
Members of this group performed the same exercises in the same order each week, increasing their weight loads as the lifting grew easier but not otherwise varying their routine.
Those in the other group, though, were provided with a special app for their phones that created a new workout each session, picking randomly from a database of 80 possible exercises. Members of this group performed the same number of upper- and lower-body exercises and lifted approximately the same amount of weight in each session as those in the other group, but their workouts varied day to day, with almost no overlap from one session to the next.
These routines continued for eight weeks, after which the men returned to the lab for new tests of their muscles’ size and strength and a repeat of the online questionnaire about their motivation to work out.
The researchers then compared results and found that it is not easy to confuse a muscle. Overall, the men’s gains in muscular size and strength were almost exactly the same, whether they had maintained the same routines or often switched them up.
There was one notable difference between the groups, however. Those men completing the ever-changing workouts reported feeling much more motivated to exercise at the study’s end than the other group.
What these findings suggest is that muscles are not deterred or bored by unvarying routines, said Brad Schoenfeld, an associate professor of exercise science at Lehman College in New York and a co-author of the study. “They adapt to load,” he said, whether that load arrives through the same exercise or a different one each time.
But minds are not muscles and could be influenced by novelty, he said. “The differences in motivation scores at the end were substantial,” he said, suggesting that “from a purely motivational standpoint, variety matters.”
Of course, this study was small, short term and involved only fit, young men with gym experience. Whether the muscles and minds of women, older people or anyone new to weight training would respond similarly is uncertain.
The study also deliberately looked at “polar opposites” in its workouts, Schoenfeld said, from a routine with “no variation at all” to one that changed every time.
He suspects that “it’s likely that a middle ground,” in which we swap out one or two familiar exercises for new ones, might be a reasonable way to help inspire us to return to the gym, even if it never confuses our muscles.

Texto completo: Democratic debate viewers were left wondering about an exchange between Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders after cameras caught an abandoned handshake and heated conversation.
In audio released by CNN Wednesday night, you can hear Warren saying, "I think you called me a liar on national TV. "
"What?" Sanders asks.
Warren repeats, "I think you called me a liar on national TV. "
"You know, let's not do it right now. If you want to have that discussion, we'll have that discussion," Sanders said, to which Warren responds, "Anytime. "
"You called me a liar. You told me -- all right, let's not do it now," Sanders says testily.
CNN hosted the event in partnership with the Des Moines Register, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.
Tensions between Sanders and Warren in the last few days arose out of reports that Sanders told Warren in a December 2018 conversation he disagreed with her that a woman could win the White House, which Sanders has denied.
Asked about it during Tuesday's debate, Sanders said that it was an "incomprehensible" claim and denied he made it. His campaign continued to deny it Wednesday.
"Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't say it. And I don't want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want," Sanders said. "Anybody knows me knows that it's incomprehensible that I would think that a woman cannot be president of the United States. "
But debate moderator Abby Philip then turned the question to Warren: What did you think when Bernie Sanders told you that a woman could not be president?
“I disagreed,” Warren said, adding that Sanders is “my friend. ”
Warren then confronted Bernie immediately after the debate, leading to the audio CNN released Wednesday evening.
The debate was a day after Warren issued a statement acknowledging that Sanders "disagreed" that a woman could beat President Donald Trump in the election in a meeting they had to discuss the 2020 election.
After the debate, cameras were still rolling as candidates shook hands and spoke to one another on stage. There was no audio available at the time.
Sanders held out his hand to Warren as she approached, but she did not shake it. The two instead engaged in what looked like a heated discussion, with Sanders pointing toward Warren and back at himself again before turning away.
Midway through their discussion, businessman Tom Steyer approached the two and looked on at their conversation. Steyer told CNN after the debate that he hadn't heard what was being discussed, however.
"I was just going up to say 'good night, Sen. Sanders' and I felt like, OK, there's something going on here. 'Good night, I'm out of here,'" he said.
"I really wasn't listening. They were talking about getting together or something," Steyer added. "I really didn't listen. I really -- it was one of those awkward moments where I felt like, you know, I need to move on as fast as possible. "
In the audio released Wednesday, Steyer can be heard saying after the tense exchange, “I don't want to get in the middle. I just want to say hi, Bernie. ”
Warren did shake hands with former Vice President Joe Biden before the interaction with Sanders, and can be seen also shaking former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg's hand afterward.
But asked about it on Wednesday, Sanders quipped to reporters that the post-debate discussion was "about the weather," according to an NBC News journalist.

Foreign research scandal affects UF

Texto completo: Four faculty members from the University of Florida have left the school amid a widening investigation into foreign exploitation of American-funded medical research.

Three of the researchers resigned and one was terminated after the university received a letter from the National Institutes of Health regarding questionable foreign meddling in grant research and funding. The terminated employee worked part time for the universitys College of Medicine. Two were from the College of Engineering and one was from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Two of the researchers were tied directly to the inquiry by the federal agency, which gives out $30 billion a year to American scientists and universities for biomedical research. Activity by the two others came to light during the universitys own review, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.

The National Institutes of Health awarded UF more than $190 million in grants last year, more than any other Florida university. The school now joins the ranks of Tampas Moffitt Cancer Center, which last month became part of the governments inquiry into whether Americas investment in top scientific research is being systematically stolen by foreign actors.

Moffitt cut ties with its CEO Dr. Alan List and five other employees over their failure to disclose ties to Chinese programs that aim to improve the quality of that countrys research and innovation by luring back esteemed scientists. Researchers would be paid for their work, sometimes in Chinese currency. Others would steal ideas from peer-reviewed proposals that originated in the U.S. and were funded by U.S. agencies.

Evidence was found that the six Moffitt employees were potentially compensated by a Chinese talent recruitment program and failed to disclose it, officials at the center said. Moffitt officials did not divulge whether List and others accepted money from China, but said an internal investigation revealed conflicts of interest and a lack of disclosure of international collaborators.

The National Institutes of Health has launched 180 individual inquiries into 70 institutions related to foreign attempts to take advantage of U.S.-backed medical research.

The university has identified certain faculty members who were participating or were seeking to participate in a foreign talents program. The university has addressed or is in the process of addressing each of these matters, UF president W. Kent Fuchs wrote in a Dec. 13 letter to U.S. Sen. Rick Scott.

Earlier in the month, Scott sent letters to Florida university presidents requesting more information on any steps they have taken to protect intellectual property from the influence of foreign adversaries, including Communist China.

Chris Hartline, Scotts communications director, confirmed that three responses from universities have been received. The University of South Florida in Tampa had yet to submit a response as of Monday.

At the state level, Rep. Chris Sprowls is leading a committee in the Florida House to investigate the Moffitt case and others in the state. That committee will meet for the first time Tuesday, Sprowls said.

Meanwhile, other connections to Chinese recruitment programs are being discovered at research institutions across the country. A federal judge will decide what becomes of Feng Franklin Tao, an engineering professor, for allegedly working for China in secret while also working for the University of Kansas. Another cancer researcher in Boston is accused of trying to smuggle stolen lab samples in his luggage. He was attempting to board a flight to Beijing when authorities stopped him, according to the New York Times.

The University of Florida launched a website outlining the proper disclosure requirements for researchers last year. It also developed a new international risk assessment process to screen activities with foreign institutions and developed an electronic system to monitor the disclosures of outside activities and interests, which Fuchs outlined in his letter to Scott.

The UF president also offered to travel to Washington, D.C., to meet with Scott in person.

The university does not approve participation in foreign talents programs as an outside activity, Fuchs wrote. Any faculty member who fails to disclose their participation in a foreign talents program is subject to discipline, including termination for cause.

The academic apocalypse

Texto completo: This column tries to keep its cool, but last week I briefly surrendered to crisis and existential dread, to the sense that an entire world is dissolving underneath our feet - institutions crumbling, authorities corrupted, faith in the whole experiment evaporating.
How did I enter this apocalyptic mood? Not by reading about Trump's Washington or the Middle East, but by downloading a package of essays from The Chronicle of Higher Education on the academic world that helped educate me - the humanities and especially the study of literature, whose apparently-terminal condition makes the condition of the American Republic look like ruddy health.
The package's title is a single word, "Endgame," and its opening text reads like the crawl for a disaster movie. "The academic study of literature is no longer on the verge of field collapse. It's in the midst of it." Jobs are disappearing, subfields are evaporating, enrollment has tanked, and amid the wreckage the custodians of humanism are "befuddled and without purpose."
The Chronicle essays cover administrative and political battles, the transformed hiring process, the rebellions of graduate students, and the golfing-under-a-volcano aspects of the Modern Language Association conference. But the central essays are the ones that deal with the existential questions, the ways that humanism tries - and lately fails - to justify itself.
In the most interesting one, the University of Melbourne's Simon During portrays the decline of the humanities as a new form of secularization, an echo of past crises of established Christian faith. Once consecrated in place of Christianity, he suggests, high culture is now experiencing its own crisis of belief: Like revelation and tradition before it, "the value of a canon  can no longer be assumed," leaving the humane pursuits as an option for eccentrics rather than something essential for an educated life.
During's essay is very shrewd, and anyone who has considered secularization in a religious context will recognize truths in the parallels it draws. But at the same time they will also recognize the genre to which it belongs: a statement of regretful unbelief that tries to preserve faith in a more attenuated form (maybe "our canon does not bear any absolute truth and beauty," but we don't want to live with an "empty heritage" or "disown and waste the pasts that have formed us") and to make it useful to some other cause, like the wider left-wing struggle against neoliberalism.
And if there's any lesson that the decline of Christianity holds for the painful death of the English department, it's that if you aspire to keep your faith alive even in a reduced, non-hegemonic form, you need more than attenuated belief and socially-useful applications.
A thousand different forces are killing student interest in the humanities and cultural interest in high culture, and both preservation or recovery depend on more than just a belief in truth and beauty, a belief that "the best that has been thought and said" is not an empty phrase. But they depend atleast on that belief, at least on the ideas that certain books and arts and forms are superior, transcendent, atleast on the belief that students should learn to value these texts and forms before attempting their critical dissection.
This is not a dead belief in the humanities; I know many professors, most of them political liberals, for whom it is essential. But it is a contested belief, which is why the other key essays in the Chronicle package stage an argument on exactly this subject - with Michael Clune of Case Western insisting that the humanities must offer "judgment" on what is worth reading, and G. Gabrielle Starr and Kevin Dettmar of Pomona answering that no, humanists can only really "teach disciplinary procedures and habits of mind ... we model a style of engagement, of critical thought: we don't transmit value."
The Starr-Dettmar belief was my alma mater's philosophy when I was an undergraduate; back then our so-called "core" curriculum promised to teach us "approaches to knowledge" rather than the thing itself. It was, and remains, an insane view for humanists to take, a unilateral disarmament in the contest for student hearts and minds; no other discipline promises to teach only a style of thinking and not some essential substance.
And the irony is that the very forces that have undermined strictly Western and white-male approaches to canon-making have also made it easier than ever to assemble a diverse inheritor. This should, by rights, be a moment of exciting curricular debates, over which global and rediscovered and post-colonial works belong on the syllabus with Shakespeare, over whether it's possible to teach an American canon and a global canon all at once. Instead, humanists have often trapped themselves in a false choice between "dead white males" and "we don't transmit value."
Escaping that dichotomy will not restore the academic or intellectual worlds of 70 years ago. But the path to recovery begins there, with a renewed faith not only in humanism's methods and approaches, but in the very thing itself.

Texto completo: The Kansas City Chiefs and Green Bay Packers will play in their respective conference championship games on Sunday with a tidbit of historical trivia on the line: If they both win, two of football's oldest franchises would meet in the Super Bowl for the first time since the inaugural NFL-AFL championship event in January 1967. Around 100 million people will watch.
Yet even after more than half a century, and despite fervent interest, the ability to see the original television broadcast of Bart Starr leading the Packers to victory over the Chiefs is nearly impossible. Only one known copy of the footage exists, owned by Troy Haupt, a 50-year-old nurse anesthetist in North Carolina's Outer Banks. The tape, which Haupt found on quadruplex reels in his mother's attic in Pennsylvania, remains unseen by the public because of a well-documented legal standoff between Haupt and the NFL.
Now, with Haupt's blessing, two filmmakers want to change that—and they say they will take the NFL to court to make it happen.
Jeremy Coon, a producer and editor on the 2004 movie "Napoleon Dynamite," and his collaborator Tim Skousen, recently launched a Kickstarter with the goal of bringing the lost Super Bowl I footage to the masses. If they raise $1.5 million, Coon and Skousen will not only complete their documentary about the saga, which is already in production, but they will also buy the tape from Haupt, who is participating in the film and has agreed to sell. If that happens, they plan to stream the game online for free before Super Bowl LV in February 2021, knowing full well that the NFL would likely send an army of lawyers to try to stop them.
"It's too easy for the NFL to put pressure on the little guy," Skousen said. "But thousands of little guys who are their biggest fans is a lot harder."
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said, "We are not aware of this latest endeavor, but we continue to reassert our rights to enforce and protect our intellectual property."
In February 2011, The Wall Street Journal first reported the story of the shocking discovery of a Super Bowl I tape. CBS and NBC, which both aired the game, didn't preserve their footage, making any surviving copy the Holy Grail of sports TV. Before the tape's discovery, Sports Illustrated valued the artifact at more than $1 million. That article, seen by a friend in 2005, informed Haupt that the tapes stashed away at his childhood home were worth something.
When Haupt surfaced with the tapes that his father recorded, he expected the NFL to pay that much to secure an important piece of its history that seemed lost forever. Instead, it offered $30,000, refused to budge and made it clear that the league would sue if Haupt did anything with his treasure.
NFL Network showed a reconstruction of Super Bowl I stitched together from the archives of NFL Films in 2016. Haupt's tape, restored by the Paley Center for Media in New York, continues to sit in a vault and will stay there until Haupt can reach a resolution.
"I had hoped the NFL would work with us, but we never wanted to go after their multibillion-dollar legal department," Haupt said. "Our family is not set up to do that kind of thing."
Enter Coon and Skousen. They first learned about the tape from a 2016 New York Times article that first named Haupt as its owner. Before that, Haupt only allowed his attorney to speak about an unidentified client with the recording in his possession.
Coon and Skousen began working on their film about three years ago and essentially funded it themselves, securing interviews with people like Packers offensive lineman Jerry Kramer, Chiefs defensive back Fred Williamson and Jack Whitaker, the Super Bowl I announcer for CBS who died in August at age 95. They say they can finish the film if they raise $50,000 and produce a better, more polished version for $200,000.
"If we don't do something, nothing will change," Coon said. "The NFL will not do the right thing unless they're pressured."
Therefore, Coon and Skousen want to buy the tape, and Haupt says he has agreed to sell it to them for $750,000—the first time he has made it available for purchase to anybody other than the NFL or CBS. They opted to turn to crowdfunding, because, they said, traditional networks and distributors expressed fear of legal action by the NFL.
The $1.5 million they hope to collect would include a legal defense reserve. They say nearly all the money they raise will go into the project and buying the tape, not their own pockets.
"The NFL can make things difficult," Coon said. "But that's why we have a legal fund, so that we can go the distance."
Before progressing too far, Coon and Skousen contacted David Nimmer, an expert on copyright law. Nimmer assured them that he believed they could successfully argue in court that the NFL doesn't hold a copyright on Haupt's Super Bowl I tape.
Nimmer cited the Copyright Act of 1976, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1978. In an interview for Coon and Skousen's documentary, Nimmer says that that because the "NFL did not bother to preserve any of its pre-existing copies," the league could "no longer say that there were any copies 'that are fixed in a tangible medium expression'—they had been destroyed."
"And for that reason," Nimmer continues, "applying the exact language of the 1976 act, there is no federal copyright protection for Super Bowl I."
Haupt always hoped it wouldn't come to this and that the NFL would decide it wanted the tape and pay what he and independent appraisers see as a fair price for it. He no longer believes that will ever happen.
Then Coon and Skousen came along and offered a life raft: If they raised the money, they would deal with the potentially lengthy and expensive legal battle, something his family lacks the desire and resources to do. Ultimately, Haupt hopes the entire world will one day see the last surviving broadcast footage of Super Bowl I—and that he won't have to spend years in court to turn that dream into a reality.
"They're not any good just sitting in a vault somewhere," Haupt said. "We want the public to see it."

Texto completo: Who exactly was it the United States killed on Jan. 3 that sparked a ramp-up of aggression between Iran and the U. S.?
Was it Qassem Soleimani?
Was it Qassim Suleimani?
Or was it Qasem Soleimani?
It depends which news source you read.
The first spelling is courtesy of The Associated Press. The "Qasem" variation is employed by The Washington Post.
The New York Times has been going with something completely different: "Qassim Suleimani."
The issue of the proper spelling of the Iranian general’s name doesn’t hold a candle to the gravity of the story at hand, of course.
I can’t imagine Iranians are having a lot of trouble spelling the man’s name right. That’s because they spell it as he did — in Arabic, a language that has an alphabet different from ours.
In case you forgot, our 26 letters are not the "English" alphabet but the "Latin" or "Roman" alphabet.
Changing words or names from one language to another without benefit of a shared alphabet is called "transliteration."
It’s a predictable way to convert one character to another character or characters rather than by converting sounds, which is known as "transcription." Think phonetics.
With transliteration, it’s easier to reverse engineer a word to its original language.
So, why the disparity in spellings?
For many clusters of characters there is more than one transliterative system. So you get variations, as with "Soleimani."
One reason could be that there are many dialects of Arabic. I imagine people have different interpretations of spellings because of that. But I’m no expert. If I were, I’d be working for the U.N. or code-breaking or something equally sexy.
When Ukraine became a hot topic of conversation last year, I came to realize that after the country gained its independence its government established rules for transliteration of city names and such from Cyrillic into the Latin alphabet for legal proclamations and such.
And it changed "Kiev" to "Kyiv."
I’m not sure why that passed below my radar for 24 years or why mass producers of frozen "chicken Kiev" continue to use a spelling that’s been out of vogue in its namesake for a quarter century.
With some languages there is just no easy pathway to English, which explains Hanukkah and Chanukah.
It’s also why if you use the translation function on your Thai sister-in-law’s Facebook posts to her friends about your shared trip to Mexico, you’re left wondering whether you were on the same trip.

Texto completo: Newly revealed surveillance video circulating on social media appears to show two missiles slamming into a Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed, killing all 176 people aboard minutes after takeoff from Tehran a week ago.
Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, told USA TODAY it's possible the plane would have survived the first hit.
"It's conceivable that if they hadn't fired the second shot, the outcome might have been different," Goelz said. "The second shot was the kill shot that took them out. "
The video was verified by The New York Times and Storyful, a social media company owned by the parent of The Wall Street Journal. USA TODAY has not independently verified the authenticity of the video.
The blurry video appears to show a missile launching from a site near Imam Khomeini International Airport and hitting the plane, moments before the second one hits. In flames, the plane circles back to the airport. It crashed minutes later, just missing a village near the airport.
The video might explain why the plane's transponder failed before the crash.
Iran missile strike and plane crash: Here's how the horror unfolded
U. S. officials identified the weapon as the Gauntlet, a Russian-made SA-15 surface-to-air missile system. Goelz said he is not surprised that it took two missiles to take down the plane.
"A single missile designed to take down fighter planes would not ordinarily take down a 737," Goelz told USA TODAY. "This was not 'Top Gun,' not a two-seat plane. I don't know if the (737) pilots could have made a safe landing, but they could probably have controlled it a little bit. "
For three days, the Iranian military rejected claims that Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down. Then Saturday, the military issued a statement saying the plane was accidentally shot down after being misidentified as a cruise missile "due to human error at a time of heightened U. S. threats of war. "
The news triggered angry protests across the country, and news of a second missile could further inflame Iranians outraged by the government's handling of the tragedy.
Fahim Masoud, Middle East regional intelligence manager for the risk assessment firm WorldAware, said the plane disaster exposed the incompetence of the regime and its military forces. It also reflected the government's fears of an overwhelming U. S. strike, he told USA TODAY.
"The second missile strike will definitely trigger outrage both inside and outside Iran," Masoud said. "This incident will haunt the Iranian regime and Iranians for years to come.
'Our enemy is right there!': Videos show Iran protesters fleeing tear gas
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have promised a thorough investigation. Most of the passengers were Iranian or Canadian, and representatives of those countries met with Ukrainian authorities Tuesday to share information on the crash. Several arrests were announced.
Tensions between the United States and Iran have heightened since President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement designed to curb Iran's nuclear intentions. Relations grew hotter still after a U. S. drone strike in Iraq targeted and killed an Iranian general viewed by much of the West as a terrorist.
Iran promised a response, and days later, missiles slammed into Iraqi military bases housing U. S. soldiers. Hours later, tragedy struck over Tehran.
"The terrible catastrophe should be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible for this unforgivable mistake will definitely be identified and prosecuted," Rouhani said.

Texto completo: Samuel St. John Haviland, 96, of Simsbury, CT died on January 4, 2020. He was the son of Winthrop Alden Haviland and Helen Curtis St. John, and the brother of Winthrop A. Haviland, Jr. and Mary Haviland Carey. He was a loving husband, father, grandfather and friend to many.

Sam was a graduate of Kingswood School, Yale University, and Stonier Graduate School of Banking. He was a terrific athlete, starring on the soccer, basketball, and baseball teams that he played on in high school and college. He served in the US Navy during World War II and the Korean War, at one point spending months at sea without touching land. After a brief period working in the insurance industry he switched to banking. His almost three-decade career as a banker at the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company was focused on small business lending, and helping those that were underserved by the banking industry.
He married Frances Cheyney Beekley on November 4, 1961 and had four children. He loved sailing and being on the water at all stages of life. He was also an avid racquet sport player who was committed for several decades to his weekly tennis and paddle groups. He was interested in genealogy and enjoyed researching his roots and the everyday lives of his ancestors in Europe. He enjoyed spending time on Nantucket during the summers and also loved taking his family to Appalachian Mountain Club lodges and cabins in New England. During his retirement years he could be found taking classes in medieval history, reading the New York Times every day, and sharing his views on finances and investing with those around him.

He was predeceased by his older siblings, Winthrop A. Haviland Jr. and Mary Haviland Carey. He leaves behind his wife, Frances Beekley Haviland, his four children Sandy Haviland (spouse Kate Haviland), Lindsey Haviland, Dave Haviland and Sue Haviland (spouse John Schneble) as well as seven grandchildren: Charlie and Grace Haviland, Eli and Emmett Peirce, and Jack, Robby, and Jane Haviland.
A memorial service will be held at First Church of Christ in Simsbury, CT on Saturday, February 1 at 10:30 a.m.

Weinstein's sexual assaults about power, not intimacy

Texto completo: Last week the world watched as disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein shuffled into the court room for a criminal trial for two of the women who accused him of sexual assault and harassment.
Meanwhile, on the same day on the other side of the country, it was reported that new criminal charges were filed against him in Los Angeles County, alleging that Mr. Weinstein raped one woman and sexually assaulted another in 2013.
These are just the handful of charges against Mr. Weinstein that will see their day in court. From countless reports - including that infamous New York Times article that launched a global #MeToo movement - these cases represent but a fraction of the people who have accused him of sexual misconduct.
To make sense ofsuch allegedbehaviors, one must start by realizing that rape, sexual violence and harassment fundamentally have nothing to do with sex.
Jeffrey Epstein, Roger Ailes, Bill Cosby, Larry Nassar. For men like them and others, it's not about sex. It's about power, domination, control and also humiliation.
I have evaluated and treated thousands of patients who are survivors of childhood sexual abuse, rape, intimate partner violence and trafficking. Harassers and abusers get pleasure in subjecting victims to their control and demonstrating their power over the victim. Perpetrators, particularly serial perpetrators, are master manipulators. They not only take pleasure in psychologically controlling their victims but also getting away with it. This explains why abusers may attack a wide variety of victims, or engage in "sexual" behaviors that hardly seem satisfying to ordinary people - it's not about sexual attraction or intimacy.
Humiliation is at the core of the perpetrator's process, and almost every victim of sexual assault describes intense shame after the attack. The point is to render the victim helpless, with loss of all control over the situation. It's profoundly humiliating. And what does humiliation do? It silences the victim. Shame is a powerful, distressing emotion that we all try to avoid. It makes us want to hide, to bury what happened and never speak of it again. Perpetrators manipulate shame so victims blame themselves for the attack and make them feel complicit in what happened, which protects the perpetrator.
Shame also increases the likelihood for abuse to happen again. Perpetrators initially groom victims by establishing a seemingly positive relationship with them. When the sexual assault begins, the victim typically feels confused because of the "positive" relationship that preceded it. The victims almost always feel intense shame: that the rape is their fault. Perpetrators amplify that idea, convincing the victim of an alternate, reversed reality that justifies their behavior and blames the victim. Survivors of repeated childhood sexual abuse may be particularly vulnerable to repeated exploitation. Almost always, in childhood, they were victimized by attachment and authority figures. They learn that relationships are based on repeated betrayals and exploitation, making later exploitative attachments seem "normal."
Understanding the dynamics of humiliation is difficult, since shame is universally avoided. In my clinical work, when traumatized patients begin to appreciate how shame and humiliation have been used against them, it is a powerful beginning of freedom from the perpetrators' psychological control.
This process takes time and care. Through a variety of therapeutic approaches, victims can begin to recognize normal, healthy attachments and how abusive relationships distort them. And we can refute trauma-based beliefs such as "It's all my fault" and "This is all I'm good for," and begin to restore their dignity and sense of self.
Humiliation can silence victims of abuse for a lifetime. But multiple women broke the cycle of shame and humiliation and called out Mr. Weinstein for wrongs they perceived, and now he will have his day in court. This could help the women replace any alternate reality that he might have created for them, if he's guilty, with the truth.
Sexualattacks are never about sex. They areabout power and humiliation. We can only hope that justice is served in such cases,and the humiliation lands right back where it belongs: squarely on the head of the perpetrator.

Presidential hopefuls' love for Iowa rekindled

Texto completo: Every four years, Iowa is the top prize in politics, the first and perhaps most important jewel in the crown.
Before every presidential election, candidates sprint across the first-in-the-nation nominating state to pitch themselves to voters as the best person to lead their party. But the 2020 Democratic primary, with its historically crowded field, has turned the quadrennial footrace into a hectic stampede.
There are the candidates who descend on the state in their painted buses and black SUVs, racing from middle school gymnasiums to coffee shops to senior centers to make their case to any heartland voter looking for a viable candidate.
But with them comes a storm of campaign staffers, strategists, the political press, even voters from neighboring states eager to catch a glimpse of the next potential White House occupant.
Every four years, Iowa plays host to them all.
Iowa becomes a destination -- no, the destination -- in politics, leading to the first caucuses that will begin the process of selecting the next president. This year they will be held Feb. 3.
Some Iowans love it. Suddenly, Iowa is not just a flyover state but a political mecca with the vaunted reputation of being able to predict a party's eventual nominee (though it often doesn't -- ask Rick Santorum). Some Iowans come dressed for the part, dusting off their caucus uniforms like retired superheroes donning their capes: American flag suits, Abraham Lincoln top hats, Uncle Sam Halloween costumes.
Reporters fly into Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, then rent cars that they fill with remnants of Jimmy John's sandwiches and pizza from Casey's General Store. Driving back and forth on I-80, they can put 500 miles or more on these cars in a two-day span.
Money flows in. Hotels are booked. Restaurants are full. Towns with less than 1,000 people, less than 500 people, are, briefly, the center of attention.
Brew pubs and high schools become must-stops on the campaign trail. Local parades and picnics draw national coverage. The annual state fair becomes a political summit. Potluck dinners hold the same weight as closed-door meetings on Capitol Hill. There are rallies and marches. There are drum lines and rock bands.
There comes a point when the race takes over. The candidates' names are everywhere: On signs planted in yards. Blaring from billboards by the highway. Peering out of coffee shop windows.
Phones ring nonstop, with polls, with pleas. "Who is your top choice?" "Am I your top choice?" So many calls that Iowans stop picking up.
People start to hear. Cheers fill the room. The candidates, too, are all trying to hear, to speak. Mostly, though, they strut -- on makeshift stages, set up to be torn down; through downtowns; right up to Iowans' doors.
There are also moments of stillness: A local union hall before anyone arrives. A campaign office at dawn. A gym after a rally, when everyone has left.
But every four years, the rest of the nation watches as cornfields decay into barren horizon lines. The days become shorter, the weather colder, while at the same time the presence of each campaign only seems to become more and more permanent for each local resident.
It can be exhausting. The campaigning is, in the end, a performance, and Iowans see it as such.
Iowa matters, but it is also being used. Vans filled with reporters clog the streets. Campaign events take over the sandwich shop, the college auditorium, the convention hall. Personal stories become source material for candidates' plans and ideas.
Many Iowans don't want to seem invested, but they are all giving up their Saturday nights. Some bring their kids to events and ignore the pleas to go home. They bring their parents and friends. They wait in line for selfies.
Campaigns begin to mark the time in weeks instead of months, days instead of weeks. Weekdays in Iowa are, mostly, a respite: Many of the candidates have jobs in Washington and return to the state on the weekends.
Some campaigns, beleaguered by money problems or low polling numbers, end before the caucuses. Their staffers move back home because home isn't Iowa.
As the caucuses approach, the pressure of choosing a preferred candidate rises. Everyone is under scrutiny: the candidates but also the farmers, the teachers, the out-of-work factory workers.
Then an unsettling feeling creeps in. What happens when everyone leaves? When the store owners wave goodbye to the White House hopefuls because they have provided all their hope?
Every four years, Iowa is the belle of the ball. Everyone cares about Iowa.
Then it ends.
By sunrise after caucus night, everyone is gone. The hotel rooms are empty but the airport is full, everyone flying out.
But they always come back.

Trump's tariff plan leaves industry reeling

Texto completo: Most years, January is a time for the wine trade to pause and congratulate itself.
It has weathered the lucrative deluge of the holidays and should be well into the planning for the next six months, having placed orders for the summer's supply of rose and whatever else it expects will be in demand.
Instead, the last month has passed in a blur of fear and dread as the industry contemplates the Trump administration's threat to impose 100% tariffs on all wines imported from the European Union, along with a variety of other goods including foods, spirits and clothing.
Make no mistake: A tariff of that size, or any number close to that, would be catastrophic for Americans in the beverage and hospitality industry. A 100% tariff would double the price of wines in shops and restaurants, with disastrous ripple effects.
Consumers may be furious if confronted with a $25 bottle of Fleurie that has doubled in price to $50. They will have to adapt, or drink wines from somewhere else. But that hardly matters when compared with the U.S. jobs that may be lost and the businesses that could be threatened if the tariffs go into effect.
Nobody knows exactly what the outcome will be, or when it will be decided. The administration has a pattern of issuing dire threats and not always following up. Even so, the prospect has conjured up a pervasive feeling of fragility.
Some importers have postponed orders, fearing what will happen if, having calculated sales according to the price paid, a tariff is imposed while the shipment is in transit, requiring a huge lump payment on arrival and the prospect of not being able to sell the goods.
The fear does not stop with importers. An entire chain of businesses are built around the acquisition and sale of European wines and foods, from distributors to retail shops and restaurants, and all the associated workers -- not to mention dock labor, forklift drivers and others.
"We hope this doesn't happen," said Beatrice Tosti di Valminuta, who, with her husband, Julio Pena, owns Il Posto Accanto, an Italian wine bar and trattoria that opened 21 years ago in New York City's East Village, and whose wine list is almost entirely Italian. "We're not a big company that can absorb this kind of thing. We are a local restaurant with workers who have been with us forever and neighbors who have supported us for years. This will be the end of us."
The new tariff threat comes on top of a 25% tariff imposed in October on certain European foods, drinks and products -- a fee that so far has largely been absorbed by importers, distributors and producers.
"The 25% was already really, really tough," said Jon-David Headrick, who imports French wines exclusively, focusing on small family estates. "I was really proud that the growers almost to a one stepped up and helped, and prices in the market haven't risen by a significant amount yet."
The new rate will be another matter entirely.
"This changes the game completely," said Harry Root, who, with his wife, Nicki Root, owns Grassroots Wine in Charleston, South Carolina, which distributes wine throughout the Southeast. "It would affect 60% of what we sell. These products are irreplaceable."
The tariffs are part of an American retaliation against the European Union over subsidies it gives to the European aerospace company Airbus. In September, the World Trade Organization ruled that the company had violated global trade rules.
The Trump administration is also considering a separate 100% tariff on Champagne and other products in retaliation for a new tax it said unfairly targets U.S. technology companies.
The Trump administration has not said why it has singled out wine and food in a dispute over industry and technology. Heavy machinery, aircraft and pharmaceutical products, for example, accounted for more than 40% of France's exports to the United States in 2018, while beverages, spirits and vinegar make up about 9% of the French exports, according to Trading Economics, a statistical website.
"From a political standpoint, it's completely ludicrous to have these trade wars somehow connect airplanes to wine," said Danny Meyer, whose restaurants, including Marta, Maialino and Gramercy Tavern, depend on European wines. "It's the one time I'm happy we have so many wines in reserve."
The potential tariffs may be damaging as well to small producers in Europe whose businesses are focused on the U.S. market. Luxury goods corporations, with wine divisions and big wine companies, have the resources to adapt and find other markets. But tiny family estates as well as the small importers who work with them will be in trouble.
"Yes, they can find other markets, but that can take many months," Headrick said. "The Europeans will recover, but Americans will be crushed by this."
Good wine is the product of a culture and a place. If, for example, the already sky-high price of Burgundy doubles, consumers will not be able to replace it by switching to, say, Oregon pinot noir. It's a different wine. Similarly, Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon may have been inspired by Bordeaux, but the wines are not interchangeable. Without European options, Americans will be drinking differently.
Nor will high tariffs on European wines necessarily be a boon, as some have suggested, for the U.S. wine industry, especially for small U.S. producers who depend on their distributors to explain their wines to customers.
"The short-term impact is likely to be pretty serious and pretty negative," said Jason Haas, general manager of Tablas Creek Vineyard, an excellent producer in Paso Robles, California. "All wines rely on the same distribution network. If the prices double on European wines, it will have an immediate negative impact on all those distributors."
Small businesses are left trying to imagine how they will cope if the products they depend on become prohibitively expensive. Shelley Lindgren is the proprietor and wine director of A16, a southern Italian restaurant in San Francisco that since 2004 has been a showcase for little-known Italian wine regions and producers. She is concerned for her restaurant and the producers from whom she buys wine.
"We work with a lot of microproducers from Italy," she said. "It's punitive to the wrong people for the wrong reasons."
Still she is optimistic, partly because of the hardships the restaurants have already endured in San Francisco, where rents have risen drastically over the last 15 years, the minimum wage has increased and new taxes have been imposed. Tariffs will be one more burden, but she is confident she will be able to adapt.
"Maybe we'll have to have a smaller menu, or less wines to offer," she said. "I feel optimistic because there is so much wine in Italy, so much still to discover."

Texto completo: One of the questions I get asked most often is, "How do you stay inspired to create new recipes?"
In the movie version of my life, I tell people that inspiration hits me when I'm strolling a market overseas, or rereading old cookbooks while I sip tea on my comfortable couch. But the actual answer is, sometimes I don't stay inspired. Sometimes I have no ideas at all, and start furiously mapping out plans for a second career, Googling how long it would take to become a botanist.
In these moments, I find it most useful to do anything but try to be creative. I repot a plant, take a hot yoga class, attempt minor accounting work. But where I often land after these activities is at home, sans groceries and extremely hungry, turning to my (admittedly well-stocked) pantry. Here, I let the primal, emotional need for something delicious take over, rather than my intellect, which demands that every opportunity for making dinner somehow relate to work.
Turns out, the primal, emotional need almost always involves beans. Probably the brothy, spicy variety, loaded with bitter greens. I will not apologize for my predictability.
Depending on how much time I've got, the beans are either dried (preferred!) or from a can (realistic!). But regardless, they are cooked in lots of olive oil with whatever combination of fried onions, shallots and garlic I have on hand. I might add some tomato paste or a few anchovy fillets, but here, I'm adding harissa, which I like to caramelize in the olive oil just as I would tomato paste, and some fresh or preserved lemon. If you want the spiciness but aren't stocking harissa paste, red-pepper flakes, a little bit of cumin and a tablespoon or two of tomato paste will get you close.
From there, I simmer everything in chicken broth because it's what I keep around. (You can use vegetable broth if you prefer.) The final texture of this dish can be soupy or stewlike, depending on how much you cook down the beans -- I like to smash them with the back of a wooden spoon, encouraging their creamy interior to thicken the broth.
Once the beans are as soupy or stewy as I please, I add an entire bunch of broccoli raab or kale, which I always have in my refrigerator because I love my dark leafy greens in any and all applications. Whatever I'm working with, I strip the leaves from the stems, chop the stems and add them to the beans as they simmer. I toss in the leaves at the very end, just to wilt them.
This satisfyingly creamy bean stew is lovely and perfect all on its own, but you can also garnish it like a bowl of chili. I won't go so far as to say that it's a fridge clean-out free-for-all, but I do use this as an opportunity to use up the last of that odd bit of feta or pecorino, whatever fresh herbs I have lingering (parsley, cilantro, mint, dill), and sometimes that last egg (fried and crispy, or medium-boiled and sliced, please).
This pot of pantry staples might not seem like much, but it is a nice reminder that it's OK to empty yourself of ideas from time to time: The act alone might lead you to your next good one.

Spicy white bean stew with broccoli raab
Prep: 20 minutes
Cook: 30 minutes
Makes: 4 servings

1 large bunch (or 2 small bunches) broccoli raab or kale, thick stems separated from the leaves
1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling
4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 medium red or yellow onion, thinly sliced
Kosher salt and black pepper
2 to 3 tablespoons harissa or tomato paste
Red-pepper flakes, optional
3 cans (15 ounces each) large white beans, such as cannellini, drained, rinsed
4 cups vegetable or chicken broth
1 preserved lemon, thinly sliced, or 1 lemon, halved, for squeezing
2 ounces feta or other salty cheese, such as queso fresco or pecorino, crumbled
1 cup parsley or cilantro, leaves and tender stems
Fried or medium-boiled eggs, optional

1. Tear broccoli raab or kale leaves into bite-size pieces; set aside. Chop the stems into about 1/4-inch pieces; set aside.
2. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and sizzled at the edges, 4 to 6 minutes.
3. Add harissa (or tomato paste and a pinch of red-pepper flakes); stir to coat in the oil. Cook until the harissa is a nice brick red color, the sugars start to caramelize and the oil turns a vibrant orange color, about 2 minutes.
4. Add beans; season with salt and pepper. Crush a few beans with a wooden spoon to release their creamy interior.
5. Add the broth and reserved stems; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer; cook to desired consistency (less time for a brothier soup, more time for a thicker stew), 15 to 20 minutes.
6. Add broccoli raab or kale leaves and preserved lemon or lemon juice; stir to wilt the greens. Season with salt, pepper and more red-pepper flakes if you want it spicier. Serve with feta and parsley, and with eggs, if you like.

Texto completo: Popular dating services like Grindr, OkCupid and Tinder are spreading user information like dating choices and precise location to advertising and marketing companies in ways that may violate privacy laws, according to a new report that examined some of the world's most downloaded Android apps.
Grindr, the world's most popular gay dating app, transmitted user-tracking codes and the app's name to more than a dozen companies, essentially tagging individuals with their sexual orientation, according to the report, which was released Tuesday by the Norwegian Consumer Council, a government-funded nonprofit organization in Oslo.
Grindr also sent a user's location to multiple companies, which may then share that data with many other businesses, the report said. When The New York Times tested Grindr's Android app, it shared precise latitude and longitude information with five companies.
The researchers also reported that the OkCupid app sent a user's ethnicity and answers to personal profile questions -- like "Have you used psychedelic drugs?" -- to a firm that helps companies tailor marketing messages to users. The Times found that the OkCupid site had recently posted a list of more than 300 advertising and analytics "partners" with which it may share users' information.
"Any consumer with an average number of apps on their phone -- anywhere between 40 and 80 apps -- will have their data shared with hundreds or perhaps thousands of actors online," said Finn Myrstad, the digital policy director for the Norwegian Consumer Council, who oversaw the report.
The report, "Out of Control: How Consumers Are Exploited by the Online Advertising Industry," adds to a growing body of research exposing a vast ecosystem of companies that freely track hundreds of millions of people and peddle their personal information. This surveillance system enables scores of businesses, whose names are unknown to many consumers, to quietly profile individuals, target them with ads and try to sway their behavior.
The report appears two weeks after California enacted a broad new consumer privacy law. Among other things, the law requires many companies that trade consumers' personal details for money or other compensation to allow people to easily stop the spread of their information.
In addition, regulators in the European Union are stepping up enforcement of their own data protection law, which prohibits companies from collecting personal information without a person's explicit consent.
The Norwegian group said it planned to file complaints Tuesday asking regulators in Oslo to investigate Grindr and five ad tech companies for possible violations of the European data protection law. A coalition of consumer groups in the U.S. said it was also sending letters to American regulators, urging them to investigate whether the companies' practices violated federal and state laws.

Marathon running may be good for your knees

Texto completo: Could it be that marathon training and racing are actually good for our knees?
A myth-toppling new study of novice, middle-aged runners suggests that the answer is a qualified yes. The study finds that taking up distance running rebuilds the health of certain essential components of middle-aged knees, even if the joints start off somewhat tattered and worn.
But the results also contain a caution. Marathon mileage could erode one vulnerable area within the knee, the study finds, if runners are not careful.
Those of us who run can almost be assured of hearing from concerned friends and relatives that we are ruining our knees. This notion is so entrenched that it discourages some people from trying the sport and worries those of us who continue.
But little of the available research about knees in motion supports that idea. Most past experiments indicate that running generally is not harmful for healthy knees. In one much-cited study, elderly runners developed knee arthritis at lower rates than sedentary people. And in another, more recent study, young people's knees grew less inflamed after a run than after a long stretch of sitting.
But most of this science has focused on whether running actively harms knees, not whether it might somehow refurbish and spiff up joints beginning to show signs of wear and tear.
That question became personal in 2012 for Dr. Alister Hart, an orthopedic surgeon and research professor at University College London, who oversaw the new study. That year, he says, he ran his first marathon.
"For two weeks afterward, I needed a handrail to do stairs," he says. "My quads were agony. My hip- and knee-replacement colleagues told me that I was mad."
He, too, was a bit concerned on behalf of his knees, and decided that it would be a service to all runners to look closely at what marathon training might be doing to those joints. So, for the new study, which was published in October in BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (with funding primarily from voluntary contributions by Hart's patients), he and his research associate Laura Maria Horga and other colleagues turned to the entry rolls of an upcoming London Marathon.
There, they identified and contacted middle-aged entrants who had listed themselves as first-time marathon runners. They wound up with more than 80 novice racers, most in their mid-40s and few of whom had run or exercised much in the past.
The researchers asked these men and women about their knees. At this point, the marathon was still six months distant, and their joints were those of middle-aged adults and not yet those of runners. All of the soon-to-be marathoners responded that the joints were in good shape, with no creaks or pains.
The researchers then gathered the volunteers at a university facility and scanned everyone's knees, using a sophisticated, high-resolution type of MRI that reveals even minor damage in the joint's tissues.
A few months later, the men and women began the same, four-month marathon-training program. Eventually, 71 of them finished the race, in an average time of 5 hours and 20 minutes. Two weeks later, they returned to the lab to have their knees rescanned.
The scientists then compared their hundreds of before-and-after scans and turned up some surprises. For one, while the participants had reported at the start of the study that their knees felt fine, many, in fact, harbored damage. About half of the pretraining knees contained frayed or torn cartilage, and others showed lesions in the joint's bone marrow. Similar patterns of tears and lesions can signal incipient bone erosion and arthritis, the researchers knew.
The postrace scans held other, new and unexpected results. "I expected to see additional damage" in runners' knees, Hart said.
Instead, many of the existing bone-marrow lesions had shrunk, as had some of the damage in the runners' cartilage. At the same time, some racers had developed new tears and strains in the cartilage and other tissues at the front of their knees, around the kneecap, a part of the joint known to be stressed during running. That area also, though, tends to be less prone to arthritis than other portions of the knee.
Overall, "the main weight-bearing knee compartments showed beneficial effects from the marathon," says Horga, meaning that, in general, the knees were healthier.
Just how running remade the marathoners' knees remains uncertain, she says, but it most likely involved strengthening of the muscles surrounding the joint, helping to stabilize it and reduce or even reverse tissue damage there. Meanwhile, the unfamiliar pounding of the running focused large forces on the kneecap area, overtaxing it.
Training on softer surfaces, such as trails or grass, might lessen the buffeting around the kneecap, she says, as could tinkering with shoes, mileage or running form, although any changes to training routines should be feathered in gradually.
Of course, this study was short term and focused on middle-aged marathon newcomers with no history of knee problems. Whether running would be constructive for the knees of older runners or people whose joints ache is not certain. The scientists also do not know if changes in knee health linger or what the effects are on other joints, such as the hips. They are planning a six-month follow-up study of their participants' knees, though, and a study of hips. The results will be posted at runningforscience.org.

Texto completo: I never had much use for the queen.
Maybe it's the Irish in me. As Winston Churchill said: "We've always found the Irish a bit odd. They refuse to be English."
Or maybe it's the American in me. We did go to an awful lot of trouble to break away from that corgi-and-gin-loving racket 244 years ago.
At some visceral level, though, America must regret being torn away from the royal family. How else to explain our enduring fascination with dynasties? Having spent my career covering four dysfunctional political dynasties, I rebel more than ever at the idea that biology entitles you to authority.
The ghost of Diana gone rogue animates the fractured fairy tale of Meghan and Harry, and their intemperate attempt to upend centuries of starchy rules and break away from the Firm.
Princess Di's dangerous tango with the tabloids left Harry with no taste to play that game again, especially with streaks of racism against Markle added to the mix. He recently confessed that every click or flash of a camera brought memories of his mother's death racing back into his mind.
I covered Diana's first trip as the Princess of Wales to America in 1985. She seemed happy then, in that year before Charles resumed his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. She and the prince shared amused eye contact, winks and teasing remarks.
Nancy Reagan planned an evening of candlelit dancing at the White House worthy of a 24-year-old Cinderella in a midnight blue velvet gown. The first lady arranged for the Marine Band to play "Night Fever" as John Travolta spun a euphoric Diana around the floor. ("She's a great little mover," he said afterward.)
I wondered how Prince Charles would deal with a young wife with so much star power, absorbing so much attention. We were all mesmerized when she tucked her chin down in that shy pose and cast that modest yet saucy look up at us.
The answer was: He did not deal with it well. Twelve years later, when the unimaginable tragedy hit, the royal ice cubes were furious at the expectation that they should emote for the woman who had publicly ripped the monarchy as a bloodless, soulless gang and christened herself the Prisoner of Wales.
The Firm was out of its depth then, and it is again now. How can the queen and Prince Philip and Prince Charles possibly understand the desire of Meghan and Harry to rebrand as a Goopish lifestyle enterprise? The news that they have applied to trademark hundreds of items, from socks to hoodies, under the "Sussex Royal" logo makes Wallis Simpson's exile in the Bahamas, spent matching the color on the walls to her face powder, seem positively monastic.
Can you really call yourself "financially independent" when all you're doing is cashing in on the royal name?
Given the state of the world and the implosion of the British Empire - with Scots once more contemplating an off ramp, Irish unity in play, Australia on fire and Boris Johnson tricking the queen into suspending Parliament in a Brexit ploy - it is hard to feel sorry for the Duchess of Sussex complaining that her diamonds are heavy. The pathos for Markle, trapped in a designer cage, goes only so far.
It's easy for royals to come to North America, where they are lavishly embraced as celebrities without all those pesky restrictions about class and role. (See "The Crown" episode about a wild, imbibing Princess Margaret charming LBJ.)
Still, I think Meghan Markle should have wielded her wokeness where it is most needed - in Buckingham Palace. She could have channeled the Obamas, who did a magnificent job of rising above racist taunts and working within the institution to imprint a new image of racial possibility in America.
Markle had already successfully brought a refreshing dose of semi-radical chic to the royal family. Her visits to a mosque that housed Londoners displaced by the Grenfell Tower fire led to her putting out a 2018 cookbook, the proceeds of which went to the victims.
At its best, the monarchy has been able to lift up people, as it did during the blitz in World War II.
I saw that ability to alchemize emotions and opinions when I covered the queen on her visit to Ireland in 2011, the first by a British monarch in a century. It was impossible not to be impressed watching her speak Gaelic and offering regret about how Britain had made Ireland suffer, bowing her head at the scene of Bloody Sunday and the Garden of Remembrance, the sacred ground for slain Irish patriots.
The Irish started out skeptical, but by the end of her visit, many were calling her "Betty" on Twitter.
The queen of England holds out the idea that she and her family should have some sort of vestigial moral authority. But with the Prince Andrew imbroglio in the seraglio of Jeffrey Epstein, and with Harry's run for the Hollywood Hills, it is clear that many in her family are not interested in moral authority.
The collapse of the authority of the British monarchy mirrors the collapse of authorities generally, scarred by years of scandals about clergymen abusing children, athletes beating up girlfriends and university officials accepting bribes.
And yet, even if the royals' role in the culture is now akin to the Kardashians, it wasn't cool for Meghan and Harry to pants the 93-year-old queen, defy her instructions, dump their Megxit plan on Instagram and intensify the sad split between the brothers. (If ever there was a time for some dry gin. ...)
What's the rush to give up real influence to be an Instagram influencer? Besides, who unfollows their own grandmother?

Texto completo: Spending time with your significant other's family can be stressful, especially if you're meeting them for the very first time.
While each romantic relationship moves at its own pace, Wyatt Fisher, a clinical psychologist in Boulder, Colorado, recommends waiting about three months from when you first started dating to introduce your partner to family members. "Just to make sure the relationship has a good footing, and you're feeling like this has some potential," Fisher said.
To keep that solid standing while attending familial festivities - and maybe get invited back next year - here are some suggestions from relationship and etiquette experts.
Send or bring
a gift
The general rule of thumb is never arrive empty-handed, said Myka Meier, a founder of the Plaza Hotel Finishing Program in New York, which provides etiquette courses. "It's not only to show a gesture of that first meeting, but it's also showing gratitude for the invitation."
You can send a flower arrangement (not a bouquet) ahead of time. Or, if you prefer having a gift in hand, baked goods, holiday-themed candles or toys for the family pet are appropriate. Meier warns against gifting alcohol - in case they're nondrinkers. "You may not know what their preferences are," she said.
Dress appropriately
During certain get-togethers, some families sport formal wear, while others opt for casual, matching get-ups (even pajamas). It's always a good idea to confirm dress-code expectations with your partner or ask the parents ahead of time.
"Talk ear-to-ear with the hosts," said Jodi R.R. Smith, the founder of Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting in Boston. "Say, 'I want to pack appropriately. ... Do you dress up? Do you dress down?' " Parents are usually happy to discuss wardrobe coordination in advance, she said, so guests can plan accordingly.
Address them appropriately
Keep things formal for starters, unless otherwise noted. "I would always recommend having a title in front of their names to show respect," Meier said. The parents, of course, may insist that you call them by their first names, or even a nickname. "Let them ask you to call them something else," she said.
Remain focused
While speaking with family members, it's important to make eye contact, establish a firm handshake and put away your phone, if you are able.
"Be truly present when someone is talking, and allow yourself a moment to respond genuinely," said Anna Nicholaides, a clinical psychologist and owner of Philadelphia Couples Therapy. Nicholaides notes these practices display mindfulness while growing relationship intimacy. "Frankly, it makes people like you more when you're a good listener."
Stay upbeat
You'll want to avoid discussing politics, religion and controversial subjects. Instead, talk about where you're from, shared interests, hobbies and sports, and ask them questions, too. Also, avoid being critical. "No complaining about how hard your job is, or your bout with the flu," Meier said.
Show, don't touch
In the family home, cultural differences can affect how you interact with your partner, and this includes public displays of affection.
Meier suggests following the lead of your significant other. "If your partner is reaching for your hand and trying to hug or kiss you in front of family, that's what they're comfortable with," she said.
If being physically affectionate is a no-no in that family, there are other ways to demonstrate your affection. "You can display kindness to your partner by laughing at their jokes," Nicholaides said.
Lend a hand
You can be a team player by kindly offering to assist with chores such as setting the table or clearing it after a meal. "It could come off as lazy if you're sitting there watching a host and hostess run around, and looking expectant to be served," Meier said. "If they say no, then they don't want you to, and that's OK."
Don't get tipsy
Try to limit your alcohol consumption to one or two glasses of wine to keep your composure. "Don't use alcohol as a social crutch," Smith said, adding, "You don't want to give them any reason to not like you."
Besides, you can always enjoy your favorite cocktail when you're back at home or meet up with friends later at a bar.

Talking to my daughter about war, 'megafires'

Texto completo: We were on the way to ballet rehearsal. It's my favorite 30 minutes of the day. It's a chance to touch base with my only child. She's 14 now, and it won't be long before she's driving herself.
"So," I asked her. "How was school today?"
"We were arguing about whether we're more likely to die from World War III or climate change," she said.
Her response stopped me cold, but I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.
With the dogs of war straining at the leash, the missiles flying in Iran, and our bellicose and unstable commander-in-chief lurching from one scarcely believable justification to the next, the prospect of another American forever war on the other side of the world didn't seem all that far-fetched.
First up, I disabused her of the notion that any of her classmates might be drafted, reassuring her that there was no such movement afoot on Capitol Hill.
She seemed relieved at that news. Talking to her about climate change was another matter entirely.
It seemed to me there were decades remaining before the Earth might be rendered uninhabitable because of climate change, I offered. Which didn't mean that we shouldn't do all we can right now, I added.
"But Australia is burning," she countered.
As of this writing, NPR was reporting that a hellish "megafire" comprising an unfathomable 1.5 million acres, an area three times larger than any brush fire in California, had taken shape in New South Wales and Victoria, the country's most populous states.
Writing in the New York Times, columnist Paul Krugman observed that, in a more rational time, the fires, which have been partially a result of climate change, "would have represented a turning point."
"After all, it's exactly the kind of catastrophe climate scientists long warned us to expect if we didn't take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions," he wrote. "In fact, a 2008 report commissioned by the Australian government predicted that global warming would cause the nation's fire seasons to begin earlier, end later, and be more intense – starting around 2020."
And all this got me to thinking about the world that we're bequeathing to my daughter and her classmates.
While much is better about the planet, there's still much to be concerned about. And the threat of an uninhabitable world should lead us to a united search for solutions, not juvenile taunts hurled at a teenager by one of the most powerful people on Earth.
I'm still firm in my belief that it's not too late for us to shrug off all that divides us, and to work together to fight these threats.
But that means having a nation that engages with the global community, not denigrates it; one that rejects the false choice that less gun violence somehow means fewer rights; and one that doesn't stare at each over the trenches, each irrevocably convinced that its way is the only way.
My daughter – and all our children – deserve far better answers than the ones we've been giving them.

These popular North Jersey restaurants are worth the wait

Texto completo: Throw a stone in North Jersey and you're likely to hit a deli, pizza shop or diner. By this logic, there's really no reason to wait too long for any meal. And yet, there are still a few spots that are known for their long lines. Why? Because the food is that good. We're not talking peddlers of trendy #Instafood — spots that will get their 15-minutes of long-lined fame before sputtering out in the wake of the Next Big Thing. We're talking institutions that have gained their reputation through years of making food that's worthy of a 30-minute, 45-minute, hour-long wait.
So Kong Dong, Fort Lee So Kong Dong doesn't look particularly pretty from the outside. Set back from the road along Fort Lee's Main Street with an old red awning and low ceilings, So Kong Dong is more revered for what's inside: vats of soft tofu soup.
This beloved tofu soup is made in a beef-bone broth that simmers for more than a day. It's available in five different levels of spiciness, from "white" to "very hot." Soup choices include mushroom, seafood, beef, kimchi and pork — the one constant is the abundance of silky, slippery tofu that swims in the well-seasoned red broth ($10.95).
Each bowl is served boiling hot. If you so please, you can crack a raw egg into the soup. Banchan, served before the soup, includes crunchy kimchi, crisp garlic broccoli, slick beansprouts and a cup of short-grain Korean rice cooked perfectly in a dolsot (a stone pot).
All this goodness earned So Kong Dong a "very good" in a New York Times review, and some very long lines that are worth the wait.
Go: 130 Main St., Fort Lee; 201-585-1122, so-kong-dong.com.
Razza, Jersey City If you want to eat the food of one of the most influential chefs in New Jersey, you're going to have get in line. Literally. Dan Richer put New Jersey pizza on the map when he opened Razza in Jersey City in 2012. The New York Times gave it a 3-star review, and Richer has garnered two James Beard Award nominations.
His beloved pizza is made with California tomatoes and olive oil from American olives, which he says make it to his door faster and fresher than anything from Italy. The cheese is made in-house, as is the bread and butter. The flour is milled in Clifton. The pizza — be it a classic margherita ($17) or the complex Di Natale, made with olives, pine nuts, raisins and chili oil ($18) — is fired in a wood-burning oven.
Richer is obsessed with crafting the perfect pie — a pie worthy of a wait.
Go: 275 Grove St., Jersey City; 201-356-9348, razzanj.com.
Bogie's Hoagies, Hawthorne Place your order at the counter, get your order number and settle into a chair at Bogie's Hoagies. It might be a while.
That's because owner Paul Beaugard, a Leonia native and graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, isn't slapping pre-sliced meat on a mediocre roll and calling it a day.
At Bogie's, the fries are hand-cut, the chicken broth is made from scratch, the brisket is smoked in house for 18 hours, the pasta is also made on-site, and the Neapolitan-style pizza is made in a special oven made by craftsmen from Italy.
"The reasons our lines get a little bit long is because we make everything to order," said Beaugard.
For the chicken parm sandwich, the chicken is grilled or fried after the order is placed — not before.
In an effort to crowd-control, Beaugard happily reports that Bogie's is now on the app ChowNow, which allows customers to place an order remotely and pick it up later.
Go: 421 Lafayette Ave., Hawthorne; 973-423-2221, bogieshoagies.com.
Tops Diner, East Newark It's a testament to Tops that, with so many diners to choose from, hungry (perhaps hungover) guests are still willing to wait sometimes up to an hour for its food. Why not drive down the street to the next greasy griddle? The answer is simply because Tops does diner food better than most.
Its accolades speak for itself. Thrillist named it the "most iconic" restaurant in the state. Time Out magazine ranked it the best diner in the country. Insider lauded it as the most famous restaurant in New Jersey. Why? Because the potatoes in its brunch poutine manage to hold their crunch despite the fact that they're piled with brown gravy, cheese, applewood bacon and two sunny-side-up eggs ($11). Because the from-scratch chocolate chip pancakes are served with a decadent side of heady chocolate sauce ($12). Because the short rib burger is made with 5 ounces of slow-cooked meat, perfectly paired with Havarti cheese, grilled onions, arugula and garlic aioli ($19).
And its crowd-control system — you can tell the host your cell number and they'll text you when your table is ready — makes the wait slightly more bearable.
Go: 500 Passaic Ave., East Newark; 973-481-0490, thetopsdiner.com.
Ted's North Deli, Paramus A deli may not pop into your mind as one of the best places to get French fries. But, Ted's North Delicatessen is as much known for its crinkle-cut fries as it is for its hearty deli sandwiches.
"A lot of people try to guess what's on the fries, but they never get it right," owner Patrick Cahill said. The seasoning sprinkled on hot, crispy fries is a sworn secret ($4.99 for a small; $5.00 for a large).
But, those ridged potato sticks aren't the only reason folks line up in droves at Ted's North. They're also happy to take a number for its subs — like The Goomba, made with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes and roasted red peppers ($8.50) — homemade salads ($10.00 for shrimp or seafood salad to $4.25 for potato, macaroni or coleslaw), and buffalo wings ($4.99 for six and $8.99 for 12).
Go: 314 Spring Valley Road, Paramus; 201-261-9599, tedsnorth.com.
Cosmo's Italian Salumeria, Hackensack Is there anything more perfect than high-quality deli meat, house-made mozzarella, a shower of fresh, shredded lettuce and zesty oil and vinegar on a firm, crusty loaf of bread? We — and the many people that wait patiently for their turn to order at Cosmo's Italian Salumeria — think not.
Owner Cosmo DePinto says he tries to get people in and out at the tiny, barebones shop as quickly as they can. "If you come around noon we'll try to serve you in about five minutes," he said. But the lines are rarely so kind. Which is not to say the Italian sub ($6.25), chicken cutlet sandwich ($6.50) and other heroes and salads aren't worth the wait. And the editors of Saveur magazine agree. They recognized it as one of the best delis in the tri-state.
The rolls are sourced from three or four different bakeries, says DePinto. The deli meats are "mostly Boar's Head." The mozzarella (a shop favorite) is made in-house. According to DePinto: "We use natural ingredients. They're fresh, and we give a good price." Enough said.
Go: 705 Main St., Hackensack; 201-342-8076.
Star Tavern, Orange One of the first things customers see when they walk into Star Tavern is a sign stuck to the window that says: "Welcome! The line forms by the kitchen." And it's there you'll wait for the ultra-thin pizza that many call the best bar pie in the state ($11.25 for a regular cheese). In 2019, The Daily Meal listed Star Tavern's pie as 32nd on its list of The 101 Best Pizzas in America. New Jersey Monthly readers voted it the best pizzeria in North Jersey.
What makes the pizza so great? Its thin crunchy crust, slightly charred at the ends, that still manages to hold up toppings without folding. The cheese that runs all the way to the edge of the pie. The ample toppings. With more than 65 years in biz, Star Tavern knows what it's about.
Go: 400 High St., Orange; 973-675-3336, startavern.net.
Vitamia & Sons Ravioli Co., Garfield Vitamia & Sons Ravioli Co. is a one-stop-shop for fantastic Italian food. The slightly garlicky, airy meatball subs, the handmade pasta packaged up and ready to take home, the homemade mozzarella, the spicy, soft, legendary sausage bread, and — yes — the ravioli, have made this old-school shop a North Jersey favorite.
The weekends and around the holidays are when the lines at Vitamia can get lengthy. To avoid, try stopping in on a weekday.
Go: 206 Harrison Ave., Garfield; 973-546-1140.

Texto completo: Some of the nation's top news media organizations are rallying behind The Journal News' yearslong effort to have the New York State Thruway Authority turn over documents critical to the public's understanding of how taxpayer money was spent to build the $4 billion Mario M. Cuomo Bridge.
Twenty-one media organizations, along with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Society of Professional Journalists, say the authority disregarded public disclosure laws by refusing to release information in a timely manner, forcing the newspaper to hire lawyers for information that should have been made available.
It's the latest showdown between the state and news organizations over the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL), a 45-year-old old law designed to create transparency in government agencies that some say has become a "toothless tiger."
"The Authority's actions in this case are inconsistent with FOIL's purpose to promote openness and transparency in state and local government," lawyers for the media groups wrote. "The Authority adopted a 'sue us attitude,' forcing Plaintiff to incur costly litigation fees over the past eighteen months in an attempt to obtain documents."
The opposing sides are slated to appear before an appeals court panel in Albany Wednesday.
At issue is a state Supreme Court judge's decision from February 2019 that sided with the Thruway Authority, saying the nearly 10 months it took to comply with The Journal News' request was reasonable considering the amount of information being sought. The judge also turned down The Journal News' request for legal fees.
The Journal News is seeking a reversal of those decisions and a finding that the authority violated the Freedom of Information Law.
The Freedom of Information Law was enacted in 1974 to ensure the public timely access to government records. Its arrival was hailed by then-Gov. Malcolm Wilson, whose contributions to the state were recognized when the Tappan Zee Bridge was renamed in 1994.
"A free society can be maintained only when government is open and accessible to its citizens," Wilson said. The Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee Bridge was torn down to make way for the Cuomo Bridge.
Generally, the law requires a state agency to respond to information requests within 20 days or cite a reason for why it can't meet the deadline.
But lawyers for news and media organizations, among them The New York Times and The Associated Press, say delays are becoming the norm. And when government agencies do comply, they often do so long after the controversies that prompted the records request have quieted, they say.
"Sadly, this sort of behavior is not uncommon," The Journal News' lawyers write. "Agencies have every incentive to thwart the transparency that FOIL is designed to provide. And they are zealously and very capably defended by the Attorney General when challenged. The courts of this state are the only institution to which the people and the press of this state can turn in order to make FOIL's promise a reality."
State lawmakers, in an effort to prevent agency delays, added a provision in 2006 that allowed the requesting party to seek attorney fees.
The Journal News enlisted the help of attorneys in 2018 after the Thruway Authority repeatedly delayed the release of information shared between Thruway officials ahead of the opening of the first span of the Cuomo Bridge.
The first request seeking emails, letters and correspondence regarding the opening of the new bridge was made in August 2017.
Nearly 10 months later, after the Journal News sued, the authority turned over more than 1,000 pages of documents, two thirds of which were news articles about the bridge project that could have been accessed on the web, the newspapers lawyers say.
"Even then – indeed to this day – the Authority continues to withhold some untold number of responsive documents, relaying on purported exemptions that it has never attempted to justify," The Journal News' lawyers write.
The Journal News is being represented by Glenn Edwards and Jennifer Philbrick McArdle of the Satterlee Stephens law firm in New York. The media organizations are represented by Mark Bailen and Kristen Rasmussen of Baker & Hostetler in Washington, D.C., along with Katie Townsend and Lin Weeks for the Reporters Committee.
The request sought information shared between 12 individuals who work for the Authority. The Thruway Authority argued that it was a time-consuming endeavor that involved the review of sensitive security information before the information could be turned over.
The Thruway Authority has argued that the issue currently before the appeals court is "moot" and said the authority did not "abuse its broad discretion in denying petitioner's request for attorney's fees and costs."
If the newspaper prevails, the authority would be forced to reconsider its claim that the documents are exempted.
The press is not alone It's not only news organizations that are facing government roadblocks.
Lawyers for the news organizations cite instances in which public officials have been denied prompt access to government records. For instance, they say the state Department of Education repeatedly stalled a Harlem councilwoman's FOIL request for information about which of the 16 schools in her district have librarians on staff.
And Tappan Zee Constructors, the consortium that built the new bridge, is suing the Thruway Authority for, among other things, not complying with its FOIL requests. The consortium is seeking budgets and correspondence about the project's cost and schedule as part of its lawsuit to recoup more than $900 million it says it's owed for the job.
The Thruway Authority has called the move a negotiating tactic.
"As the court has repeatedly affirmed, FOIL is a cornerstone of the right of the people (and the press who operate in their name) to hold government accountable by making its operations transparent," The Journal News' lawyers write. "If FOIL has no teeth, that cornerstone crumbles. And if the Authority is right – if its behavior in this case is perfectly acceptable – then FOIL truly is a dead letter."
Several media organizations are rallying behind The Journal News' battle with the New York State Thruway Authority.

Ready to meet the parents? Tips to follow before, during a family gathering

Texto completo: Spending time with your significant other's family can be stressful, especially if you're meeting them for the very first time.
While each romantic relationship moves at its own pace, Wyatt Fisher, a clinical psychologist in Boulder, Colorado, recommends waiting about three months from when you first started dating to introduce your partner to family members. "Just to make sure the relationship has a good footing, and you're feeling like this has some potential," Fisher said.
To keep that solid standing while attending familial festivities - and maybe get invited back next year - here are some suggestions from relationship and etiquette experts.
Send or bring a gift
The general rule of thumb is never arrive empty-handed, said Myka Meier, a founder of the Plaza Hotel Finishing Program in New York, which provides etiquette courses. "It's not only to show a gesture of that first meeting, but it's also showing gratitude for the invitation."
You can send a flower arrangement (not a bouquet) ahead of time. Or, if you prefer having a gift in hand, baked goods, holiday-themed candles or toys for the family pet are appropriate. Meier warns against gifting alcohol - in case they're nondrinkers. "You may not know what their preferences are," she said.
Dress appropriately
During certain get-togethers, some families sport formal wear, while others opt for casual, matching get-ups (even pajamas). It's always a good idea to confirm dress-code expectations with your partner or ask the parents ahead of time.
"Talk ear-to-ear with the hosts," said Jodi R.R. Smith, the founder of Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting in Boston. "Say, 'I want to pack appropriately. ... Do you dress up? Do you dress down?' " Parents are usually happy to discuss wardrobe coordination in advance, she said, so guests can plan accordingly.
Address them appropriately
Keep things formal for starters, unless otherwise noted. "I would always recommend having a title in front of their names to show respect," Meier said. The parents, of course, may insist that you call them by their first names, or even a nickname. "Let them ask you to call them something else," she said.
Remain focused
While speaking with family members, it's important to make eye contact, establish a firm handshake and put away your phone, if you are able.
"Be truly present when someone is talking, and allow yourself a moment to respond genuinely," said Anna Nicholaides, a clinical psychologist and owner of Philadelphia Couples Therapy. Nicholaides notes these practices display mindfulness while growing relationship intimacy. "Frankly, it makes people like you more when you're a good listener."
Stay upbeat
You'll want to avoid discussing politics, religion and controversial subjects. Instead, talk about where you're from, shared interests, hobbies and sports, and ask them questions, too. Also, avoid being critical. "No complaining about how hard your job is, or your bout with the flu," Meier said.
Show, don't touch
In the family home, cultural differences can affect how you interact with your partner, and this includes public displays of affection.
Meier suggests following the lead of your significant other. "If your partner is reaching for your hand and trying to hug or kiss you in front of family, that's what they're comfortable with," she said.
If being physically affectionate is a no-no in that family, there are other ways to demonstrate your affection. "You can display kindness to your partner by laughing at their jokes," Nicholaides said.
Lend a hand
You can be a team player by kindly offering to assist with chores such as setting the table or clearing it after a meal. "It could come off as lazy if you're sitting there watching a host and hostess run around, and looking expectant to be served," Meier said. "If they say no, then they don't want you to, and that's OK."
Don't get tipsy
Try to limit your alcohol consumption to one or two glasses of wine to keep your composure. "Don't use alcohol as a social crutch," Smith said, adding, "You don't want to give them any reason to not like you."
Besides, you can always enjoy your favorite cocktail when you're back at home or meet up with friends later at a bar.

Texto completo: Re: "$150M project aims to bring gym, restaurants, services to Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center," Jan. 12:
The article about the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center was inaccurate in referring to the financier and philanthropist Michael Milken as an investor in TRIC. He owns no such investment and has never had anything to do with the center's operations.
The confusion arises from a totally false report in the New York Times last October. The entire Times article is contradicted both by the proven facts and by a timeline of actual events showing that Milken had no involvement in any decisions about Nevada opportunity zones.
Gazette Journal readers who want to know the complete truth about this matter can find a fact sheet on the home page of www.mikemilken.com.
(The writer is an adviser to Michael Milken.)

Start writing tickets to reduce traffic accidents Growing vehicle pedestrian and bicycle accidents is the result of our communities' choices. The most obvious is failing to enforce traffic laws. Drivers who speed, fail to stop at stop signs, turning right on red lights, and running red lights is commonplace. It also involves pedestrians who cross anywhere and fail to look before crossing. And finally, a pet peeve of mine, are the bicyclists who ignore all traffic laws. Without effective enforcement, laws are meaningless, and people openly ignore the laws.
Increasingly in our communities, being ticketed for a moving violation is as likely as winning the lottery. As a result, most people — and I mean most — pay little attention to the laws. Speeding, failing to stop, and cellphone use is almost universal. There's no debate here. Everyone knows this.
I realize that as a tourist destination we don't want to be viewed as an unfriendly community, but recognize the cost in lives. It's a choice.

Rural doctors already overwhelmed All the Democratic candidates are calling for some form of Medicare for All. But seems like none are asking doctors for their opinion, just naturally assuming medical people will be cheering for the humanitarian benefits.
In the rural counties, doctors already are overwhelmed with work and won't accept medicare patients. When I retired I was politely informed that my favorite doctor would have to assign me a new one at the regional hospital. Medicare payments were too low for my doctor to makes ends meet. And now the Medicare for All politicians want to include illegal immigrants to the rolls.
Where are the doctors who will accept all these new patients at minimum-wage payments?

Trump shouldn't expect help to stabilize Middle East I see Donald Trump (I still refuse to call him president) is asking our allies to help him bring peace to the Middle East. Would these be the same allies he's been kicking in the teeth for the last three years? Maybe the chickens are coming home to roost.

She's running Hillary Clinton will run in 2020. Why, you ask?
She won the popular vote 2016. She never quit explaining the reasons for her loss.
The Russians are less likely to impact results. The Clinton machine is still in place. She polls ahead of the other Democratic candidates.
Being virtually assured of winning in 2016, there are likely unfulfilled commitments to big players who funded the Clinton Foundation.
Entering late, she can pace herself, leaving energy to campaign in the routinely blue states that cost her the election. (Bill warned her of this oversight.)
A sexual predator was appointed to the Supreme Court. An incumbent's record is easily attacked.
Trump's impeachment. The mainstream media does not report the administration's accomplishments. Still no release of Trump's tax returns.
And lastly: She reports receiving external pressures to run again.
Her rightful place in history.
There is nothing like a woman scorned.
How can she not?

Authentic hummus is a do-it-all taste treat

Texto completo: Michael and I recently returned from a trip to New York City to see family and friends. It was a nice getaway from Iowa where political candidates dominate the airwaves and the upcoming caucuses are forever sparking angry debates on Facebook.
During our six days in Gotham, we attended all kinds of cultural events ranging from the New York Philharmonic to various art museums that included the Neue Gallery of German and Austrian Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the latter we saw knights in shining armor and masterpieces by Jacque Louis David and Michelangelo.
My favorite piece? A 16th century painting by Italian artist Lorenzo Lotto titled "Venus and Cupid." In it, Venus lies naked on a bed of blue satin while her son, the aforementioned Cupid, pees joyfully. According to the information card, the artist probably included that last detail to connote fertility. Me? I just thought it was funny.
That's right. Even when I am surrounded by some of the greatest works of art in the world my brain and tastes revert to junior high.
Fortunately, there were others with me during this trip who lifted my tastes out of the schoolyard from time to time. These kind and patient souls forced me to experience some of the finer things the city has to offer. Not surprisingly, most of those were concerned with food.
I swear that if I lived in NYC I would weigh 500 pounds. From the cakes and cookies of the Magnolia Bakery to the crusty baguettes of Masion Kayser, I could happily eat my way across the city. Still, the culinary highlight of the trip was a visit to a small restaurant in Greenwich Village called "Balaboosta." The name is Yiddish for "perfect housewife and mother." It also could mean "the best food I have eaten in a long time" because that's exactly what it was.
The menu at Balaboosta is Middle Eastern, and the dishes aren't fancy. I had the brick chicken with crème brulee for dessert. The highlight of the evening, however, was the hummus and pita platter. I've been eating hummus for decades. I first "discovered" it in graduate school where it was a standard at pretty much every party I ever attended. No wonder. It's inexpensive and delicious. Moreover, it pairs with everything from fresh vegetables to crunchy bread.
Yet as familiar as I was with hummus, I was not prepared for the deliciousness that was set before me. It was earthy and garlicky and so wonderful that I would have gladly eaten it with nothing but my fingers.
Luckily, I didn't have to. The hummus plate came with four perfect little squares of pita bread that we used to convey the dip to our taste buds. I would have gladly skipped my entrée and simply kept ordering the pita and hummus all night.
To give you a taste of that experience I've included recipes for hummus and pita below. Neither is hard to make, although pita can be a bit time consuming.
Hopefully, this will convince you that my taste in food is classier than my taste in art.
Hummus I found this recipe at the website Feel Good Foodie. It advertises itself as "Authentic Lebanese Hummus." I am not sure what that means because the ingredients are pretty much the same as most hummus recipes I have seen.
Maybe the difference is in the preparation. This recipe – and other "authentic" recipes I found – calls for soaking the garbanzo beans in water with a little baking soda and then "peeling" off the skin. I am embarrassed to admit that I didn't even know that garbanzo beans had skin. The point is to make your hummus creamier. If, however, you don't care about creaminess don't worry about peeling. You can just dump everything into the food processor and go to town.
Note: Tahini – ground sesame seeds - is in most supermarkets, but it can be hard to find. I found mine in the "health market" section near the peanut butter. Just ask a clerk, and they should be able to help you
Ingredients
1 can (15 or 16 oz.) garbanzo beans (also known as chick peas)
Water (enough to cover the bean as they soak)
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons tahini
2 garlic cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 small ice cubes
Olive oil (for serving)
Paprika (for serving)
Drain the garbanzo beans. Put them in a bowl and cover with water. Stir in the baking soda. Let sit for 15 minutes. Drain and rinse the beans. Carefully peel off the skin and discard (you can skip soaking and peeling the beans if you like; it did, however, make for a better texture in my finished hummus).
Pour the beans into the food processor. Blend until they become "powder like," scraping the sides of the bowl as needed.
With the processor running, add the lemon juice, tahini, garlic, salt and ice cubes. Blend for about 5 minutes until smooth.
To serve, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with paprika.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
Homemade Pita Bread I first experienced pita bread in college. There, of course, we didn't call it pita. Instead, it was "pocket bread," so named because of the pockets created in the little round slabs.
Today, pita is far more common. It's easy to find in any grocery store. Still, making it at home is easy. This recipe from the New York Times is a bit time consuming, however, as it requires you to bake each pita individually. If you have a big pan you might be able to do two at a time, though.
Ingredients
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (about 100 degrees)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
To prepare the sponge:
In a large bowl stir the yeast into the warm water. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved. Allow the sponge to sit uncovered on your countertop until it begins to bubble (about 15 minutes).
To prepare your pita:
Add the salt, olive oil and 2 cups of the all-purpose flour to your sponge. Stir until mixture forms a shaggy mass. Dust with a little of the remaining 1/2 cup flour (just a little), and knead in the bowl for about 1 minute.
Sprinkle a bit more of the reserved flour onto your countertop. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes until smooth. Cover and allow dough to rest for 10 minutes. Knead for another 2 minutes (the dough should be soft and a little moist).
Put the dough into a clean bowl (the instructions do not say to grease the bowl). Cover with plastic wrap, and allow dough to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk (about 1 hour).
Preheat oven to 475 degrees On the bottom shelf of the oven place a heavy-duty baking sheet or a large cast iron pan. Punch down the dough and divide it into 8 pieces Form each piece into a little ball. Place dough balls on your work surface and cover with a damp towel. Let them sit for 10 minutes.
Remove from ball and roll it into a 6-inch diameter circle that is roughly 1/8-inch thick. Working quickly place the dough circle on your hot pan and bake for about 2 minutes. The dough should puff up in the oven. Turn over with tongs and bake for another minute and a half. Transfer to a plate and proceed with the remaining dough balls.
Makes 8 pita.

Texto completo: Q: What happened to "Better Call Saul"?
A: It took a break. It may have felt like a long one, but many shows take longer hiatuses (and make fewer episodes) than in TV's olden days. "Better Call Saul" will begin a 10-episode fifth season Feb. 23 on AMC.
According to the network: "Jimmy McGill's decision to practice law as 'Saul Goodman' creates unexpected and profound waves of change for those in his orbit."
AMC also will set the stage with a big showcase of "Breaking Bad," the series that led to "Better Call Saul." A five-week "Breaking Bad" marathon will present all the episodes of that series on each Sunday from Jan. 19 to Feb. 16. Also on Feb. 16, AMC will air "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie," which picks up after the end of "Breaking Bad" and debuted on Netflix.

Q: For years I've recorded CNBC's "Nightly Business Report" on PBS to watch the next morning as I'm getting ready for work. Co-host Bill Griffeth made an announcement on the Dec. 27 episode that the program was ending and that it was its last broadcast. Why? It was fair, succinct, politically neutral and remarkably helpful in understanding how current happenings affect the markets. I will definitely miss it.
A: The increased availability of business programming was a major reason for the end of the series after more than 40 years on the air. When it began, news service Current reported, "It was the only television show to offer a full evaluation of daily events on Wall Street." But since then, entire cable channels and online services devoted to business have come along, including CNBC, which bought the show in 2013 and has produced it for public television since then. But cuts in staff and funding had begun even before then, and more changes followed under CNBC, eventually leading to this biggest change of all.

Q: What happened to the handsome Frenchman who was on "Dancing with the Stars"? He almost won the mirror ball but lost to a little blonde gal who had been in the Olympics.
A: You are remembering Gilles Marini, a model and actor who famously showed all his stuff in the first "Sex and the City" movie. He was on "Dancing with the Stars" twice, finishing second to gymnast Shawn Johnson in the eighth season in 2009 and sixth in the 2012 "all-stars" season. He has acted often on television, including extensive stints on "Brothers & Sisters," "2 Broke Girls," "Devious Maids," "The Bold and the Beautiful" and, not too long ago, "Days of Our Lives."

Q: I just finished watching all seven seasons of "The West Wing" on Netflix. It ended with Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen) ending his time as president and Matt Santos taking over. Was anything ever done to continue the series or start a spinoff? I really wanted to see what was going to happen next.
A: The drama about the folks working in the White House certainly left the door open for a continuation with a new administration with its 2006 series finale, but sagging ratings prompted NBC to end things then. Now the show seems loved even more now than when it ended in 2006 - "an idealistic alternative reality" to current politics, as the New York Times put it late last year. If you Google "West Wing sequel" you will find nearly annual reports of this or that possible new "West Wing." But so far none appears to have gotten past chatter.

Q: I really enjoyed the Navy SEALs series "Six." Is it coming back this year?
A: No. The show ended in 2018 after two seasons on History. Deadline.com reported the reason was a huge drop in the ratings from the first to the second season.

Trump isn't getting a political bump from killing Iran's Soleimani, and it's his own fault

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has sought political profit from targeted killing. His reelection campaign has run hundreds of social media ads praising the attack on Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani. In October, after he announced the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the campaign quickly produced a video that bragged about “obliterating ISIS. ”
Although his blood-dimmed appeals have generated campaign money, they have had a weak impact on the general public. His approval rating remains anemic.
Why has he failed to get the “rally effect” that boosted previous presidents after foreign crises? For all his complaints about Democrats and the news media, the blame is in Trump's own hands. Years of tweets and public statements have completely undercut his message.
President Barack Obama saw his approval rating jump six points after a successful raid against 9/11 architect Osama bin Laden. The effect did not last long, however, in part because critics such as Trump urged Americans to deny credit to their president.
In December 2011, Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer: “I keep hearing about, oh, bin Laden, the military did an incredible job and they called and they said, we have him. And he said, go get him. What’s he going to say, don’t get him? And he gets all this credit? It’s a lot of crap. ”
In October 2012, Trump was still at it: “Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. ”
Trump's foreign relations ignorance
And bin Laden was a far more familiar figure than Trump’s recent targets. Before last autumn, few Americans knew who Soleimani and al-Baghdadi were, and Trump showed little interest in rallying the public against them.
In a 2015 interview with Hugh Hewitt, Trump acknowledged his own ignorance. Hewitt mentioned their names, asking: “Do you know the players without a scorecard, yet, Donald Trump?’ He responded: “No, you know, I’ll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they’ll all be changed. They’ll be all gone. ”
Hewitt’s questioning annoyed Trump, who then tweeted: “Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman, Abu Bake al-Baghdad, Hassan Nasrallah and more — typical 'gotcha' questions. ”
The following year, Bret Baier of Fox News asked: “So if we took out al-Baghdadi, would you say that decapitation would kill ISIS or another leader would just pop up?” This time, Trump did not object to the question but belittled the value of killing evil leaders. “No. No,” he said “another leader would pop up. I think it's been proven. ”
No straight story: The truth is never enough for Trump, even when he kills a US enemy like Iran's Soleimani
Trump seldom if ever mentioned al-Baghdadi or Soleimani on the campaign trail, and the pattern continued into his presidency.
In a 2017 tweet, he falsely claimed that The New York Times had published information that foiled al-Baghdadi’s capture. Trump briefly uttered al-Baghdadi’s name during his 2018 State of the Union address, but as a way to fault previous administrations. “In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi,” he said.
The claim was misleading. After al-Baghdadi was in American custody in 2004, the United States handed him over to Iraqi authorities.
Lies about Obama return to haunt
That was about it. Between January 2017 and October 2019, Trump talked and tweeted far more about Hillary Clinton than about the men whose deaths he would order. When he did discuss the killings, he stepped on his own story.
With al-Baghdadi, he staged a meandering news conference full of tangents and dubious claims, such as his insistence that al-Baghdadi wept before he died. With Soleimani, he bungled any chance for national unity by making a harsh, inaccurate and unnecessary attack on Obama’s Iran policy.
A risky choice: Trump crisis mismanagement on full display with roll of dice on Iran, Iraq and Suleimani
In a USA TODAY/Ipsos poll, a plurality of respondents said Trump ordered the killing of Soleimani to distract attention from his impeachment. Why would they believe such a ghastly thing? For one thing, Trump had encouraged them to think that way.
In 2011, he tweeted: “In order to get elected, @BarackObama will start a war with Iran. ” In a YouTube video, he said: "Our president will start a war with Iran because he has absolutely no ability to negotiate. … So I believe that he will attack Iran sometime prior to the election, because he thinks that's the only way he can get elected. ”
Trump has told thousands of lies and openly disparaged the intelligence community. It is no surprise that so many people now doubt him when he says that the targeted killing thwarted an imminent threat. It’s as if he spent the past decade making sure that Americans would distrust him at this very moment.
Here is the worst part: Future presidents will need the public to believe them in times of peril, and Trump’s record will make their job much harder.

Texto completo: Popular dating services like Grindr, OkCupid and Tinder are spreading user information like dating choices and precise location to advertising and marketing companies in ways that may violate privacy laws, according to a new report that examined some of the world's most downloaded Android apps.
Grindr, the world's most popular gay dating app, transmitted user-tracking codes and the app's name to more than a dozen companies, essentially tagging individuals with their sexual orientation, according to the report, which was released Tuesday by the Norwegian Consumer Council, a government-funded nonprofit organization in Oslo.
Grindr also sent a user's location to multiple companies, which may then share that data with many other businesses, the report said. When The New York Times tested Grindr's Android app, it shared precise latitude and longitude information with five companies.
The researchers also reported that the OkCupid app sent a user's ethnicity and answers to personal profile questions - like "Have you used psychedelic drugs?" - to a firm that helps companies tailor marketing messages to users. The Times found that the OkCupid site had recently posted a list of more than 300 advertising and analytics "partners" with which it may share users' information.
"Any consumer with an average number of apps on their phone - anywhere between 40 and 80 apps - will have their data shared with hundreds or perhaps thousands of actors online," said Finn Myrstad, the digital policy director for the Norwegian Consumer Council, who oversaw the report.
The report, "Out of Control: How Consumers Are Exploited by the Online Advertising Industry," adds to a growing body of research exposing a vast ecosystem of companies that freely track hundreds of millions of people and peddle their personal information. This surveillance system enables scores of businesses, whose names are unknown to many consumers, to quietly profile individuals, target them with ads and try to sway their behavior.
The report appears two weeks after California enacted a broad new consumer privacy law. Among other things, the law requires many companies that trade consumers' personal details for money or other compensation to allow people to easily stop the spread of their information.
In addition, regulators in the European Union are stepping up enforcement of their own data protection law, which prohibits companies from collecting personal information without a person's explicit consent.
The Norwegian group said it planned to file complaints Tuesday asking regulators in Oslo to investigate Grindr and five ad tech companies for possible violations of the European data protection law. A coalition of consumer groups in the U.S. said it was also sending letters to American regulators, urging them to investigate whether the companies' practices violated federal and state laws.

Failing our migratory birds Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel expansion destroyed a vital habitat

Texto completo: The Virginia Department of Transportation displaced an estimated 25,000 migratory birds from their nesting place of 40 years without plans to provide an alternative for them - an egregious and avoidable misstep by the state agency.
Certain accommodations must be made for vital transportation projects such as this, of course. But what price must be paid in the name of progress? And what's a few dollars more if it protects the natural environment so central to this region's identity?
The VDOT paved over an island used for more than 40 years by a number of birds, including some endangered species, as part of the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel expansion project. The expanded crossing is vital to improving transportation in the region, which is routinely the worst part of living in this part of Virginia.
Experts are not sure what will happen when the birds return. But the fact that there was no plan to replace the habitat - that this was willfully and deliberately done - is a stain on the agency and on the commonwealth.
Naturally, it was aided and abetted by the Trump administration's weakening of environmental laws meant to defend threatened species from extinction.
Since its earliest days, the Trump administration has been doing whatever it can to end or not enforce the protections for wildlife that the United States has put into place - with considerable success - since our collective national awareness was raised in the 20th century.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act was one of the earliest and most successful of those conservation achievements. It was put into place in 1918 as part of an agreement between the United States and Canada to curb the extinctions of bird species caused by habitat destruction and unregulated hunting.
For a century, through Republican and Democratic administrations, the act protected waterfowl and other birds. It set up sensible hunting regulations and protections for habitats and nesting birds and expanded to keep corporations and others from inadvertently killing birds when they use pesticides, build power lines, erect windmills, drill for oil or otherwise disturb the environment.
Corporations knew that if they were careless, they would face prosecution and hefty fines. They figured out ways to do their business without needlessly destroying birds.
But the Department of the Interior under President Donald Trump gutted the law in 2017, a year shy of the act's centennial. The department circulated an opinion to federal wildlife police saying that the act applies only if the primary purpose of an activity is to kill birds.
It offered an example of a farmer tearing down a barn even though he knows it houses young owls. If the farmer's main aim was to tear down the barn, the opinion said, it wouldn't matter if he killed owls. No prosecution, no penalty.
In December, the New York Times cited the HRBT expansion to illustrate the practical effect of the law's "clarification" by the administration. As engineers working for Virginia prepared plans for the mile-long, two-lane expansion of the tunnel under Thimble Shoal Channel, they discussed developing an artificial island to replace the nesting grounds of 25,000 seabirds that would be destroyed by the project.
But in the summer of 2018, the Trump administration said thanks, but don't bother.
Plans for the island were dropped. State officials told the Times the federal opinion had no direct impact, and that they hope to find another solution for the seabirds. But conservationists working with the state disagreed on the cause and effect.
The lost habitat, if not replaced, may mean disaster for some bird species, because rising sea levels and erosion have destroyed other nesting sites in the bay.
There are similar examples around the country. Some states and businesses are still protecting birds voluntarily, but without the threat of prosecution, the future looks grim.
The HRBT expansion is a necessity for this region, but surely the commonwealth can find a way to balance environmental protection with infrastructure construction. The absence of penalty from Washington should be a license to do irreversible harm.

Texto completo: Popular dating services like Grindr, OkCupid and Tinder are spreading user information like dating choices and precise location to advertising and marketing companies in ways that may violate privacy laws, according to a new report that examined some of the world's most downloaded Android apps.
Grindr, the world's most popular gay dating app, transmitted user-tracking codes and the app's name to more than a dozen companies, essentially tagging individuals with their sexual orientation, according to the report, which was released Tuesday by the Norwegian Consumer Council, a government-funded nonprofit organization in Oslo.
Grindr also sent a user's location to multiple companies, which may then share that data with many other businesses, the report said. When The New York Times tested Grindr's Android app, it shared precise latitude and longitude information with five companies.
The researchers also reported that the OkCupid app sent a user's ethnicity and answers to personal profile questions - like "Have you used psychedelic drugs?" - to a firm that helps companies tailor marketing messages to users. The Times found that the OkCupid site had recently posted a list of more than 300 advertising and analytics "partners" with which it may share users' information.
"Any consumer with an average number of apps on their phone - anywhere between 40 and 80 apps - will have their data shared with hundreds or perhaps thousands of actors online," said Finn Myrstad, the digital policy director for the Norwegian Consumer Council, who oversaw the report.
The report, "Out of Control: How Consumers Are Exploited by the Online Advertising Industry," adds to a growing body of research exposing a vast ecosystem of companies that freely track hundreds of millions of people and peddle their personal information. This surveillance system enables scores of businesses, whose names are unknown to many consumers, to quietly profile individuals, target them with ads and try to sway their behavior.
The report appears two weeks after California enacted a broad new consumer privacy law. Among other things, the law requires many companies that trade consumers' personal details for money or other compensation to allow people to easily stop the spread of their information.
In addition, regulators in the European Union are stepping up enforcement of their own data protection law, which prohibits companies from collecting personal information without a person's explicit consent.
The Norwegian group said it planned to file complaints Tuesday asking regulators in Oslo to investigate Grindr and five ad tech companies for possible violations of the European data protection law. A coalition of consumer groups in the U.S. said it was also sending letters to American regulators, urging them to investigate whether the companies' practices violated federal and state laws.

$150 million commercial center breaks ground

Texto completo: If you build a huge commercial center in the largest industrial park in the United States, will the services come?
A group of investors is betting that the answer is "yes," as The Horse Oasis breaks ground this week for the first of several buildings at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center.
The $150 million project aims to fill a glaring need in the industrial park located just east of Reno-Sparks, said Batuhan Zadeh, head of land acquisition for real estate company Marmot Properties. Thanks to the arrival of companies such as Walmart, Tesla, Panasonic and Switch, the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center is now home to thousands of workers. The number of businesses that cater to those workers within the park, however, is extremely lacking, Zadeh said.
"The goal is to bring new services to USA Parkway," Zadeh said. "Right now, there are very few options compared to the number of people out there."
Restaurant options, for example, are limited to just a few dining spots such as Burger King, Philly's NV and Shanghai Express.
There's also a drought of other services that cater to the park's workforce, including retail stores and health clinics.
It's a sweet spot that The Horse Oasis hopes to take advantage of, especially given how only 12% of the land at the park is zoned for commercial use.
The Horse Oasis can have "an urgent care (facility), a charter school, a gym, doctor's office — anything that's not residential or industrial," Zadeh said. "The project is really bringing in the feasibility of providing space for companies."
Another chance for opportunity zone investors Construction of the full Horse Oasis project on 500 Italy Drive is expected to take several years, with KRI Architecture's Dave Madsen overseeing its design.
The first three buildings are slated for completion this year, followed by three more by the end of 2021.
Once the project is completed, there will be 16 buildings on the 871,200-square-foot site.
There is no timeline for when all of the buildings will be completed. Zadeh pointed to the challenging construction market as a key factor, with strong competition causing a shortage of available workers.
"I wish we could do all the buildings at the same time but the labor is not here," Zadeh said. "It takes about six to seven months per building (to finish)."
The Horse Oasis is also the latest opportunity zone project to hit the area with backing from outside investors. Opportunity zones fueled a flurry of activity before the end of the year as developers tried to meet an end-of-year deadline to qualify for higher tax breaks. The opportunity zone program rewards developers with significant tax incentives for building in economically depressed areas.
Downtown Reno alone has seen a slew of proposed projects tied to opportunity zones:
Las Vegas-based CAI Investments recently spoke to the Reno Gazette Journal about its planned 20-story boutique hotel on Court Street.
P3 Partners pitched a proposal to redevelop the former CitiCenter bus station site and also remodel the National Bowling Stadium and Reno Events Center.
San Francisco-based SVE Development has plans for a large multi-tower project called T3 North as well as a remodel of the old Woolworth's building called 101 North Virginia.
Opportunity zone projects, however, have also come with their share of controversy. These include the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, where The Horse Oasis is being built. The industrial park made national news after critics questioned whether Storey County received special treatment after the location was chosen as an opportunity zone.
The site was also tied to allegations involving former 1980s "junk bond king" Michael Milken, following a New York Times article that reported that he was invested in property at the industrial park. In a five-page statement sent to the RGJ in October, Milken denied any involvement in getting the site an opportunity zone designation. A representative of Milken also sent another statement on Tuesday that Milken "owns no such investment" in TRIC.
'We're not concerned about a downturn whatsoever' Funding for The Horse Oasis is coming from overseas via investment partners in Saudi Arabia.
Although the opportunity zone incentives were attractive, Zadeh insisted that they were not the driving force for the investment.
The Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center was already appealing to investors due to the presence of facilities such as Tesla' Gigafactory and Switch's Citadel Campus. Then Google came in as well. Given the names entering the park, the investors decided to buy 20 acres right away, according to Zadeh.
"It was about USA Parkway," Zadeh said. "The rest is just gravy."
Also, while funding is coming from overseas, the driving force behind the project involves local people. One of the brains behind The Horse Oasis is Fady Mehanna, who owns 1up, Brauhaus 701 and the Whisky Lounge.
With ongoing murmurs about a potential recession after the U.S. economy posted a record 10 straight years of growth in 2019, Zadeh responded that people behind the project are "not concerned about a downturn whatsoever."
"We're very methodical in the projects that we take," Zadeh said.
This includes The Horse Oasis, which is definitely a long-term play.
At the moment, there is a large untapped market in USA Parkway, with some projecting the number of workers in the area to grow to 30,000 in the next few years, Zadeh said.
In most communities, the target market for businesses like a gym, for example, is about 30% of the total population. At a place like the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, however, the share increases exponentially due to the large number of working individuals, according to Zadeh.
Zadeh is banking on interest in that large worker population to drive businesses to set shop in The Horse Oasis.
"You're directly targeting people with similar actions from the start of the day to the end of the day ... so you know who you're dealing with," Zadeh said. "Every single person is a target market."

Amazon Courts Big-Name Authors

Texto completo: When Dean Koontz's book contract expired last year, his stature as one of the country's top-selling authors made him a hot target for several major publishing houses. He chose Amazon.com Inc.
It was a surprising move because it means his new books likely won't appear in retail stores, which generally boycott Amazon-published titles. But Mr. Koontz is banking on Amazon's vast retail machine to get his work to readers, whether in physical or digital formats.
"Maybe I won't be in some stores or make the New York Times best-seller list, but I'm willing to take that risk and I think we'll sell more books in all formats," Mr. Koontz said.
Amazon dominates the U.S. book-retail market -- accounting for over half of all new books sold in October, according to research firm Codex Group -- but it is also a force as a book publisher. Signing up blue-chip authors like Mr. Koontz could make the company an even more formidable threat to the traditional industry, led by publishing houses such as Penguin Random House, which is controlled by Germany's Bertelsmann SE, ViacomCBS Inc.'s Simon & Schuster and HarperCollins Publishers, which is owned by Wall Street Journal parent News Corp.
Mr. Koontz's first novel for Amazon is expected to publish March 31. He already has published a collection of short stories, "Nameless," that generated over a million downloads in the first month after its debut last November. The stories are available only as e-books and audiobooks.
Mr. Koontz, whose over 100 books include hits like "Odd Thomas" and "Watchers," isn't the only high-profile writer Amazon Publishing has snared. In 2018, Patricia Cornwell signed a two-book deal; the first novel, "Quantum," was published last October and enjoyed brisk downloads despite poor reviews. Both Mr. Koontz and Ms. Cornwell are in the top 25 of all currently published U.S. adult fiction writers, as measured by the size of their most dedicated fan bases, according to consumer surveys by Codex.
Amazon Publishing already has 16 imprints in the U.S. churning out titles from thrillers to romance novels.
The fact Amazon is both a book publisher and the dominant book retailer is unlikely, on its own, to raise antitrust issues, said legal and media experts. Current antitrust laws are meant to increase consumer welfare, so Amazon's low prices act as a shield.
"When prices are low for the customer, that improves consumer welfare even if it puts out of business people who are charging more," said Gregory Arenson, an antitrust lawyer and partner at Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.
Mr. Arenson said Amazon might be in violation of antitrust laws, however, if it is using its platform to provide an advantage to books it publishes that it doesn't provide to other book publishers.
"Amazon offers all publishers a variety of marketing programs, including adding titles to subscription programs like Kindle Unlimited, Amazon First Reads and Prime Reading," a spokeswoman for Amazon said.
Amazon can promise writers a big paycheck, agents say, and a powerful e-commerce platform and marketing tools to promote sales of their work.
"Quantum" sold only 6,000 hardcover copies through Nov. 23, according to NPD BookScan, a unit of NPD Group Inc. A spokeswoman for Amazon Publishing said the book has "reached approximately 600,000 readers across print, audio and digital sales and downloads."
"They are playing a long game with a lot of authors, and yes, it worries me," said a senior executive at one of the largest publishing companies.
Amazon isn't "aggressively hunting big-name authors," said Jeff Belle, vice president of Amazon Publishing. But it cultivates relationships with writers, he said, and is willing to "write checks for great content."
The downside for high-profile authors of tying up with Amazon is that Barnes & Noble Inc. and independent booksellers shun Amazon's books. It is possible Barnes & Noble could change its approach under the new management team that took over after hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. acquired the retailer last summer.
"I am surprised that there is an overt policy at Barnes & Noble to boycott and generally would not personally be in favor of this," James Daunt, the bookseller's chief executive, said last month.
For Mr. Koontz -- who has sold more than 500 million books world-wide -- the opportunity to reach new readers through Amazon's extensive promotions was too good to ignore, he said.
"We had seven or eight offers, but Amazon offered the most complete marketing plan, and that was the deciding factor," said Mr. Koontz, 74 years old.
The pact Mr. Koontz signed last spring with Amazon Publishing's Thomas & Mercer imprint ended his long relationship with Bantam Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House, the world's largest consumer book publisher. A spokeswoman for Bantam Books, which has published more than 50 of his works, declined to comment.
The six "Nameless" short stories, which feature a vigilante who suffers from amnesia, sell for $1.99 each. Subscribers to the Amazon Kindle Unlimited service can access them as part of their membership, as can Amazon Prime users.
Mr. Koontz said another reason he signed with Amazon Publishing is because he enjoyed close ties with audiobook publisher Brilliance Audio even before it was acquired by Amazon in 2007.
Mr. Koontz's success with Brilliance Audio caught the eye of Julia Sommerfeld, editorial director of the Amazon imprint Amazon Original Stories, who suggested working together. The novella that followed, "Ricochet Joe," was published in December 2017 exclusively as an Amazon e-book and audiobook.
"There was no paperback, no hardcover, but hundreds of thousands of people read it with their e-readers, and he was well compensated," said Richard Pine, his literary agent.
The ability to reach new potential readers was also an attraction for Ms. Cornwell, best known for her novels featuring fictional medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta.
Ms. Cornwell signed a two-book contract with Amazon's Thomas & Mercer imprint in 2018. Her most recent Kay Scarpetta novels had been published by HarperCollins Publishers, which declined to comment.
"She's not scared of shaking it up," said Ms. Cornwell's agent, Jeremy Barber, a partner at United Talent Agency LLC.
Ms. Cornwell's "Quantum," the first in a new series, disappointed many readers, with 35% of the reviewers on Amazon.com giving it one star.
The author said she is undeterred. "I'm building a new audience, and yes, I'm getting kicked around in reviews, but I know what I'm doing," she said.

Louis C.K. sets Boston tour date as part of attempt to revive his career

Texto completo: Louis C.K. is attempting to resurrect his once-thriving stand-up career with a series of shows in the coming months, including a just-announced gig in Boston on April 4. The show's location has not been released and tickets are not yet on sale.
The announcement comes a little more than two years after multiple women accused Louis C.K. of sexual misconduct and harassment. On Nov. 9, 2017 The New York Times published an article detailing accounts of several women who accused the comedian of misconduct, including accounts of Louis C.K. masturbating in front of them without their consent.
Louis C.K. lost a deal with FX network, his agent, and management, and the rights to his movie, “I Love You, Daddy," which he directed and starred in, were sold back to him by the production company, and the movie's release was canceled.
After the accusations hit the media, Louis C.K. issued a statement of apology, also published in The New York Times, where he wrote, “These stories are true." He ended the letter by saying, “I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen."
However, less than a year after making that statement, Louis C.K. returned to stand-up with surprise performances at comedy clubs, his first in August 2018 at New York's Comedy Cellar.
“His jokes started out like, 'my life is hard now, I had a bad year, feel bad for me,' " audience member Klaire Randall told The Cut about seeing Louis C.K. at a gig a few months later. “There was nothing like, 'hey I ruined my own life by masturbating in front of women.' "
Despite pushback from some audience members at pop-up shows, the Comedy Cellar started booking the comedian for scheduled performances. This tour is the first time Louis C.K. has announced a string of performances since the accusations surfaced, and many dates on the tour are already sold out, according to his website.

Texto completo: It may be that this time of year is making me pessimistic - it's gray, chilly and damp, with no holidays to look forward to - but I think that many countries in this world are being badly governed by their leaders.
One example is India, a country of 1.3 billion, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in some ways a reasonable leader, is working with his party to make India, a country whose population is composed of many different religious elements, a Hindu state. This effort on his part means that India, which shares a subcontinent with predominantly Muslim Pakistan, will automatically not have peace as an element in its political and developmental path as long as Mr. Modi and his party remain in power. This fact is definitely not to the advantage of Indians as a population.
Another example of grave misgovernance is China, whose population also numbers above 1.3 billion. I do not fall in the category of those who think that everything the Chinese do is directed against the United States and that, as a rising global rival in a zero-sum international game, China's gain is automatically America's loss.
One "plus" in China's current global policy, in my view, is its Belt and Road initiative, designed primarily to enhance China's situation in international trade and development. The concern on other countries' part is the opportunity it may give China to build up its military potential in the world. That is a legitimate concern, but it should not be forgotten, particularly in Africa, that the U.S. (and the West in general) has had free rein since post-World War II independence, succeeding the era of colonialism, to develop Africa and other areas at will. The main reasons it did not was the difficulty involved and the cost.
China's shortcoming, instead, turns on its mistreatment of minorities, whether they be ethnic and religious, such as the Uighurs in Western China, or the people of Hong Kong, who are not at all enthusiastic about Beijing's approach to democratic urges. Chinese leader Xi Jinping may have some interesting and innovative ideas, but he is also thin-skinned and intolerant of opposition.
By the way, we as Americans dealing with Asian leaders such as Mr. Xi, North Korea's Kim Jong Un and others do not profit from the fact that our leaders are not very good at understanding Asian leaders' political circumstances. Slapping them on the back and even saying we love them may not play well at all with their political bases.
Another group that I believe is being governed badly now is the British. England has been a major world leader since at least the reign of Elizabeth I. It is now poised to jump into a world pool as Little Britain, a country that can only be taken seriously for what it used to be, not for what it is now. Former Prime Minister David Cameron launched the British on the Brexit path to try to save his political career (a career that wasn't worth saving), but his Conservative Party let him do it, and the oafish Boris Johnson is now proceeding with the foolhardy plan.
Finally, we must look at the United States. The picture is not encouraging. First and foremost, America is not adequately addressing the existential question of global warming, though it is unclear if that is due to deliberate ignorance or political cowardice. One would think that the sometimes bizarre or even catastrophic weather events in this country would point to the need for a systematic national approach to climate change.
Instead, the U.S. government spends hundreds of millions on defense - or is it really offense? - trying to somehow rearrange the world more to its advantage.
In the meantime, not only does America's environmental policy continue not to reflect the ever-growing climate disaster, but our nation also refuses to cooperate with other nations in addressing the problem. That is in addition to our government's shocking indifference to the needs of education, health care and infrastructure. How can the United States consider itself to be a wealthy, successful nation while lagging behind other such nations in so many regards?
Americans will get another chance to re-energize the country this November, though it is hard to see which candidate can muster the kind of change we really need.

Texto completo: Before he broke Major League Baseball's race barrier in 1947, Jackie Robinson was summoned by Branch Rickey, a Brooklyn Dodgers team executive. According to Arnold Rampersad's Robinson biography, Rickey told Robinson, “I know you're a good ballplayer. What I don't know is whether you have the guts."
What Rickey wanted was a black man who would remain stoic even as n-words poured from dugouts and bleachers, or when opposing white players slid into him, their sharpened cleats held high. “I'm looking for a ballplayer," he said, “with guts enough not to fight back."
Always, black people are expected to accommodate bigotry. To cure racism, we're supposed to magically rise above it, instead of stripping it bare and calling out its practitioners and enablers. Just as foundational as racism itself is the corrosive belief that the burden of its eradication lays on the weary shoulders of those directly maligned by it.
Asking black people to stop racism is like asking women to stop sexism.
That's been an undercurrent to the recent drama swirling around Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to step back from their royal duties and split their time between England and North America. Even though Queen Elizabeth has endorsed the young couple's plans, a primary question from Markle's critics lingers: Yes, she's treated with racist disdain by the British media, but does she have to make such a big deal out of it?
This was The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd's terrible recent take: “Still, I think Meghan Markle should have wielded her wokeness where it is most needed — in Buckingham Palace," she wrote. “She could have channeled the Obamas, who did a magnificent job of rising above racist taunts and working within the institution to imprint a new image of racial possibility in America."
See, the racism that plagued Markle was her own fault because she refused to stiff-upper-lip her way through it. Also, white America reacted to the Obamas' “new image of racial possibility" — whatever that nonsense means — by electing this nation's most openly racist president.
In his January 2017 essay, “My President Was Black," Ta-Nehisi Coates said of the outgoing chief executive, “For eight years, Barack Obama walked on ice and never fell." Of course, Obama had no choice, even when he was deliberately pushed by racist GOP legislators or a future president. Had he put aside the noted Obama cool for a minute (as many of us wished he would), his presidency would have drowned in accusations that he was stirring racial unrest.
In a racist system, challenging racism is deemed worst than racism — that's why the International Olympic Committee has banned specific protests at the 2020 Summer Olympics, such as kneeling on the medal stand. As if politics haven't long played a prominent role in the Games. Athletes must learn to abide, although some are already resisting.
During his Hall of Fame career, Robinson did not resist Rickey's demand. Sixteen years after he retired, he was dead, at 53. Officially, he died from a heart attack. Unofficially, the enormous weight of the racism he was forced to ignore probably helped kill him.
At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Michelle Obama first spoke the line which has become her trademark: “When they go low, we go high." As first lady, she certainly endured her share of racist ire and handled it publicly with the same pragmatism and poise as her husband.
Whatever is thrown at us, black people are charged with having guts enough not to fight back — to rise above, regardless of the emotional and psychological cost. While the racists sit comfortably, we're chased higher into the thin, frigid air where we either find some temporary escape, like Meghan, or can no longer breathe at all, like Jackie.

Texto completo: Apparently, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: 3D," was not playing.
Cuttlefish were outfitted with special glasses in a tank at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, then shown a 3D movie of tasty shrimp on an underwater screen: They lashed out at their prey as if they had been fooled by the images, indicating that they have depth perception, researchers said.
The University of Minnesota-led team's results were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. Cuttlefish are only the second invertebrate species shown to be able to see in 3D, researchers said.
The research clearly establishes that the diminutive cephalopods use stereopsis, or depth perception, when hunting, said Trevor Wardill, assistant professor at the University of Minnesota's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior.
Wardill, whose lab focuses on how the visual systems of insects and cephalopods process information and generate behavior, said putting the 3D glasses on the cuttlefish with a bit of glue and Velcro wasn't always easy.
“Some individuals will not wear them no matter how much I try," he told The New York Times.
Once the glasses were on the European cuttlefish Sepia officinalis , researchers showed them 3D images that made it appear shrimp were in front of the screen. The cuttlefish backed up so they could deploy their tentacles, which they use to subdue their prey before biting them and injecting them with toxins.
The cuttlefish “moved their body away from the screen and shot tentacles at a perceived location," Wardill said in a telephone interview.
When researchers showed images that made it appear the shrimp was behind the screen, he said, “They would run into the screen trying to get the shrimp behind the screen."
Researchers said that when only one of a cuttlefish's eyes could see the shrimp, it took longer for it to position itself for attack. Having stereo vision could thus make a big difference in catching a meal, they said.
Wardill noted that the MBL was “instrumental in helping us get this to work." He also said researchers had been inspired by similar research showing that praying mantises have stereo vision.
“The evidence presented here," the study said, “establishes that cuttlefish make use of stereopsis when hunting and that this improves hunting performance by reducing the distance traveled, the time taken to strike at prey, and allowing it to strike from farther away. Further investigation is required to uncover the neural mechanisms underlying the computation of stereopsis in these animals."
Wardill said cuttlefish actually do better than humans in dealing with depth perception in an environment where there's a lot of variation in brightness and may have “evolved a more advanced version of stereopsis."
“While cuttlefish have similar eyes to humans, their brains are significantly different," Paloma Gonzalez-Bellido, assistant professor at the University of Minnesota and a coauthor of the study, said in a statement.
“We know that cuttlefish brains aren't segmented like humans. They do not seem to have a single part of the brain — like our occipital lobe — dedicated to processing vision."
However, she said, “Our research shows there must be an area in their brain that compares the images from a cuttlefish's left and right eye and computes their differences."
“This study takes us a step further toward understanding how different nervous systems have evolved to tackle the same problem," Rachael Feord, a graduate student at Oxford University, the research paper's first author, said in the statement.
“The next step is to dissect the brain circuits required for the computation of stereopsis in cuttlefish with the aim of understanding how this might be different to what happens in our brains."

Candidates Critical of Trump on Iran, but Vague on What They'd Do

Texto completo: The candidates were short on specifics at Tuesday's debate when pressed on how they would accomplish their key foreign policy goals.
The six Democratic presidential candidates who debated Tuesday night in Des Moines agreed on one point: President Trump threw away a nuclear deal that was working and is now recklessly speeding toward war with Iran.
But they all turned vague when pressed on how they would accomplish their key goals -- preventing Tehran from obtaining nuclear capability, stopping the revival of the Islamic State and disarming North Korea -- without backing up diplomacy with the threat of military force.
Time and again, they separated themselves from Mr. Trump, especially on his rejection of allies and his unilateral action to pull out of international treaties and agreements. But they ended up describing a series of hopes for a return to negotiations and plans for incremental withdrawals that at moments echoed the Trump administration, circa 2019.
And all the candidates struggled to define the conditions under which they might use military force if there were no imminent threat, rejecting Mr. Trump's "America First" approach to the world but trying to avoid stoking fears that they lacked the spine and strategic sensibilities to succeed as commander in chief.
The hedge words flew off the stage.
Asked whether he would never allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said simply that ensuring the country remains far from obtaining one would "be a priority." (Later, perhaps realizing he sounded less than decisive, Mr. Buttigieg, the only candidate on the stage who had served in the military, took a second shot and said American security "depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear.")
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. conceded in the first minutes of the debate that it was a "mistake" for him to have voted for an authorization to use military force in Iraq 18 years ago, insisting that as soon he realized he had been deceived by George W. Bush's administration he reversed course. After that, he said, he worked tirelessly to reduce the number of troops.
Then came the caveat. While he said he would not keep combat troops in the Middle East, he added that "I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf" and would keep a "small number" to confront the Islamic State. Those are both considerable tasks, in which a willingness to convince adversaries the United States would not leave the scene is often critical to backing up negotiations. And Mr. Biden said nothing about how he would respond if the Islamic State rose again, as it did after the withdrawals during the end of President Barack Obama's administration.
Still, Mr. Biden staked his ground well to the right of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who vowed that "it's time to get our combat troops home" but never answered how the United States would help prevent the revival of the Islamic State without a ground presence.
The exchanges were all the more notable because until Tuesday night, foreign policy had been a side show in the 2020 campaign. But the targeted killing of the Iranian commander Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani this month ended the moment when the six Democratic candidates could avoid addressing some of the most complex and intractable conflicts that they would inherit if elected. Most seemed to be hoping the subject would soon return to more familiar ground, like universal health insurance or universal background checks for gun sales.
It should have been the moment for Mr. Biden to shine: A former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he was among the most experienced in the Obama Situation Room during debates over increasing troop levels in Afghanistan and secretly carrying out cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear facilities.
He had a moment to look decisive, especially in contrast to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who was the most vociferous about extracting the United States from what he called "endless wars." Again, it echoed a phrase that Mr. Trump has often used -- or at least did until his decision to kill General Suleimani all but assured a greater American troop presence in the Middle East for years to come.
Mr. Biden was clearly the one with the best grasp of the global situation, but he seemed unsteady at moments, even when describing events in which he was deeply involved. He argued that he was the one who "led the effort" against "surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan," without noting that Mr. Obama ignored his advice and ordered a surge anyway. On Iraq, he claimed he was the one who engineered the withdrawal of 156,000 troops from Iraq without noting that it was Mr. Bush, just before leaving office, who ordered a troop withdrawal.
But it was on North Korea -- a nation that, unlike Iran, is already believed to have nuclear weapons, with American intelligence agencies putting the number at 30 to 60 -- that the candidates seemed softer. Curiously, none vowed that the North would have to give up its weapons, a statement that just a decade ago was a staple of any foreign policy discussion by leading presidential candidates, even if it seemed like a pipe dream.
Instead, the candidates seemed to silently acknowledge that disarming the North was all but a lost cause. Instead, they focused on negotiating tactics, without ever quite saying what the goal would be. Mr. Biden vowed he wouldn't meet Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, "without any preconditions," but never described what those might be.
What was most striking about the discussion was that the candidates talked about the use of diplomacy and military coercion as if they were alternatives, rather than mutually reinforcing tactics to accomplish a strategic end.
Such concepts can seem too abstract amid the bumper-slogan imperatives of a presidential debate. But it left the candidates seeming to revert to caricatures of themselves: Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren trying to outdo each other on the speed with which they would withdraw troops and Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg carefully leaving themselves room to keep modest amounts of American power in the region.
Only Mr. Buttigieg touched on the changing nature of warfare, suggesting that while the debate over the Iraq war struck a nerve, it had little to do with the national security challenges the next president would face.
Those were "not just conventional military challenges," he said, "not just stateless terrorism, but cybersecurity challenges, climate security challenges, foreign interference in our elections." It seemed an effort to contrast himself with Mr. Trump, who has a 1950s view of American power -- often measuring it by naval tonnage and nuclear arsenals.
But it was Iran that animated the conversation and gave each candidate a chance to differentiate his or her approach from Mr. Trump's.
Several candidates said they would re-enter negotiations with Iran on a new version of the 2015 deal, with what Mr. Biden said would be changes to assure Iran could not return to producing nuclear fuel for many more years, and with heightened inspections.
But he never explained what would drive the Iranians back to the table, or persuade them to take a less advantageous deal than the one the country's leadership negotiated, over nearly three years, with the Obama administration. Would the candidates lift sanctions on Iran first, in hopes that would encourage the country to return to the old deal? None said. Would they deploy military assets to make it clear the United States would destroy nuclear facilities in case diplomacy failed?
Again, evasions.

Texto completo: A contemporary and friend of Milos Forman, he was part of the Czech New Wave before resettling in the United States.
Ivan Passer, a director who joined Milos Forman and others in ushering in the filmmaking movement known as the Czech New Wave in the 1960s, then went on to direct American features, including "Born to Win," "Cutter's Way" and "Creator," died on Thursday at his home in Reno, Nev. He was 86.
Rodney Sumpter, a lawyer and spokesman for Mr. Passer's family, said the cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Mr. Passer's debut feature, "Intimate Lighting," released in Czechoslovakia in 1965, was widely hailed as helping to establish a new level of cinema in that country, where Mr. Forman's early success, "Loves of a Blonde," had been released the same year.
"Intimate Lighting" was a sparse, elegantly told tale of a cellist from Prague who visits a country town for a concert and reunites with an old friend. The film drew acclaim when it played at the New York Film Festival in 1966 and again when it was given a theatrical release in the United States in 1969.
"It is one of those very special movies that does not so much reveal new secrets each time you see it as confirm a justness and good humor that was never hidden," Roger Greenspun wrote in The New York Times.

Early that same year, Mr. Passer had left his homeland for good, the Soviet-led invasion of 1968 having squelched the liberalization and artistic flowering of Czechoslovakia earlier in the decade.
In 1971, two years after he had emigrated to the United States, he directed his second feature, a New York story with American actors. It was "Born to Win," a comic drama about a middle-aged drug addict played by George Segal. Critics didn't like Mr. Passer's attempt to wring comedy out of drug addiction.
After two more comedies -- "Law and Disorder" (1974) and "Silver Bears" (1977) -- he had one of his biggest successes in 1981 with "Cutter's Way," a dark mystery that starred John Heard and Jeff Bridges.
"'Cutter's Way' grabs you by the throat and pulls you, kicking and screaming, into an America gone mad," Michael Blowen wrote in his review in The Boston Globe.
The movie, Mr. Blowen wrote, showed Mr. Passer's ability to imbue even seemingly throwaway scenes with meaning.
"Passer, obviously not satisfied with an outstanding thriller laced with superb performances, digs even deeper into the material," Mr. Blowen wrote. "In one simple sequence featuring a parade, the Czechoslovakian-born Passer presents a spare view of the American class system. Each decorative float is reserved for one race, religion, nationality or class. There are smiling Mexicans, Indians, blacks and whites -- each in their separate, but equal, spaces. America, he implies, is a country where the melting pot is a myth and where integration is impossible."

Mr. Passer was born on July 10, 1933, in Prague. He and Mr. Forman were students together at the King George boarding school in Podebrady, and again at the Film and Television School of the Academy of the Performing Arts in Prague (although Mr. Passer did not graduate).
He was an assistant director on Mr. Forman's "Black Peter" in 1964 as well as on "Loves of a Blonde," for which he was also one of several writers. He was also a writer of another Forman film, "The Firemen's Ball," released in 1967. For a time he taught film at the University of Southern California.
If Mr. Passer never achieved the fame of his friend Mr. Forman, a two-time Oscar winner who died in 2018, it was in part because of his laid-back approach to his profession.
"I never wanted to direct," he told The Boston Globe in 1985. "I didn't like the hustle. I didn't like the idea that I was being judged all the time. I would like to be totally invisible."
Mr. Passer was sometimes frustrated with the processes of Hollywood, especially the tendency of producers to interfere in filmmaking.
"Because they have money, they think they know how to do it," he told The Globe. "Then they lose all their money, and they blame everyone else."
One particularly vexing moment came in the early 1980s, when, after the success of "Cutter's Way," Mr. Passer planned to make a movie about the later years of Bat Masterson, the gunfighter turned journalist. James Cagney, then in his 80s, was set to star. The film's backers, though, thought Cagney was too old.
"Finally, the people who were ready to finance it said to me, 'We'll do it with Bob Duvall,"' Mr. Passer told The Globe. "I said: 'You want me to fire James Cagney? You must be out of your mind."'
The project fell through. Mr. Passer, though, would eventually work with Mr. Duvall. In 1992, in one of his most acclaimed television projects, he directed "Stalin," an HBO movie about the Soviet leader, with Mr. Duvall in the title role. The film won four Emmy Awards, including outstanding movie made for television.
Mr. Passer's other films included the comedy "Creator" (1985), with Peter O'Toole and Mariel Hemingway, and the romance "Haunted Summer" (1988), with Eric Stoltz and Laura Dern.
Mr. Passer's first marriage, to Eva Limanova, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Anne Frances Passer, and a son from his first marriage, Ivan Max Passer.
Mr. Passer shot "Stalin" in Moscow at the very moment when the Soviet Union was collapsing. On the last day of shooting, Dec. 21, 1991, the actors and crew broke out champagne after filming a scene that involved a dinner for Soviet leaders hosted by Stalin at his dacha. Just then, someone interrupted the production team's wrap party with word that an agreement signed that day had effectively dissolved the Soviet Union.
"I always wanted to see the end of that regime," Mr. Passer told The San Francisco Chronicle in 1992, adding, "and in this crowd, I saw Stalin, Khrushchev, Molotov and Voroshilov with glasses of champagne. I thought, 'I'm making this up!"'

Texto completo: Gentrification looms over the "freakishness and fun-loving spirit" of the boardwalk.
Dianna Carlin should be finishing the book she is writing about the joys of owning the Lola Star boutique, a "really tiny, magical little shop" on the Coney Island boardwalk, for the past 19 years.
Instead, Ms. Carlin has been anxious and fearful since her landlord weeks ago offered her a new lease -- with a 400 percent rent increase. "I'm wondering if I should start ordering 'going out of business' signs," she said.
In the summer, Brooklyn's Coney Island swells with sunbathers and amusement seekers, but it tends to be much quieter in the winter.
Over a decade ago, New York City promised a year-round destination with a water park, an arena, an ice-skating rink, and millions of dollars in residential and commercial investment.
At the same time, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, the cheap eats and mom-and-pop shops would be protected. The then-Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz, said in 2005 that the plan would preserve "Coney's famed freakishness and fun-loving spirit."
But like many grand plans for New York, the full vision has not materialized. Coney Island stood ceremoniously desolate on a recent January afternoon, a far cry from the year-round bustling attraction it was promised to be. Roaring winds gusted by famed roller coasters like the Cyclone and Luna Park's Steeplechase, but not by an ice-skating rink or a water park. Those wonders were never built.
And now, facing the steamroller of gentrification, even Coney Island's quirky circus sideshow could be forced to confront an uncertain future.
"They're trying to turn the People's Playground into the playground for the wealthy," Ms. Carlin said.
Ms. Carlin and the owners of five other small businesses in Coney Island -- Nathan's Famous, Ruby's Bar & Grill, Paul's Daughter, Tom's Restaurant and the Coney Island Beach Shop -- have been negotiating new 10-year lease agreements with Zamperla, the Italian amusement park manufacturer that was contracted by the city a decade ago to build and manage Coney Island's Luna Park amusement zone, of which the businesses are a part.
Zamperla's new terms: a 50 to 400 percent increase in rent for each of the businesses.
"I love Coney Island," Ms. Carlin said. "Having this store on the boardwalk is one of the most beloved things in my life. But there is no way I could afford that."
In a statement to The New York Times, Alessandro Zamperla, the president of Zamperla, said: "We care about Coney Island and its future, and we are dedicated to making it as strong a community as possible. This is why we've been working with our tenants to ensure their success and preserve the character of Coney Island."
Mr. Zamperla, who was on a trip in Italy, declined to answer specific questions from The Times, but added that at least three of the six businesses had agreed and signed their new leases, and others were making "significant progress."
The proposed rent increases on the six small businesses have reignited a yearslong tug of war for the soul of Coney Island.
In 2009, after a four-year standoff over the best plan for a revival, the Bloomberg administration bought seven acres in the downtrodden amusement district from the developer Joseph J. Sitt for $ 95.6 million.
Mr. Bloomberg wanted to restore the district, which began to decline in the 1960s, to its heyday by promoting the development of stores and apartments along Surf Avenue. Businesses that were open only in the summer would move to a year-round schedule, helping to bolster what Mr. Bloomberg envisioned as the nation's largest urban amusement park.
The city leased the land to Zamperla, allowing it to open Luna Park in 2010, dictate its own lease agreements with small businesses owners, and even require those businesses to hand over some of their profits.
Beloved boardwalk businesses that did not fit Zamperla's vision were shuttered. Others, like Ms. Carlin's boutique, which had been evicted under Mr. Sitt, returned.
By 2012, the revival was underway, and crowds and revenue were growing. Ms. Carlin said her profits rose nearly 50 percent after Zamperla assumed control.
"Most people believe that it has been developed in a manner consistent with Coney Island's history," Seth W. Pinsky, the former president of the Economic Development Corporation, said about the area.
Still, the amusement district is not operational year-round. Mark Treyger, the city councilman who represents the part of Brooklyn that includes Coney Island, said he believed this stemmed from a dearth of investment by the city and Mayor Bill de Blasio in the 2009 goals.
"Businesses just don't know where the de Blasio administration is taking Coney Island," Mr. Treyger said. "There's a lack of vision or holistic plan to improve the area."
The unfulfilled promises, he said, gave Zamperla leverage to place the burden on tenants to help recoup squandered profits. These tenants were "invested with the thought this would be a yearlong destination, with foot traffic year-round, as opposed to three or four months out of the year," Mr. Treyger added. "You cannot allow public land to be weaponized in the name of greed to hurt small businesses."
Ms. Carlin and dozens of other Coney Island workers protested the rent increases on the steps of City Hall in early December.
In an interview with The Times, a civil rights lawyer, Norman Siegel, called Zamperla's rent decision "unconscionable." He said Mr. de Blasio should intervene.
The de Blasio administration, Mr. Siegel said, should ask Zamperla to come up with more reasonable terms. "If that doesn't happen," he said, the city "should give serious thought to puling the lease."
Mr. Zamperla said that in an attempt at good faith, he had extended the deadline for Ms. Carlin to sign her lease to Wednesday.
"Alessandro is vacationing in Italy while I'm working desperately to save my store and my livelihood," Ms. Carlin said.
Neither Mr. Zamperla nor the owners of the other five businesses would comment on their lease agreements, though multiple people with knowledge of the terms confirmed that the increases ranged from 50 percent for the larger shops to 400 percent for Ms. Carlin's smaller store.
Ms. Carlin said she believed the other businesses were not speaking out for fear of retribution. "They're afraid of getting kicked out," she said.
To handle the increases, Ms. Carlin said, owners have mentioned raising the prices of goods. One eatery, she said, was making changes to transition from a sit-down restaurant to a fast-food counter, to curb costs.
Ms. Carlin said that she has tried to beseech City Hall multiple times -- with calls, emails and last month's protest -- but that it appeared that little has changed.
"The city keeps telling me they're not able to help and there's not much they can do, but I don't agree with that," she said. "They're Zamperla's landlord."
Mr. Siegel, the lawyer, said the increases were so egregious that they might be grounds for litigation. "There is some case law where if the court decides that what they're doing is unconscionable, that can be a claim in and of itself," he said.
At City Hall, there have been no public indications of plans to pull back the lease from Zamperla, or to intervene; the rent increases do not violate the agreement between the city and Zamperla.
Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, denied the claims that the administration had no vision or plan for Coney Island. She said the city spent $ 180 million upgrading Coney Island's infrastructure in the last decade and planned to expand New York City's ferry system to Coney Island by 2021.
"This administration is committed to maintaining Coney Island's character while ensuring it's equitable and prepared for the future," Ms. Meyer said.
Mr. Siegel said he wondered just whom that future is for.
A Brooklyn native who grew up spending summers on the boardwalk, he fondly recalls spending a dollar to ride the Cyclone and coming home with no appetite for dinner after gorging on Nathan's Famous hot dogs and fries.
"We've got to fight to save Coney Island," he said.

Texto completo: "Expedition With Steve Backshall" kicks off on PBS. And a war comedy-drama debuts on Paramount Network.
What's on TV
EXPEDITION WITH STEVE BACKSHALL 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). "I think it's really important that we're rational today," Steve Backshall says in the first episode of this adventure series. Moments later, Backshall and his team begin a rock climbing descent down a large canyon, one he describes as "four times the height of London's Big Ben." Few viewers, thankfully, are likely to tune to this British show to see perfectly rational behavior: "Expedition" follows Backshall, an adventurer known for hosting the BBC Show "Deadly 60," as he ventures across various rugged frontiers, from flooded caves in Mexico to white water rapids in Bhutan. This first episode finds him in Oman. And that descent he compares to Big Ben? It's just the prelude to an even more intense climb.
68 WHISKEY 10 p.m. on Paramount Network. Body bags, military helicopters and camouflage uniforms aren't the standard-issue tools of humor, but they feature prominently in this new comedy-drama series, which is set on a United States military base in Afghanistan. Something like a modern-day "M*A*S*H," "68 Whiskey" centers on a group of United States Army medics. Its debut episode involves a discharge, a cute goat and a clandestine hookup.
JARHEAD (2005) 11 p.m. on Showtime. For far more straight-faced military drama than "68 Whiskey" offers, consider turning to "Jarhead," which stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a soldier fighting in the first gulf war. Directed by Sam Mendes, the film would also be a fitting choice for those who saw Mendes's "1917" -- a World War I movie and a leading Oscar contender -- and want to see the director's take on a different conflict.
What's Streaming
THE MASTER (2012) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu. Joaquin Phoenix is up for the best actor Oscar this year for his performance in "Joker." If he wins, it will be the first time that he's landed the award. But he's been nominated twice before: Once for the Johnny Cash biopic "Walk the Line," and more recently for "The Master," a hallucinatory drama from Paul Thomas Anderson. Set in 1950, the film stars Phoenix as Freddie Quell, a World War II veteran and alcoholic who falls under the spell of a California cult leader played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The cast also includes Amy Adams and Laura Dern, who is herself up for a best supporting actress Oscar this year. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott called the film "a glorious and haunting symphony of color, emotion and sound." This is a movie, he wrote, "that defies understanding even as it compels reverent, astonished belief."
JAYDE ADAMS: SERIOUS BLACK JUMPER Stream on Amazon. "I don't know if you've ever been to stand-up in this day and age," the British comedian Jayde Adams says in this new special, "but basically, stand-up isn't stand-up unless you are trying to inflict change upon your audience." Other topics she addresses here include emoji, feminism and black turtlenecks.

For investment firm, not easy being green; Financial giant BlackRock's climate activism has limits

Texto completo: BlackRock Inc., the world's biggest fund manager with $7 trillion in assets, said Tuesday that it plans to "place sustainability at the center of our investment approach." Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Fink said in his annual letter to corporate executives that BlackRock will take steps to address the issue across the thousands of companies in which it invests.
Fink wrote that the risks posed by rising world temperatures will affect "both our physical world and the global system that finances economic growth." BlackRock said it is seeking a tenfold increase in the assets dedicated to sustainable investments in the coming decade, to $1 trillion from about $90 billion currently.
As environmental, social and governance issues become more pressing, especially for younger savers, it's a savvy business move that will pressure peers to follow suit. But there's a problem. With about two-thirds of the money it manages allocated to index-tracking funds, the issue of how to harness the resources in passively managed products -- the bulk of which command fees that are too low to finance costly and time-consuming engagement with company boards -- remains unaddressed.

BlackRock funds hold a 6.7% stake in Exxon Mobil Corp., for instance, as well as 6.9% in Chevron Corp. and 6% in Glencore. And in all likelihood, it will keep holding them because much of that is held by funds that passively track market indexes, rather than actually pick stocks or bonds.
BlackRock said it would undertake a number of steps to bring climate considerations to its passive funds. The firm will double its lineup of sustainable exchange-traded funds to about 150, and pressure index providers to create sustainable versions of their flagship indexes, according to a client note outlining the changes.
In his letter, Fink said the financial world is undergoing "a fundamental reshaping" as the climate crisis becomes more apparent. "Our investment conviction is that sustainability- and climate-integrated portfolios can provide better risk-adjusted returns to investors," he wrote.
BlackRock's move comes as the world's fund managers find themselves at the forefront of populist pressure to do more to save the planet. As the world's principal allocators of capital, money managers are being scrutinized like never before -- and are being found wanting in many cases.
BlackRock's annual investment stewardship report, for example, shows that in the one-year period ending in mid-2019, it interacted with 256 companies on "environmental risks and opportunities." Although more than 80% of those discussions were on climate-specific risks, the firm voted in favor of just four shareholder proposals pressing U.S. companies to implement policies designed to prevent the average global temperature from increasing by more than 2 degrees Celsius. Hence the criticism.
The nonprofit group Majority Action examined the U.S. voting record of 25 of the world's biggest asset managers and what it found wasn't pretty. BlackRock and Vanguard Group Inc. voted against at least 16 climate-related proposals that would have passed with their backing, a report the group published in September found.
This month, BlackRock joined Climate Action 100+, a group of more than 370 fund managers that champions engagement with companies to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. The organization now has $41 trillion of firepower to rain down on companies deemed to be hurting the planet.
But the trillions of dollars in the growing category of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are unlikely to participate in that activism. ETFs designed to cater to investors who prioritize environment, social and corporate governance, or ESG, factors have about $20 billion in assets spread across more than 100 products, with more than 30 such ETFs introduced in the last two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.
Although that ESG subset is dwarfed by the $6 trillion of global assets ETFs have garnered in recent years, it attracted a record $8 billion of inflows in 2019, a trend likely to continue accelerating as the climate crisis continues to attract headlines -- and dollars.
In an interview with the New York Times, Fink acknowledged that the firm's passive index funds aren't able to ditch the shares of companies it deems not to be acting in line with its views on sustainability. Moreover, he said in his letter that governments will dictate the speed at which the world moves to a lower-carbon economy. "Under any scenario, the energy transition will still take decades," he wrote.
BlackRock's size puts it in a delicate position: Operating in more than 30 countries, and as one of the biggest holders of most U.S. publicly traded companies, the company has a client list that includes large sovereign wealth funds, state pension plans and financial advisors with viewpoints that don't necessarily align on what to do about climate change and social justice issues. .
Also, although BlackRock said it will cut exposure to thermal coal, that doesn't mean it's selling out of the biggest producers. BlackRock's discretionary active investment portfolios will sell out of all companies that get more than 25% of sales from thermal coal, Fink wrote.
However, the revenue threshold means that large, diversified miners -- which also rank among the largest coal producers -- won't be affected. Glencore, for instance, is the biggest coal shipper, mining about 130 million tons last year.
Yet its thermal coal revenue accounted for less than 10% of the total, thanks to the contribution from its giant trading operations. Major coal producers Anglo American and BHP Group also comfortably escape the cap.

Texto completo: Many have been all too quick to make Atty. Gen. William Barr out to be a reflexive toady for President Trump. Just last week, the New York City Bar Assn. took the extreme step of writing to congressional leaders to investigate Barr for political bias. And last month, he came under blistering criticism for defending the Trump campaign and characterizing the FBI's Russia investigation into the 2016 election as bogus.
Slate has accused Barr of using the Department of Justice as "a personal law firm for Trump." Vox has bewailed "the department's politicization under Barr." The Daily Beast has lamented how Barr has "become another of Donald Trump's personal lawyers." The New York Times has noted that the attorney general had "reprised his role as a vocal defender of President Trump."
Perhaps none of these media outlets recall the time when then-Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. famously described himself as President Obama's "wingman." Curiously, Holder actually took to the Washington Post to decry Barr's ostensible self-debasement as an unfortunate "instrument of politics."

Holder's hypocrisy aside, the new stance in favor of a strongly independent attorney general among liberals is misguided as a matter of constitutional interpretation and ahistorical as a matter of American custom.
Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution states that "[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America." The power is vested not in numerous sources, but solely in the president. The president maintains plenary authority over the entirety of the executive branch.
The "unitary executive theory," which Democrats routinely excoriate, comes from the plain text of the Constitution. As Atty. Gen. Barr recently said during his remarks at the Federalist Society's 2019 National Lawyers Convention, the notion of the unitary executive "is not 'new,' and it is not a 'theory.'" On the contrary, he continued, "[i]t is a description of what the Framers unquestionably did in Article II of the Constitution."
Throughout American history, attorneys general have intuited and acted upon their non-independent subordination to presidents of the United States. In "Conflicting Loyalties: Law and Politics in the Attorney General's Office, 1789-1990," the scholar Nancy V. Baker explored the historical nature of the attorney general's position. Baker devoted entire book sections to "The Attorney General as a Legal Advisor" and "The Attorney General as a Policy Advisor." She observed that "before he became an administrator" of a sprawling Department of Justice bureaucracy, "the attorney general assumed the role of the advisor to the president." What's more, the attorney general's "responsibility" to serve in such an advisory capacity "has antecedents in seventeenth-century England."
Indeed, the role of the attorney general as a top presidential advisor has been a recurring theme throughout American history. When President Lincoln's attorney general, Edward Bates, famously wrote to Congress in 1861 to defend Lincoln's unilateral suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, he did so not as a neutral arbiter of legal principle, but as Lincoln's top legal advisor who shared his superior's ultimate policy aim of a Union victory in the Civil War.
Similarly, President Franklin Roosevelt's wartime attorney general, Francis Biddle, ceased his vocal opposition to Japanese American internment after it became obvious that Roosevelt planned to sign the fateful Executive Order 9066. Biddle understood that he was not in any way independent of the president, but that he was a political appointee who had to support the president in order to keep his job.
In modern times, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which was created by Congress during the New Deal, provides "legal advice to the president and all executive branch agencies" and reviews "all executive orders and substantive proclamations proposed to be issued by the president." The president also has at his disposal the White House counsel's office, but that office tends to focus on legal issues arising from legislation, executive and judicial branch nominations and ethics questions.
Though the Office of Legal Counsel does sometimes reach legal conclusions at loggerheads with the White House, it is hardly independent in any meaningful way. Former Acting Assistant Atty. Gen. David Barron, who led the OLC during the early years of the Obama administration, once stated that the office's legal analyses "may appropriately reflect the fact that its responsibilities also include facilitating the work of the Executive Branch and the objectives of the President, consistent with the law." And legal scholarship has observed the "systematic deference" that the Office of Legal Counsel generally shows toward the president's prerogatives.
Eric Holder was correct the first time. The attorney general, in large part, actually is the president's "wingman."

Justices Wary In Weighing 'Bridgegate' As a Crime

Texto completo: Justices across the ideological spectrum seemed wary of allowing prosecutions based on officials' misrepresentations about the reasons for their actions.
WASHINGTON -- Closing access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to punish a political opponent in 2013 was a scandal, one that helped doom the presidential ambitions of Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor at the time. On Tuesday, a skeptical Supreme Court considered whether the incident -- "Bridgegate," in the tabloid shorthand -- was also a crime.
The case concerned two of Mr. Christie's associates, Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, who were convicted of wire fraud and related federal charges for their roles in concocting a "traffic study" that caused extreme delays for motorists seeking to cross the bridge, the busiest in the world, from Fort Lee, N.J., to Manhattan. The mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, had rebuffed a request to endorse Mr. Christie, and this was his punishment.
"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee," Ms. Kelly, an aide to Mr. Christie, wrote in an email to officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge. Mr. Christie, who was at the court for Tuesday's argument, has denied any knowledge of the scheme.
Eric J. Feigin, a lawyer for the federal government, told the justices on Tuesday that the delays were "catastrophic," endangering motorists. That point was undisputed.
"It was quite a problem, I grant you," Justice Stephen G. Breyer said.
Also undisputed was that the traffic scheme was at least unseemly. In a Supreme Court brief, Ms. Kelly's lawyers called it petty and ill-advised. But they said it was not criminal.
"I'm not trying to suggest that this is O.K.," said Jacob M. Roth, a lawyer for Ms. Kelly. "We don't want public officials acting for personal reasons. We don't want them acting necessarily for partisan or political reasons. But what I'm saying is the remedy for that is not the federal property fraud statutes."
A central legal question for the court was whether it can be a crime for government officials to give false reasons for their actions. Justices across the ideological spectrum appeared wary of allowing such prosecutions. Lying about the reasons for official conduct is commonplace, several justices suggested, and making it criminal could expose countless government officials to prosecution.
"I don't see how this case works," Justice Breyer said. It should not be a serious crime, he said by way of example, for mayors to have their streets plowed first after snowstorms and to lie about why they gave themselves priority.
"Now, that is not a good thing to do," he said of the special treatment. "It is really undesirable. And maybe it should be a crime. But 30 years in prison? That, I'm not sure."
Mr. Baroni was sentenced to 18 months in prison in February and reported to a federal corrections facility in Pennsylvania in April, but he was released on bail after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in June.
Ms. Kelly was sentenced to 13 months but will remain free unless the Supreme Court rules against her.
The justices also struggled to decide a second legal question: whether the Port Authority had been defrauded of anything.
"The object of the deception was not to obtain property," Justice Elena Kagan said, paraphrasing the words of the key federal law under which the defendants were prosecuted.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. echoed the point. "The object of the scheme was not to commandeer lanes on the bridge," he said. "The object was to cause a traffic jam in Fort Lee. And if they could have done it some other way, they would have done it some other way."
Mr. Roth, the lawyer for Ms. Kelly, drew a distinction between lies resulting in personal gain -- expense account fraud, say -- and ones told about the allocation of government resources.
"The federal property fraud statute is concerned with cheating the government out of its property rights," Mr. Roth said. "And that's just not what we have here. What we have here is an abuse of power, a political abuse of power."
Allowing criminal prosecutions of such abuses under property fraud laws could have sweeping consequences, Ms. Kelly's lawyers wrote in their Supreme Court brief. Under the government's theory, they wrote, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross could be prosecuted for giving what the Supreme Court found in June was a contrived reason for trying to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.
Mr. Feigin, the government lawyer, said Ms. Kelly and Mr. Baroni had unlawfully commandeered public property. "The defendants in this case committed fraud by telling a lie to take control over the physical access lanes to the George Washington Bridge and the employee resources necessary to realign them," he said.
Other justices delved into whether Mr. Baroni, who was a Port Authority official at the time, had been authorized to reallocate the lanes. If he had been, Mr. Feigin said, he was free to use the authority even if he had a political motive.
But Mr. Feigin added that Mr. Baroni's untruthful statements were evidence that he lacked authority.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that did not follow. "Isn't it often the case that somebody who has the authority to do something may lie about why the person is doing the thing because, if the real reason was exposed, it would cause a furor?" he asked. "That doesn't show the person doesn't have the authority to do it."
Michael Levy, a lawyer for Mr. Baroni, said he had the power to call for the new traffic pattern and to give untruthful reasons for doing so.
Several justices asked no questions or only unilluminating ones, and others interrogated both sides vigorously, making it unusually hard to draw definitive conclusions about where the court seemed headed in the case, Kelly v. United States, No. 18-1059.
The Supreme Court has limited the tools available to prosecutors in public corruption cases, notably in a 2016 decision that unanimously overturned the conviction of Bob McDonnell, a former governor of Virginia who was accused of accepting luxury products, loans and vacations from a business executive in return for arranging meetings and urging underlings to consider the executive's requests.
Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the court, said that only formal and concrete government actions could form the basis of a corruption prosecution. Anti-corruption laws, the court has indicated in the McDonnell case and others, were meant to cover only classic bribery and kickbacks.

Texto completo: A home-style Mexican restaurant in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, pozole from Fany Gerson and Danny Mena, and more news.
Headliner
Piggyback NYC
Leah Cohen's latest has a broader scope than her Lower East Side spot, Pig and Khao. "The food at Pig and Khao is from Southeast Asia," she said. Piggyback NYC's focus is "all over Asia except India, and is inspired by our travels." This new spot in Chelsea features Chinese dishes like a Hainanese duck with a rice cake and two sauces, as well as Filipino lumpia done Shanghai-style, and Korean wings with gochujang sauce. Still, Ms. Cohen's menu makes several stops in Southeast Asia: Vietnam for her take on the fish and herb dish cha ca la vong, Thailand for fried rice and Indonesia for lamb rendang. The restaurant has a narrow, brick-walled space with a bar and some tables, and a kitchen pass-through that opens into a bright, airy and informal dining room whose walls Ms. Cohen's husband and partner, Ben Byruch, papered with Asian newspapers and advertisements. Butterfly pea flower, Thai basil and gochujang season some cocktails.
140 West 30th Street, 212-239-0570, pigandkhao.com.
Opening
Boca Santa
Natalie Hernandez, a Texan with a background in fashion, offers her take on home-style Mexican cooking at this Brooklyn spot. Though vegetables are featured in much of the food, her signature dish is a quesadilla with crisp chicharrónes, salsa verde and white onions. The small restaurant is decorated to evoke the colorful colonial city San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, where most of her family lives.
480 Madison Street (Marcus Garvey Boulevard), Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, no phone, bocasantanyc.com.
La Pozoleria at La Newyorkina
It's not the first time that Fany Gerson, the maker of Mexican sweets, has teamed up with Danny Mena, the chef who was an owner of Hecho en Dumbo and now runs La Loncheria in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Last year, she created frozen paletas that were served at La Loncheria. Now they're simmering pozole in several guises and serving them at a pop-up they created at Ms. Gerson's La Newyorkina, to be open at least until March 21.
240 Sullivan Street (West Third Street), 646-861-0727, lanewyorkina.com.
Omar's La Boîte
Omar Hernandez, the restaurateur and night-life entrepreneur who lent a downtown vibe to the upstairs room at Vaucluse on the Upper East Side, is opening a nightclub and a dining club. Wednesdays through Saturdays, a $ 200 fee will cover entertainment and a four-course tasting menu from the young chef Flynn McGarry of Gem, around the corner from Omar's. A downstairs lounge and disco is open for late-night partying. (Opens Wednesday)
302 Broome Street (Forsyth Street), 212-203-5552, omar-nyc.com.
Sushi Ishikawa
Don Pham has brought his innovative sushi omakase to the Upper West Side. Like the original on the Upper East Side, this location offers 15- and 16-course menus for $ 125 and $ 155, with traditional items like pen shell scallops with yuzu zest, and chawanmushi with mushrooms, and more unusual preparations like cod milt tempura, and sweet shrimp with bottarga and foie gras. There are 12 seats at the counter, in a pale, restful setting. (Wednesday)
207 West 80th Street, 212-651-9152, ishikawanyc.com.
Le Petit Parisien
The charming little Parisian-style sandwich shop in the East Village has opened an uptown branch. As at the original, French newsprint pages have been glued to the walls, and the baguettes are baked by Orwashers, according to the owners' recipe. But at this larger location, there is room for a few desserts.
151 Malcolm X Boulevard (117th Street), 917-262-0524, lepetitparisienusa.com.
Sauced
Wines with the prices per glass written directly on the bottles, and small plates like smoked salmon rillettes, oysters and beef tongue escabeche are served at this intimate bar from Four Happy Men Hospitality.
331 Bedford Avenue (South Third Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 347-209-0480, saucedbklyn.com.
Carnegie Diner & Cafe
A casual spot that was called Artisan's Gate, named for a nearby entrance to Central Park, is now an updated all-day, all-purpose diner. (Wednesday)
205 West 57th Street, 212-664-1001, carnegiediner.com.
Restaurants on the Move
The Pool
Instead of trying to run two separate restaurants, the Grill and the Pool, in the former Four Seasons restaurant space, Major Food Group has merged them, and is serving the meat-focused Continental menu from the Grill, the more popular of the two, in both rooms. A few highlights from the Pool remain on the menu, including the caviar service, the halibut with fennel sauce and clams, the beet mille-feuille and the turbot. When making reservations, customers can request either room. Jeff Zalaznick, the managing partner of Major Food Group, said the decision came in conjunction with physical changes in the Pool lounge that had to be made to satisfy the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which has listed the restaurant's 1959 interior as a landmark. The lounge area is to reopen at the end of the month.
99 East 52nd Street, 212-375-9001, thepoolnewyork.com.
Jiang Diner
This casual place with vibrant Northern Chinese food, including pancakes and lamb specialties, has moved to a new, similar storefront.
104 Second Avenue (East Sixth Street), 646-484-5999, jiangdiner.com.
Closed
DaDong
This ambitious multilevel Midtown Manhattan branch of the Beijing roast-duck chain has closed after a little less than two years. The restaurant, from the chef and restaurateur Dong Zhenjiang, who has opened more than 20 restaurants in China in the past 24 years, was the chain's first location in the United States. It got off to a bad start with devastating notices, including a zero-star review by Pete Wells in The New York Times. More recently, it declared bankruptcy, and its furnishings will be sold at auction.
Events
Burns Brunch
The birthday of the poet Robert Burns, Jan. 25, is usually celebrated as Burns Night. But this year, the 260th anniversary, there will be a Burns brunch, complete with bagpipes, a haggis ceremony, Scotch eggs, poetry, plenty of whisky and Andrew Weir of the movie "Braveheart" on hand.
1 to 5 p.m., Jan. 25, Fine & Rare, 9 East 37th Street, $ 75 plus fee, brownpapertickets.com/event/4475378.

Texto completo: The Revolutionary Guards arrested the person who made a video of a missile striking a passenger plane. The video undercut the military's denials of responsibility.
President Hassan Rouhani of Iran called on Tuesday for a special court to examine the recent downing of a passenger plane that killed 176 people, as protests flared for the fourth day in several cities over the disaster and officials' shifting explanations for it.
But even as the president made the announcement, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a powerful arm of Iran's military, said it had arrested a person it identified as having recorded a video of a missile attacking the plane, which undercut the military's initial denials that Iran was responsible. The arrest was announced by Iranian media outlets affiliated with the Guards.
The contradictory messages from the president, who is elected, and the Guards, who answer to Iran's clerical leaders, reflect the competing power centers in the Iranian government.
For three days after the crash of a Ukraine International Airlines jetliner, the military blamed mechanical failure. It eventually acknowledged that it had mistakenly shot the jet down with a missile, but insisted that "human error" was to blame, not any systemic problem.
In an apparent criticism of the military, Mr. Rouhani, a moderate, urged that an official inquiry be candid about its findings. But some hard-line lawmakers have lashed out at his administration, demanding resignations.
Iran's chief prosecutor also demanded the expulsion of the British ambassador on Tuesday, accusing him of having broken the law by participating in an unauthorized protest.
The ambassador, Rob Macaire, was briefly detained on Saturday after being picked up at an antigovernment demonstration at a Tehran university. Britain denounced the arrest as "a flagrant violation of international law" and summoned the Iranian ambassador to London on Monday to convey its objections.
The Iranian prosecutor, Muhammad Jaffar Montazeri, said Tuesday that Mr. Macaire should be expelled as soon as possible, and Gholam Hossein Ismaili, a spokesman for the judiciary, called the ambassador a "problematic mole."
In the government's investigation of the shooting down of the Ukrainian jet, Mr. Ismaili said Tuesday that "arrests have been" made but he did not provide any details, leaving it unclear how many people had been detained or how senior they were.
"It would have been better if they had announced from the beginning that commissions are investigating," he said, in an apparent criticism of the military and the government for the initial misleading statements.
He said the flight data recorders recovered from the Ukrainian plane would be sent to France for analysis.
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is expected to deliver a Friday Prayer sermon this week, a role he plays only at times of major crisis; the last was eight years ago.
The Ukrainian plane was shot down on Jan. 8, shortly after takeoff from Tehran, as hostilities between Iran and the United States had escalated after an American airstrike killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. Hours before the airliner crashed, Iran had fired missiles at United States forces in Iraq in response to the general's killing, and Iranian forces were on guard for American retaliation.
After three days of denying any role in the crash, Iran's military admitted that the plane had been hit by at least one of its missiles.
Mr. Rouhani, himself a former commander of Iran's air defense forces, said on Tuesday that he wanted the issue "to be addressed to the people with honesty."
"The familiarity I have with air defense issue, I say that it can't be one person who is responsible for this," he said, according to the state news agency. "Not just the person who pressed the button -- there are others too."
Ali Rabeei, a spokesman for Mr. Rouhani, has said that the government did not lie, but initially made incorrect statements because it did not have all the relevant information in a tense, fast-changing situation.
"Perhaps, I can even say, it was due to being kept uninformed," Mr. Rabeei said.
President Rouhani asked the judiciary on Tuesday to create a "special court, with a high-ranking judge and tens of experts," to look into the downing of the airliner.
"This is not a regular case," Mr. Rouhani said. "The whole world will watch this trial."
Amid a heavy security presence in Tehran, protests broke out on several university campuses on Tuesday, as they have daily since the government admitted that the plane had been shot down. At Tehran University, where Ayatollah Khamenei had prayed over the coffin of General Suleimani just days earlier, students chanted about the ayatollah, "our shame, our shame is our supreme leader."
At Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, students castigated officials who had misled the public about the crash while saying they were mourning the victims. "If you are mourning why did you cover it up for three days?" they chanted.
Mr. Ismaili, the judiciary spokesman, said about 30 people have been arrested over the recent days of protests.
Officials in Tehran said on Tuesday that 61 of the 176 victims had been identified through DNA testing, and that their remains could be handed over to their families.

Texto completo: A Times copy editor, she kick-started Anthony Bourdain's career when she helped him get a tell-all article about the restaurant world published in The New Yorker.
Gladys Bourdain, a longtime copy editor at The New York Times who helped kick-start the writing career of her son Anthony, the chef who became a world-famous memoirist and television host, died on Friday at a hospice facility in the Bronx. She was 85.
Her son Christopher confirmed the death. He said she had been in failing health for some time.
Ms. Bourdain began her career at The Times in 1984 and worked there until 2008, developing a reputation as a strict grammarian on the culture and metropolitan desks. She also wrote for outlets like Opera News, Musical America and The Times.
She profiled Julia Child for The Times in 1978 after a visit to Ms. Child's home in Southern France, describing her kitchen as "organized clutter."
Anthony Bourdain became a hard-living chef, and in the late 1990s he wrote an article chronicling the seamier secrets of life in the restaurant business. He was struggling to publish it in 1999 when Ms. Bourdain mentioned to him that she knew a Times reporter, Esther Fein, who was married to David Remnick, the newly minted editor of The New Yorker magazine.
"She came over, and she said, 'You know, your husband's got this new job,"' Ms. Fein (who left The Times in 1999) said on Monday. "'I hate to sound like a pushy mom, but I'm telling you this with my editor's hat on, not my mother's hat on. It's really good, and it's really interesting, but nobody will look at it, nobody will call him back or give it a second look. Could you put it in your husband's hands?"'
Ms. Fein persuaded Mr. Remnick to read the article, and The New Yorker published it under the title "Don't Eat Before Reading This." Mr. Bourdain later said that he had a book deal in a matter of days after that.
Expanding on the article, he wrote "Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly" (2000), an unflinching look at the food service industry that became a No. 1 New York Times best seller.
The book's success propelled Mr. Bourdain from a brasserie kitchen onto television, as the host of "No Reservations" and "Parts Unknown," on which he traveled the world sampling different foods and engaging with different cultures.
Mr. Bourdain committed suicide in 2018 at 61.
[Read Anthony Bourdain's obituary.]
Ms. Bourdain memorialized her son with a tattoo of his name on her wrist -- her first and only tattoo.
Gladys Sacksman was born in Manhattan on Oct. 19, 1934, to Martha and Milton Sacksman. Her father operated a small trucking company, and her mother was a homemaker.
She grew up in the University Heights neighborhood of the Bronx and attended what is now Lehman College in that borough. She worked for TV Guide, The Record of Bergen County, N.J., and Agence France-Presse before joining The Times.
She married Pierre Bourdain in 1954. They separated in 1980. Mr. Bourdain died in 1987. In addition to her son Christopher, she is survived by three grandchildren.

Texto completo: "The Box," by the 21-year-old rapper, held off a comeback single by Bieber thanks to success on streaming platforms.
Roddy Ricch, a 21-year-old melodic rapper from Compton, Calif., held off a brand-new comeback single from Justin Bieber to take the top spot this week on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, giving him a No. 1 song to go with his second nonconsecutive week atop the Billboard 200 album chart.
Ricch's "The Box," from his debut album "Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial" (Atlantic), rose from No. 3, becoming the rapper's first No. 1 single, after a monster streaming week that included 68 million plays, according to Nielsen Music, despite the song having no official music video.
Team Bieber had pulled out all the stops in hopes of having "Yummy," the singer's first solo single in more than two years, debut at No. 1 in its first week of release.
In addition to a strong push to traditional radio, Bieber promoted seven different videos for "Yummy" -- all of which counted toward its chart position -- and even became a target for criticism when he shared, and later deleted, a social-media post created by his die-hard fans that encouraged listeners to game the system. (Among other tips, international listeners were instructed on how to trick Spotify into thinking their plays were from within the United States, and thus, eligible to be counted by Billboard.)
Instead, "Yummy," which was also promoted with the sale of special-edition vinyl and cassette singles (including some with Bieber's autograph), came in at No. 2, including a total of 29.3 million streams, according to Nielsen.
The strength of "The Box" helped propel Ricch's "Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial" back to No. 1 on the album chart for a second week, after it debuted there last month. The album, now in its fifth week on the chart, was credited with 97,000 equivalent units, which combines sales, streams and downloads. But the album had almost all of its activity via audio streams, selling just 1,000 units, while being streamed 127 million times.
This week's album chart marked the first time that streams from YouTube were counted toward an album's sales total, though it barely came into play for Ricch: According to Billboard, audio streaming made up about 91,000 units of the rapper's total activity, while video streams made up under 4,000. Ricch became the first artist to top both the Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 simultaneously since Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's "A Star Is Born" soundtrack nearly a year ago.
Elsewhere on the album chart was a limited number of new releases and a pile of albums that have previously reached the top spot: Post Malone's "Hollywood's Bleeding" was No. 2; Harry Styles's "Fine Line" was No. 3; last week's No. 1, from Travis Scott's JackBoys collective, fell to No. 4; and the soundtrack to "Frozen 2" was No. 5.

Texto completo: Our reporters followed all of the exchanges and fact-checked the candidates, providing context and explanation.
Six of the candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination took the stage on Tuesday night in Des Moines for their last debate before the Iowa caucuses kick off the primary season in less than three weeks.
Here is how the candidates' remarks stacked up against the truth.
Senator Bernie Sanders said that his "Medicare for all" plan would cost "substantially less" than the current health care system, a characterization that many serious analysts contest.
"Medicare for all, which will guarantee comprehensive health care to every man, woman and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo."
This is exaggerated. Medicare for all would be an enormous change to the health care system, and many key details are still unsettled. That makes it very difficult to provide precise estimates of what such a system would cost. A number of serious economists have considered the question in a rigorous way. Some believe that a Medicare for all system could cost less over the long run than the future under current policy. But several believe it will cost more.
Medicare for all would be able to squeeze savings out of the current system. It could pay lower prices to doctors, hospitals and drugmakers. It would eliminate health insurance profit. And it could eliminate spending on administration and paperwork by simplifying the system.
But it also has features that would tend to increase spending. By covering Americans who currently are uninsured, it would incur new costs. It would also expand benefits beyond what health insurance typically covers, by including dental care and long-term care, among other services. Once those services are covered, economists assume more people will use them.
Last year, The Upshot published a summary of several serious estimates of the cost of Mr. Sanders's program. That summary gives a sense of the range of estimates and the variables that drive the differences between them.
Mr. Sanders said that his health care plan would eliminate the large differences between the prices paid for health care in the United States and peer nations, a statement without much evidence to support it.
"Medicare for all will end the absurdity of the United States paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and health care in general."
This is exaggerated. Mr. Sanders is correct that nearly every kind of medical service costs more in the United States than in other developed nations. Many health economists believe it is these higher prices paid in the United States that explain the bulk of why the American health care system is so unusually expensive.
A Medicare for all plan like the one Mr. Sanders has proposed would have the power to lower such prices by making the government the only purchaser of health care services. But just because the government could pay less for health care than insurers and patients pay now does not mean that the government could easily reduce American prices to match those of other nations.
The health care system in the United States is organized around our current prices, meaning that huge reductions in payments could be disruptive, with the potential to cause hospitals to close or doctors to default on their debts. That's why most serious analysts believe that even a Medicare for all system could only cut medical prices by so much.
The countries with lower payment rates set up systems to limit health care prices decades ago, before the gap with the United States became so large. A Medicare for all system would almost certainly narrow that gap. But the United States would probably continue to pay the highest prices in the world for many health care services.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried to explain his vote to authorize the Iraq war.
"I said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war."
Mr. Biden was one of 77 senators who voted to authorize the war in Iraq in October 2002 -- and he called that vote a mistake in 2005. The New York Times reviewed how he made that decision nearly two decades ago and found that the episode reveals how he operates "as a Senate dealmaker at heart."
Later in the debate, Mr. Biden suggested that he began to oppose the war in 2003 after weapons inspectors had left the country saying they had found no evidence of illegal weapons. But Mr. Biden continued to justify his support for the war until 2005.
On other military engagements, potential and actual, Mr. Biden has exercised more caution. During his bid for the presidency in 2008, for example, Mr. Biden warned that war with Iran "is not just a bad option. It would be a disaster."
When he became vice president, Mr. Biden was a lonely voice in the White House who argued against increasing troop levels in Afghanistan in 2009 -- a fight he ultimately lost. He then repeatedly pushed to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by 2014 and, though President Barack Obama shared that aim, the United States still had troops in Afghanistan when the two men left office.
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said that Australia, which is experiencing the worst wildfires seen in decades, is also suffering from tornadoes made of fire.
"In Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place. This is no longer theoretical or off in the future."
Firenadoes, or fire tornadoes, are, indeed, a thing. When wildfires get big enough and hot enough, it can create thunderstorms that breed tornadoes. Climate change is a key element here because warming is making wildfires worse by lengthening the fire season, decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures.

Mr. Sanders said he objected to the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement because it did not address climate change.
"Every major environmental organization has said 'no' to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase 'climate change' in it."
This is true. Democrats fought for language calling for a commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as for binding climate change standards, but those provisions did not make it into the final measure that passed the House. That bill, which awaits a vote in the Senate, does not include any mention of climate change.
Multiple candidates said Iran was complying with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal before President Trump abandoned the agreement.
"By gutting the Iran nuclear deal, one that, by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran, by gutting that, they have made the region more dangerous."
This is true. After the Iran nuclear deal was approved by the Obama administration in 2015, Congress voted to require the American president to issue regular certifications that Iran was complying with the agreement's limits on uranium enrichment and other nuclear activity. Mr. Trump twice approved such certifications, affirming findings of American intelligence agencies that Iran was in compliance. He stopped doing so in October 2017 without citing specific Iranian violations.
In May 2018, Mr. Trump abandoned the deal altogether. He made no claim that Iran was in violation but that the "horrible" agreement expired too soon, failed to limit Iran's ballistic missile program and did not constrain its foreign interventions across the Middle East. Defenders of the deal argue that it was focused narrowly on preventing Iran from acquiring a bomb within 10 to 15 years rather than fundamentally changing Iran's behavior.
Mr. Sanders said that Mr. Biden's previous support for NAFTA and normalizing trade relations with China damaged the American work force.
"And the end result of those two, just P.T.N.R. with China, Joe, and Nafta, cost us some four million jobs, as part of the race to the bottom."
This is mostly true. As we reported when this issue came up last September, while NAFTA often receives much of the blame from Democrats for the loss of American manufacturing jobs, it is P.N.T.R. -- Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China -- that economists tend to point to as the cause of more job losses.
A 2014 report from the Economic Policy Institute estimated that 851,000 jobs were lost because of the trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. The same group found that the trade deficit in goods with China cost 3.4 million jobs from 2001 to 2017.
Still, most economists say that it is difficult to pinpoint blame on specific trade relationships for jobs losses, as trade creates winners and losers across the work force and generally boosts economic growth.

Texto completo: A former adviser writes that "the image of Jimmy Carter as a weak president defies reality."
To the Editor:
In "Donald Trump Is a Hostage to 1979" (Sunday Review, Jan. 12), Stephen Metcalf argues that President Trump's decision to kill Qassim Suleimani stems from his obsession with being the anti-Jimmy Carter. But the image of Jimmy Carter as a weak president defies reality.
As a former submarine officer, Mr. Carter considered a naval blockade of Iran's ports, but his national security and military advisers were concerned that it would enhance the influence of the Soviet Union and lead to the hostages being returned in coffins.
As president he reversed the decline in post-Vietnam War defense spending. All the weapons systems that President Reagan used to help bring down the Soviet Union were greenlighted by Mr. Carter. Even his conservative critics applauded his tough response to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and his threat of military force to block any Soviet drive to the Persian Gulf.
He warned the mullahs in Tehran that any show trials or physical harm to the hostages would bring instant military retaliation. They heeded his warning.
In fact, in many ways the Carter presidency is the anti-Trump. His landmark ethics legislation passed after Watergate is more relevant today than ever before, as is his pledge to the American people that "I will never lie to you."
He championed environmental protection and human rights in his foreign policy. And his record of successfully passing almost 70 percent of his major legislation was built on bipartisan support. These are all lessons for the current administration.

Texto completo: The sudden breach between the two leading liberals in the Democratic primary race has disheartened those who fear it could provide an advantage to the party's moderate candidates.
Following Monday's acrimonious exchanges between Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the leader of one left-wing activist group summed up the sudden breach between the two liberal presidential candidates with an analogy on Twitter: "Mom and dad are fighting and all I wanna do is go to my room and put my headphones on."
For a year, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have refused to criticize each other in the 2020 race, instead directing their attacks at moderate candidates and President Trump. But on the eve of Tuesday night's Democratic debate in Des Moines, and just three weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Ms. Warren on Monday confirmed a news report that Mr. Sanders told her in a meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. Mr. Sanders strongly denied he said that.
The back-and-forth was not only the most serious schism between the two in the primary race, but it has also split supporters of the candidates -- the most vehement of whom have used the episode to rehash old fights. The controversy has also prompted activist groups who view Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren as their standard-bearers to lament a disruption that could provide an advantage to the party's moderate candidates.
Waleed Shahid of the progressive group Justice Democrats said he was "saddened" by the conflict and viewed it as a distraction from the goal of overtaking the centrist front-runner, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
"Biden remains in the lead nationally with numerous vulnerabilities that have yet to be adequately vocalized by the candidates," Mr. Shahid said.
Amid the tumult, other prominent liberal leaders have another message: Calm down and move on, and have both candidates and their supporters focus on working together to defeat the party's moderate wing.
"We have an opportunity to defeat the corporate wing of the Democratic Party, and that's where this primary should be focused," said Charles Chamberlain, who leads the left-wing group Democracy for America. "This helps no one."
There is also fear among liberals that the dispute would become a focal point of Tuesday's presidential debate -- the last one before the Feb. 3 caucuses. At previous debates, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have made a point of remaining political allies, even as some differences have emerged on issues such as health care.
In polls, the combined voter support for Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders has represented a plurality that is larger than Mr. Biden's support for months. But many on the left worry that, despite the comity that characterized much of their interactions with each other in 2019, the zero-sum nature of the primary would eventually force each camp to try to undermine the other's support at the ballot box.
The latest episode has only deepened those concerns, capping what has been weeks of growing internal tensions. Those in Ms. Warren's orbit have been frustrated by repeated attacks from the decentralized, ideologically rigid universe of Mr. Sanders's online supporters; some of them have framed Ms. Warren as inauthentic and disingenuous since she released a health care plan that differed from Mr. Sanders's "Medicare For all" vision. These attacks have included efforts that her supporters have said were sexist, including one viral tweet that made fun of Ms. Warren dancing at a recent rally in New York City.
The tension heightened on Sunday when Ms. Warren said she was "disappointed" in Mr. Sanders after reports that his campaign distributed an organizing script to volunteers instructing them to portray Ms. Warren as elite and out of touch. It continued Monday when CNN reported that Ms. Warren had told people that in a private 2018 meeting Mr. Sanders told her a woman could not win the presidency. Other news organizations, including The New York Times, soon confirmed the report.
Mr. Sanders denied the accusation, saying instead that he had told Ms. Warren that President Trump would be unforgiving in his attacks on a female candidate. Ms. Warren issued a brief statement Monday night asserting that her friend and rival had in fact told her a woman could not win.
In this instance and the one with the volunteer script, supporters of Ms. Warren said she was not the instigator of conflict.
"I don't think this is what Warren wanted to be talking about today," said Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which has endorsed Ms. Warren. "Friends don't always agree but we believe that Warren and Sanders have far more that unites them -- and not just them but their supporters. We think their supporters should focus their fire on the corporate wing of the Democratic Party."
"A Bernie-Warren battle doesn't do Bernie or Warren any good," he went on, "nor our bases, nor our movement. There is a whole corporate wing of the Democratic Party we need to defeat."
Whoever finishes ahead of the other on the night of the Iowa caucuses will seek to claim the mantle of progressive front-runner, which could have a significant impact on their path to the nomination. Liberals have quietly worried about the acrimony that could surface that evening, if the supporter base of one candidate loudly calls for the other to drop out. Other leaders, who see Mr. Sanders's and Ms. Warren's electorates as more distinct, say both candidates will be in contention through the Super Tuesday contests in March.
"This will be a long primary," Mr. Chamberlain said.
But as the events of the last few days make clear, tensions are growing. And while some dismissed Monday's war of words as a media-concocted feud, others affiliated with Mr. Sanders accused Ms. Warren's team of a cynical political move to imperil his reputation.
Early Tuesday morning, Mr. Sanders's campaign released a new television advertisement focused on his record defending women's rights. The spot, called "On Our Side," contrasts Mr. Sanders's record with Mr. Trump's. RoseAnn DeMoro, a former leader of the nurses union who is close to Mr. Sanders, said Ms. Warren was making a political play that would backfire.
"I find it unfathomable that she would believe that attacking Bernie Sanders with a lie that he essentially disrespects women -- which is just outrageous -- would pull the female support toward her," Ms. DeMoro said. "Women aren't that shallow."
"I don't believe she honestly believes at this stage in the game she can win," she said.
Senators Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, both former candidates for president who dropped out of the Democratic primary late last year, weighed in on Tuesday, releasing firm statements refuting the contention at the heart of the dispute.
"A woman can win," Ms. Gillibrand said. "Anything that suggests otherwise ignores the facts."
Ms. Harris added: "A woman can be president -- of that I am sure."

Texto completo: Readers discuss the challenges that women surgeons face in meeting the needs of two very demanding roles.
To the Editor:
Re "When the Surgeon Is a Mom" (Science Times, Dec. 31):
As a past president of the Association of Women Surgeons, I was disappointed by this article.
The vignette at the beginning portrays women surgeons who are mothers in a very negative way. The idea that "desperate mothers" take sick children to day care by giving them Tylenol to reduce their fever is unsettling. The reporter does not take into account that this woman is a physician who would be able to assess the gravity of her child's fever and make a responsible decision.
Furthermore, she is then described as not giving an operation her full attention because she is checking the clock, worried about picking up her son in time. If this is true, it is unacceptable. In the operating room, all surgeons must and do concentrate all their attention on the surgery they are performing.
This article revives outdated stereotypical ideas that women cannot be competent professionals and good mothers. My 50 years of experience with countless women surgeons has demonstrated the baselessness of that supposition. More than half of the physicians graduating from medical school are women. We must help enable them to be good doctors as well as have good family lives. They need not sacrifice the well-being of their families to live up to their responsibilities to their patients.

To the Editor:
Both my parents were highly regarded surgeons. I grew up with seven siblings. My reconstructive surgeon mother started her practice in the 1950s. The challenges she faced in launching and sustaining her career were titanic, the help, little to none. Suffice it to say that certain aspects of child rearing took a back seat.
My siblings and I raced a lot of wheelchairs around the emergency room while she sewed people back together. We saw Dad on weekends, sometimes. They did their best.
Only at the end of the article was the impact on the child mentioned. This bothered me. Without the right support for surgeons who choose to become mothers, the results can range from problematic to devastating. To say the family made sacrifices would be to put it mildly. I didn't get the eyeglasses I needed (my first-grade teacher reported that I could not see the blackboard) until I was 15 and I went to get them for myself.
I know my parents loved us. My mother was my hero. In many ways we were quite privileged. Nonetheless, the consequences of their choices had a long-term impact on my ability to find my way in life. Sometimes my parents' best wasn't very good. I count myself lucky, though. At least I did not end up homeless as one of my brothers did.
Pamela Hudson
New City, N.Y.
To the Editor:
"When the Surgeon Is a Mom" seems to suggest that the surgical profession should adapt in order to accommodate the needs of moms who also want to dedicate their time and energy to being primary caregivers to their children. I would like to voice my concern about this entitled attitude.
Being a surgeon is, and should be, a very demanding profession no matter how it is structured, as is being a primary caregiver to a child. I don't believe that women are "owed" the right to be able to be successful at two very demanding concurrent roles (both of which require being "on call") any more than men are.
It is wonderful that more women are becoming surgeons, but it is appropriate that they are subject to the same choices that everyone else must make, prioritize their time and energy, and sacrifice that which is less important to them.

Bartenders Are 'Sober Curious,' Too

Texto completo: As interest in Dry January and sobriety rises, and as social media opens up new conversations, the bar business has begun to evolve.
When Jade Golden, a bartender at 169 Bar in Manhattan's Chinatown, was in Alcoholics Anonymous, her sponsor strongly recommended that she stay out of the bar business.
"The mentality was that if you stay in the barbershop long enough, you'll end up getting a haircut," Ms. Golden said. "I don't believe that. I believe I could grow my hair to my feet standing in a barbershop. I sit down in the chair and tell somebody to cut my hair -- that's how I get a haircut."
Ms. Golden has been sober for eight years, balancing her personal life with the demands of the field in which she works. Like other sober bartenders, who have long been a presence in the industry, she isn't just hanging around the shop; she's the barber.
Interest in going dry, or drinking less, has been on the rise broadly in recent years. Semi-sobriety is no longer confined to Dry January (or Drynuary), the monthlong challenge that rose to popularity five years ago, and the "sober curious" movement is giving people who don't necessarily identify as having a drinking problem a framework for abstaining.
Within the beverage industry, low-alcohol and nonalcoholic beverages are gaining popularity. Retail sales of nonalcoholic beverages have grown by $ 3.2 billion, to $ 87.2 billion, in the last year alone, according to Danny Brager, a senior vice president at Nielsen, which tracks sales. "Abstinence -- or reduction -- of alcohol consumption has taken on a new life," he said in an email.
Nonalcoholic bars are opening in cities across the country. Venerable cocktail bars are adding booze-free drinks to their lists. And there is a growing sense among professional bartenders that their business culture may be changing, too.
In 2010, when Jack McGarry opened the Dead Rabbit in Manhattan's financial district with Sean Muldoon, stereotypical back-of-house debauchery was commonplace. "I was at the forefront of that free-for-all," Mr. McGarry said. "I would've drank during shifts, I would've drank afterward."
But Mr. McGarry, who first went sober three and a half years ago after recognizing that he had addictive tendencies, said he has noticed a heightened interest in sobriety over the past few years, and a far more open discourse. "People in the industry approach me often," seeking advice on cutting back their drinking, he said.
In late September, he went to a drink tasting after a long run on an empty stomach and got drunk, a story that he shared in an Instagram post. (To sample cocktails, Mr. McGarry dips a straw into the drink and suctions out a sip to taste, then spits it into a cup.)
The post was to hold himself accountable, he said, and to announce that day as his new sober date. One of the first comments on that post read, "But if we all gave up we'd have no industry." The commenter was a brand ambassador for a liquor company.
That reaction, Mr. McGarry believes, is emblematic of a larger problem: peers assuming, incorrectly, that he prescribes sobriety to his colleagues and employees.
"Alcohol will always be there," he said, and people will always drink it. What the industry needs isn't more sober people, necessarily, but more transparency.
Joanna Carpenter, a cocktail consultant who works primarily with liquor brands, attributes some of the changing attitudes toward sobriety in the industry to "how we communicate in the digital age, and the pervasiveness of call-out culture" -- people are now more forthcoming on social media about their own experiences, and the ways in which they feel others may have crossed lines.
Ms. Carpenter stepped away from alcohol because of her family history with addiction, going sober for six months in early 2018 and taking steps to reduce her consumption ever since. She found solidarity on a private Facebook thread with other women in the business who are sober, or semi-sober. Offline, though, safe spaces were harder to find.
"If you did not drink, you got bullied," she said. "You got questioned. You got made fun of."
One of her goals is to normalize conversations about substance abuse and mental health among bartenders. (In an industry that rarely offers insurance to employees, mental health resources are difficult to access. As Ms. Golden put it, "We don't get health insurance, but we get free drinks.")
The writer Julia Bainbridge, whose cookbook devoted to nonalcoholic drinks will be published in October, also attributes the trend toward less drinking in the industry in part to the #MeToo movement. Bad behavior in the restaurant business often goes hand in hand with the copious consumption of alcohol. (In November, The New York Times reported on allegations by four women in the wine industry, who accused a celebrated sommelier of sexually assaulting them or attempting to do so.)
Ms. Bainbridge is optimistic about the state of the industry, and has seen an uptick in sober-curiosity in her circles. "The conversations, and actions, are taking place," she said. "I see people creating best practices, hiring H.R. personnel, or otherwise trying to professionalize."
But the idea of a sober bartender still takes some bargoers by surprise. When Adrienne Oakes, a bartender at Up & Up in Greenwich Village, explains to customers that she's sober, the reaction is often respectful, but not always.
"There are some guests that are like, 'Oh, that's like a chef that doesn't eat,' " she said.
She gave up alcohol at her doctor's suggestion, but often has to lie to customers until they drop the subject. "I have to make up reasons that I don't drink," she said. "Me saying that I don't drink should be enough."
And, Ms. Oakes pointed out, she is not obligated to be anyone's drinking buddy.
"That's actually not a part of my job description," she said. "I'm supposed to give you hospitality and make you a proper cocktail and make sure you're enjoying your time in this space that we've curated. Me drinking, or not, is not a part of that experience."

Texto completo: Paris Opera Ballet performers now retire at 42 with a full pension. France, which wants to tighten retirement rules for everyone, has walked back its original proposals, but no one is happy.
PARIS -- Among the banners and placards at a demonstration in Paris on Thursday, one statement stood out: On top of what looked like a real pair of dancer's legs and a tutu, a sign read, in French: "Your retirement from ballet."
Dancers from the Paris Opera Ballet were taking part in their fourth major protest so far as part of nationwide strikes, which began in December, over a pension policy overhaul by the government of President Emmanuel Macron.
The ballet employees stood with transportation and health care workers and others to oppose a universal pension plan based on points instead of the current patchwork of 42 different retirement systems in France, many tailored to individual professions.
On Saturday, officials announced that the government would withdraw, at least temporarily, a plan that would have raised the full-benefit retirement age, now 62 for many workers, to 64 for all professions.
The Paris Opera Ballet's dancers currently stop working at 42, then receive monthly payments equal to 45 to 48 percent of their top salaries. (According to the company, an entry level dancer's gross earnings total about 35,000 euros, or $ 39,000 a year; an "étoile," or star, whose salary is negotiated privately, may make upward of €77,000, and often much more.) While retired dancers often work as teachers or ballet masters, the pension ensures a smooth professional transition. The average annual wage in France is €35,856.
Even a mandatory wait until the age of 62 would leave 20 years between a dancer's hanging up their point shoes and being able to collect a full pension, although there are temporary unemployment benefits and welfare available.
The strike will carry on, Matthias Bergmann, a union representative, said. "We remain completely opposed to this reform, which goes against our values, and will continue to do everything we can to put an end to it," he wrote in an email on Sunday.
While 42 may seem like an early age for retirement, the extreme jumps, lifts and contortions standard in classical ballet technique take a physical toll on the dancers. Alexandre Carniato, 41, a member of the company and a union representative, said professional dancers expect to endure pain and injuries comparable to those in the most demanding professional sports. "My ankle joints have been destroyed," he said. "At a certain age, it is against nature to continue dancing."
France's ministry of health has acknowledged that it is impossible for the dancers to perform until their 60s. But under the government proposal, members of the company (or at least those hired under the new legislation) would have to find alternative employment when they could no longer dance, and would receive pensions at the same age as everyone else in France.
When The New York Times sought comment from the company on the issue, the Paris Opera's director, Stéphane Lissner, declined to comment, and the director of dance, Aurélie Dupont, was on vacation.
Matthieu Botto, 32, a dancer in the company, said government officials had shown "that they know nothing about our way of functioning."
On Monday, Franck Riester, France's culture minister, tried to sell a compromise to the dancers. He restated an offer made in December that would allow current company members to retain their existing privileges; the new rules would apply only to new hires.
"In order not to penalize those who didn't foresee this change in the social contract, the idea is that we'll only count those who are hired after Jan. 1, 2022," Mr. Riester said on LCI, a French news channel.
The first time they refused that offer, the striking dancers said in a statement, "We are a small link in a chain stretching back 350 years," adding, "we cannot be the generation who sacrifices those who follow."
Opera singers, technicians and artisans are also on strike. Hours before officials said Saturday that they would amend their proposal, the Paris Opera announced that the evening's performance of Rossini's "The Barber of Seville" -- the return of the opera season after a holiday break -- would be canceled (the opera website warned that the next performance, on Tuesday, might also be affected). The next ballet is "Giselle," scheduled to open on Jan. 31.
While the Paris ballet receives generous government funding for its dancers' pensions, not every company in France does. Mr. Riester has noted that regional ballet troupes, which lack the pension resources of the Paris Opera, find local employment for dancers who retire.
But Sandrine Deshaie, a former dancer in the Ballet Nice Méditerranée, said she had been offered no such alternative. After 17 years of working on short-term contracts, she said, she was "left to my own devices to find employment."
She added, "When there were problems at regional companies, Paris Opera Ballet dancers knew about our precarity and did nothing to show solidarity."
"Social rights are great," she added. "At the same time, financial problems are proving themselves to be real right now in France."
Mr. Macron's reforms aimed to standardize an array of pension rights negotiated by France's unions, which have been a strong force in the country's politics since the 1930s. But the Paris Opera's superannuation fund is much older: Retirement privileges for dancers have existed since 1698.
"The pension comes from Louis XIV's era, when dance was revered as one of the most important cultural assets," said Benjamin Millepied, a former director of dance of the Paris Opera. "It's a wonderful tradition from a time when culture held that kind of place in society."
Since the Paris Opera's inception in the 17th century, its ballet dancers have been considered representatives of the state. "The Paris Opera Ballet is presented first and foremost at the most important diplomatic occasions," said Philippe Gerbet, a former dancer with the company who is on the committee overseeing its pensions. "The corps de ballet represents France through the world."
According to a 2011 study commissioned by the International Federation of Actors, long-term contracts followed by lifelong pensions were the norm in Europe's national ballet companies until recent decades. This kind of security is no longer common. "Even in countries where there is still such a pension scheme in place, there is an increasing reluctance to extend it to new dancers, who are often employed on short-term contracts," the study says.
Christine Thomassen, a former principal dancer of the Norwegian National Ballet and vice president of the union representing that company's dancers, said members reached out to Paris Opera Ballet colleagues to express support for the cause.
"Dancers are extremely passionate about their art form and audience," she said in a telephone interview. "If the dancers at the Paris Opera have been on strike for over a month, it is because this is actually very serious -- both for them as individual workers and for the future of the art form."
A reform of the pension system in the Norwegian National Ballet is looming, Ms. Thomassen said, and her union is watching developments in Paris closely.
In the United States, the European model of state-funded ballet was "looked to as a dream or a fantasy," said Griff Braun, an official at the American Guild of Musical Artists, a labor union. Mr. Braun said that even in top companies, most dancers are offered yearlong renewable contracts. American dancers generally have access to retirement savings plans, but nothing that resembles the Paris pension benefit.
"You tend to hear about those who make spectacular transitions, and become doctors and lawyers as second careers," Mr. Braun said. "But those are the exceptions."
The Paris Opera's striking dancers say that eliminating the pension would reshape the company and destroy elements of its celebrated style. For example, the generous provisions encourage retention, which allows the members of the corps de ballet, or ensemble, to develop unparalleled uniformity of movement, down to the angles of their wrists and fingers.
"Without the pension, dancers trained at the Paris Opera School of Dance will move elsewhere for better compensation," Mr. Carniato, the dancer and union official, said.
Mr. Millepied said that the company's long history created an atmosphere in which change was resisted. "The Paris Opera Ballet is very respectful of traditions, but then there's the question of how to take those traditions forward," he said.
He said, however, it's "impossible for me to be against these dancers wanting to save their pension." He added, "During this difficult time for the arts, it is exactly the kind of thing we should be saving."

Texto completo: When it comes to the Democratic presidential primary candidates, President Trump is worried about Mike Bloomberg while his campaign sees an opportunity in Bernie Sanders.
President Trump's advisers see Senator Bernie Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and have been doing what they can to elevate his profile and bolster his chances of winning the Iowa caucuses, according to Republicans familiar with the plans.
But their new focus on Mr. Sanders, independent of Vermont, comes at a time the president himself has been closely watching Michael R. Bloomberg, a late arrival to the Democratic primary race, unnerved by his campaign spending and his suggestion he might spend $ 1 billion of his own fortune on opposing Mr. Trump, even if he does not emerge as the nominee.
It has left the president and his campaign focused on two different candidates in the weeks before Democrats cast their first votes in Iowa -- one, a populist running with a grass-roots movement behind him, and the other, a liberal billionaire who could refashion the general election because of his bottomless bank account.
Neither is the national front-runner, but Mr. Sanders is believed to have gained significant ground in Iowa, and both are on the minds of the president and his team.
Most of Mr. Trump's advisers see his biggest looming threat as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has maintained a steady level of support despite an onslaught of attacks from the president and his team. But there is often a divide between how Mr. Trump and his aides view opponents.
Over the past few weeks, aides to the president in a series of conversations have discussed how to keep the focus on Mr. Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist who favors a significant expansion of government health programs and who is currently at the top of some Iowa polls. They see attacking him as a way to excite his base and draw attention away from other Democrats.
Such efforts tend to be haphazard and revolve around Mr. Trump's comments at rallies and on his Twitter feed, as does much of the messaging of his campaign. The president, his advisers say, has been in need of a clear target for months, and he believes he is actually hurting Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Trump's advisers do not necessarily share that view. But they find utility in trying to elevate Mr. Sanders, and aides are discussing ways to keep attention on Mr. Sanders in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.
"Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party," Mr. Trump posted Sunday on Twitter, after a Des Moines Register poll showed Mr. Sanders leading in the state. "So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!"
"It means you're going to lose," Mr. Sanders tweeted in response.
At a rally last week in Toledo, Ohio, the president singled out Mr. Sanders for his criticism of Mr. Trump's Jan. 3 drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani at Baghdad International Airport.
"Bernie is going up," Mr. Trump said. "He's surging. Crazy Bernie is surging."
Most of the president's advisers see Mr. Sanders, if he were to become the nominee, as helping to solve Mr. Trump's problem with suburban voters in states like Virginia, where the 2018 midterm elections showed that moderate and independent voters have recoiled from the president's behavior, controversies or policy positions.
But some have concerns that Mr. Sanders might be more durable in the Rust Belt states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, with high concentrations of white working-class voters that emerged as trouble spots for the president in the 2018 elections.
The advisers say that in their voter research Mr. Sanders registers with his own supporters as authentic -- the same quality that Mr. Trump's base ascribed to the president in 2016. They view Mr. Sanders as a more difficult opponent than Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, but less of a challenge than Mr. Biden.
And Mr. Trump's advisers are discussing rolling out policies to counter Mr. Sanders's populist appeal.
In recent days, Mr. Trump's team has been interested in focusing attention on Mr. Sanders's comments after the strike that killed the General Suleimani, arguing that he will appear too dovish for the general electorate.
"We have no preference in potential opponents because President Trump will beat any one of them handily," Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a statement. "However, over the last two weeks Bernie Sanders has proved himself to be dangerous -- not as an opponent but as a potential president -- by excusing and appeasing Iran's aggression and belligerence."
"Bernie Sanders would not protect American interests as president and his weakness is something that begs to be highlighted," he added.
Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, pointed out that Mr. Trump ran as the candidate who "would stop the endless wars" and is now attacking the senator as weak. He added of Mr. Trump's efforts to tar Mr. Sanders: "There's no 'there' there."
As for Mr. Bloomberg, the president has made clear he is aware of the money Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, is pouring into the race -- especially into the attack ads hitting him in 118 media markets across the country. And this week he responded on Twitter to a TV spot focused on the top issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterms: health care.
"Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising," Mr. Trump tweeted, going on to misrepresent his role in the health care debate. "I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual Mandate."
Bloomberg aides noted that the ads highlight a core weakness for Mr. Trump, one that he seemed cognizant of defending himself over.
"My view from watching the president's tweets is that he is clearly seeing our ads, he's clearly concerned about their impact," said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. "It's a massive television buy that is nationwide, attacking his biggest vulnerability and contrasting his failed record on health care."
Mr. Bloomberg spent over $ 100 million in 2018 through his super PAC, involving himself in two dozen races across the country, and that has made him and his team confident they have identified his weaknesses.
"We amassed an enormous amount of data about what works in terms of identifying targeting the president's vulnerabilities," Mr. Wolfson said.
But the Trump campaign has waved away concerns about Mr. Bloomberg's spending, arguing that it will only encourage Republican megadonors like Sheldon G. Adelson to spend more money for Mr. Trump.
Despite Mr. Trump's own history of upending expectations of which candidates succeed, his aides insist they do not view Mr. Bloomberg as a serious contender for his party's nomination, and they believe that the power of his money is limited, noting that Mr. Bloomberg's aides would be legally prohibited from direct coordination with the Democratic nominee's campaign, unlike the national party committees.
"Hillary Clinton said she 'inherited nothing' from the D.N.C., which is as broke today as it was when she lost," said Mike Reed, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. "Growing a $ 300 million data-driven field operation like we have at the R.N.C. takes years. Liberal billionaires can spend as much outside money as they want, but the eventual nominee cannot coordinate with anything they build."
Campaign finance experts, however, said the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee were underestimating the effect of Mr. Bloomberg's cash infusion into the race and that Mr. Trump was right to be concerned.
"If Bloomberg does this, it will be unprecedented in American history," said Fred Wertheimer, the founder and president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit watchdog group. "They will probably have more organizers than the R.N.C. will have. They will have loads of people in the battleground states, they'll have TV ads, they'll have digital ads."
"It will neutralize any financial advantages he thought he had," Mr. Wertheimer said, referring to the president, "and if they're not worried, they're kidding themselves."
Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, agreed that Mr. Bloomberg should not be dismissed.
"By any traditional measure, it's a pipe dream, but if we learned anything in 2016 it's that just because something has never happened before doesn't mean it can't happen now," he said. "No one has ever talked about spending remotely as much money as he's talking about spending on this race."

Plan to Cut U.S. Troops In West Africa Is Criticized

Texto completo: French officials said that a Pentagon proposal to relocate troops as it focuses on China and Russia could hinder the fight against extremists.
BRUSSELS -- A Pentagon proposal to greatly reduce American forces in West Africa faced criticism from allies on Tuesday, with French officials arguing that removing United States intelligence assets in the region could stymie the fight against extremist groups.
American officials said they were proceeding nonetheless.
While no final decision has been made on how many troops will be transferred from Africa and the Middle East as the Pentagon refocuses its priorities to confront "great powers" like Russia and China, America's top military officer said the United States needed to shift its forces to better counter China in particular.
Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged that the proposal was "causing some anxiety." But he said that the United States needed to seriously re-examine its military footprint in Africa, and the Middle East and Latin America after that, given the heightened focus on China.
General Milley's comments came ahead of a NATO military chiefs' meeting in Brussels, where he also sought to lay out the United States' rationale for killing Iran's top military commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani this month. The killing of General Suleimani, who was the head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps' Quds Force, has raised questions from America's military allies about whether commanders of sovereign countries are now fair game for drone strikes.
The Pentagon is also asking Europe to do more in the Middle East. After the killing of General Suleimani, Mr. Trump called for NATO to step up efforts to train Iraqi forces to fight the Islamic State in their country -- a point that General Milley elaborated on at the NATO meeting on Tuesday.
One way European allies could help in Iraq, he said, was to provide ballistic missile defense systems at bases that house troops from the American-led coalition that has been fighting the Islamic State. Iran fired several ballistic missiles at two such bases in Iraq last week, though no one was killed.
In Africa, the Trump administration wants European allies, particularly the French, to pick up a bigger share of the battle against extremist Islamist organizations like the Islamic State, Al Qaeda in the Maghreb and Boko Haram.
The Pentagon's discussions of a large-scale pullback from West Africa include abandoning a recently built $ 110 million drone base in Niger and ending assistance to French forces battling militants in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.
President Emmanuel Macron of France, in his own meeting with leaders of five West and Central African nations on Monday, pledged to send a further 220 French troops to the region, supplementing the 4,500 who are already there. Mr. Macron had called the meeting in an effort to persuade the African leaders to make clear publicly that they wanted the French forces to remain.
With the Pentagon expected to make its initial decision about Africa this month, the United States' plans have already drawn criticism from lawmakers, allies and military officials, and could eventually affect most global missions. About 200,000 United States forces are stationed abroad, a similar number to when President Trump took office with a promise to conclude the nation's "endless wars."
Responding to General Milley's comments on Monday, an aide to Mr. Macron told the news agency Agence France-Presse that American contributions to the fight against Islamic extremist groups in West Africa were "irreplaceable."
General Milley said that no final decision had been made, and that the Pentagon was reviewing American force posture all over the world. (United States military officials said that Africa was first because it begins with "A.")
The Pentagon says that the overhaul of African deployments will be followed by one in Latin America and that drawdowns will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan, as it has outlined in recent months.
But the killing of General Suleimani, which has sharply exacerbated tensions between Washington and Tehran, could undermine the Pentagon's plans. Since that killing, it has sent thousands of additional troops to the region to protect against possible strikes from Iran.

Texto completo: Thursday: The scale is different, but the parallels are undeniable. Also: Gov. Gavin Newsom's big homelessness plan, and one of "52 Places."
Good morning.
(Here's the sign-up , if you don't already get California Today delivered to your inbox.)
Today, we have a special dispatch from my colleague Thomas Fuller , who has covered deadly wildfires in California for years. Now, he's in Australia, reporting on the devastating fires there:
Driving along the southeastern Australian coast, past homes razed by fire and beside blackened forests shrouded in a milky white haze, my thoughts often drift back to California.
As the San Francisco bureau chief, I've covered the Wine Country fires of 2017, the devastation of Paradise in 2018 and the Kincade fire a few months ago. Last week I flew from San Francisco to Sydney to help report on the fires that have burned more than 15 million acres in Australia -- an area seven times larger than what burned in California in 2018, which was the most destructive year on record in the Golden State.
[Read more about Californians who have fled fire after fire .]
Yet despite the difference in scale I've seen countless parallels with California.
There's a shared feeling of helplessness, a destabilizing fear of not being able to control the vast hinterland. And a dazed recognition of the awesome power of wildfires. The aluminum wheels of cars melted into miniature rivers here, just as they have in California, a testament to the fires' ferocious intensity.
In the small town of Mogo, Andrew Graham stood in his backyard inspecting the ruins of his home. It had been a sturdy cinder-block structure, but the fire was so fierce it shattered the walls as if it were a missile. The glass from Mr. Graham's windows appeared to have vaporized, leaving only a few curved pieces that could have been mistaken for sea glass collected from the beach.
[Read more about Mogo here.]
Mr. Graham and his wife had moved into their home on Christmas Eve. A week later, on New Year's Eve, the firestorm came.
"I have two sets of clothes and that's it," he said. "I lost everything."
Just as in California, many Australians have moved from cities into more affordable rural areas in recent years. Now Australia, like California, is counting the costs of communities pushing into the fire-prone wilderness.
Firefighters in Australia have similar observations about the infernos they are seeing. Fires are more intense than in the past; they move more quickly, even at night. And just as in the United States there are acrimonious debates between left and right over the role of climate change in creating these conditions.
There seems to be a recognition on both sides of the Pacific that the fires are seminal events that will change the relationship between man and nature and will upend assumptions about the protections and conveniences of modern life.
[Here's more about efforts to save Australia's wildlife .]
The fires in Australia cut power to many areas, and the hardware shops that remained open sold out of generators. Some shops accepted only cash because their electronic payments system went off-line. And the authorities warned residents to boil tap water before drinking it. Just as in California, the fires seemed to be dragging a modern society backward.
Australians, like Americans, have a tradition of can-do optimism. It's now being tested, but I've been impressed with the emotional resilience I've seen both in California and Australia.
In the seaside town of Canjola Park, three hours south of Sydney, I met Maree Fletcher scouring the wreckage of her home for anything she could salvage.
She, her son and her two dogs survived the New Year's Eve firestorm by wading into the ocean.
Bulldozers would come soon to flatten the rubble of Ms. Fletcher's home, and there was very little she could find to recover. Yet she was remarkably calm.
"As long as I've got my family everything else is irrelevant," she said.

And Finally ...
A while ago, I made a reference in this newsletter to California's wine region. A reader emailed to note that's imprecise: The Golden State, in all its bounty, has more than one.
Today, The Times introduced the 2020 installation of our "52 Places" feature, and one of those wine regions -- not Napa Valley -- was the only California destination on this year's list.
The Paso Robles area, the piece notes, has more than 300 wineries, a massive light art installation and new restaurants.
But Californians know -- and as evidenced by the hourslong wait at every restaurant we tried in town before a concert at Vina Robles Amphitheatre last year -- it's hardly undiscovered territory.
So here's my additional, totally unsolicited Paso Robles travel tip: Make reservations.

Texto completo: The production, "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove" by Jane Chambers, is backed by producers including Ellen DeGeneres and Lily Tomlin.
Cynthia Nixon is set to direct a Broadway production of "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove," Jane Chambers's groundbreaking play that debuted Off Broadway in 1980. Ellen DeGeneres, Lily Tomlin, Harriet Newman Leve, Portia de Rossi and Jane Wagner will produce.
The story follows several gay women who are enjoying their usual summer vacation at the fictional seaside town of Bluefish Cove. A straight woman unexpectedly joins them after leaving her husband, unaware of what she has stepped into.
After its debut, the play was lauded for its well-rounded representation of gay women at a time when they were absent from mainstream theater productions. (The New York Times contributor Elisabeth Vincentelli has argued that stories of lesbians still struggle to make it to Broadway.)
"None of the women in this play apologize for being lesbians," Chambers said in an interview with The Times in 1981. "They accept it and go on to lead productive lives. I don't know why that should be a threat to people."
The play will open later this year. The cast, creative team and theater have yet to be announced.

Texto completo: Popular dating services like Grindr, OkCupid and Tinder are spreading user information like dating choices and precise location to advertising and marketing companies in ways that may violate privacy laws, according to a new report that examined some of the world's most downloaded Android apps.
Grindr, the world's most popular gay dating app, transmitted user-tracking codes and the app's name to more than a dozen companies, essentially tagging individuals with their sexual orientation, according to the report, which was released Tuesday by the Norwegian Consumer Council, a government-funded nonprofit organization in Oslo.
Grindr also sent a user's location to multiple companies, which may then share that data with many other businesses, the report said. When The New York Times tested Grindr's Android app, it shared precise latitude and longitude information with five companies.
The researchers also reported that the OkCupid app sent a user's ethnicity and answers to personal profile questions - like "Have you used psychedelic drugs?" - to a firm that helps companies tailor marketing messages to users. The Times found that the OkCupid site had recently posted a list of more than 300 advertising and analytics "partners" with which it may share users' information.
"Any consumer with an average number of apps on their phone - anywhere between 40 and 80 apps - will have their data shared with hundreds or perhaps thousands of actors online," said Finn Myrstad, the digital policy director for the Norwegian Consumer Council, who oversaw the report.
The report, "Out of Control: How Consumers Are Exploited by the Online Advertising Industry," adds to a growing body of research exposing a vast ecosystem of companies that freely track hundreds of millions of people and peddle their personal information. This surveillance system enables scores of businesses, whose names are unknown to many consumers, to quietly profile individuals, target them with ads and try to sway their behavior.
The report appears two weeks after California enacted a broad new consumer privacy law. Among other things, the law requires many companies that trade consumers' personal details for money or other compensation to allow people to easily stop the spread of their information.
In addition, regulators in the European Union are stepping up enforcement of their own data protection law, which prohibits companies from collecting personal information without a person's explicit consent.
The Norwegian group said it planned to file complaints Tuesday asking regulators in Oslo to investigate Grindr and five ad tech companies for possible violations of the European data protection law. A coalition of consumer groups in the U.S. said it was also sending letters to American regulators, urging them to investigate whether the companies' practices violated federal and state laws.

Texto completo: Australian-American Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley grew up with bushfires, but not of the magnitude seen on the continent in recent weeks. According to the New York Times, 25 million acres have burned, more than a billion animals have perished and at least 24 people have died.
Buckley is helping to organize a fundraiser at Fado Irish Pub on Jan. 25 at 1 p.m. to benefit the Australian Red Cross and WIRES, the New South Wales Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service Inc., which rescues and rehabilitates wildlife.
WIRES describes a bit of what they're facing on the ground on their website, in calling for donations to its emergency fund. "With species such as koalas and grey-headed flying-foxes already listed as vulnerable to extinction, the additional loss of life caused by emergencies like the fires and drought is even more devastating."
Buckley says the fires show the need to act on climate change policy immediately, and that resilience to climate change will mean adapting in different ways in different places.
"In Australia it means drought, in Annapolis it means flooding, in Ellicott City it means flash flooding," he said. "We've been asleep at the wheel when it comes to the environment."
He said meat pies and stuffed sausages, typical Australian fare, will be available at the event. The event will be held one day before Australia Day, Jan. 26, which celebrates the arrival of the first British Fleet at Sydney Cove. It is also referred to by some Australians, including indigenous Australians, as Survival Day, the Day of Mourning or Invasion Day.
On Jan. 20, Mission Escape Room locations including Arundel Mills will donate 100% of sales from the day to WIRES and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. A post on the businesses social media promoting the fundraiser says to book online using the code AUS100.

Texto completo: Groups sue to block a federal agency's decision to open up 1 million acres of public land for oil drilling and fracking. A group of homeless women illegally occupying an Oakland home to bring attention to the plight of homelessness are evicted at dawn. And the world pitches in to save ancient trees.
It's Arlene Martínez, handpicking the best stories on this very newsy Tuesday.
But first, a jet preparing for an emergency landing dumped fuel over several schools in Los Angeles, injuring 44 students and staff.

Groups organize to block federal fracking plan
A coalition of conservation organizations filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management on Tuesday, challenging a plan by the agency to open more than 1 million acres of public lands in the Central Valley and Central Coast to new oil drilling and fracking permits.
The lawsuit — filed in U. S. District Court in Los Angeles by the Center for Biological Diversity, EarthJustice, National Parks Conservation Association, The Sierra Club, Patagonia and others — alleges that the Trump administration failed to adequately consider how the plan could harm public health and recreation in the region or if it increases the threat of earthquakes.
Opening up the land would "accelerate the climate crisis, and Ventura County already ranks as the fastest-warming county in the continental U. S. ," Robert Tadlock, associate general counsel at Patagonia, said in a statement.
No new oil and gas leases have been sold in California since 2012, when a judge ruled the BLM had failed to properly assess the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), which uses high-pressure injections of fluids, toxic chemicals and sand to extract natural gas from wells.
Use of the technique is on the rise, despite several studies that link fracking to negative impacts on air and water quality. It's also credited with creating jobs and making the country less dependent on OPEC oil.
Voting, shopping and working in CA
Going into Tuesday's debate, Californians preferred Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a new poll showed.
Express clothing retailer is closing another store. This one's in Visalia and is next to Forever 21, which announced last fall it's shuttering up to 178 U. S. stores.
Translators and interpreters, who are overwhelmingly comprised of women and immigrants, are losing big under California's new gig law (OPINION).
Sheriff's deputies evict Moms 4 Housing
As winter approached, a group of Oakland mothers grew desperate. Rent was too high, commutes to their jobs were long and they needed a place where their children could stay warm.
They found refuge in a vacant three-bedroom, one-bathroom, 1,400-square-foot home that had been bought at auction earlier in the year by an out-of-town real estate firm. The women, known by the group they since founded, Moms 4 Housing, claimed they were exercising their human right to shelter. The real estate company said they were illegal squatters and asked city officials to remove them.
A months-long standoff that has come to encapsulate the region's growing affordable crisis came to a head Tuesday when law enforcement used a battering ram to enter the property and force the protesters out.
What else we're talking about
The remains of a man who went for one last hike at Joshua Tree National Park in July 2018 have been identified as a Canadian outdoors enthusiast who had been vacationing with his wife.
Days after being sworn in as San Francisco's district attorney, Chesa Boudin fired seven prosecutors and hired four new attorneys, including two from the public defender's office.
Who's Boudin again? He's part of a group of "progressive prosecutors," so-called because of platforms that include eliminating cash bail, looking closely at police conduct and in general hoping to overhaul a system that disproportionately punishes poor people and minorities.
It isn't wildfires driving up the cost of fire protection in California, it's union-mandated staffing requirements and the way overtime is unnecessarily built into scheduling (OPINION).
Different versions of the past for Calif. , Texas students
Students educated in California may learn that white flight to the suburbs in the 1950s existed to escape living among minorities and that African Americans were excluded from even buying homes there because of racist lending and selling practices.
Students in Texas may learn that people went to the suburbs to escape crime and congestion.
The two states use in some cases textbooks produced by the same publisher and the same authors. But there are stark differences between what and how two states choose to include, which works to shape the next generation of voters, leaders and activists. The New York Times took a deep look at differences between the two and why it matters.
In Tuesday's California Today (the Times' Golden State newsletter), find out how NYT reporter Dana Goldstein got onto this story and what may come next.
Here's how some readers have responded to the story.
The world pitches in to save the redwoods
Donations arrived from all 50 states and 31 countries to secure the future of the largest private grove of giant sequoia in the mountains of Tulare County. The former ski resort and hotel will eventually be gifted to the Giant Sequoia National Monument to keep its ancient residents around in perpetuity.
Buoyed by the help of 10,000 people, Save the Redwoods League raised nearly $16 million to buy the 530-acre property that includes ancient trees as old as 3,000 years. Nearly half of the donations arrived in just four months.
"This is a truly magical place, and it comes at a time when people needed some good news — something that protects the beauty of the world," said Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League.
With the Alder Creek acquisition, 98% of California’s giant sequoia groves are now protected under public, tribal or Redwood League ownership.

Texto completo: This had to be one of the most successful failures " one of the most triumphant defeats " in modern political history.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) clearly failed in the stated aim of her four-week delay in sending impeachment articles to the Senate: to withhold the articles and the naming of impeachment managers until, as she put it last month, 'we see the process that is set forth in the Senate.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) didn't reveal his impeachment resolution and made no commitment to bring forth witnesses or documents.
But Pelosi's delay seems to have blunted any hope President Trump's defenders had of dismissing the charges without a trial. Before the speaker's gambit, McConnell pledged that 'there will be no difference between the president's position and our position as to how to handle this.' Trump is now calling for a dismissal, but Senate Republicans say they won't allow that.
Credit the delay. Public attention to the dispute and to former Trump national security adviser John Bolton's willingness to testify make it more difficult for Republicans to dismiss the charges. It also left time for investigators to obtain notes and phone records of indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas; released in part Tuesday night, they show, among other things, that people working with Giuliani apparently had Marie Yovanovitch, then the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, under surveillance.
The biggest benefit of the 28-day delay, though, could not have been predicted when Pelosi sent the nation on this path. Many of the behaviors that got Trump impeached have returned in other guises for all to see:
l He took the nation to the verge of war with Iran based on a lie: that his assassination of a top Iranian general was justified by an 'imminent' threat, specifically a planned attack against four U.S. embassies. When the world learned that Trump had fabricated it, he claimed 'it doesn't really matter' whether there is an imminent threat before he engages in hostilities " an assault on congressional authority to declare war.
l He is simultaneously preparing to assault congressional power of the purse. As The Post's Nick Miroff reported, Trump plans to divert an extra $7.2 billion for a border wall " five times the amount Congress authorized " by siphoning money away from military construction and counternarcotics efforts.
l Trump has also refused to release $18 billion of congressionally approved disaster aid for Puerto Rico, which just suffered a 6.4-magnitude earthquake on top of the lingering effects from Hurricane Maria in 2017. Other (whiter) U.S. citizens got better treatment following natural disasters.
l Trump's 2016 political benefactor, Russia, has been caught interfering in the 2020 election to help Trump. Russia's military spy agency, the GRU, hacked Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden served and that was at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. Trump tried to force Ukraine to give him politically helpful dirt on the Bidens " and now Russia appears ready to oblige.
After the past four weeks, Senate Republicans will have a more difficult time disregarding the consequences of excusing Trump's wrongdoing. They're knowingly blessing his claims of unilateral power to make war and spend taxpayer dollars and leaving him in a position to owe reelection to the same man who helped him win a first term: Vladimir Putin.
Pelosi announced her official surrender in the Capitol basement Tuesday morning, telling House Democrats the impeachment managers would be named Wednesday and the articles sent. During a news conference after the meeting, Sheryl Gay Stolberg of the New York Times pointed out that Pelosi failed to get McConnell's commitments. 'So what's changed?'
The Democratic caucus chairman, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), argued that the stall 'created space' for three Republican senators " Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Mitt Romney (Utah) " to support witness testimony. Only one more Republican vote is needed to hear from witnesses such as Bolton.
Will vulnerable Republicans still try to quash testimony about Trump withholding Ukrainian aid for political dirt " even now that Russia has violated Ukrainian sovereignty to steal precisely the sort of dirt Trump sought? Jeffries suggested blocking testimony would look like 'a coverup' by 'Moscow Mitch and the Senate Republicans.'
Nearby, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) held a news conference declaring Pelosi's delay a dud: 'No one questions about what she gained, it was nothing.'
McCarthy went on to claim that Pelosi withheld the articles to help Joe Biden defeat Bernie Sanders " renewing a Democratic conspiracy from 2016, he alleged, when 'emails came out to show that . . . Sanders was cheated.'
Emails came out? Incredibly, McCarthy was citing emails stolen by Putin when the Democratic National Committee was hacked by the GRU " the same Russian military outfit that just hacked Burisma.
Add that to the many benefits of Pelosi's delay: exposing the utter perfidy of McCarthy, relying on Russians' 2016 dirty work on Trump's behalf even as those same spies were just caught trying to help Trump in 2020.
Surely a few Senate Republicans, now in the spotlight, will feel pressure to show more integrity.

Amazon Publishes Books by Top Authors, and Rivals Fret; Dean Koontz, Patricia Cornwell are among the blue-chip writers whose books the tech giant is not just selling but publishing

Texto completo: Dean Koontz's first novel for Amazon is expected to publish March 31. PHOTO: Annie Tritt for The Wall Street Journal
When Dean Koontz's book contract expired last year, his stature as one of the country's top-selling authors made him a hot target for several major publishing houses. He chose Amazon.com Inc.
It was a surprising move because it means his new books likely won't appear in retail stores, which generally boycott Amazon-published titles. But Mr. Koontz is banking on Amazon's vast retail machine to get his work to readers, whether in physical or digital formats.
"Maybe I won't be in some stores or make the New York Times best-seller list, but I'm willing to take that risk and I think we'll sell more books in all formats," Mr. Koontz said.
Amazon dominates the U.S. book-retail market—accounting for over half of all new books sold in October, according to research firm Codex Group—but it is also a force as a book publisher . Signing up blue-chip authors like Mr. Koontz could make the tech giant an even more formidable threat to the traditional industry, led by publishing houses such as Penguin Random House, which is controlled by Germany's Bertelsmann SE, ViacomCBS Inc.'s Simon & Schuster and HarperCollins Publishers, which is owned by Wall Street Journal parent News Corp.
Mr. Koontz's first novel for Amazon is expected to publish March 31. He already has published a collection of short stories, "Nameless," that generated over a million downloads in the first month after its debut last November. The stories are available only as e-books and audiobooks.
Mr. Koontz, whose over 100 books include hits like "Odd Thomas" and "Watchers," isn't the only high-profile writer Amazon Publishing has snared. In 2018, Patricia Cornwell signed a two-book deal; the first novel, "Quantum," was published last October and enjoyed brisk downloads despite poor reviews. Both Mr. Koontz and Ms. Cornwell are in the top 25 of all currently published U.S. adult fiction writers, as measured by the size of their most dedicated fan bases, according to consumer surveys by Codex.
Amazon Publishing already has 16 imprints in the U.S. churning out titles from thrillers to romance novels. Rival publishers expect competition for top talent to heat up further, now that Amazon's initial big-name signings have proved encouraging.
The fact Amazon is both a book publisher and the dominant book retailer is unlikely, on its own, to raise antitrust issues, said several legal and media experts. Current antitrust laws are meant to increase consumer welfare, so Amazon's low prices act as a shield.
"When prices are low for the customer, that improves consumer welfare even if it puts out of business people who are charging more," said Gregory Arenson, an antitrust lawyer and partner at Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.
Mr. Arenson said Amazon might be in violation of antitrust laws, however, if it is using its platform to provide an advantage to books it publishes that it doesn't provide to other book publishers.
"Amazon offers all publishers a variety of marketing programs, including adding titles to subscription programs like Kindle Unlimited, Amazon First Reads, and Prime Reading," a spokeswoman for the company said.
Amazon can promise writers a big paycheck, agents say, and a powerful e-commerce platform and marketing tools to promote sales of their work. That is an appealing package, including to established authors who have had declining sales but still believe their best days are ahead.
"Quantum" sold only 6,000 hardcover copies through Nov. 23, according to NPD BookScan, a unit of NPD Group Inc. A spokeswoman for Amazon Publishing says the book has "reached approximately 600,000 readers across print, audio, and digital sales and downloads."
Even when premier writers remain under contract elsewhere for their novels, Amazon can develop ties with them on other projects such as exclusive short works, and eye a larger deal down the road.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Have changes in the book-retail market affected your ability to find your favorite authors? How? Join the conversation below.
"They are playing a long game with a lot of authors, and yes, it worries me," said a senior executive at one of the largest publishing companies.
Amazon isn't "aggressively hunting big-name authors," said Jeff Belle, vice president of Amazon Publishing. But it is cultivating relationships with writers, he said, and is willing to "write checks for great content."
The downside for high-profile authors of tying up with Amazon is that Barnes & Noble Inc. and independent booksellers shun Amazon's books. It is possible Barnes & Noble could change its approach under the new management team that took over after hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. acquired the retailer last summer.
"I am surprised that there is an overt policy at Barnes & Noble to boycott and generally would not personally be in favor of this," James Daunt, the bookseller's chief executive, said last month.
For Mr. Koontz—who has sold more than 500 million books world-wide—the opportunity to reach new readers through Amazon's extensive promotions was too good to ignore, he said.
"We had seven or eight offers, but Amazon offered the most complete marketing plan, and that was the deciding factor," said Mr. Koontz, who is 74.
The pact Mr. Koontz signed last spring with Amazon Publishing's Thomas & Mercer imprint ended his long relationship with Bantam Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House, the world's largest consumer book publisher. A spokeswoman for Bantam Books, which has published more than 50 of his works, declined to comment.
The six "Nameless" short stories, which feature a vigilante who suffers from amnesia and doesn't have any fingerprints, sell for $1.99 each. Subscribers to the Amazon Kindle Unlimited service can access them as part of their membership, as can Amazon Prime users.
Mr. Koontz says another reason he signed with Amazon Publishing is because he enjoyed close ties with audiobook publisher Brilliance Audio even before it was acquired by Amazon in 2007.
Mr. Koontz's success with Brilliance Audio caught the eye of Julia Sommerfeld, editorial director of the Amazon imprint Amazon Original Stories, who suggested working together. The novella that followed, "Ricochet Joe," was published in December 2017 exclusively as an Amazon e-book and audiobook.
"There was no paperback, no hardcover, but hundreds of thousands of people read it with their e-readers, and he was well compensated," said Richard Pine, his literary agent.
The ability to reach new potential readers was also a key attraction for Ms. Cornwell, best known for her novels featuring fictional medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Ms. Cornwell signed a two-book contract with Amazon's Thomas & Mercer imprint in 2018. Her most recent Kay Scarpetta novels had been published by HarperCollins Publishers.
"She's not scared of shaking it up," said Ms. Cornwell's agent, Jeremy Barber, a partner at United Talent Agency LLC. "She believed she'd be able to access new and different readers via this platform." HarperCollins Publishers declined to comment.
Ms. Cornwell's "Quantum," the first in a new series featuring Captain Calli Chase, a NASA pilot, scientist and expert in cybercrime investigations, disappointed many readers, with 35% of the reviewers on Amazon.com giving it one star.
The author said she is undeterred. "I'm building a new audience, and yes, I'm getting kicked around in reviews, but I know what I'm doing," she said.
Ms. Cornwell didn't anticipate the emotional impact of not seeing her new novel in bookstores. "It's depressing when you don't see your book anywhere," she said. "It's not fair, and it's not right."
Ms. Cornwell is working on a sequel titled "Spin" expected to publish this year.

Ai Weiwei Explains Why He Was Sued by a Casino Worker in ‘New York Times’ Op-Ed

Texto completo: After spending four years under house arrest in China, the dissident artist Ai Weiwei moved to Berlin in 2015, and from his chosen country of residence has continued to criticize the Chinese government and speak out against numerous means of oppression. Prominently, he’s also gotten deeply involved in documenting the Hong Kong protests. However, Berlin has not proven to be an urban paradise for Weiwei: last August, the artist told the German daily Welt that Germany “is a society that wants to be open, but above all it protects itself,” while also adding that he’d personally experienced discrimination from taxi drivers and disinterested authority figures since moving there. On Monday, in a new op-ed for the New York Times , Weiwei expounded upon his feelings about prejudice, xenophobia and ‘cultural differences’ in Germany, China and the entire Western world.
Specifically, Weiwei recounts an incident that resulted in him being sued by a casino worker he had a run-in with in Germany. After a round of cards at the Berlin Casino in Potsdamer Platz, Weiwei writes that he approached a cashier’s window to get his gambling chips redeemed and was told to say “please” by the casino employee. After asking for clarification, Weiwei recounted that the cashier said, “You’re in Europe, you know. You should learn some manners,” while directly afterwards adding that he was responsible for “feeding” Weiwei (because he’s an immigrant living in Berlin) and was therefore entitled to the artist’s deference. “That’s a Nazi attitude,” Weiwei responded, “and a racist comment.” These remarks are evidently what Weiwei is now being sued for.
Weiwei has the resources and lawyers to combat a petty legal complaint. The outcome of the case doesn’t appear to cause him much concern, but he used the incident as a jumping off point to analyze the state of the conflicted world as he currently sees it. “The casino clerk had cloaked his ethnic prejudice as a question of culture: Immigrants (whom we Germans are ‘saving’) should be learning European civilization,” Weiwei elaborates. Indeed, the cultural calcification that solidifies discriminatory ideas is a process that effects everything. Particularly, the artist refers to the recent symbiosis he sees between hard-charging Western capitalist interests and the whims of authoritarian Chinese governance, a combination he argues has resulted in democracy being threatened altogether.
In essence, Weiwei is saying that the cultural discrimination he experienced in Germany is used in different ways, by many powerful governments, as a means of extracting profit. With the threat of catastrophe already imminent, in Weiwei’s words, “the great challenge facing German and other Western governments is whether they can find a way to exit the carnival of profit making with their moral integrity intact.” It’s good writing, and it includes cleverly biting imagistic work as well: what are carnivals except spaces filled with clowns?

Texto completo: Joe Biden has regained some of his strength in Iowa, but his three closest rivals for the Democratic nomination remain clustered at his heels, according to a Monmouth University poll released Monday.
The poll, published three weeks before Iowa's first-in-the-nation nominating contest, found the former vice president with support from 24 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, a bump of 5 percentage points since Monmouth's most recent Iowa poll, in November.
Biden's three closest competitors are clumped together in a statistical tie, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont earning 18 percent support; Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., 17 percent; and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts earning 15 percent. The poll had a five-point margin of error.
Sanders has leapt five points since the last Monmouth poll of the state, Buttigieg experienced a five-point drop, and Warren experienced a three-point drop.

Booker drops out of presidential race
Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey dropped out of the Democratic presidential race Monday, ending a nearly yearlong quest built around a message of peace and unity that failed to resonate with voters eager for a more aggressive posture against President Trump.
The departure of Booker, 50, from the crowded Democratic field, heralded at the outset as the most diverse in history, leaves just one African-American candidate, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, vying for the nomination in a party in which black voters are an essential bloc of the Democratic base.
The decision came after Booker, who never cracked the top tier of Democratic contenders and consistently polled in the low single digits, fell short of qualifying for a second consecutive debate. The setback, the Booker campaign conceded in the past few weeks, would most probably doom the underdog candidacy at a time when the Democratic race for president is being overshadowed by an impeachment trial in Washington and a growing conflict with Iran.
“I got in this race to win, and I've always said I wouldn't continue if there was no longer a path to victory," Booker said in a statement to supporters.
Booker, who is also up for reelection to the Senate this year, still enjoys favorable ratings in New Jersey, which leans decidedly Democratic and hasn't elected a Republican senator in more than 40 years.

Sanders would consider list of Supreme Court picks
Senator Bernie Sanders said in an interview that he would consider releasing a list of potential Supreme Court appointees he would name if elected president, and noted his wife, Jane, also believes he should offer a roster of jurists in the way President Trump did during his 2016 campaign.
Sanders suggested it was premature right now to unveil the names of his prospects for the nation's highest court — “got to kind of win the nomination first," he said — but he warmed to the idea in an interview with the editorial board of The New York Times.
Sanders, a progressive Vermont senator who remains a political independent, does not face the sort of ideological suspicion that many on the right harbored toward Trump when he ran, but he is viewed warily by some Democrats. And with polls in the states that begin the presidential nominating process showing him at or near the top of the field, his willingness to name his potential Supreme Court appointments at a moment the court is sharply divided could offer a measure of comfort to uneasy primary voters.
Sanders said he would push the Senate to pass his legislative priorities with a simple majority; called Xi Jinping, China's top leader, a dictator; and acknowledged he had changed his views to become more supportive of gun control.

Mueller witness pleads guilty on child sex charges
A key witness in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation will be sentenced to at least 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of child sex trafficking and possessing child pornography.
Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, 60, entered a plea deal Monday in federal court in Alexandria.
Nader admitted transporting a 14-year-old boy from the Czech Republic to Washington, D.C., in 2000 to engage in sexual activity with him. He also admitted possessing child pornography depicting infants or toddlers.
The pornography charge carries a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. Prosecutors agreed as part of the plea bargain to recommend a 10-year sentence when Nader is sentenced in April, though the judge will be free to impose a significantly longer sentence if she chooses.
Nader's name appears more than 100 times in Mueller's report. It details Nader's efforts to serve as liaison between a Russian banker with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and members of President Trump's transition team.
Nader is also under indictment in Washington along with seven others on charges of conspiring to conceal the source of more than $3.5 million in political donations to Hillary Clinton.
Nader previously served as an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, a close Saudi ally, and in 2017 wired $2.5 million to a top Trump fund-raiser, Elliott Broidy, through a company in Canada, the Associated Press reported in 2018. The goal was to persuade the United States to take a hard line against Qatar, a longtime American ally but now an adversary of the UAE.

NAACP lawsuit says Census Bureau is unprepared
Calling preparations for the 2020 Census “conspicuously deficient," the NAACP is suing the US Census Bureau, demanding that the agency send more workers into the field and spend more money on encouraging people to participate in the once-a-decade head count.
The civil rights group and Prince George's County, a majority African-American county in Maryland, filed the lawsuit last Friday in federal court in Maryland. It claims the Census Bureau wasn't planning to put enough workers in the field and hadn't opened up a sufficient number of field offices.
The lawsuit also faulted the bureau for conducting limited testing, particularly when, for the first time, it is encouraging most respondents to answer the questionnaire online.
The 2020 census will help determine the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal spending and how many congressional seats each state gets. It starts for a few residents next week in a remote part of Alaska, but most people won't be able to begin answering the questionnaire until mid-March.

Texto completo: The terrorist attack at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in December has reignited a bitter debate in digital technology: Are cellphones and other devices a threat to public safety and national security if the government doesn't have a way to get past their digital security?
On Monday, US Attorney General William Barrcomplained that smartphone giant Apple had failed to help federal investigators break the encrypted passwords of two iPhones belonging to Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, the Saudi Air Force cadet who murdered three people and wounded eight others in a Dec. 6 mass shooting.
"It is very important to know with whom and about what the shooter was communicating before he died," Barr said. But he said that Apple “has not given us any substantive assistance," and added that “this situation perfectly illustrates why it is critical that investigators be able to get access to digital evidence once they have obtained a court order based on probable cause."
Barr's complaint is an echo of the government's confrontation with Apple following the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., when a husband and wife murdered 14 people during a shooting spree. In that case, the Justice Department won a court order seeking to force Apple to open the iPhone of one of the shooters. Apple resisted, but a courtroom showdown was averted when the FBI obtained phone-cracking technology from a cyber-security company.
Despite that technological breakthrough for investigators, Apple phones have apparently gotten even harder to crack. Even older iPhones are tougher than they used to be, thanks to upgrades to the operating system software. Joe Caruso, chief technology officer of Global Digital Forensics in Boston, said that his company breaks into thousands of phones every year, to assist in civil and criminal investigations, using tools that work well on phones with relatively simple passwords.
But newer iPhone software uses six-digit passwords by default and can be set to use much longer ones. As a result, “there are some iPhones that we cannot get into," Caruso said.
In the current case, investigators recovered an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 7 after Alshamrani was killed by police. FBI investigators want to read files stored on the phones to determine whether the killer acted alone or had accomplices with whom he communicated.
The iPhone 7 comes with a fingerprint lock. It's not known if Alshamrani used it, but in any case that may be a moot question: Most fingerprint readers on phones rely on a tiny amount of electrical current flowing through the finger, Anil Jain, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State University and an expert on fingerprint technology, told the publication Live Science. And that flow stops once the person is dead.
There's still the old-fashioned password, of course. But an iPhone is designed so that unlocking it without the correct password is almost impossible. Importantly, an iPhone can be set so that all data on the phone are wiped out after 10 failed attempts to enter a password. To avoid that risk, the FBI sought help from Apple in bypassing the phone's security system.
In a statement, Apple said it supplied the FBI with “many gigabytes of information" related to the phones, including the owner's account information and data backups stored in Apple's Internet-based iCloud service. The company also said its engineers have worked closely with the FBI to provide technical assistance in investigating the case.
But the company also defended its longstanding policy of refusing to design its phones with “backdoors" that would allow Apple or the police to gain access to a phone without its owner's permission. The reason: Any such backdoor would sooner or later be exploited by criminals.
“We have always maintained there is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys," the Apple statement read. “Backdoors can also be exploited by those who threaten our national security and the data security of our customers."
In addition, even if Apple could grant access to the phone, there's nothing to stop the user from installing an app which uses its own non-Apple method for encrypting data. Such apps are available from foreign companies beyond the reach of US law.
But Stewart Baker, former general counsel at the National Security Agency, said that Apple and other companies should build backdoors for police.
“Tim Cook talks a lot about social responsibility, and his company has a responsibility to help the government catch terrorists who use its products," Baker said, referring to Apple's chief executive. “Instead, the company has been spending enormous resources on making it harder and harder for the government to do that."
A version of this argument has been underway for decades. When the first robust encryption programs became available for use on personal computers and telephones in the early 1990s, law enforcement and intelligence agencies warned the technology would make it possible for criminals and spies to communicate in complete secrecy, and sought tough limits on their use.
Since then, encryption technology has became a vital tool for lawful citizens and businesses. For instance, online banking and shopping would be unthinkable without encryption systems such as SSL, which enables secure transfers of money. Soon, hardcore encryption became a common feature in everyday gadgets.
But now that criminals routinely use encrypted devices, the controversy is becoming more intense. Apple shows no signs of changing its position, and the government may again seek a court order to force the company's hand.
Meanwhile, in Congress, members of both parties have expressed support for legislation to make backdoors mandatory in encrypted consumer devices.
And in a speech in July at Fordham University, Barr said that “while we remain open to a cooperative approach, the time to achieve that may be limited."

Texto completo: LIMA - Robert W. Schiff built a business empire selling moderately priced shoes - a lot of moderately priced shoes.
When the 85-year-old Schiff died in Columbus in December 1971, the New York Times noted that the Shoe Corporation of America, which grew out of a single store Schiff founded a half century earlier, employed more than 10,000 people in about 1,000 stores and nine manufacturing plants.
By 1961, when Schiff’s opened an outlet in Lima’s Northland Plaza Shopping center, there were four Schiff’s shoe stores in Allen County, three of them in Lima.
Born in 1886 in Russian Lithuania, Schiff received a Talmudic education before coming to the United States in 1905. “He recalled in 1951 that he had planned to resume his studies in Jewish law, but found himself instead as clerk in a shoe store,” the Times wrote. “He tried various businesses in Cincinnati, Dallas and Dayton. As a partner in a shoe store in Marion, he envisioned the possibility of nationwide chain store outlets. Moving to Columbus, he built his organization on a basis of centralized purchasing from manufacturers but individualized operation of the local store.”
Schiff opened his first shoe store in 1920 in Columbus. In the late 1940s, he opened his first store in Lima at 48 Public Square in the Lima House business block. In the early 20th century, the space had been home to the popular Oak Café and billiard rooms. In 1921, Kirby’s shoe store opened at 48 Public Square.
An ad in January 1921 announcing the new store’s proclaimed Kirby’s was “not connected with any other shoe store in Lima” and touted its prime location in the Square. Kirby’s, the ad declared, was the “only new shoe store on the Square,” which at the time was home to several other stores selling shoes.
Meanwhile, the Columbus-based Schiff’s was becoming the third largest shoe store chain in the country. In 1946, its name was changed from the Schiff Shoe Co. to the Shoe Corporation of America. The company operated stores under a variety of names, including Schiff’s Shoes, which sold medium and lower-priced shoes.
In the late 1940s, Schiff’s opened its first Lima store, moving into 48 Public Square and Kirby’s became Schiff’s Kirby shoe store. A second Schiff’s shoe store opened in 1957 at 213 N. Main St., about two blocks north of the first store.
The second store was managed by Bernard Gutmann, who also was a district manager for Schiff’s. Gutmann announced in 1961 that the store would expand into the space next door, formerly occupied by Vickie Frocks.
Nineteen sixty-one also saw Schiff’s presence in Allen County grow to four stores. “Schiff’s (Shoe Corporation of America) will open its new store in Northland Plaza Shopping Center Monday with store hours from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily and from noon to 6 p.m. Sundays,” the Lima Citizen reported Nov. 12, 1961. The Northland store joined the two downtown Lima outlets and a Delphos store.
Robert Schiff stepped down as chairman of SCOA Industries in 1968, three years before his death. SCOA Industries was sold in 1991.

In 2017, Dow Chemical scored a long-sought-after victory: After a push from the U.S. government, China approved the import of the company’s genetically modified herbicide-resistant corn seeds.
A grateful Dow lobbyist emailed a senior Agriculture Department official whose support had been critical: “Thank you for your efforts in support of U.S. agriculture.”
That official, Rebeckah Adcock, was no stranger to Dow. Before joining the Trump administration, Adcock was the chief lobbyist for the herbicide industry’s trade group, of which Dow was a prominent member.
Adcock had helped her former industry colleagues in a variety of ways. At Dow’s request, for example, she had arranged a meeting between a top company official and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue about the seed issue.
Before the May 2017 meeting, a Dow lobbyist emailed Adcock: “Do you know who will staff the secretary?”
Adcock wrote back, playfully, “Yes and u do too.”
“Roger,” the lobbyist, Hunt Shipman, replied. Then he joked about the potential conflict of a public servant helping former colleagues: “Maybe you can have a chair on both sides of the table…maybe you can staff them both? :)”
Adcock isn’t the only lobbyist who has made her way to the federal government. Roughly one of every 14 appointments in the Trump administration has been a lobbyist. But previously unreported emails show Adcock repeatedly trading notes with industry players to craft policy.
“It’s highly inappropriate conduct,” said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel for the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Canter worked as an ethics attorney in the administrations of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
The emails were recently obtained by the Sierra Club and the liberal freedom of information group American Oversight. The groups requested the communications in response to a ProPublica and New York Times investigation that revealed the industry ties of Adcock and other administration officials.
All federal employees are subject to standards of conduct that require them to be impartial and to seek authorization before participating in matters where their impartiality is likely to be questioned.
“As a U.S. official, she cannot represent any person’s interest other than the [U.S. government’s] in matters in which U.S. interests are at stake,” Canter said.
Like other officials, Adcock had signed a Trump administration ethics agreement, promising to avoid conflicts of interest. But the agreement gave Adcock wide berth, allowing her to offer help to Dow and other clients of the herbicide and pesticide trade group she worked for.
Adcock did not respond to requests for comment. Dow declined to comment.

Bipartisan effort by Congress could help save some local newspapers

Texto completo: THE ISSUE
Many small newspapers across America are in dire economic straits — a situation exacerbated by the business practices of the biggest technology companies — and Congress has responded with some rare bipartisan agreement, The New York Times reported in a story published in Monday’s LNP | LancasterOnline. “The proposal would give news organizations an exemption from antitrust laws, allowing them to band together to negotiate with Google and Facebook over how their articles and photos are used online, and what payments the newspapers get from the tech companies,” the Times reported.
We are pleased to see Republicans and Democrats rally around an issue that relates directly to the freedom of the press that’s so essential to democracy.
Have no doubt: We cannot have “freedom of the press” without having a press. Yet that is increasingly the case in many U.S. communities.
“Newspapers have faced devastating financial losses for years,” the Times explained. “One in five newspapers has closed since 2004 in the United States, and about half of the nation’s more than 3,000 counties have only one newspaper, many of them printing weekly, according to a report by the University of North Carolina published in late 2018.”
Areas with little or no local newspaper coverage become “news deserts.” It is an awful thing for any community.
We wrote last March about what can happen when the watchdog function of local journalism disappears: “It’s hard to imagine no one covering a local school board, as it plans to build an expensive new facility. Or no one covering the state lawmakers deciding how tax dollars should be spent. Imagine no one covering the construction of a natural gas pipeline as it cuts through local neighborhoods. Or no one covering the turmoil in a county office. Or the alleged defrauding of a local energy business by its CEO.”
The residents of Cornelia, Georgia, still have a watchdog. But The Northeast Georgian has just five staffers, and they hustle to do everything — report, edit, take photos and design pages for the two print editions per week. They are doing all they can to keep serving their community.
But the tech giants are working against them.
When The Northeast Georgian recently covered a big story, it posted updates on Facebook, resulting in hundreds of shares. “But unless the people who shared its story on Facebook follow a link to its website, either to see an ad or to subscribe to its twice-weekly print edition, the paper won’t get paid,” The Times reported.
In this way, Facebook and Google are dooming media outlets that have few other routes to reach online readers.
As another Times article from last October explained, Facebook and Google pull in about 80% of all online advertising revenue, leaving little available for media companies, especially small newspapers. Accessing that online revenue stream is perhaps the only hope newspapers have to compensate for years of declining print advertisement revenue.
Enter Congress.
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “gave a big boost last week to a bill that may provide some papers a lifeboat,” the Times reported. It would let multiple news organizations combine their negotiating power to wrestle better deals from the tech companies that share their journalistic content.
It has a wide array of supporters in both chambers of Congress, including GOP Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.
It’s encouraging to see politicians of differing views understanding the importance of local news.
“I am a free-markets guy and have fought against the idea that just because something is big it is necessarily bad,” Collins said. “But look, I’m a politician and live with the media and see its importance. These big, disruptive platforms are making money off creators of content disproportionately.”
And Klobuchar, a Democratic candidate for president, tweeted last month about her personal experience with the importance of journalism: “Thinking of my dad on #LoveMyNewspaper Day. He got his start in the newspaper business delivering Grit, a small-town & rural weekly paper & went on to work 43 years in journalism. He taught me the importance of a free press and now more than ever — it’s crucial to our democracy.”
We should note that Facebook recently unveiled new deals with major news outlets, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and CNN, that would pay them for the content they share. But that’s hardly going to help little newspapers like the one in northeastern Georgia.
And there’s this: In a nation of fewer newspapers, there are fewer avenues to counter disinformation campaigns — many launched by foreign governments — during this presidential election year.
“Disinformation on social media is our No. 1 problem,” Stacy Hall, chairman of the board of commissioners in Habersham County, Georgia, told The Times. “There is a crisis in getting the facts — the basic facts that only community newspapers can provide.”
We are fortunate in this community. While newspapers struggle and shutter elsewhere in our nation, Lancaster County still strongly supports journalism, both print and online.
“Our readers depend on us, engage with us, criticize us — but certainly don’t ignore us,” we wrote last March. “For that we are deeply grateful. ... (LNP | LancasterOnline) is also family-owned, which has given it stability in a storm-tossed industry.”
Not every newspaper has that stability. Sadly, not every county has a newspaper paying close attention to how the people’s business is conducted. So we’re heartened that Congress is trying to address the problems those big tech companies have caused for so many local newspapers.

Texto completo: Dwight Clarence Niese, who always made time for a cup of coffee with a friend while proudly wearing his alma-mater's scarlet and grey, passed away on Friday, January 10, 2020 at the age of 70 after a battle with cancer.
A beloved husband and father, Dwight was born and raised in Putnam County, Ohio, where his family farmed soybeans, corn and wheat. He graduated from THE Ohio State University (Go Buckeyes!) in 1971, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics. During this time, Dwight met the love of his life, Linda. He swept her off her feet, and they were wed on August 7, 1971, and later welcomed two children into their family.
After college, a strong work ethic and love of country led Dwight to enlist in the Army and serve his country honorably. He also later went on to study Robotic Engineering at Lima Technical College, a subject he excelled at both scholastically and in his professional career. His work provided the opportunity for Dwight to become a world traveler who experienced many different cultures and returned home with many stories that he shared with family and friends.
Dwight and Linda raised their family in Putnam County, where they continued working the family farming business, and where Dwight also started his engineering career at Phillips Magnavox. He worked there for 10 years before taking a new job with Thomson and relocating to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania – which Dwight jokingly referred to as "Pennsyltucky." He disliked the potholes and traffic of the Keystone state but soon found a community of neighbors who he would come to call dear friends. Dwight enjoyed golfing with his buddies, getting Dairy Queen with Linda in his canary-yellow Corvette, watching old John Wayne movies in his man cave, and completing the New York Times crossword puzzle. He was a good card player, and trivia wizard. Football season was holy. And when the first iPad landed under the Christmas tree years ago, he became a big fan of Monster Legends.
In addition to being a respected Quality Control Engineer, Veteran, Husband, and Father, Dwight enjoyed being called ‘Pops." He taught his grandson to ride a bicycle without training wheels, helped put together thousand-piece Star Wars legos, and loved giving rides on his green John Deere.
Dwight is survived by his wife Linda Niese; his daughter, Vanessa Frederick and her husband, Junius; his son, Damon Niese and his wife, Traci; his brother, Rene Niese and wife, Judy; his sister, Lucretia Rosengarten, and her husband Jerry; his grandchildren Saxon and Hayden; and several cousins, in-laws, and friends he considered family.
For those whose lives were touched by Dwight C. Niese, services will be held at DeBord Snyder Funeral Home & Crematory, 141 East Orange St., Lancaster, PA 17602 on Thursday, January 16, 2020. The visitation will start at 9:30 AM and the service will begin at 11:00 AM. To leave an online condolence for the family, please visit:

Texto completo: A new report by Cosmopolitan magazine and Type Investigations alleges widespread child sexual abuse in Amish communities throughout the United States, including Lancaster County.
The year-long investigation by reporter Sarah McClure, published on Tuesday, identified 52 official cases of child sexual assault in communities throughout seven states, including Pennsylvania.
The report comes amid increased scrutiny of sexual abuse within Plain Sect communities.
In a series last year called "Coverings," the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette looked at the issue of sexual abuse in Lancaster County’s Plain communities from the perspectives of victims, law enforcement and church leadership.
A similar series was published in 2004 in the Intelligencer Journal, a forerunner to LNP | LancasterOnline. “Silenced by Shame” described church leaders silencing the voices of abused women and children, and leaders defending their actions by pointing to biblical mandates and church doctrine.
The 2004 series also described changes that already were underway in Amish and more liberal Mennonite churches.
The report, which appears in the February edition of the national magazine and online here, describes a secretive world where children are sexually abused and knowledge of the abuse is hidden by leadership in the Amish churches.
Click here to read the report.
McClure spoke to dozens of law-enforcement officials, advocates and victims throughout the country, including several from Lancaster County.
Court of Common Pleas Judge Dennis Reinaker, who said he has presided over 30 cases of sexual abuse within the Amish Community in his nearly 20 years on the bench, spoke of the difficulty law enforcement and prosecutors have in getting witnesses who are willing to press charges.
Former Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman, installed as a judge on the county court earlier this month, talked about efforts Lancaster County’s law enforcement agencies have made to build relationships with leaders in the local Amish churches.
During his time as district attorney, Stedman started a task force that connected law enforcement, social services and local Amish leaders several times a year.
Amos Stoltzfoos, a member of the Lancaster County Conservative Crisis Intervention, an Amish initiative to increase cooperation with law enforcement and encourage reporting within the Plain churches, was also interviewed in the story.
According to Stoltzfoos, the Lancaster County Amish are no longer interested in hiding the abuse, saying “a lot of things have changed and forced us to comply and not allow things to be swept under the rug, like they had at one point.”
Type Investigations, formerly The Investigative Fund, funds independent watchdog reporting. Its investigations have appeared in publications ranging from The New York Times Magazine, Smithsonian Magazine, Vice, Harper’s, The Nation and Mother Jones.

From France, a cautionary tale for cultural aristocrats

Texto completo: Gabriel Matzneff is not a good man, but it’s taken France a long time to realize it.
Norimitsu Onishi reported an astonishing story in Sunday’s New York Times. It begins:
“The French writer Gabriel Matzneff never hid the fact that he engaged in sex with girls and boys in their early teens or even younger. He wrote countless books detailing his insatiable pursuits and appeared on television boasting about them. ‘Under 16 Years Old,’ was the title of an early book that left no ambiguity.
Matzneff, now 83, spent decades as a French literary darling. His work was supported by leading newspapers and literary publications. He’d appear on highbrow TV shows where he’d regale interviewers and audiences with the sublime pleasures of having sex with children in France and on sex tours of Southeast Asia.
His overdue comeuppance is the result of a memoir by one of his victims, Vanessa Springora, who was seduced by a then-50-something Matzneff when she was 14.
“He was not a good man,” Springora writes. “He was in fact what we’re taught to dread since childhood: an ogre.”
In his book “Under 16 Years Old,” Matzneff writes, “To sleep with a child, it’s a holy experience, a baptismal event, a sacred adventure.” The book was first published in 1974 but was republished, apparently with no controversy in 2005. In 2013, Metznaff received a major French literary prize.
How could a country that prides itself on being so enlightened celebrate an ogre? After all, we’re not talking about a Jeffrey Epstein, as horrible as he was. The well-connected billionaire spent vast sums to keep his sexual abuses at least somewhat secret. Matzneff not only confessed to his crimes, his confessions were celebrated as literary contributions.
The answer stems in part from the fact that Matzneff was a “Child of ‘68” — i.e., a product of the left-wing “May 68” movement that shook France in the 1960s. These radicals subscribed to the idea that anything smacking of traditionalism or bourgeois morality was backward. Conventional sexual morality was part of the same rotten edifice as imperialism and racism. True liberation meant not just freedom from, say, capitalism, but also from the old-fashioned view that sex with kids was wrong. “It’s forbidden to forbid” was a rallying cry.
Some argued, Onishi writes, “for abolishing age-of-consent laws, saying that doing so would liberate children from the domination of their parents and allow them to be full, sexual beings.”
Matzneff is a good example of what can happen when people who share a self-styled radical worldview capture the commanding heights of the culture and consider themselves above the rubes from whom they make their money.
There’s a reason Ricky Gervais struck such a chord at the Golden Globes a week ago when he told the assembled Hollywood royalty to get over themselves.
“If you do win an award tonight, don’t use it as a platform to make a political speech,” Gervais said. “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.”
This should be a cautionary tale for all cultural aristocrats. Not all radical fads hold up well over time.

'Left with no choice': European countries move to hold Iran accountable for violating nuclear deal

Texto completo: Britain, Germany, and France moved toward implementing more sanctions against Iran after Tehran said it would not comply with any restrictions on enriching uranium following the U.S. strike that killed top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani.
The European countries said they had “sought to persuade Iran to change course” and “worked hard” to address its concerns. They said there were, however, few options left, given Iran’s decision, except to trigger a dispute mechanism in the 2015 nuclear deal.
“We have therefore been left with no choice, given Iran’s actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments” under the nuclear agreement, the countries said in a joint statement Tuesday.
Triggering the mechanism gives the parties up to 60 days to negotiate about Iran coming back into full compliance with the deal, according to the New York Times. It could end in reviving United Nations sanctions on Iran, but the European countries said they remain committed to saving the deal and would not be joining the United States’ “maximum pressure” campaign.
President Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and has imposed several rounds of sanctions on the country. Iran has responded by gradually exceeding many of the limitations it agreed to in the deal.

Sanders and Warren 'nonaggression pact' was a bad idea from the start

Texto completo: Barack Obama has gone out of his way to remain an unusually neutral arbiter in the Democratic presidential primary, so when he weighed in on the party's concerns in November, what he said was almost as curious as the timing of when he said it.
The Left pounced on Obama's correct assertion that "the average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it," but more telling was his warning about the primary system itself.
"For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary," Obama told hundreds of keyed-in donors and politicos. "I’m confident that, at the end of the process, we will have a candidate that has been tested."
But when Obama was touting the importance of a "robust" primary, it was anything but. Joe Biden was and remains the dominant front-runner with roughly 30% of the vote, and all three candidates who tried to take him down found the effort futile. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Julian Castro all dropped out after languishing in the single digits. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren rotated between second and third place, refusing to attack each other thanks to an informal nonaggression pact. The only "robust" debate that came around the time of Obama's warning was from Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who pointedly debated Warren's wacky leftism, to their benefit.
Unsurprisingly, Obama was right, and the lack of robust debate between the second-place Sanders and third-place Warren now imperils them both. Warren's campaign all but certainly leaked the claim that Sanders told her a woman couldn't win the presidency, and now both have been embroiled in an intersectional civil war. But this was an inevitable outcome of their attempt to deny the public a robust debate earlier on.
To their detriment, the media mostly insulated the pair from substantive criticism of their socialist plans. It wasn't until nearly a year after announcing her candidacy that Warren faced any real pushback on how she'd pay for her $34 trillion Medicare for All plan. In all that time, she was touting radical notions such as court packing and canceling student debt while Sanders backed even more bogus spending math, with the added bonus of campaigning with some of the vilest anti-Semites in public life.
The press and the party failed to vet either of them. Their math went unaccounted for, Warren's lies went unchallenged, and Bernie's surrogates went uncriticized. So, now that Warren's campaign went nuclear in the paradigm of intersectionalism, two extremely untested candidates are about to tear each other apart on a debate stage for all the world to see. No matter who gets the best of the exchange, both will be heartily damaged not even three weeks before the crucial Iowa caucuses.
Democrats spent over a year trying to insulate voters from information vital to their choice of candidates. Just as Obama warned, it's about to backfire on them spectacularly.

Texto completo: Despite strong opposition from the government, Philadelphia charity Safehouse intends to open a first-of-its-kind facility where people can inject opioids under medical supervision.
"Our purpose is to save lives,” said Ronda Goldfein, the group's vice president. "We have a crisis. We will open."
Safehouse would allow drug users to inject their own opiates with clean needles provided by the center while in the presence of healthcare professionals standing by with overdose-reversal drugs. The hope is to reduce the risk of fatal overdoses in the streets as well as the transmission of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.
The organization is closer than ever to opening its doors after a yearlong court battle with the federal government. U.S. Attorney William McSwain said last year that Safehouse is in violation of the Controlled Substances Act's "crackhouse statute," devised at the height of the 1980s crack epidemic, which makes it illegal to manage a site for the purpose of using illegal drugs.
The government has argued that a supervised injection site would encourage opioid abuse rather than prevent fatal overdoses. For instance, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote in the New York Times in August 2018 that safe injection sites "are very dangerous and would only make the opioid crisis worse."
"They invite visitors to use heroin, fentanyl, and other deadly drugs without fear of arrest," Rosenstein wrote. "The policy is 'B.Y.O.D.' — bring your own drugs — but staff members help people abuse drugs by providing needles and stand ready to resuscitate addicts who overdose."
Still, Safehouse's lawyers presented to Eastern District Judge Gerald McHugh in October that the organization's purpose is to prevent overdose and disease, not to promote illegal drug use. They filed a motion last week asking McHugh to declare that they have the legal authority to open the first site to the public. Goldfein said the legal team is optimistic that McHugh will rule in Safehouse's favor.
The organization's troubles don't end with legal battles, though. Goldfein said they are short of the funding necessary to keep the first site open long term. After Safehouse won tax-exempt status from the IRS, the team saw a rise in donations to fund the site, but not enough.
“We still get small showings of support. We get small checks and some foundation support. I’m hoping if we can get open and stay open, that’ll show funders we’re legit,” Goldfein said.
Running a charity that is operational at all hours every day is a costly enterprise. The Safehouse board of directors will have to bring in healthcare professionals trained to assist users in need of emergency care as well as find a suitable location for the center so that it’s accessible to as many users as possible.
The board has not yet settled on a location, though, and there are several neighborhoods in Philadelphia to choose from that need their help. The likely spot for the first center to open is in Kensington, a neighborhood in Philadelphia that has been hit so hard by the opioid crisis that Mayor Jim Kenney declared a disaster there due to opioid overdoses in October 2018.
The neighborhood is home to the nation’s largest open-air drug market, in which dealers publicly advertise their products and users administer drugs on the sidewalks.
“The Philadelphia health department put out a map of ‘hot zones,’ and there are areas in Kensington that are blaring red hot, and I think we need to go where the data shows us,” Goldfein said. “But there are places that are in second and third places, places where we need to be thinking about providing some services there, too.”
Goldfein said she and the team are working to secure a facility so that it can open as soon as possible, and a probable challenge by McSwain will not deter them.
Safehouse's legal team anticipates further opposition from federal attorneys, taking both parties to the 3rd District Court of Appeals, but plans to move forward in opening the first site even while in litigation. Goldfein said the need for Safehouse’s services is too great to postpone opening much further.
“People are injecting eight to 10 times a day,” Goldfein said. “Your entire life is consumed by fear of withdrawal, hustling for money, buying, using, it’s an endless cycle. But when in that cycle are you taking a deep breath and saying, ‘is it possible that I can have a different life?’”

Texto completo: Surveillance footage from last week shows two separate Iranian missiles bringing down a Ukrainian airliner.
The new video, released by the New York Times on Tuesday, shows two missiles fired about 30 seconds apart hitting the commercial jet and causing it to crash. The downing killed all 176 on board, many of whom were Iranian citizens.
The footage sheds light on how the plane was brought down. It shows that the first missile to hit the jet took out the aircraft’s transponder, and then 23 seconds later, a second hit caused further damage. An earlier recording of the attack appeared to show just one missile striking the doomed airliner.
The new video captured the plane trying to circle back to Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport before it exploded and plummeted to the ground. The victims of Wednesday’s crash included 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Germans, and three British nationals.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that dozens of Iranians have been arrested in the country over the crash, though he blamed the “root cause” of the deaths on the United States and tensions between the two countries.
The aircraft’s crash came just hours after the Iranian military lobbed more than a dozen short-range ballistic missiles at bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops. Photos released on Monday show the aftermath of the Iranian missile attacks.
Since the crash, protesters at universities and cities across Iran began protesting the Iranian regime over the attack on the airliner.
Maryam Rajavi, the president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran and co-leader of the People’s Mujahedin of Iran, has encouraged the demonstrations, which began in Tehran and have since spread to other cities.
“Time has come for the international community to acknowledge the reality that the religious fascism ruling Iran does not represent the Iranian people and recognize the national call for the overthrow of the mullahs,” Rajavi said in a statement provided to the Washington Examiner.
Protesters on Tuesday chanted slogans that included, “Be afraid, be afraid, we are all together!” and “Death to oppressor, whether it be the Shah or the [supreme] leader!"

Warren wields intersectionality against Sanders: Will the revolution devour its own?

Texto completo: When it was Brett Kavanaugh's neck on the line, the Left laughed — we were supposed to "believe all women," regardless of any lack of evidence or credibility on the part of the accuser.
Now Elizabeth Warren, who famously appropriated Native American identity to advance her career, is trying desperately to play the intersectionality card to take Bernie Sanders down with her own failing campaign.
To be clear, if Warren waffles even slightly tonight on whether Sanders actually told her that a woman cannot win the presidency, it will make her candidacy, if not her entire political career, toast. But if Warren manages to generate and ride a wave of ire from former Hillary Clinton fans, once more inflamed by the perceived sexism of Bernie and his bros, it could become a murder-suicide situation.
At an instinctive level, Democrats know that Warren's lies have fundamentally undercut her credibility. They know you aren't actually supposed to "believe all women" unless it's to hurt Republicans. They know that even if Sanders actually said what he's accused of, it's just a logical extension of their own three-year fantasy that Clinton lost because of sexism and Vladimir Putin.
But their thought leaders can't just say that publicly. Sure, the Very Online Bernie Bros have already pounced on Warren's credibility, but will the New York Times? Will the Center For American Progress? Will Obama-land?
Tonight's debate is do-or-die for both Warren and Sanders, because only one of them will make it out alive. Tonight will determine to what lengths the backward laws of intersectionality can be manipulated to backfire on the patriarch of the Left.

Pelosi demands Trump officials brief Congress on reported Russian hack of Burisma

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanded the Trump administration brief Congress on a U.S. cybersecurity firm's assessment that Russia hacked the Ukrainian natural gas company at the center of impeachment.
Echoing her fellow Democrats in the "Gang of Eight," Pelosi claimed she had no prior knowledge of the Burisma breach and wants to know what U.S. officials may have known about it.
"The president and every Republican senator must explain to the American people why they are refusing to defend our national security and the integrity of our elections," the California Democrat said in a statement Tuesday. "We only learned of this hacking through the press. Congress must be briefed on what the administration knows about this attack and why the president doesn’t have a plan to protect our elections."
According to an assessment by Area 1, first reported by the New York Times late Monday, Russian military hackers from the GRU began targeting in November subsidiaries of Burisma, which once employed former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, and Kvartal 95, a Ukrainian television production company founded by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, from 2014 to 2019. The impeachment effort began last year after a whistleblower complaint revealed that President Trump pressured Zelensky in a July phone call to open investigations into political rivals, including the Bidens, while withholding congressionally approved military aid. His father, Joe Biden, is now a Democratic candidate for president.
In back-to-back MSNBC appearances Monday evening, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said they too only learned of the reported hack through the media. Like Pelosi, they are members of the "Gang of Eight," a bipartisan group of leaders from both parties in the House and Senate with access to classified intelligence. Democrats have complained over what they say is the Trump administration's reluctance to share intelligence, particularly after U.S. officials failed to consult Congress before carrying out a drone strike killing Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani.
Pelosi, who picked Wednesday to appoint Democratic lawmakers to serve as impeachment managers in a Senate trial, also took shots at Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for resisting legislation to improve election security, which has been a priority ever since the U.S. intelligence community determined Russia meddled in the 2016 election.
“The alarming reports that the Russian Government is continuing to interfere in our elections to benefit the president and to undermine our democracy highlight the urgent need for action," she said.
In a Sunday interview, Pelosi said Trump is "in complete denial" about Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2020 election and accused McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, of being an "accomplice" to Russian interference, claiming that she wonders about his allegiance to the United States.

Founder of Area 1, firm that alleges Russian hacking of Burisma, is working with 2020 Democrats

Texto completo: Before we break out the rocket launchers in response to reports that Russian hackers have targeted the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, let’s consider the source of that information: a single cybersecurity start-up, whose founder is a Democrat and who won’t say anything about how he knows that the hacking actually happened.
The New York Times and the Washington Post on Monday reported that technology company Area 1, founded by Democratic donor Oren Falkowitz, has found that Burisma’s internal cyber system was breached by Russian hackers.
“In this instance, the hackers set up fake websites that mimicked sign-in pages of Burisma subsidiaries, and have been blasting Burisma employees with emails meant to look like they are coming from inside the company,” the New York Times story said.
There has yet to be any corroboration of this by Burisma (the seedy company at the center of President Trump’s impeachment, and which paid Joe Biden’s son Hunter hundreds of thousands of dollars for unknown services), Russia, or U.S. intelligence.
No, the only evidence that any breach occurred is an assertion by Falkowitz, who is trying to get his company, Area 1, off the ground and turn it into a leading cybersecurity firm.
In a brief phone interview on Tuesday, Falkowitz declined to tell me exactly how his firm would have identified the alleged hacking of Burisma.
He said that Area 1 has developed a “technology platform” that uses “sensors” to stop breaches that begin with phishing attempt, which take place when a bad actor sends fake emails with malware to an individual in order to gain access to internal systems.
I asked Falkowitz if he could identify the clients of his who would have benefited from Area 1’s service in this particular case involving Burisma. “We don’t comment on who our customers are,” he said.
I also asked if he could offer more information about the “sensors” that his firm uses to target phishing activity. Where are they? How did they retrieve any information relating to Burisma or Ukraine or Russia?
“I’m not going to get into that,” he said.
That’s fine, but then why should anyone take his word for it on the hacking of Burisma?
Nowhere in the New York Times story nor the Washington Post’s is it mentioned that Falkowitz is providing services to Democrats running for president at no charge. He told me on the phone that Area 1 is charging any candidate $1,337 per year, but campaign donation records show that he donated that exact same amount to the presidential campaigns of Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. (Falkowitz also gave money to Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy and Republicans Will Hurd and John Kasich, though both Kasich and Hurd have been Trump critics.)
Maybe Russians really have breached Burisma’s internal systems. But I’m not going to take it as fact on the word of a single U.S.-based Democrat-run security firm which, for all we know, might have created this controversy as a publicity stunt.

2020 Democrats blame corporations for healthcare costs, but those costs are a result of government rules

Texto completo: Every 2020 Democratic presidential candidate on the debate stage Tuesday said they would deal with soaring healthcare costs by either bringing drug prices down (very vague on how) or sticking it to private providers for bilking patients.
Billionaire Tom Steyer said fixing the problem is a matter of "break[ing] the corporate stranglehold" on health insurers.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said we would "have to stand up to the healthcare industry."
This is mostly or all a distraction.
There are a lot of problems with our healthcare system, which is really bad — recall President Trump ignorantly declaring, "Who knew healthcare could be so complicated?" — but the biggest ones are caused by disastrous government policies. That's not to say there are no good government policies, just that the good ones usually aren't that popular or easy to understand.
Here's a complicated one, conveniently created by the government by way of Medicare. Any new healthcare law will have to put a cap on the amount of “codes” that can be submitted from a hospital or doctor’s office to an insurance company, with an exception for life-threatening or other extreme incidents. And those abnormal occasions will have to be audited by insurers. Disputes can be settled in court.
Codes are how healthcare providers negotiate reimbursements from insurers. They were first established as a way for healthcare providers to bill the government for Medicare patients, but the system since been adopted industrywide for even private-insurance patients.
When a patient sees a doctor, every procedure and instrument deployed during that visit comes with a code that the doctor jots down and submits to the insurer for payment. This is why patients often complain that they don’t understand why they’re repeatedly subjected to unnecessary tests, procedures, and checks. It’s because the doctor or hospital can then charge the insurer more.
The New York Times covered this magnificently in 2017:
Each billing decision, then, can be seen as a battle of coder versus coder. The coders who work for hospitals and doctors strive to bring in as much revenue as possible from each service, while coders employed by insurers try to deny claims as overreaching. Coders who audit Medicare charts look for abuse to reclaim money or fraud that needs to be punished with fines. Hospital coders teach doctors — and doctors pay to take courses — to learn how they can “upcode” their charts to a more lucrative level with minimal effort. In a doctor’s office, a Level 3 visit (paid, say, at $175) might be legally transformed into a Level 4 (say, $225) by performing one extra maneuver, like weighing the patient or listening to the lungs, whether the patient’s illness required that or not.
Fix that problem and you fix a lot of the ballooning costs associated with health insurance.
Trump, like President Barack Obama before him, says he wants to protect people with "preexisting conditions," which is in direct conflict with the purpose of insurance to begin with. This idea has probably been baked into what the U.S. population expects of healthcare now, and that's OK. But it comes with a price.
That price is a requirement that we all have insurance by law. And having insurance by law means there's a penalty if you don't have it. And the penalty of not having it has to be more severe than the cost of paying for insurance.
This doesn't sound very fun, does it? No, and it's what Obama tried to do with the so-called "individual mandate," a very minor penalty on those who don't have insurance. But if we're going to do that, it has to go much further than what Obama did. No lawmaker will do that, though.
Too bad. It's the only way we can have a healthcare system that takes care of everyone and insures that everyone gets the treatment that they need.
No Democrat will lay that out for the public, so don't believe them when they pretend to have the answers.

Texto completo: Over the weekend, a minor conflict broke out between the presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, longtime friends who have, until now, seemed to operate under an unspoken nonaggression pact.
It started when Politico reported on a script that Sanders volunteers had been given to persuade voters leaning toward other candidates. Warren backers, the script said, are “highly educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what” and that she’s “bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party.”
Attacking another candidates’ supporters rather than her record is kind of obnoxious, but as far as political combat goes, it was pretty mild. The reason it caused a small uproar is that in much of the Democratic Party, there’s tremendous resentment of Sanders left over from 2016. Many believe he weakened Hillary Clinton by dragging out the primary — at one point even threatening a contested convention — and then only half heartedly rallying his fans behind her when it was over. Warren alluded to this anger in a fundraising email keyed to the Politico article that said, “We can’t afford to repeat the factionalism of the 2016 primary.”
She’s right, and she may be the only person who can save us from it.
I’ve hesitated to write too much about the Democratic primary because I have a conflict of interest — my husband is consulting for Warren’s campaign. Besides, while it seems obvious to me that of all the candidates Warren would be the best president, I go back and forth over who would be the strongest nominee against Donald Trump.
On Monday, CNN reported that, during a private conversation at Warren’s apartment in 2018, Sanders told Warren that he didn’t think a woman could win the presidency in 2020. (Sanders disputed this, saying that he argued only that Trump “is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could.”) It’s infuriating, but I’ve spoken to more than a few women who share such doubts.
In my darkest moments, so do I. Trying to game out electability is often fruitless — on paper John McCain seemed more electable than Barack Obama, and Clinton seemed more electable than Trump — but given the existential urgency of defeating the president, it’s still an ever-present concern.
So I’m not going to argue that Warren has the best chance of winning in 2020; I have no idea who does. What I will argue is that she has the best chance of bringing the Democratic Party together. Warren’s increasingly explicit argument that she is the unity candidate is correct.
She excites the middle-aged women who dominate the Resistance as well as the young people Democrats need to turn out en masse. She shares Sanders’ economic populism, but as a registered Democrat who has worked within the party — including in the Obama administration — she’s cultivated more good will inside it. (See how quick Julián Castro was to team up with her after ending his own candidacy.)
Both state and national polls often show her with the highest favorability rating among Democrats of any of the candidates. When a recent Economist/YouGov survey asked Democratic primary voters about candidates whose nominations would disappoint them, Warren was last, with 11%.
Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders’ press secretary, dismissed arguments for Warren’s broad acceptability, writing on Twitter, “Warren has plenty to recommend her, but nominating the candidate who people don’t feel so strongly about one way or the other is not how you beat a man as galvanizing as Trump.” But the claim that people don’t feel strongly about Warren is just wrong.
She’s drawn huge crowds throughout the race, and people wait in line for hours to have their picture taken with her. Warren has almost 1 million individual donors, which is a bit less than Sanders’ 1.2 million, but impressive when you consider that Sanders had a previous presidential campaign in which to build up his donor list. I’ve heard from many people that they’ve never felt as passionate about a candidate as they do about her.
Sanders may have even more intense devotees — it’s one of his great strengths as a candidate. But there are also a lot of Democrats who detest him. Joe Biden, too, faces significant internal opposition — in the YouGov poll, 21% of Democratic primary voters said they’d be disappointed if he were the nominee, including 40% of those ages 18 to 29.
With Biden and Sanders atop many polls, I fear that if the race comes down to the two of them, it will become vicious and destructive, because each has so many supporters who view the other as unacceptable. We could even, God forbid, face the sort of contested convention we avoided in 2016.
Obviously, the nomination is going to be bitterly fought no matter who comes out on top in the February contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. But backers of opposing candidates would be quicker to reconcile themselves to Warren than to any of the other front-runners. A Warren candidacy would not force centrist Democrats to make their peace with socialism nor ask young socialists to jettison their dreams of egalitarian economic transformation.
The better she does next month, the more hope there is that Democrats will be able to fight Trump rather than one another.

Paul Krugman: Trump’s plot against health care continues

Texto completo: Make no mistake: Health care will be on the ballot this November. But not in the way ardent progressives imagine.
Democrats running for president have spent a lot of time debating so-called Medicare for All, with some supporters of Bernie Sanders claiming that any politician who doesn’t demand immediate implementation of single-payer health care is a corporate tool, or something. But the reality is that whatever its merits, universal, government-provided health insurance isn’t going to happen anytime soon.
I say this because even if Democrats take the Senate in addition to the White House, the votes for eliminating private health insurance won’t be there; nor will the kind of overwhelming public support that might change that calculus. In practice, any of the Democratic candidates — even Sanders — will, if victorious, end up building on and improving Obamacare.
On the other hand, if Donald Trump wins, he will probably find a way to kill Obamacare, and tens of millions of Americans will lose health coverage.
Let’s talk for a minute about Obamacare. There’s a sort of perverse alliance between Republicans and some progressives, both of whom are determined, albeit for different reasons, to see the Affordable Care Act as a failure.
These downbeat assessments are made easier by the fact that the ACA left much of its implementation up to the states, and that national performance has been held down by states that have done their best to sabotage health reform.
But look at states that have tried to make the law work, and what you see is a huge if incomplete policy success. Take the case of California. In 2010, before the ACA went into effect, 21% of nonelderly Californians were uninsured, above the national average. By 2016 the uninsurance rate had dropped to 8%. And Californians with preexisting medical conditions saw an enormous improvement in their health and financial security.
Now, 8% uninsured is still too many, and even those with insurance often face high out-of-pocket costs. But relatively minor improvements in the law, especially a modest increase in the generosity of insurance subsidies, could substantially improve both the quality and the quantity of coverage.
Does pointing out the possibility of incremental progress mean giving up on a truly universal system? No. By all means let’s make something more ambitious, such as Medicare for All, a long-term goal. But this goal shouldn’t stand in the way of policies that would immediately benefit millions of Americans, and save thousands of lives.
And while we debate the ideal health system, we mustn’t forget that Trump and his allies are as determined as ever to undo the progress we’ve made.
It’s true that so far repeated Republican attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act have failed. In 2012, the Supreme Court rejected claims that the whole law was unconstitutional. In 2017, a Republican-controlled Congress narrowly failed to repeal Obamacare. And a variety of narrower efforts to undermine health reform and send insurance markets into a “death spiral” have fallen short: Markets seem to have stabilized, and one by one, states that initially rejected Medicaid expansion have been relenting.
But the people who want to take away your health care haven’t given up.
The latest attempt is a lawsuit claiming that the 2017 tax cut, which reduced the penalty for not having insurance to $0, somehow made the entire Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It’s a ludicrous claim, both in terms of substance — would the law suddenly become constitutional if the penalty were a penny? — and because it’s clear that this was not legislators’ intention.
But the Trump administration has joined the suit and a partisan Republican judge has indeed ruled that the ACA as a whole should be struck down.
Clearly, this case is headed for the Supreme Court. But Trump doesn’t want it heard until after the election.
Why does Trump want to leave this court case hanging? Partly because his side would probably lose. As I said, the lawsuit is ludicrous, although, given the partisanship of Republican-appointed judges, it might prevail anyway.
Beyond that, however, Trump’s political health care strategy is to flat-out lie about what he has done and is trying to do. On Monday he made the breathtakingly dishonest claim that he is “the person who saved preexisting conditions” — breathtaking because he has tried at every stage to remove the protections for Americans with preexisting conditions created by the Affordable Care Act.
And while Trump, who lies constantly, often seems to pay little penalty for those lies, this one — which touches the lives of millions of voters — would be thrown into sharp relief if the case were heard by the Supreme Court. He wants to take away your health care, but he doesn’t want you to see him doing it until the election is behind him.
So that’s the real health care issue this year. Will it be expanded coverage under a Democrat — it probably doesn’t matter much which one — or will it be tens of millions of newly uninsured Americans under Trump?

Sharon Buccino: Trump’s weakening of environmental rules leaves us in the dark

Texto completo: Fifty years ago this month, President Richard Nixon signed one of the most effective laws ever written to protect the environment and strengthen democracy by ensuring that citizens would have a say over projects like highways and pipelines that directly affect their well-being.
Now President Trump is trying to cripple it.
New rules that he proposed on Thursday for carrying out the law would strike at the heart of the public’s right to know what our government is doing or failing to do on our behalf and to speak to the lasting impact those actions might have.
Often called the Magna Carta of environmental law, the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act requires that major energy and infrastructure projects receiving federal funding or requiring federal approval must undergo environmental reviews. Citizens have a right to weigh in on these proposals in hearings and through a public comment process.
Mr. Trump’s proposed changes would reduce the number of projects subject to such reviews, by setting new criteria for what qualifies as a major federal action requiring review by excluding projects deemed to be “minimal.” It’s not possible, from the vague language in the proposed rules, to predict which kinds of projects might escape reasonable review, but the enthusiastic response to the proposed changes from the oil, gas and construction industries offers a clue. As more projects are exempted, less information will be available about their potential impacts on communities and the environment.
And by relaxing language meant to prevent conflicts of interest, Mr. Trump’s rules would allow environmental reviews to be conducted by contractors with a financial interest in the project. That could give corporations more influence over how those reviews are written, increasing the chances of rosy reports that favor corporate interests.
The rules would enable fossil fuel companies and others to put their profits ahead of the public interest. Mr. Trump’s plan would also restrain the fight against climate change by removing a requirement to assess a project’s cumulative impacts, like the emission of greenhouse gases.
That’s a handout to the fossil fuel industry, which doesn’t want long-term climate impacts to be considered in decisions over whether to allow more coal to be mined from public lands, for example, or more oil drilled offshore.
Everyone who cares about public integrity and good governance, from any political party, should oppose this effort to surrender responsible public oversight to the ends of big polluters.
For half a century, the National Environmental Policy Act has guaranteed everyone affected by one of these projects — individuals, small-business owners, community activists, faith-based organizations, tourism groups, conservationists and others — a seat at the table.
The law lays out a process designed to expose a project’s potential pitfalls in advance, identify common ground and open the door to innovative solutions that can benefit all parties. It also requires the federal government to consider alternatives and mitigation for projects that threaten communities with lasting harm.
This is how a modern nation working to build a more just and equitable society blends public input with good governance to reach decisions that balance corporate interests with the broader good. Small wonder that some 160 other countries have emulated this model with laws of their own, seeking to replicate a process that has proved its worth time and again.
It resulted, for instance, in improved efficiency, navigational safety and wetlands protection at a major container terminal at the Port of Mobile, Ala.; important provisions for controlling erosion, protecting wildlife and restoring native trees and grass along a new highway through a national forest in Ohio; and the planting of vegetation to naturally filter runoff from a new medical facility in rural Virginia, reducing the risk of contamination to area groundwater sources.
That approach has been especially vital in the effort to confront environmental injustice. There’s a long and shameful practice in this country of steering big projects in or near low-income communities. The provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act help to level the playing field, ensuring that all citizens have the opportunity to address federal officials, through public hearings or written comments, to which federal agencies must respond.
In proposing to weaken the law, Mr. Trump argues that the new rules would speed the costly process of environmental review. “It takes 20 years,” he said Thursday in rolling out the proposed changes. “It takes 30 years. It takes numbers that nobody would even believe.”
Actually, the most common reason, by far, that major federal projects are delayed is a lack of funding, not regulatory review, a 2016 study for the Treasury Department of 40 major water and transportation projects found.
Not all federally approved or funded projects even end up receiving extensive environmental review. A new highway or power plant gets one, but resurfacing a road or putting up a fence to protect cultural resources does not. Of the thousands of projects that are funded or permitted by federal agencies each year, in fact, 95 percent are excluded from any detailed environmental assessment at all, according to a 2014 report by the Government Accountability Office. Less than 1 percent require full environmental impact statements, which take, on average, four and a half years to complete.
Nobody wants overregulation. But it can take time to gather critical information required to make informed decisions on projects that change entire landscapes. Better to get it right than to cut corners in ways that end up imposing even higher costs on everyone down the road.
We need to tell our representatives in Congress that we care about our right to know about what happens in our communities and our ability to speak out in ways that matter to protect the environment and public health. Don’t let the president turn back the clock five decades to a time when the government was inclined to give big industry a pass and let the people pay the price.

Bret Stephens: Of course Bernie Sanders can win

Texto completo: “The first principle,” said Richard Feynman, “is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.”
When it comes to pundits and politics this year, I’d revise the great physicist’s admonition as follows: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself that Bernie Sanders can’t win — not just the Democratic nomination, but also the presidency itself.”
The warning applies to me as much as to anyone else who has spent the past months, or years, insisting that the senator from Vermont doesn’t have a chance. What it comes down to is this: We don’t want Sanders to be elected, so we tell ourselves he can’t.
According to the theory, Sanders’ support has a hard ceiling: It may be intense, but it’s also cultlike and off-putting. Too many Americans know enough about socialism to want a president who wears the term proudly (even if he insists it’s of a more benign variety). He embraces nearly all of the same policies, like Medicare for all, that raised Elizabeth Warren high in the polls but are now dragging her down.
And then there are those clips of him saying nice things about the Soviet Union, or defending the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, or finding the silver lining in the Castro dictatorship in Cuba. Didn’t Jeremy Corbyn, whose ideological affinities run in the same direction, just lead Britain’s Labour Party to disaster?
It all sounds superficially convincing — and eerily familiar. It’s what many conservatives kept saying about Donald Trump around this time four years ago.
As with Sanders, Trump was seen as being way outside his party’s mainstream: a protectionist in a party of free traders; an isolationist in a party of interventionists; a libertine in a party of moralists. As with Sanders, Trump barely belonged to the party whose nomination he sought. As with Sanders, Trump’s message was that he was fighting a “rigged system.”
And as with Sanders, the ideological distaste for Trump among conservatives was matched to the conviction that he couldn’t possibly win. “Let’s Elect Hillary Now,” was the title of one conservative lament about the popularity of supposedly unelectable Republicans, written toward the end of 2015. I know the article well because I wrote it.
Trump won because he was willing to say loudly what his supporters believed deeply; because, in his disdain for what politicians are supposed to be and do, he exuded authenticity; because he was hated by the people his supporters found hateful; because he had an opponent who, in the minds of his supporters, epitomized corruption and self-dealing; and because he offered radical cures for a country he diagnosed as desperately ill. Despite being the oldest man ever elected president, he seemed (to his voters) fresh, true, bold, and sorely needed.
So it is, and would be, with Sanders. Depth of conviction? Check. Contempt for conventional norms? Check. Opposed by all the right people? Check. Running against a “crooked” opponent? Check. Commitment to drastic change? Check. Like Trump, too, he isn’t so much campaigning for office as he is leading a movement. People who join movements aren’t persuaded. They’re converted. Their depth of belief is motivating and infectious.
The strength of Sanders’ movement is reflected in his blowout fundraising numbers — nearly $100 million for 2019 — which only rose in the wake of his heart attack. If Sanders wins Iowa (where polls have him in a dead heat for first), and New Hampshire (where he has a slight lead), then the argument about his supposed non-electability will begin to crumble — including among older black voters, who have so far been among Joe Biden’s most important pillars of support.
But even if Sanders won the nomination, how would he win the election? Perhaps more easily than people suspect.
Intensity among Democratic-leaning voters will never be greater. There will likely be no third-party challenger like Ralph Nader to shave his margin, or an influential “NeverSanders” wing among liberal pundits. He will find crossover support from former Trump voters in places like Ohio and Michigan, just as Trump found it from former Obama voters. To energize African-American support, he could choose Eric Holder or Stacey Abrams as his running mate.
Nor will scare tactics work any better against Sanders than they did against Trump. Overwrought comparisons with Hugo Chávez will wear thin, just as comparisons between Trump and Benito Mussolini did. The easiest move in American politics is to show yourself to be less scary than your caricature. Ronald Reagan’s devastating “There you go again” line against Jimmy Carter can be a Sanders quip, too.
I write all this as someone who thinks a Sanders presidency would be ruinous on many levels: by turning the Democratic Party into a socialist one; by turning the American economy into a statist one; and by turning America’s position in the world into a feeble one. I’d hate to see him win the nomination, just as I hated seeing Trump win it in 2016. But wishes aren’t facts. To say Sanders is unelectable is indefensible.

Texto completo: Once the faith of his youth had faded into the serene agnosticism of his mature years, Charles Darwin found himself amazed that anyone could even wish Christianity to be true. Not, that is, the kindlier bits — “Love thy neighbor” and whatnot — but rather the notion that unbelievers (including relatives and friends) might be tormented in hell forever.
It’s a reasonable perplexity, really. And it raises a troubling question of social psychology. It’s comforting to imagine that Christians generally accept the notion of a hell of eternal misery not because they’re emotionally attached to it, but because they see it as a small, inevitable zone of darkness peripheral to a larger spiritual landscape that — viewed in its totality — they find ravishingly lovely. And this is true of many.
But not of all. For a good number of Christians, hell isn’t just a tragic shadow cast across one of an otherwise ravishing vista’s remoter corners; rather, it’s one of the landscape’s most conspicuous and delectable details.
I know whereof I speak. I’ve published many books, often willfully provocative, and have vexed my share of critics. But only recently, in releasing a book challenging the historical validity, biblical origins, philosophical cogency and moral sanity of the standard Christian teaching on the matter of eternal damnation, have I ever inspired reactions so truculent, uninhibited and (frankly) demented.
I expect, of course, that people will defend the faith they’ve been taught. What I find odd is that, in my experience, raising questions about this particular detail of their faith evinces a more indignant and hysterical reaction from many believers than would almost any other challenge to their convictions. Something unutterably precious is at stake for them. Why?
After all, the idea comes to us in such a ghastly gallery of images: late Augustinianism’s unbaptized babes descending in their thrashing billions to a perpetual and condign combustion; Dante’s exquisitely psychotic dreamscapes of twisted, mutilated, broiling souls; St. Francis Xavier morosely informing his weeping Japanese converts that their deceased parents must suffer an eternity of agony; your poor old palpitant Aunt Maude on her knees each night in a frenzy of worry over her reprobate boys; and so on.
Surely it would be welcome news if it turned out that, on the matter of hell, something got garbled in transmission. And there really is room for doubt.
No truly accomplished New Testament scholar, for instance, believes that later Christianity’s opulent mythology of God’s eternal torture chamber is clearly present in the scriptural texts. It’s entirely absent from St. Paul’s writings; the only eschatological fire he ever mentions brings salvation to those whom it tries (1 Corinthians 3:15). Neither is it found in the other New Testament epistles, or in any extant documents (like the Didache) from the earliest post-apostolic period. There are a few terrible, surreal, allegorical images of judgment in the Book of Revelation, but nothing that, properly read, yields a clear doctrine of eternal torment. Even the frightening language used by Jesus in the Gospels, when read in the original Greek, fails to deliver the infernal dogmas we casually assume to be there.
On the other hand, many New Testament passages seem — and not metaphorically — to promise the eventual salvation of everyone. For example: “Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.” (Romans 5:18) Or: “For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:22) Or: “He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2) (Or: John 13:32; Romans 11:32; 1 Timothy 2:3-6; 4:10; Titus 2:11; and others.)
Admittedly, much theological ink has been spilled over the years explaining away the plain meaning of those verses. But it’s instructive that during the first half millennium of Christianity — especially in the Greek-speaking Hellenistic and Semitic East — believers in universal salvation apparently enjoyed their largest presence as a relative ratio of the faithful. Late in the fourth century, in fact, the theologian Basil the Great reported that the dominant view of hell among the believers he knew was of a limited, “purgatorial” suffering. Those were also the centuries that gave us many of the greatest Christian “universalists”: Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, Didymus the Blind, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Diodore of Tarsus and others.
Of course, once the Christian Church became part of the Roman Empire’s political apparatus, the grimmest view naturally triumphed. As the company of the baptized became more or less the whole imperial population, rather than only those people personally drawn to the faith, spiritual terror became an ever more indispensable instrument of social stability. And, even today, institutional power remains one potent inducement to conformity on this issue.
Still, none of that accounts for the deep emotional need many modern Christians seem to have for an eternal hell. And I don’t mean those who ruefully accept the idea out of religious allegiance, or whose sense of justice demands that Hitler and Pol Pot get their proper comeuppance, or who think they need the prospect of hell to keep themselves on the straight and narrow. Those aren’t the ones who scream and foam in rage at the thought that hell might be only a stage along the way to a final universal reconciliation. In those who do, something else is at work.
Theological history can boast few ideas more chilling than the claim (of, among others, Thomas Aquinas) that the beatitude of the saved in heaven will be increased by their direct vision of the torments of the damned (as this will allow them to savor their own immunity from sin’s consequences). But as awful as that sounds, it may be more honest in its sheer cold impersonality than is the secret pleasure that many of us, at one time or another, hope to derive not from seeing but from being seen by those we leave behind.
How can we be winners, after all, if there are no losers? Where’s the joy in getting into the gated community and the private academy if it turns out that the gates are merely decorative and the academy has an inexhaustible scholarship program for the underprivileged? What success can there be that isn’t validated by another’s failure? What heaven can there be for us without an eternity in which to relish the impotent envy of those outside its walls?
Not to sound too cynical. But it’s hard not to suspect that what many of us find intolerable is a concept of God that gives inadequate license to the cruelty of which our own imaginations are capable.
An old monk on Mount Athos in Greece once told me that people rejoice in the thought of hell to the precise degree that they harbor hell within themselves. By which he meant, I believe, that heaven and hell alike are both within us all, in varying degrees, and that, for some, the idea of hell is the treasury of their most secret, most cherished hopes — the hope of being proved right when so many were wrong, of being admired when so many are despised, of being envied when so many have been scorned.
And as Jesus said (Matthew 6:21), “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”

It's not up to black people to cure white racism

Texto completo: Before he broke Major League Baseball's race barrier in 1947, Jackie Robinson was summoned by Branch Rickey, a Brooklyn Dodgers team executive. According to Arnold Rampersad's Robinson biography, Rickey told Robinson, “I know you're a good ballplayer. What I don't know is whether you have the guts."
What Rickey wanted was a black man who would remain stoic even as n-words poured from dugouts and bleachers, or when opposing white players slid into him, their sharpened cleats held high. “I'm looking for a ballplayer," he said, "with guts enough not to fight back."
Always, black people are expected to accommodate bigotry. To cure racism, we're supposed to magically rise above it, instead of stripping it bare and calling out its practitioners and enablers. Just as foundational as racism itself is the corrosive belief that the burden of its eradication lays on the weary shoulders of those directly maligned by it.
Asking black people to stop racism is like asking women to stop sexism.
That's been an undercurrent to the recent drama swirling around Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to step back from their royal duties and split their time between England and North America. Even though Queen Elizabeth has endorsed the young couple's plans, a primary question from Markle's critics lingers: Yes, she's treated with racist disdain by the British media, but does she have to make such a big deal out of it?
This was The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd's terrible recent take: "Still, I think Meghan Markle should have wielded her wokeness where it is most needed — in Buckingham Palace," she wrote. “She could have channeled the Obamas, who did a magnificent job of rising above racist taunts and working within the institution to imprint a new image of racial possibility in America."
See, the racism that plagued Markle was her own fault because she refused to stiff-upper-lip her way through it. Also, white America reacted to the Obamas' “new image of racial possibility" — whatever that nonsense means — by electing this nation's most openly racist president.
In his January 2017 essay, “My President Was Black," Ta-Nehisi Coates said of the outgoing chief executive, “For eight years, Barack Obama walked on ice and never fell." Of course, Obama had no choice, even when he was deliberately pushed by racist GOP legislators or a future president. Had he put aside the noted Obama cool for a minute (as many of us wished he would), his presidency would have drowned in accusations that he was stirring racial unrest.
In a racist system, challenging racism is deemed worst than racism — that's why the International Olympic Committee has banned specific protests at the 2020 Summer Olympics, such as kneeling on the medal stand. As if politics haven't long played a prominent role in the Games. Athletes must learn to abide, although some are already resisting.
During his Hall of Fame career, Robinson did not resist Rickey's demand. Sixteen years after he retired, he was dead, at 53. Officially, he died from a heart attack. Unofficially, the enormous weight of the racism he was forced to ignore probably helped kill him.
At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Michelle Obama first spoke the line which has become her trademark: “When they go low, we go high." As first lady, she certainly endured her share of racist ire and handled it publicly with the same pragmatism and poise as her husband.
Whatever is thrown at us, black people are charged with having guts enough not to fight back — to rise above, regardless of the emotional and psychological cost. While the racists sit comfortably, we're chased higher into the thin, frigid air where we either find some temporary escape, like Meghan, or can no longer breathe at all, like Jackie.

Portland Stage brings ‘Almost, Maine’ back to Mainstage with playwright in starring role

Texto completo: After its opening on Portland Stage in 2004, “Almost, Maine” has traveled internationally breaking box office records, while its playwright, John Cariani, who grew up in Presque Isle, has collected acting credits on and off-Broadway, in TV and film, including a Tony-nomination for his portrayal of Motel in “Fiddler on the Roof.” With over 5,000 productions to date, “Almost, Maine” is so popular that it has become a contemporary classic. It’s been performed around the world and has been translated into over a dozen languages.
Anita Stewart, executive and artistic director of Portland Stage invited the play to its new works festival, The Little Festival of the Unexpected in 2003, and produced its Mainstage premiere in 2004. “‘Almost, Maine’ is a play that comes from the heart. Portland Stage is proud to have helped shape it and I am thrilled to embrace both John and his play once again. John’s play introduced Maine to the world and it is wonderful to see how excited our community is about this production.” Early ticket sales are on trend for this production of “Almost, Maine” to become the highest attended mainstage production in Portland Stage’s history.
The New York Times described “Almost, Maine” as “A higher-concept and more clever version of Hollywood hits like ‘Love Actually’ and ‘Valentine’s Day,’ this rom-com leans on shrewd writing rather than star power in its nine interlocking love stories. (It) alternates beautiful, evocative prose with stutteringly awkward exchanges and often very funny sight gags.”
“‘Almost, Maine’ is a loosely connected collection of love stories based in a fictional northern Maine town (that isn’t quite a town) called Almost, Maine, and those stories are all slightly surreal—and they’re romantic—and not sentimental,” explains John Cariani. “There’s a great quote by F. Scott Fitzgerald—and I’m paraphrasing, but you get the gist, ‘… the sentimental person thinks things will work out and last; the romantic person has a desperate confidence that they won’t—that they’ll fall apart.’ I’m a romantic person, not a sentimentalist. I’m always worried that things are going to fall apart and not work out. And ‘Almost, Maine’ is full of romantics–and it’s for romantics. Most romantic comedies are actually sentimental comedies. In a true romantic comedy—you want to feel like the characters’ desires will never be fulfilled, so it’s thrilling when they are fulfilled. Sentimental comedies make you feel like everything’s going to work out. Romantic comedies make you worry. And ‘Almost Maine’ is a romantic comedy, and it features working people – people who work in heating & cooling and in wood chip mills, in paper mills. Because people who really work for a living have fantastic, spectacular, beautiful things happen to them like—love.”
“I am a character actor, and as a character actor, you play the sidekick to help the star get the guy, the girl, the money, or the dream, but you don’t get anything for your own character. I wanted to write a play for a bunch of character actors. You can be any kind of human and be in ‘Almost, Maine.’ It’s a bunch of love stories meant to be played by people who aren’t what we would consider “hot.” This bunch of love stories is for people who don’t look like actors—they’re for people who look like people. They’re for ragtag character actors—who don’t get to play ‘lovers’ usually.”
“Almost, Maine” is currently the most frequently produced play in North American high schools topping perennial favorites “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “You Can’t Take It with You,” and “Our Town,” so it is no surprise that area schools clamored to participate in this production’s Portland Stage Student Matinee Program which annually provides more than 7,000 students with discounted tickets for student matinees. The goal of the program is to help students gain understanding of their own lives by connecting on a deeper level to productions that explore and mirror the world in which they live. Following the performance, students participate in a talk-back discussion with the cast and crew, which helps them gain awareness of the creative process and encourages them to think critically about the themes and messages of the play. There are 567 students coming to see “Almost, Maine” with their school from Falmouth Middle School, Greely High School, Brunswick High School, Cape Elizabeth High School, Fryeburg Academy, Gorham High School, Maine Coast Waldorf School, Yarmouth High School, Falmouth High School, Waynflete, Blue Hill Harbor School, and Presque Isle High School, the high school that John Cariani attended and consistently praises for his experiences in their drama department.
Portland Stage had to adjust its original scheduled run of “Almost, Maine” to accommodate Cariani’s newly acquired role in “Caroline, or Change,” a Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori musical which begins rehearsals in early February and begins previews March 13 at Studio 54 in New York. Also to Cariani’s acting credit, he has recently appeared on Broadway as Itzik in the Tony Award-winning musical, “The Band’s Visit.” Other Broadway credits include Nigel Bottom in “Something Rotten!” for which he received an Outer Critics Circle Award nomination; and “Fiddler on the Roof” for which he won an Outer Critics Circle Award and received a Tony Award nomination. On film, John has shared the screen with Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and Ed Asner. On television, he’s probably best known for his recurring roles on Law & Order, Numb3rs, and The Onion News Network. He has recently guest starred on “The Blacklist” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”
This production will feature John Cariani from Jan. 15-Feb. 2 and again on Feb. 8 and 9. Dustin Tucker will fill in for John on Feb. 5, 6 and 7. The other three cast members are from New York City and Los Angeles: Raymond McAnally, Kathy McCafferty, and Samantha Rosentrater. All are members of the Actors’ Equity Association. Sally Wood directs the play. Set design, which includes a forest on stage, is by Anita Stewart.
Cariani has also recently finished a novel version of “Almost, Maine,” published by Macmillan Publishing, which will be released in March.
Portland Stage is located at 25 Forest Ave., Portland, and offers Mainstage performances, New Works, and Education programs. The 2019-20 offers one co-production musical with Maine State Music Theatre, six Mainstage Productions, Staged Readings of its commissions, and Studio Series productions. PSC promotes and celebrates the creation of new plays with an environment that supports the region’s playwrights, builds bridges between its theater and national writers, and builds awareness of theater with three exciting initiatives: The Clauder Competition, the Little Festival of the Unexpected, as well as From Away, a festival in collaboration with the International Writing Program (IWP) at the University of Iowa. This year, Portland Stage also celebrates its 10th season of the Susie Konkel Theater for Kids and the 100,000 student experiences it has provided in the last decade through the Theater for Kids.

Texto completo: Donald Trump isn’t George W. Bush.
That should be obvious to everyone by now, but his critics and even some of his supporters immediately acted as if it were 2003 on the cusp of the Iraq War when Trump took out Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" />
Suddenly, the neocons had cachet again (Vox warned that “the Iraq War hawks are back”), and we were about to launch yet another endless war. Trump’s decision to kill Soleimani, New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote, repeating a common refrain, “has brought the United States to the brink of a devastating new conflict in the Middle East.”
There’s no doubt that the operation against Soleimani carried risks, but it didn’t transform Trump into a conventional interventionist. In fact, taking out Soleimani was wholly consistent with the president’s approach to the world that can’t be plotted on a simple hawk/dove or neocon/isolationist axis. As a Jacksonian, Trump is none of the above, combining a willingness to whack our enemies with a distaste for ambitious foreign interventions.
The Jacksonian label is the famous construction of foreign-policy analyst Walter Russell Mead, who traces the tradition back to Andrew Jackson and the cultural influence of the American backwoods. Jacksonians are content to let the world sort itself out, except if they perceive a threat, in which case they react with great ferocity.
Trump’s victory overturned the reigning Republican foreign-policy consensus, but it didn’t herald a lurch to isolationism pure and simple.
Even when Trump sounded most hostile to U.S. commitments and alliances abroad in 2016, he promised, in one of his most Jacksonian sentiments, to “bomb the s—” out of ISIS. No matter how much Trump disdained being in the Middle East, it wouldn’t be possible to follow through on this threat without military assets, an intelligence network and allies on the ground. Once elected, Trump did, sure enough, bomb the s— out of ISIS.
Killing Soleimani is keeping with this general orientation rather than a departure from it. In fact, the whole thing is shot through with Jacksonian attitudes.
Trump’s red line to Iran didn’t have to do with our values or shipping lanes. It reflected the most basic imperative of a nation protecting its own: Don’t harm Americans.
When a rocket attack by an Iranian-supported militia killed an American contractor and injured other Americans at a base in Iraq, Trump’s response was also characteristically Jacksonian: a stunning, bolt-out-of-the-blue droning of an enemy commander who was thought to be safely out of bounds, designed to create the maximum deterrent bang for the buck.
All of this is why the complaint from Trump’s populist backers that the president has been co-opted by deep-state warmongers, putting at risk his political base, is misplaced. Trump never promised anyone he’d refuse to respond to threats to Americans, or honor the unspoken rules protecting a bloodstained high official of a hostile foreign regime. In fact, if Trump had said any of these things, it would have been out of character.
Bellicosity of a certain kind — taunting and over the top, boasting of our awesome military capabilities and motivated by considerations of personal and national honor — is key to the Trump brand.
The killing of Soleimani is likelier to add to the legend of Donald Trump for his most loyal backers instead of give them pause. In their view, here is President Trump once again doing what no other president would do, taking an inordinate amount of criticism for it, often from a perpetually hysterical press corps, and having it work out (so far).
The Jacksonian impulse alone is not enough to solve the complex foreign-policy problem presented by Iran. But it can be useful in a contest of intimidation and escalation. The killing of Soleimani isn’t a deep-state or neocon project, rather an unmistakable expression of Trump’s distinctive worldview.

Texto completo: El vuelo duró unos siete minutos: el avión de Ukraine International despega del Aeropuerto Internacional Imán Jomeini en Teherán, un misil lo impacta y se estrella. Mueren las 176 personas a bordo.
Horas antes, Irán había lanzado un ataque con misiles contra dos bases que albergan militares de EE.UU. en Irak en represalia a la operación con la que el presidente Donald Trump ordenó matar en Bagdad al general Qasem Soleimani, el jefe de las fuerzas Quds, el batallón de élite del país persa.
* Irán admite que derribó “por error” el avión de Ukraine International
* Canadá y EE.UU. creen que el Boeing 737 de Ukraine International fue “derribado por error” por Irán
Pero el ataque, que fue presentado con aspavientos por los medios iraníes como la consumación de la “venganza severa” por el “martirio de Soleimani”, fue limitado: no hubo pérdidas de vidas estadounidenses y los daños materiales fueron mínimos.
De hecho, las víctimas de las tensiones por el conflicto entre los dos países no serían militares y estaban a cientos de kilómetros de las bases atacadas.
Antes, durante y después del ataque, los aviones siguieron despegando con normalidad desde Teherán: el país estaba en alerta máxima pero nunca cerró su espacio aéreo.
Según reconoció el gobierno el sábado, un “ error humano ” llevó a que se confundiera la aeronave que despegaba con un misil de EE.UU.: las defensas se activaron y el vuelo PS752 fue derribado.
Getty ImagesEl avión de Ukraine International había despegado de Teherán con destino a Kiev cuando fue derribado.
Por tres días -y pese a que la evidencia era abrumadora- Irán negó estar detrás de la catástrofe e insistió que se había tratado de un “ problema técnico ” del avión.
Cuando finalmente el gobierno de Teherán reveló que un misil disparado por error había derribado el Boeing 737, se ganó cierto reconocimiento de la comunidad internacional por dar un paso hacia la transparencia, pero revivió también la llama de un peligroso polvorín interno.
Cientos de personas salieron a la calle durante el fin de semana y este lunes para protestar por lo que consideran un intento del gobierno de ocultar la verdad sobre lo que pasó con el avión de Ukraine Airlines.
Y aunque la policía negó haber disparado contra los manifestantes, diversos reportes y videos en redes sociales indican que varias personas resultaron heridas cuando las fuerzas de seguridad disolvieron las protestas Teherán.
Last week: Massive (state-organized) funerals for Soleimani This week: Iranians openly tearing down Soleimani posterpic.twitter.com/WZMQ1TaXqz

El propio presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, mostró su simpatía a los manifestantes (incluso con tuits en farsi) y lanzó amenazas contra los líderes de Irán para que no agredieran a los manifestantes.
Las manifestaciones del fin de semana fueron un insólito giro pocos días después de que Irán se uniera masivamente en el duelo por la muerte de Soleimani, cuyo funeral lanzó a millones de personas a las calles en apoyo a su gobierno y en rechazo generalizado a Estados Unidos.
Pero ¿cómo la tragedia del avión ucraniano dio un vuelco y trastocó el apoyo de la semana previa en convulsión social contra el gobierno?
Pero de acuerdo con el Middle East Institue, la presión que enfrenta el gobierno de Irán no es solo económica: el país también ha perdido fuerza en su influencia regional en los últimos meses, lo que demostró la reciente quema de uno de sus consulados en Irak.
Y ahora Teherán también puede enfrentar demandas de compensación de las naciones cuyos ciudadanos murieron en el avión, según anunció el lunes el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Ucrania, Vadym Prystaiko.
“Hemos creado este grupo de ministros de relaciones exteriores de las naciones en duelo. El 16 de enero, nos reuniremos en persona en Londres para discutir las formas, incluidas las legales, cómo estamos siguiendo esto, cómo los estamos procesando “, dijo a la BBC.
Pero además de las protestas y la presión externa, algunas voces con repercusión internacional también se han sumado a las críticas al gobierno.
El capitán del equipo nacional de voleibol masculino, Said Marouf, escribió en Instagram sobre lo que llamó la “opresión” en Irán y, en una aparente referencia al derribo del avión, dijo que esperaba que su país hubiera visto su “último espectáculo” de “engaño y estupidez”.
Una de las actrices más famosas del país, Taraneh Alidoosti, publicó que los iraníes no estaban siendo tratados como ciudadanos sino como “rehenes”, mientras, la única medallista olímpica femenina de esa nación, Kimia Alizadeh, anunció que había desertado.
Incluso algunos conservadores de línea dura que exaltaban a los militares y que hasta el viernes se mostraban orgullosos del conflicto con EE.UU. cuestionaron “las decisiones deliberadas” de altos funcionarios militares de “desinformar al público”.
Hamideh Zarabadi, miembro del parlamento de la ciudad conservadora de Qazvin, dijo que Irán debería celebrar un funeral de estado para las víctimas y escribir sobre cada ataúd, 80 millones de veces, que condenaba la guerra.
AFPEstudiantes se manifestaron fuera de la universidad Amir Kabir, una vigilia que se convirtió en protesta.
En tanto, el editor en jefe de la agencia oficial de noticias Tasnim, Kian Abdollahi, escribió que mentirle al público fue tan catastrófico como la tragedia del avión y que todos los funcionarios que ocultaron la verdad debían ser procesados.
Según The New York Times, una valla publicitaria en el centro de Teherán que mostraba una foto de Soleimani fue retirada y, en su lugar, se colgó una pancarta negra con los nombres de las víctimas del incidente y una leyenda sobre el dolor.
Una metáfora, tal vez, de que el duelo y la ira por la muerte del general han encontrado otros rumbos más oscuros para el gobierno.
“Aunque estas últimas protestas probablemente también serán reprimidas como las anteriores, la ira contra Jamenei y sus soldados de la Guardia Revolucionaria no desaparecerá”, opina Vatankas.

Texto completo: Building housing
EDITOR: During World War II, the government found a way to quickly build thousands of units to house families who were moving to the Bay Area to work in war industries. Why can’t our current government find a way to build affordable housing for the huge population in this state (some of them working every day)?
It seems to me that the old Sutter hospital would be a good place to start. Remodel that facility, including retrofitting it for earthquakes. Since the local government already owns that property, it would seem like a very good down payment on turning that property into quite a lot of small, affordable units.
Maybe our local governing bodies need to ask their constituents for workable ideas.
CHARLENE STONE
Santa Rosa
Ridiculous recall
EDITOR: Stuart Kiehl’s effort to recall Supervisor Lynda Hopkins is ridiculous (“Recall effort targeting Hopkins,” Jan. 5). Don’t blame. Be part of the solution. Hopkins is an outstanding leader and person of action for the west county and all of Sonoma County. Early on in her term, she began advocating for homeless services and housing solutions. Unfortunately, proposals such as the Guerneville homeless shelter a few years ago were thwarted by “not in my backyard” folks.
So which is better? Having children step over homeless neighbors on their way to school or providing a home for our less-fortunate neighbors and showing our children that we care?
According to your article, Kiehl was against the conversion of Sam Jones Hall, which now houses almost 200 people. Had his objection worked, our Joe Rodota Trail camp could now be up to 400 people.
I feel terrible that things have failed, and we have not been able to figure this out. Now homeless persons are literally in Keihl’s backyard. But we are all, so to speak, in the same backyard. We must stop blaming, be more empathetic, stop the NIMBYism and work together toward a solution. Hopkins is doing just that.

Arts in schools
EDITOR: I read with interest the Jan. 5 article about a necessary resurgence of arts classes in Santa Rosa schools to better comply with state law (“4 out of 5 schools fall behind in arts education”). As we all know, music, art and drama are among the most fun parts of school. They keep students interested and enrolled.
Participation has many side benefits, such as increasing cognitive skills, hand-to-eye coordination, social integration and self-esteem. So why wouldn’t our schools do everything possible to preserve these programs and find less expensive ways to teach the three R’s?
There are some protections for arts in schools, but not enough. I have a simple suggestion to improve sustainability of music programs, especially in our secondary schools. All we need is for colleges to accept music as a foreign language.
Not only is music a universally understood language all over the world, but one learns actual foreign words placed on the sheet music, where notations are present concerning tempo, articulation, type of instrument, key changes and other instructions. It’s a win-win.
If anyone knows a college regent anywhere, please pass this suggestion along.

Partisan perspectives
EDITOR: I like Margaret Sullivan, and I’m a Republican who watches Fox News in addition to mainstream media outlets. When Sullivan was public editor of the New York Times, her views were spot on and sometimes in direct opposition of her fellow columnists and her employer. So I’m surprised by her outlook about conservative media (“Exploring the alternate universe of right-wing media,” pressdemocrat.com/opinion).
As for museums, I visited Washington’s National Museum of African American History and Culture and was impressed. But I couldn’t help but notice that there is no display — or even mention — of Clarence Thomas, the conservative African American Supreme Court justice. Yet the museum has space for such role models as Jay Z and Beyoncé? Is this what happens when members of a board of trustees of such institutions favor one political party over another?
As for President Donald Trump’s war powers, he has, as commander in chief, the right to knock out people who threaten and kill Americans — just like President Barack Obama used drones many times to knock out foreign adversaries. Under Obama’s watch, liberals and conservatives rightfully cheered when Osama bin Laden was knocked out by Navy SEALS.
Why the sudden objection from many in Congress and the media now? Is it because Trump is a Republican while Obama is a Democrat?

Bolton’s testimony
EDITOR: When our prevaricator in chief tells Fox News that he would invoke executive privilege to try to block former national security adviser John Bolton from testifying at the Senate impeachment trial, it is glaringly obvious that he didn’t have a “perfect” phone call with Ukraine. If he is, as he claims, completely innocent, what does he have to fear from the testimony of Bolton?
Let the truth come forth, and let us see what Senate Republicans who will take an oath to protect the Constitution and act fairly during the impeachment trial will do; act according to their collective consciences or continue to toady up to the most corrupt president in our history.

Texto completo: Joshua R. Helmer is no longer executive director of the Erie Art Museum, following a recent New York Times article raising questions about his behavior with women in that position as well in his previous job at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
Helmer, 31, is "no longer employed at the Erie Art Museum," according to a terse, unsigned statement posted on the museum's Facebook page Monday afternoon. "The Museum appreciates, in advance, the community's support as we move forward."
A man answering the phone at the Erie museum Monday, who declined to identify himself, said the museum would have no further statement at this time.
Pressure for Helmer's removal began to mount over the weekend with the circulation of a change.org petition calling for the art executive's removal. The story in the Times alleged that Helmer entered into relationships with more junior-level female employees while holding out chances for professional advancement.
Helmer, who was the first person to occupy the post of assistant director of interpretation, separated from the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 2018 for undisclosed reasons. He declined to discuss his relationships with the Times. "That's personal information," he told the newspaper. "You keep your personal life private."
He came to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 2013 and was a favorite of director and CEO Timothy Rub, according to Art Museum staffers. Rub declined to talk with The Inquirer, but said in a statement Monday:
"We care deeply for our staff and firmly believe that all voices should be heard. We are listening closely and we are also taking action. As I noted to staff last Friday, we will be engaging outside consultants to conduct a close review of our workplace environment, our policies and programs, including training activities so we understand how we can be better in the future. We will do everything we can to address the concerns of staff so that we can move forward together."
Art Museum staffers have voiced frustration with the way management handled complaints about Helmer, and by the time the Times published its story last week, their frustrations could be found in comments online and in the form of "We Believe Women" buttons they wore to work.
Rub, in an email to staff Friday afternoon co-signed by Art Museum president Gail Harrity, assured staff that the museum was interested in employees feeling "comfortable sharing any concerns they may have about the workplace. This is not simply an obligation, but also a strongly held belief." The email said the museum had "initiated plans to work with outside experts who will gather input from staff and conduct a review of our workplace environment, our policies and programs, including training activities, so we understand how we can be better in the future."
But these moves did not quell the anger. Art Museum employees were among the more than 3,000 who signed the change.org petition started by Erie activist Katie DiPrinzio urging Helmer's removal, with many adding pointed comments.
DiPrinzio, 29, said she was "really angered and troubled" after reading the Times article, which spurred her to launch the internet petition.
"Erie is a really, really small city," she said. "We have one museum, this is it, and we care about what happens there."
After the museum announced Helmer's departure, DiPrinzio, in an interview with The Inquirer, said questions remain: Why was he hired? What will prevent something similar from happening again?
On Monday, a separate statement of solidarity, drafted by museum staffers and approved by the women who spoke to the Times, was signed by more than 250 current and former Philadelphia Museum of Art employees. In part, it read:
"This is not an isolated incident unique to one institution but endemic to the field. We call for greater accountability from the institution for which we work and about which we care so deeply. Structural change is required to ensure that abusers aren't enabled, employees feel safe reporting abuse, and no one fears retaliation for coming forward. Museums can and should do better."
Among those from the Philadelphia Museum of Art staff who put their names to the statement are highly regarded curators Kathleen A. Foster, senior curator of American art and director of the museum's Center for American Art; Felice Fischer, curator of Japanese art and senior curator of East Asian art; Peter Barberie, the museum's curator of photographs; and Elisabeth Agro, associate curator of American modern and contemporary crafts and decorative arts.
After Helmer's departure from Erie was announced Monday, Adam Rizzo, a museum educator at the Philadelphia museum who helped to draft the statement, expressed a need for continued change at the institution.
"It's great Josh is no longer in a position of power and can't harm anyone anymore. But what I still find frustrating is that the structural inequities that allowed him to thrive are still in place," Rizzo told The Inquirer. "This guy, he created a toxic environment in the museum. He was so close with management, we felt powerless to do anything."
Rizzo said the women who spoke to the Times about Helmer helped him and his colleagues to "actually take some action."
"If they can speak out, we can do this petition, we can send out a tweet," he said.
In announcing Helmer's appointment to the job in Erie in May 2018, the museum's former board president, Stephen Porter, said that "while at the PMA, Josh was tasked with leading the museum in a complete rethinking of how it engaged its nearly 800,000 visitors a year."
Porter concluded: "I am confident that we now have exactly the type of dynamic, enthusiastic leader the Erie Art Museum - and this region - needs. Please join me in welcoming Josh to our community."

Texto completo: The International Association of Blacks in Dance (IABD) is coming together in Philadelphia this week. That means that starting Wednesday, there are dance performances every night. It also means that 63 instructors will be giving classes in dance traditions that span the diaspora.
So, for example, if you wanted to see performances from Philadanco, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and the Dance Theatre of Harlem, among others, all on the same bill, that would be Saturday night.
If you wanted one of Beyonc's longtime choreographers as a hip-hop teacher, on midnight Friday, Chris Grant will be here, and you'd have your chance.
Noted scholar Brenda Dixon-Gottschild, a professor emerita of dance studies at Temple University, lavished praise on the lineup. "I would suggest that [people] choose a concert on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday night - one or more - and come and taste. Come and feel. Come and experience. Come and see," Dixon-Gottschild said. "I think that you will leave with love."
It would be a grave mistake, she said, to assume that since it's a gathering for black dance, that there's sameness across the dozens of companies.
"Every black dance company is different," she explained. With showcase concerts that may feature seven or more ensembles, the diversity of perspectives will be apparent. "In a sense, it's not the same as a deep dive into one dance ensemble, but it's a taste of many different styles and ways of thinking dance . . . of embodying ways of making art."
Philadelphia hosted the IABD's first ever festival and conference in 1988, then called the 1st International Conference on Black Dance Companies. It was the brainchild of Philadanco founder Joan Myers Brown, whom Dixon-Gottschild calls the mother of IABD. Now, Philadanco and Brown are hosting this 2020 festival during one the last months of Brown's tenure as executive artistic director. Brown, who turned 88 on Christmas, plans to retire this spring.
What should festivalgoers look out for? Dixon-Gottschild shared tips. .
A day for tap
On Wednesday, the Tap Philly Style program brings afternoon and evening classes at the University of the Arts. After these workshops end, there will be a 10 p.m. tap jam. The classes cost $25, and the jam costs $20. The lead teaching artists will be Jason Samuels Smith, an Emmy winner who is both the son and grandson of celebrated dancers, and Dormeishia, who was recently hailed as "the queen of tap" in the New York Times. Of Dormeishia, Dixon-Gottschild gushed: "This person is like the epitome of tap dance."
Philly proud
Philly companies make up the vast majority of the roster Wednesday night, for the show that opens the festival's concert series at the Merriam Theater. Tickets are $60. That includes Kulu Mele African Dance & Drum Ensemble, Waheed Works, and Just Sole! Street Dance Theater Company, among others. The ensemble
DMB|#dbdanceproject, led by Rowan dance professor Dawn Marie Bazemore, is also set to perform.
Thomas Prestø
On Thursday at 4:30 p.m. and on Friday at 2:45 p.m., Norwegian dancer Thomas Prestø, who leads his Tabanka African & Caribbean Peoples Dance Ensemble in Oslo, will be teaching a class at the University of the Arts. Non-IABD members may register for the price of $35 a class. Prestø will be teaching his technique, which Dixon-Gottschild called "indescribably beautiful in the way that he has codified and expanded on African dance tropes and made a vocabulary of his own."
A roundtable for sharing support
Dixon-Gottschild, founder of the Coalition for Diasporan Scholars Moving, leads a session annually at IABD for attendees to come together to discuss struggles and barriers in academia and dance culture. Her Saturday afternoon roundtable this year, Collective Strategies for Diasporan Women in Dance, will include academics from the U.K. and the U.S. at the Doubletree Hotel. (This event requires registration for IABD's conference, which is running at multiple locations. Non-IABD members may purchase registration for one session at $35.)
"What's important about this session is that it becomes a kind of clearinghouse and learning moment for how certain people have come up against the wall, how they have dealt with it, if they got through it, and if they didn't, what techniques would they suggest and what is their takeaway?" Dixon-Gottschild said. "The last hour of the session is an open discussion with the audience. And it's a very deep and necessary place that we need to go and stop and take stock, in the middle of all that we are still enduring."
The trailblazers' performance
The IABD began with five companies: Philadanco, Dallas Black Dance Theatre, Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, Lula Washington Dance Theatre from Los Angeles, and Denver's Cleo Parker Robinson Dance. Dixon-Gottschild is looking forward to seeing them all at the Saturday night performance at the Merriam Theater. Tickets are available for $60.
Dixon-Gottschild, who wrote the 2012 book Joan Myers Brown and the Audacious Hope of the Black Ballerina, said the significance of each founding company remains profound: "These five companies are unforgettable in their persistence, in their continuity, and in their continuing to thrive against all the odds,"
Performing with them, in addition to Alvin Ailey and the Dance Theatre of Harlem, is the Brooklyn-based company Evidence, led by the prestigious choreographer Ronald K. Brown.
Praise through dance
On Sunday morning, there's a concert and awards brunch at the Bellevue Hotel that will focus on liturgical dance. Admission is $100. Typically, Dixon-Gottschild said via email, youth groups "give a beautiful 'sermon' with their young dancing bodies, with gospel music accompaniment." Every year, she insists, this event is consistently "jaw-dropping."

Come and see," Dixon-Gottschild said. "I think that you will leave with love."
It would be a grave mistake, she said, to assume that since it's a gathering for black dance, that there's sameness across the dozens of companies.
"Every black dance company is different," she explained. With showcase concerts that may feature seven or more ensembles, the diversity of perspectives will be apparent. "In a sense, it's not the same as a deep dive into one dance ensemble, but it's a taste of many different styles and ways of thinking dance . . . of embodying ways of making art."
Philadelphia hosted the IABD's first ever festival and conference in 1988, then called the 1st International Conference on Black Dance Companies. It was the brainchild of Philadanco founder Joan Myers Brown, whom Dixon-Gottschild calls the mother of IABD. Now, Philadanco and Brown are hosting this 2020 festival during one the last months of Brown's tenure as executive artistic director. Brown, who turned 88 on Christmas, plans to retire this spring.
What should festivalgoers look out for? Dixon-Gottschild shared tips. .
A day for tap
On Wednesday, the Tap Philly Style program brings afternoon and evening classes at the University of the Arts. After these workshops end, there will be a 10 p.m. tap jam. The classes cost $25, and the jam costs $20. The lead teaching artists will be Jason Samuels Smith, an Emmy winner who is both the son and grandson of celebrated dancers, and Dormeishia, who was recently hailed as "the queen of tap" in the New York Times. Of Dormeishia, Dixon-Gottschild gushed: "This person is like the epitome of tap dance."
Philly proud
Philly companies make up the vast majority of the roster Wednesday night, for the show that opens the festival's concert series at the Merriam Theater. Tickets are $60. That includes Kulu Mele African Dance & Drum Ensemble, Waheed Works, and Just Sole! Street Dance Theater Company, among others. The ensemble DMB|#dbdanceproject, led by Rowan dance professor Dawn Marie Bazemore, is also set to perform.
Thomas Prestø
On Thursday at 4:30 p.m. and on Friday at 2:45 p.m., Norwegian dancer Thomas Prestø, who leads his Tabanka African & Caribbean Peoples Dance Ensemble in Oslo, will be teaching a class at the University of the Arts. Non-IABD members may register for the price of $35 a class. Prestø will be teaching his technique, which Dixon-Gottschild called "indescribably beautiful in the way that he has codified and expanded on African dance tropes and made a vocabulary of his own."
A roundtable for sharing support
Dixon-Gottschild, founder of the Coalition for Diasporan Scholars Moving, leads a session annually at IABD for attendees to come together to discuss struggles and barriers in academia and dance culture. Her Saturday afternoon roundtable this year, Collective Strategies for Diasporan Women in Dance, will include academics from the U.K. and the U.S. at the Doubletree Hotel. (This event requires registration for IABD's conference, which is running at multiple locations. Non-IABD members may purchase registration for one session at $35.)
"What's important about this session is that it becomes a kind of clearinghouse and learning moment for how certain people have come up against the wall, how they have dealt with it, if they got through it, and if they didn't, what techniques would they suggest and what is their takeaway?" Dixon-Gottschild said. "The last hour of the session is an open discussion with the audience. And it's a very deep and necessary place that we need to go and stop and take stock, in the middle of all that we are still enduring."
The trailblazers' performance
The IABD began with five companies: Philadanco, Dallas Black Dance Theatre, Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, Lula Washington Dance Theatre from Los Angeles, and Denver's Cleo Parker Robinson Dance. Dixon-Gottschild is looking forward to seeing them all at the Saturday night performance at the Merriam Theater. Tickets are available for $60.
Dixon-Gottschild, who wrote the 2012 book Joan Myers Brown and the Audacious Hope of the Black Ballerina, said the significance of each founding company remains profound: "These five companies are unforgettable in their persistence, in their continuity, and in their continuing to thrive against all the odds,"
Performing with them, in addition to Alvin Ailey and the Dance Theatre of Harlem, is the Brooklyn-based company Evidence, led by the prestigious choreographer Ronald K. Brown.
Praise through dance
On Sunday morning, there's a concert and awards brunch at the Bellevue Hotel that will focus on liturgical dance. Admission is $100. Typically, Dixon-Gottschild said via email, youth groups "give a beautiful 'sermon' with their young dancing bodies, with gospel music accompaniment." Every year, she insists, this event is consistently "jaw-dropping."

Bernie Beats Hillary; Activists celebrate the end of moderation in the Democratic field.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders lost the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton. But even if he loses again in 2020, his long-term project to pull Democratic candidates in the direction of socialism is already a success.
Today the left-leaning Americans for Tax Fairness is celebrating the end of moderation among Democrats seeking the White House. The organization gleefully announces:
All four leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have proposed tax and spending plans many times the size of Hillary Clinton's fiscal plan in 2016, showing how far the debate has shifted in the progressive direction in four years. Like Clinton, they would all raise taxes almost exclusively on the wealthy and corporations to improve public services working families rely on like healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
Don't believe that part about taxes only hitting the rich and corporations. But it's hard to argue the point that radicalism is the new normal for office-seeking Democrats. According to the lefty outfit:
Clinton proposed upping tax revenue on the wealthy and corporations by $1.4 trillion over 10 years to pay for $1.7 trillion in public investments. Biden and Buttigieg have both offered up plans raising taxes on the rich and corporations by around $3.4 trillion, although both have made statements suggesting their totals could go quite a bit higher. Sanders and Warren are proposing around $10 trillion in high-income and corporate tax hikes, exclusive of the revenue they propose raising for their Medicare for All plans.
Notably, Michael Bennet, another moderate Democrat running for president, has proposed raising $5.2 billion from the wealthy and corporations to fund $6 trillion in new investments.
The organization estimates $28.4 trillion in new tax hikes under the plans described by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and $22 trillion in tax increases proposed by Mr. Sanders.
The Sanders tax tab would almost certainly be much higher to cover the cost of all his new spending. In October Brian Riedl wrote in City Journal:
All told, Sanders's current plans would cost as much as $97.5 trillion over the next decade, and total government spending at all levels would surge to as high as 70 percent of gross domestic product. Approximately half of the American workforce would be employed by the government. The ten-year budget deficit would approach $90 trillion, with average annual deficits exceeding 30 percent of GDP... This unprecedented outlay would more than double the size of the federal government.
Now Ronald Brownstein writes for CNN:
Sanders' plan, though all of its costs cannot be precisely quantified, would increase government spending as a share of the economy far more than the New Deal under President Franklin Roosevelt, the Great Society under Lyndon Johnson or the agenda proposed by any recent Democratic presidential nominee, including liberal George McGovern in 1972, according to a historical analysis shared with CNN by Larry Summers, the former chief White House economic adviser for Barack Obama and treasury secretary for Bill Clinton.
As much success as Mr. Sanders has had in persuading nomination rivals to adopt radical positions, his history and policy proposals say that the Sanders economic wrecking ball would be the most destructive of all.
***
Mr. Sanders' radical politics don't stop at the water's edge. The Vermont senator routinely insists that his version of socialist governance would be nothing like the murderous reigns of the world's Marxist tyrants. But then he keeps insisting on saying nice things about the world's Marxist tyrants. In a recent visit to the New York Times, Mr. Sanders said :
In terms of Evo Morales [of Bolivia], his record was a pretty good record. He went a long way to limit or to cut back on extreme poverty in a very poor country. Give a voice to the indigenous people of that country. Should he have run for another term although they made it legal? Probably not. But you know, within the context of what?... I think Morales probably should not have run again, but his record is not a bad record.
This week the Journal's Mary Anastasia O'Grady notes Mr. Morales' warm relations with Iran and in November reviewed the appalling Morales record:
The South American socialist, who had ruled Bolivia like a tyrant for 14 uninterrupted years, fled his country after the army told him earlier this month that it would not use force against demonstrators protesting a fraudulent election.
Ms. O'Grady added that Mr. Morales is "secretary-general of the Bolivian federation of coca growers, one of the largest producers and distributors of cocaine in the Western Hemisphere" and "trampled the rights of the lowland indigenous people in the Amazon when they opposed the expansion of the coca business". She adds:
...in the early years of his tenure he used his popularity and a commodity boom to destroy his country's democratic institutions.
But Mr. Morales's popularity declined when commodity prices tumbled, the economy slowed, and the government ran low on money.
The country remains one of the poorest in Latin America. The only way to credit Mr. Morales with "a pretty good record" is by judging success as adherence to Marxist ideology and the trashing of individual liberty.
Bernie Sanders is giving Americans who cherish freedom fair warning of the misery he intends to impose on them. Why would Democrats want to follow his lead?

For Corporate Headquarters, Could Denver Be The New Dublin?
Assuming U.S. voters don't decide to abandon the market economy in November, they can continue to enjoy a new phenomenon resulting from President Trump's 2017 enactment of corporate income tax reform. While Mr. Trump's predecessor sought ways to prevent companies from fleeing the U.S. tax burden, there's now a competitiveness argument for moving into the United States. The Canadian Press wire service reports today:
Shareholders in Encana Corp. have voted overwhelmingly in favour of the oil and gas company moving its headquarters to Denver from Calgary and changing its name to Ovintiv Inc.
CEO Doug Suttles says the 90 per cent vote in favour of the resolution shows clear support for the long-standing Canadian company's decision to move its corporate home south of the border...
It says a corporate domicile in the United States will expose it to increasingly larger pools of investment in U.S. index funds and passively managed accounts, as well as better align it with its U.S. peers.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Evidence unveiled Tuesday in the impeachment proceeding against President Donald Trump shows an associate of his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, worked to get the Ukraine government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.
The documents appear to show that Giuliani and Lev Parnas, who faces unrelated campaign finance charges, knew the U. S. ambassador to Ukraine would be removed the day before it happened last year.
The materials, provided to Congress by Parnas' lawyer on Monday, were released Tuesday by four House committees.
They include Parnas' handwritten notes on stationery from the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Vienna, the committees said. One page refers to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky: "get Zalensky to annouce that the Biden case will be Investigated. "
House Democrats impeached Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for withholding military aid and a White House visit in order to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden. That included Trump's personal request to Zelensky for an investigation, made in a July 25 call.
Evidence released Tuesday shows Zelensky was aware of accusations against Biden in May, well before that call, according to the committees.
U. S. officials have discredited accusations about Ukraine and the Bidens as conspiracy theories. U. S. officials testified in the impeachment inquiry that accusations that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential election are Russian propaganda, and it wasn’t credible Biden would influence policy for financial or personal motives.
A statement from the Democratic chairmen of four committees that investigated Trump said the documents “demonstrate that there is more evidence relevant to the President’s scheme, but they have been concealed by the President himself. ”
“All of this new evidence confirms what we already know: the President and his associates pressured Ukrainian officials to announce investigations that would benefit the President politically,” the statement said.
The three committees that investigated Trump's dealings with Ukraine – Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform – submitted the evidence to the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee plans to submit it to the Senate along with the articles of impeachment.
The House is expected to vote Wednesday on sending the articles to the Senate, where the trial is expected to begin Tuesday.
Trump said he was justified in fighting corruption in Ukraine and predicted he would be exonerated at trial.
The committees that led the Ukraine investigation subpoenaed Parnas on Oct. 10 for the evidence, a day after he was arrested. Parnas won approval from a federal judge in New York to share documents and evidence from devices seized by investigators, including two phones and an iPad.
The committee chairmen – Reps. Adam Schiff of California at the Intelligence Committee, Jerry Nadler of New York at Judiciary, Carolyn Maloney of New York at Oversight, and Eliot Engel of New York at Foreign Affairs – had said they would continue to investigate Trump after the Dec. 18 vote to impeach the president.
Trump's lawyers agreed to represent Parnas and an associate before they were arrested
The evidence includes an Oct. 2 email showing contact between Jay Sekulow, a member of Trump's legal team, and former Trump lawyer John Dowd about the topic of "representation" for Parnas and one his co-defendants, Igor Fruman.
"I have discussed the issue of representation with the President," Sekulow wrote to Dowd. "The President consents to allowing your representation of Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. "
The day after that email was sent, the committees said, Dowd wrote to the Intelligence Committee to clarify that he was representing Parnas and Fruman, and that they "assisted Mr. Giuliani in connection with his representation of President Trump. "
Those messages were sent a week before Parnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles International Airport with one-way tickets to Europe.
A federal indictment unsealed in October charged Parnas, 47, and Belarus-born associate Fruman with conspiring to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign money to buy influence with U. S. political candidates and campaign committees. Evidence in the case includes $325,000 allegedly contributed under a false name to a political action committee supporting Trump.
Two other associates, David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, are charged separately with contributing foreign funds to candidates in Nevada and other states in a bid to win support for a planned cannabis business. Some of the money allegedly was supplied by a Russian businessman who was not identified in the indictment.
The four men have pleaded pleaded not guilty.
Parnas tried to arrange meetings between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials
Messages translated by the committees showed communication between Parnas and top Ukrainian officials during the campaign to pressure that country to open investigations.
In May, Parnas communicated by instant message with Ivan Bakanov, the head of Ukraine's Security Service, and Serhiy Shefir, a top aide to Zelensky. Parnas tried to arrange meetings between the aides and Giuliani. He sent them articles about Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a New York Times story about Giuliani's investigative goals in Ukraine.
"If you are currently on vacation please connect someone else who is close to President Voldomyr [and] who can call me back so I can connect them with Giuliani," Parnas wrote to Bakanov on May 2.
Bakanov responded that he "shared the information he [Parnas] provided with Mr. President via the established channel," though he did not schedule a meeting with Giuliani.
The Intelligence Committee said those messages documented that Zelensky knew of the Biden allegations in May.
The evidence includes a photograph of a previously-undisclosed letter from Giuliani to Zelensky on May 10. “In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you on this upcoming Monday, May 13th, or Tuesday, May 14th,” Giuliani wrote.
House investigators wrote that the letter “makes clear that his trip, which he publicly described at the time as an effort to 'meddle in in investigation, was undertaken with the knowledge and support of President Trump. ”
Trump ally claimed U. S. ambassador to Ukraine was under surveillance
WhatsApp messages obtained by the Intelligence Committee show Parnas was in contact with Robert F. Hyde, a pro-Trump congressional candidate in Connecticut who claimed to have Yovanovitch under surveillance.
In March, Parnas sent Hyde articles critical of Yovanovitch, to which Hyde responded, "Wow. can't believe Trumo [sic] hasn't fired this b****. "
Hyde sent a series of messages suggesting he had hired people in Ukraine to surveil the ambassador, alluding to "the guys over there," and updating Parnas on what he said was Yovanovitch's location.
"Guess you can do anything in the Ukraine with money. . . what I was told," Hyde told Parnas.
Yovanovitch's attorney Lawrence Robbins called the alleged surveillance "disturbing" and called for an investigation.
"Needless to say, the notion that American citizens and others were monitoring Ambassador Yovanovitch’s movements for unknown purposes is disturbing," Robbins said in a statement.
Giuliani, Parnas knew ambassador would be removed before it happened
The Intelligence Committee also obtained messages between Giuliani and Parnas about Yovanovitch's firing — the day before she was told to come back to America.
"He fired her again," Giuliani texted Parnas on April 23. Parnas responded, "I pray it happens this time. I'll call you tomorrow my brother. "
Yovanovitch told House investigators she learned Giuliani was communicating with people in Ukraine in late 2018.
She said people in the Ukrainian government told her Giuliani was in touch with a former Ukrainian prosecutor general, "and that they had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me. "

Chief of Online Luggage Seller Away Reverses Course on Resignation; Steph Korey apologized last month for her behavior at the startup and said she would step down

Texto completo: A month after she said she would step down as chief executive of online luggage seller Away, Steph Korey now says she is keeping her job.
Ms. Korey, who resigned in December after an article in the Verge criticized her management style as harsh, said she and her presumptive successor will be co-CEOs of the New York-based startup. She was previously going to become executive chairman.
In a message Monday to employees that was provided by Away, Ms. Korey, who is in her early 30s, said the initial decision to rereshuffle the leadership ranks was an attempt to protect the company after the article "unleashed a social media mob." She told the New York Times it was a mistake to "let some inaccurate reporting influence the timeline of a transition plan that we had."
The episode highlights the rising power of employees to put pressure on leaders whose behavior they don't like, and the potential perils for companies that respond quickly and forcefully to the criticism and ensuing backlash.
"There is that pressure to do something, but doing something doesn't always have to be making a final decision," said Erik Bernstein, the president of Bernstein Crisis Management. "You can buy yourself some time and just acknowledge the issue and avoid this sort of embarrassing and damaging back and forth."
Away is a fast-growing startup that has touted its transparent workplace, where most employee communications were public on the Slack messaging application, according to the Verge article. The company said it employs about 500 people.
The Verge article included accusations that Ms. Korey regularly criticized employees in public channels. It also said the company sought to stifle private communication between employees, forbidding them from sending emails to each other.
The article elicited strong criticism of Ms. Korey on social media, including calls for her firing.
After it was published, Ms. Korey apologized in a Dec. 6 statement shared on Twitter , calling her behavior "wrong, plain and simple." She also said she was working with an executive coach to "improve as a leader."
Away is demanding unspecified corrections and retractions to the Verge article, Ms. Korey wrote in Monday's message to employees. A representative of Vox Media, the Verge's parent company, said the publication stands by its reporting.
Away already had recruited Stuart Haselden from Lululemon Athletica Inc. before the Verge article was published. The company sped up its plans as the reaction intensified, saying last month that Mr. Haselden would become CEO, and Ms. Korey would shift into an executive chairman role, effective Jan. 13.
Ms. Korey will now share the top role with Mr. Haselden, Lululemon's former operating chief, but their responsibilities would follow the original plan, she said Monday.
"This is the exact working arrangement Stuart, Jen, and I had envisioned when we announced he was joining, but the shift in titles will hopefully add more clarity," she said in the message, referring to Away co-founder Jen Rubio, who is president and chief brand officer.
She said the initial executive changes were misinterpreted as her exiting the company. "So, let me clear that up: I am not leaving the company," she wrote.
Ms. Korey and Ms. Rubio, both alumni of eyewear seller Warby Parker, co-founded Away in 2015. Last May, investors valued the company at $1.4 billion .
Ms. Korey's decision to stay in her role was reported earlier by the New York Times.

Texto completo: Who exactly was it the United States killed on Jan. 3 that sparked a ramp-up of aggression between Iran and the U. S.?
Was it Qassem Soleimani?
Was it Qassim Suleimani?
Or was it Qasem Soleimani?
It depends which news source you read.
The first spelling is courtesy of The Associated Press. The "Qasem" variation is employed by The Washington Post.
The New York Times has been going with something completely different: "Qassim Suleimani."
The issue of the proper spelling of the Iranian general’s name doesn’t hold a candle to the gravity of the story at hand, of course.
I can’t imagine Iranians are having a lot of trouble spelling the man’s name right. That’s because they spell it as he did — in Arabic, a language that has an alphabet different from ours.
In case you forgot, our 26 letters are not the "English" alphabet but the "Latin" or "Roman" alphabet.
Changing words or names from one language to another without benefit of a shared alphabet is called "transliteration."
It’s a predictable way to convert one character to another character or characters rather than by converting sounds, which is known as "transcription." Think phonetics.
With transliteration, it’s easier to reverse engineer a word to its original language.
So, why the disparity in spellings?
For many clusters of characters there is more than one transliterative system. So you get variations, as with "Soleimani."
One reason could be that there are many dialects of Arabic. I imagine people have different interpretations of spellings because of that. But I’m no expert. If I were, I’d be working for the U.N. or code-breaking or something equally sexy.
When Ukraine became a hot topic of conversation last year, I came to realize that after the country gained its independence its government established rules for transliteration of city names and such from Cyrillic into the Latin alphabet for legal proclamations and such.
And it changed "Kiev" to "Kyiv."
I’m not sure why that passed below my radar for 24 years or why mass producers of frozen "chicken Kiev" continue to use a spelling that’s been out of vogue in its namesake for a quarter century.
With some languages there is just no easy pathway to English, which explains Hanukkah and Chanukah.
It’s also why if you use the translation function on your Thai sister-in-law’s Facebook posts to her friends about your shared trip to Mexico, you’re left wondering whether you were on the same trip.

Ex-Cuban judge hits country's legal system

Texto completo: A former high-ranking judge in Cuba has joined an antigovernment activist in revealing information from secret government documents that show the government is holding thousands of inmates on dubious charges and has the highest incarceration rate in the world.
The revelations by Edel González Jiménez, who spent more than 15 years on the bench and once supervised 65 other judges, are believed to be the first public challenge to the Cuban government by a top member of the judiciary.
"The repression that I am seeing against part of my people is not what I want for my people," he said during a news conference Monday in Madrid, where he was joined by members of an organization that works on behalf of political prisoners and by members of the European Parliament.
González told the audience that his wife had advised him not to speak out but that he had gone against her wishes because he felt it was his duty.
González said Cuba's judiciary was often controlled by state security forces that can manufacture cases against political opponents - a statement that critics will readily agree with but that is surprising coming from a man who insisted that he remains a faithful member of the Communist Party of Cuba and a believer in Fidel Castro's project.
His avowed support of the government makes his words significantly troubling for a country that paints dissidents as mercenaries for Washington.
González was joined at the news conference by Javier Larrondo, a longtime anti-Castro activist who runs an organization called Prisoners Defenders in Madrid, in publicly announcing his call for the Cuban government to respect civil rights.
"This is an important blow to the regime," Larrondo said.

Amazon Publishes Books by Top Authors, and Rivals Fret; Dean Koontz, Patricia Cornwell are among the blue-chip writers whose books the tech giant is not just selling but publishing

Texto completo: Dean Koontz's first novel for Amazon is expected to publish March 31. PHOTO: Annie Tritt for The Wall Street Journal
When Dean Koontz's book contract expired last year, his stature as one of the country's top-selling authors made him a hot target for several major publishing houses. He chose Amazon.com Inc.
It was a surprising move because it means his new books likely won't appear in retail stores, which generally boycott Amazon-published titles. But Mr. Koontz is banking on Amazon's vast retail machine to get his work to readers, whether in physical or digital formats.
"Maybe I won't be in some stores or make the New York Times best-seller list, but I'm willing to take that risk and I think we'll sell more books in all formats," Mr. Koontz said.
Amazon dominates the U.S. book-retail market—accounting for over half of all new books sold in October, according to research firm Codex Group—but it is also a force as a book publisher . Signing up blue-chip authors like Mr. Koontz could make the tech giant an even more formidable threat to the traditional industry, led by publishing houses such as Penguin Random House, which is controlled by Germany's Bertelsmann SE, ViacomCBS Inc.'s Simon & Schuster and HarperCollins Publishers, which is owned by Wall Street Journal parent News Corp.
Mr. Koontz's first novel for Amazon is expected to publish March 31. He already has published a collection of short stories, "Nameless," that generated over a million downloads in the first month after its debut last November. The stories are available only as e-books and audiobooks.
Mr. Koontz, whose over 100 books include hits like "Odd Thomas" and "Watchers," isn't the only high-profile writer Amazon Publishing has snared. In 2018, Patricia Cornwell signed a two-book deal; the first novel, "Quantum," was published last October and enjoyed brisk downloads despite poor reviews. Both Mr. Koontz and Ms. Cornwell are in the top 25 of all currently published U.S. adult fiction writers, as measured by the size of their most dedicated fan bases, according to consumer surveys by Codex.
Amazon Publishing already has 16 imprints in the U.S. churning out titles from thrillers to romance novels. Rival publishers expect competition for top talent to heat up further, now that Amazon's initial big-name signings have proved encouraging.
The fact Amazon is both a book publisher and the dominant book retailer is unlikely, on its own, to raise antitrust issues, said several legal and media experts. Current antitrust laws are meant to increase consumer welfare, so Amazon's low prices act as a shield.
"When prices are low for the customer, that improves consumer welfare even if it puts out of business people who are charging more," said Gregory Arenson, an antitrust lawyer and partner at Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.
Mr. Arenson said Amazon might be in violation of antitrust laws, however, if it is using its platform to provide an advantage to books it publishes that it doesn't provide to other book publishers.
A spokeswoman for Amazon Publishing declined to comment.
Amazon can promise writers a big paycheck, agents say, and a powerful e-commerce platform and marketing tools to promote sales of their work. That is an appealing package, including to established authors who have had declining sales but still believe their best days are ahead.
"Quantum" sold only 6,000 hardcover copies through Nov. 23, according to NPD BookScan, a unit of NPD Group Inc. A spokeswoman for Amazon Publishing says the book has "reached approximately 600,000 readers across print, audio, and digital sales and downloads."
Even when premier writers remain under contract elsewhere for their novels, Amazon can develop ties with them on other projects such as exclusive short works, and eye a larger deal down the road.

Have changes in the book-retail market affected your ability to find your favorite authors? How? Join the conversation below.
"They are playing a long game with a lot of authors, and yes, it worries me," said a senior executive at one of the largest publishing companies.
Amazon isn't "aggressively hunting big-name authors," said Jeff Belle, vice president of Amazon Publishing. But it is cultivating relationships with writers, he said, and is willing to "write checks for great content."
The downside for high-profile authors of tying up with Amazon is that Barnes & Noble Inc. and independent booksellers shun Amazon's books. It is possible Barnes & Noble could change its approach under the new management team that took over after hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. acquired the retailer last summer.
"I am surprised that there is an overt policy at Barnes & Noble to boycott and generally would not personally be in favor of this," James Daunt, the bookseller's chief executive, said last month.
For Mr. Koontz—who has sold more than 500 million books world-wide—the opportunity to reach new readers through Amazon's extensive promotions was too good to ignore, he said.
"We had seven or eight offers, but Amazon offered the most complete marketing plan, and that was the deciding factor," said Mr. Koontz, who is 74.
The pact Mr. Koontz signed last spring with Amazon Publishing's Thomas & Mercer imprint ended his long relationship with Bantam Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House, the world's largest consumer book publisher. A spokeswoman for Bantam Books, which has published more than 50 of his works, declined to comment.
The six "Nameless" short stories, which feature a vigilante who suffers from amnesia and doesn't have any fingerprints, sell for $1.99 each. Subscribers to the Amazon Kindle Unlimited service can access them as part of their membership, as can Amazon Prime users.
Mr. Koontz says another reason he signed with Amazon Publishing is because he enjoyed close ties with audiobook publisher Brilliance Audio even before it was acquired by Amazon in 2007.
Mr. Koontz's success with Brilliance Audio caught the eye of Julia Sommerfeld, editorial director of the Amazon imprint Amazon Original Stories, who suggested working together. The novella that followed, "Ricochet Joe," was published in December 2017 exclusively as an Amazon e-book and audiobook.
"There was no paperback, no hardcover, but hundreds of thousands of people read it with their e-readers, and he was well compensated," said Richard Pine, his literary agent.
The ability to reach new potential readers was also a key attraction for Ms. Cornwell, best known for her novels featuring fictional medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Ms. Cornwell signed a two-book contract with Amazon's Thomas & Mercer imprint in 2018. Her most recent Kay Scarpetta novels had been published by HarperCollins Publishers.
"She's not scared of shaking it up," said Ms. Cornwell's agent, Jeremy Barber, a partner at United Talent Agency LLC. "She believed she'd be able to access new and different readers via this platform." HarperCollins Publishers declined to comment.
Ms. Cornwell's "Quantum," the first in a new series featuring Captain Calli Chase, a NASA pilot, scientist and expert in cybercrime investigations, disappointed many readers, with 35% of the reviewers on Amazon.com giving it one star.
The author said she is undeterred. "I'm building a new audience, and yes, I'm getting kicked around in reviews, but I know what I'm doing," she said.
Ms. Cornwell didn't anticipate the emotional impact of not seeing her new novel in bookstores. "It's depressing when you don't see your book anywhere," she said. "It's not fair, and it's not right."
Ms. Cornwell is working on a sequel titled "Spin" expected to publish this year.

Texto completo: Like it or not, the future is connected.
Your next car will probably connect to the internet. So will your TV and doorknobs. One day, you may even adopt a robot companion capable of analyzing its environment and reacting to your actions in real time.
That future, or at least a glimmer of it, was on display at CES, the giant consumer electronics trade show that attracted more than 170,000 attendees here last week.
This year's annual event featured more than 4,500 exhibitors, including tech companies big and small from all over the world, and sprawled across 2.9 million square feet at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other venues around town.
The conference was a window into where the industry is pouring huge amounts of resources and investment, hoping that the year's hottest tech trends -- like artificially intelligent virtual assistants, connected cars and foldable screens -- will become everyday fixtures in our lives.
The enormous conference was also an opportunity for tech observers to make predictions about the innovations that might become popular and the gadgets that will probably flop in the coming years.
Among the questionable tech trends were foldable screens, demonstrated by TCL, Lenovo and Dell, among others. Lenovo showed its ThinkPad X1 Fold, a Windows foldable tablet. Unfolded, it measured about 13 diagonal inches, and folded up, it looked compact like a book.
Not everyone is optimistic about foldable screens. Frank Gillett, a technology analyst for Forrester Research, predicted that foldable devices would be unpopular, largely because of their high price tags and limited use cases.
Case in point: Samsung's Galaxy Fold, its first foldable smartphone priced at nearly $2,000, was a failure after early reports of the device breaking after light use. Lenovo's X1 Fold will cost about $2,500 when it arrives this year.
"Foldables -- the pun is too tempting -- will be a flop," Gillett said.
Amazon and Google were among the biggest players at CES, each boasting about how awesome their personal assistants were.
Google said its virtual assistant is now used by more than 500 million people a month across more than 90 countries.
Last year, Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo speakers dominated the global smart speaker market with about a 25% share, ahead of Baidu and Google, according to Canalys, a research firm. And the market for smart speakers keeps growing.
It is still unclear, however, whether consumers want to do much with virtual assistants as they continue to get smarter. Studies have shown that people mostly use Alexa and Google Assistant for basic tasks.
Still, Dave Limp, Amazon's head of hardware devices, was bullish.
"Customers interact with Alexa billions of times a week," he said. "Even one of many things that they're doing can add up to be a pretty big thing."
Self-driving cars are still far from fruition, but tech companies highlighted features that could help people drive more safely.
Samsung showed a car with its Exynos Auto V9 computing processor, which can run applications on multiple screens and pull information from up to 12 cameras. The system was designed to simultaneously provide entertainment to back-seat passengers while providing safety-assistance apps to drivers, the company said.

Texto completo: Soldiers with deep wounds sometimes feel no pain at all for hours, while people without any detectable injury live in chronic physical anguish. How to explain that?
Over drinks in a Boston area bar, Ronald Melzack, a psychologist, and Dr. Patrick Wall, a physiologist, sketched out a diagram on a cocktail napkin that might help explain this and other puzzles of pain perception. The result, once their idea was fully formed, was an electrifying theory that would become the founding document for the field of modern pain studies and establish the career of Melzack, whose subsequent work deepened medicine's understanding of pain and how it is best measured and treated.
Melzack died Dec. 22 in a hospital near his home in Montreal, where he lived, his daughter, Lauren Melzack, said. He was 90, and had spent most of his professional life as a professor of psychology at McGill University.
When Melzack and Wall, then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, met that day in 1959 or 1960 (accounts of their encounter vary), pain perception was thought to work something like a voltmeter, in which nerves send signals up to the brain that reflect the severity of the injury. But that model failed to explain not only battlefield experience but a host of clinical findings and everyday salves. Most notably, rubbing a wound lessens its sting -- and accounting for just that common sensation proved central to the new theory.
Doctors knew that massaging the skin activated so-called large nerve fibers, which are specialized to detect subtle variations of touch, and that deeper, small fibers sounded the alarm of tissue damage. The two researchers reasoned that all these sensations must pass through a "gate" in the spinal cord, which adds up their combined signals before sending a message to the brain. In effect, activating the large fibers blocks signals from the smaller ones by closing the gate.
Over several years, Wall worked from the bottom up, mapping out the circuitry that was likely to be involved. Melzack worked from the top down, detailing the various ways the mind moderates and shapes the messages coming through the gate. Injured soldiers often don't feel pain right away because their brains are focused on bigger threats to survival, like a firefight. Chronic pain without injury is not common but suggests some misfiring in the circuitry.
In a 1965 paper published in the journal Science, "Pain Mechanisms: A New Theory," the pair rolled out their comprehensive, psycho-biological model for how the body processes pain.
Pain, they concluded, is "a linguistic label for a rich variety of experiences and responses" that are "sequentially reexamined over long periods" by the body.
The new model, called the gate control theory, met with some initial skepticism. But it soon became the touchstone for an emerging, and critical, field of study.
"Finally, for first time, people had a model to try to prove or disprove," Jeffrey Mogil, a professor of pain studies at McGill, said in a phone interview. "There was no real pain research field before the gate control theory; after it, people started thinking of themselves as pain researchers, and soon an international society was established."
Doctors loved the theory, and so did their patients, said Dr. Allan Basbaum, chairman of the anatomy department at the University of California, San Francisco. "The key was the gate," he said in an interview. "Turn it one way and it closes, and the other way it opens. Whether the information that gets to the brain causes pain depends on the balance of activity in small and large fibers coming through the gate."
In the 1970s, Melzack turned to another problem he had been thinking about for years: pain measurement. At the time, doctors had only crude instruments, like simply asking people to rate their pain level on a scale from 1 to 10 (a method still in use). As a young researcher, Melzack had worked in a chronic pain clinic and befriended a 70-year-old woman with diabetes.
"She was a highly intelligent person with a good vocabulary, and I began to collect her descriptive words about pain, like 'burning,' 'shooting,' 'horrible' and 'excruciating,' " he told McGill Reporter in a 2008 interview.
He continued to build his adjective collection by listening to many patients' descriptions and, working with a statistician, divided them into 20 categories, each describing a particular kind of pain: "tugging," "pulling" and "wrenching" in one category, for instance, and "pinching," "pressing" and "gnawing" in another.
This descriptive catalog, published in the journal Pain in 1975, became the McGill Pain Questionnaire. It soon became a standard measure worldwide, deeply enriching the conversations doctors have with their patients, and in many cases helping with diagnosis.
"Scientists go their entire career trying for one home run, one big finding that makes a difference, and most never get it," Mogil said. "Ron hit two home runs; it's not an exaggeration to say he's the greatest pain researcher who ever lived."
Ronald Hyman Melzack was born on July 19, 1929, in Montreal, the youngest of four children of Joseph and Annie (Mandel) Melzack, Jewish immigrants from Poland. His mother worked in the household, and his father, after a variety of jobs, started the store Classic Books, which would later become a national chain in Canada.
Ronald studied psychology as an undergraduate at McGill and went on to complete a Ph.D. there in 1964, under renowned neuroscientist Donald Hebb. He did postdoctoral research under Dr. William Livingston at the University of Oregon Medical School and spent several years at MIT before returning to McGill to finish his career. He married Lucy Birch, an interior designer, in 1960.
His siblings died before him. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife and a son, Joel.
Wall died in 2001.
Melzack wrote two popular books about the science of pain, "The Puzzle of Pain" (1973) and, with Wall, "The Challenge of Pain" (1996). He became a prominent presence at McGill, having helped establish the McGill Pain Clinic, and received numerous best-instructor awards, as voted by McGill students.

Texto completo: A former high-ranking judge in Cuba has joined an antigovernment activist in revealing information from secret government documents that show the government is holding thousands of inmates on dubious charges and has the highest incarceration rate in the world.
The revelations by Edel González Jiménez, who spent more than 15 years on the bench and once supervised 65 other judges, are believed to be the first public challenge to the Cuban government by a top member of the judiciary.
"The repression that I am seeing against part of my people is not what I want for my people," he said during a news conference Monday in Madrid, where he was joined by members of an organization that works on behalf of political prisoners and by members of the European Parliament.
González told the audience that his wife had advised him not to speak out but that he had gone against her wishes because he felt it was his duty.
González said Cuba's judiciary was often controlled by state security forces that can manufacture cases against political opponents - a statement that critics will readily agree with but that is surprising coming from a man who insisted that he remains a faithful member of the Communist Party of Cuba and a believer in Fidel Castro's project.
His avowed support of the government makes his words significantly troubling for a country that paints dissidents as mercenaries for Washington.
González was joined at the news conference by Javier Larrondo, a longtime anti-Castro activist who runs an organization called Prisoners Defenders in Madrid, in publicly announcing his call for the Cuban government to respect civil rights.
"This is an important blow to the regime," Larrondo said.

Texto completo: Jay Rife surveys the landscape - hundreds of flat, grassy acres reclaimed from a spent mountaintop mine once operated by Paramont Coal Co. A few handsome homes stand on one end of the project. An 80,000-square-foot shell, to house some future manufacturing operation, is being built on another. For the intrepid, there are trails for all-terrain vehicles. There's an RV park. The whole site has been wired for broadband. Elk have been imported from Kentucky for tourists to look at.
Buchanan County, where Grundy sits, has spent $35 million to $40 million on the development, called Southern Gap, some 7 miles from town along U.S. 460. Rife, head of the county's Industrial Development Authority, said the project "is going to be the salvation of Buchanan County."
Few places have had as many shots at deliverance. None, so far, have succeeded in stemming Grundy's inexorable decline.
This corner of southwestern Virginia has long sought alternatives to coal as a source of sustenance. The Appalachian School of Law, which opened in the 1990s in the shell of Grundy Junior High School, was heralded as a new economic engine, lubricated - of course - with taxpayer funds. So was the Appalachian College of Pharmacy, founded in 2003 some 20 minutes down the road in Oakwood. County officials considered a dental school but figured it was too expensive. They still get grumpy about the optometry school, on which they spent $250,000 in feasibility studies, only for it to open across the state line in Pikeville, Kentucky. Then there is downtown Grundy itself, much of which was moved up the hill to avoid periodic floodwaters from the Levisa Fork, a tributary of the Big Sandy River.
Virginia estimates that the relocation and flood-proofing projects, started almost 20 years ago, cost $170 million in federal and state funds, more than $170,000 for every woman, man and child living in town today. The Army Corps of Engineers shaved off the flank of a mountain across the river to create an elevated platform on which the new commercial district would sit. Virginia's Department of Transportation bulldozed much of the old downtown and routed U.S. 460 through it, built on top of a levee protecting what was left of Grundy's old center. Finally, in 2011, Walmart opened a superstore to anchor the new site, perched somewhat oddly above a two-story, publicly funded parking lot.
Today, a Subway and a Taco Bell are there, too, alongside a restaurant called El Sombrero, run by the only Mexican immigrants in town. There are a Shoe Sensation, a Verizon outlet and a Double Kwik gas station. Still, the effort does not quite amount to a reinvention. The economic engine is still the one that carried this corner of Appalachia through the 20th century. "We are a one-industry community, and that's coal," Rife said. A few steps from Walmart, an office of Welmore Energy, a coal-producing subsidiary of Ukrainian steel conglomerate Metinvest, serves as a reminder of that dominance.
And that, today, is a problem. At the peak of coal's fortunes in the 1970s, more than 35,000 people lived in Buchanan. Over 5,000 worked in the mines. Rife remembers downtown sidewalks in Grundy, the county seat, packed with thousands of people on weekend shopping expeditions. Karen Brown, principal of Grundy High School, recalls Porsches and Mercedes-Benzes parked in the high school lot when she went to school there.
Coal is still the most prominent business, employing 1 in 6 workers in the county and accounting for one-third of its total wages. But it can no longer support such living standards. The income of Buchanan County's residents has fallen to about two-thirds of the national average. And about 40% of that comes from federal transfers like Social Security.
The county population has declined to under 22,000, of whom almost 3,500 people receive disability benefits. More than one-quarter live in poverty. And it is getting old. The only age group that has grown in the last two decades is the population over 55. Brown's high school, which housed about 1,000 students when she was there, these days educates just a bit over 400. The county's elementary and middle school population has shrunk by one-fifth over the last 10 years, to under 2,000 students.
Falling behind
Grundy is hardly unique. It is one of many victims of globalization, technology and other economic dislocations that have wreaked havoc with small-town America. For years, most economists argued that rather than spend millions in pursuit of a new economic engine for such places, it would make more sense to help residents seek opportunities elsewhere.
But the proliferation of towns like Grundy across what used to be the nation's industrial heartland - stymied by joblessness, awash in opioids and frustration - has prompted a new sense of alarm. At a recent conference organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Lawrence Summers, once a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, put it this way: "There is probably no issue more important for the political economy of the next 15 years, not just in the United States but around the world, than what happens in the areas that feel rightly that they are falling behind and increasingly left apart."
Since the last industry peak, in 2012, the coal mines of Buchanan County have shed 1,000 jobs - roughly half. And they are not paying quite as well as they once did. Mikey Elswick estimates that 90% of his family has worked in the coal industry, including his father, his uncle and his brother-in-law. Still, he got out four years ago after Cambrian Coal bought the mine where he worked and said it would cut wages to around $20 an hour from $22.50. Luckily for him, the local exterminator was retiring and let him take over the business, including his roster of clients.
"There are not many jobs around here," Elswick said. "Just teachers, state troopers and coal." Cambrian Coal filed for bankruptcy in July.
Migration, as economists would have predicted, has become an increasingly compelling option: Those lucky enough to find work somewhere else leave.
Brian Ward owns a small company he started to provide crews and equipment to coal mines in the area but has been forced into residential construction - remodeling, mostly - as coal has waned. Migration is not new, he said.
"We lost one generation of workers to Detroit, another to the Carolinas," he said. These days, workers will go anywhere. "I don't know where we are losing them to now," Ward added.
Other options
Buchanan County is in some ways better off than other coal-mining regions. To be sure, its coal production has shriveled, virtually pushed out of the power market by the cheaper coal coming from the gargantuan open-top mines in the West since the 1980s. Automation has also taken out thousands of jobs.
But the county is bountiful in what's known as metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking. Much of it is exported. This insulates local mines from the transition that power plants are making to natural gas. Indeed, coal jobs in the county experienced a bump starting in 2016, driven by exports to Europe and Asia. And while that has passed as growth prospects overseas have dimmed, steelmaking guarantees some future for the region's coal.
Shannon Blevins, associate vice chancellor for economic development and engagement at the University of Virginia College at Wise, 60 miles from Grundy, said she is optimistic about the diversification initiatives in southwestern Virginia. She puts a lot of hope in the university's computer science and software engineering graduates, who might draw the interest of high-tech firms worried about labor costs in bigger cities.
Tourism is another promising option. There are efforts to develop forest products and crops like hemp in the region and even to identify abandoned coal mines that could house data centers, taking advantage of the low underground temperatures to keep them cool.
"This is a great time to invest in southwestern Virginia," Blevins said.
And yet her optimism contrasts with the more jaundiced views of many residents. "There has been a ton of money spent in Buchanan County through grants," said Ward, now in construction. "Not one penny has provided a replacement job for coal workers."
He admits he doesn't have good alternatives to their "pie-in-the-sky ideas," but wonders, "How can you replace $30-an-hour jobs in the mines with mom-and-pops renting little cabins and paying $8 an hour?" His business has "not made any real money since 2011."

Texto completo: For every Greta Thunberg and school-skipping climate change protester, there is another member of Generation Z buying inexpensive clothes on a smartphone.
Their purchasing choices - fueled by influencer culture and catered to by a new wave of ultra-fast-fashion retailers such as Fashion Nova, PrettyLittleThing and Missguided - are as much about how an outfit will look on social media as in the real world.
Two Gen Z shoppers, one in America and one in Britain, invited us into their homes to talk about what they buy, and why. All of them work after school or save money to pay for their own purchases.
Mia Grantham is a 16-year-old British high school student. She lives with her father and her younger sister in Wilmslow, England. Her bedroom is small but immaculately kept, with a pillow shaped like a speech bubble reading "You've Got This" on her bed.
Mia's interest in clothes ramped up about 18 months ago, when she started getting an allowance and attracting followers on her social media accounts. She has more than 1,500 followers on Instagram, gets around 500 views per story on Snapchat and spends three hours per day on her iPhone XR (about five hours on weekends).
Her favorite going-out look is a red dress. She owns 14 of them.

Q: How often do you shop?
A: I browse every single day - at least once - on the PrettyLittleThing phone app. It's my favorite, and I don't look anywhere else, except if I see something on an Instagram influencer I like. Normally I look at shopping apps at the end of the day before bed for about 10 to 15 minutes. But if there is an event coming up that I want a new outfit for, then I could browse for more than an hour. I don't really go to bricks-and-mortar stores.

Q: Why is PrettyLittleThing your favorite fashion brand?
A: I pay 8.99 pounds as part of a yearly subscription, which gives me unlimited next-day delivery on anything I buy. I know all the delivery people really well now - they always know when I have plans on a Friday or Saturday night. I buy something at least once a week. Seventy percent of the time I send some ordered items back.

Q: How many pieces of clothing do you think you've bought in 2019?
A:Eighty? One hundred? Those are pieces I've kept.

Q: What is your favorite piece that you've bought?
A:The ones I probably wear the most are gray leggings that cost 2.50 pounds. For going out, I bought a silky red dress with a cutout for a house party. I've worn it out three times, which is a lot for me.

Q: What else do you look for?
A:Social media is a big consideration. I'm on Snapchat and Instagram, and occasionally Facebook. I take selfies for social media every single time I go out. I'm on Snapchat the most because of its messenger function, then Instagram, where I have both a public and a private account and spend an hour per day.
Q: What do you think of sustainable fashion?
A: I am hearing more and more about it because a lot of brands are now bringing out sustainable fashion capsule collections, where clothes are made out of recycled materials, for example. A lot look the same as the normal collection but cost a few pounds more. But if I'm honest, I do think: Why would I pay more, when I can get the same for less?

Andrea Vargas, an 18-year-old freshman at Hofstra University, loves hunting for sales. She looks for them on websites such as PrettyLittleThings and Boohoo, as well as physical stores like H&M.
"I go shopping when the season sales are on," she said one Saturday night at her family's home in Farmingdale, New York. She commutes to school and spends most weekend nights out with friends. Her plan for this particular evening was to go to P.F. Chang's with three girlfriends.
Her absolute favorite piece of clothing is a red plush jacket."It's just so cute," Vargas said. "I feel like it dresses up an outfit."
Vargas pays for her clothes herself, using money she earns by working at Target. The red jacket cost her around $40, and she said it was worth every penny.
But, she said, "I feel like there's no point in spending $40 on a T-shirt. Especially since I'm in college, I need to buy all these books."
Vargas guessed she had purchased between 100 and 200 items this year, including shoes and jewelry, and that her wardrobe comprises 500 or 600 total pieces.
She doesn't generally check where her clothing is made, and she doesn't feel guilty about how much of it she has. After she's done wearing something, it can have a second life.
"My mom is from El Salvador and my dad is from Nicaragua," she said. "They're not wealthy countries, so I like to give back to people who don't have a lot."
She estimates she wears each piece 15 times before ultimately donating it or selling it on Depop - but she also doesn't want to be seen wearing the same thing every day on Instagram.
"If I have a shirt in one of my previous pictures, I try not to take a picture again in it," she said. "I don't like to repeat."

Ex-Cuban judge hits country's legal system

Texto completo: A former high-ranking judge in Cuba has joined an antigovernment activist in revealing information from secret government documents that show the government is holding thousands of inmates on dubious charges and has the highest incarceration rate in the world.
The revelations by Edel González Jiménez, who spent more than 15 years on the bench and once supervised 65 other judges, are believed to be the first public challenge to the Cuban government by a top member of the judiciary.
"The repression that I am seeing against part of my people is not what I want for my people," he said during a news conference Monday in Madrid, where he was joined by members of an organization that works on behalf of political prisoners and by members of the European Parliament.
González told the audience that his wife had advised him not to speak out but that he had gone against her wishes because he felt it was his duty.
González said Cuba's judiciary was often controlled by state security forces that can manufacture cases against political opponents - a statement that critics will readily agree with but that is surprising coming from a man who insisted that he remains a faithful member of the Communist Party of Cuba and a believer in Fidel Castro's project.
His avowed support of the government makes his words significantly troubling for a country that paints dissidents as mercenaries for Washington.
González was joined at the news conference by Javier Larrondo, a longtime anti-Castro activist who runs an organization called Prisoners Defenders in Madrid, in publicly announcing his call for the Cuban government to respect civil rights.
"This is an important blow to the regime," Larrondo said.

Civic center staff confused over Louis C.K. show

Texto completo: Residents Monday were divided by the name on the marquee outside the Majed J. Nesheiwat Convention Center:
"LOUIS CK 3/ 11"
Some said they were eager to see the disgraced comedian perform live in Poughkeepsie. Others said they found his visit uncomfortable.
One of those groups is going to be disappointed, but it's no longer clear which.
Around 4 p.m., workers removed the name from the marquee.
Danielle Anderson, president of the Mid-Hudson Civic Center nonprofit organization, which operates the venue known as the MJN, confirmed Louis C.K.'s March 11 appearance on Monday morning. Hours later, she notified the Journal the show was not finalized.
"Our industry is a fluid one, Louis CK is not confirmed, when he is I will send you details," Anderson wrote in an email to the Journal at 4:14 p.m.
Once one of the most popular performers in the world, Louis C.K.'s career was derailed in November 2017 after he acknowledged that reports of sexual misconduct with multiple women were valid.
More than two years later, he is back touring and selling out venues.
Though it appeared Poughkeepsie would be one of those on his tour list, the Civic Center could not say if the show was still happening as of the Journal's deadline Monday.
Some who spoke with the Journal would prefer it not happen.
"It bothers me a lot that he's back on tour in general," Hannah Pratt, a 22-year-old Wappingers Falls resident, said, calling it "shocking" that he would come to Poughkeepsie. "I don't want him out there at all. It's kind of hitting a little close to home now."
In confirming the performance initially, Anderson said she and her staff considered the incidents involving Louis C.K. before booking him.
"We kind of looked into that," she said. "I don't think there are any artists that don't have some history of something. If we knocked everyone out for having any kind of past history – that's not what we're in the business of. We're a show facility. My job is to put on shows."
Speaking of any performer's past history, Anderson said, "How do you get around that? I cannot judge based on past issues."
After an absence from the stage, Louis C.K. began performing again in August 2018 and has been touring in recent months; he will perform sold-out shows in January in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Orleans and Houston.
While some residents Monday regarded him with contempt, others focused on his humor.
Tracy Dwyer of Rosendale, who works in Poughkeepsie, said she is familiar with Louis C.K., "all the good and the bad, and I'd still go see him.
"I think he'd be great for entertainment, something different, a little bit of a celebrity in the area," said the 34-year-old.
Sean Clark, another Wappingers Falls resident, had a more blunt opinion:
"He's an idiot," the 24-year-old said.
Still some, including four women outside the convention center Monday, said they were unfamiliar in general with the comedian.
Louis C.K.'s career imploded after he acknowledged harassment complaints reported by the New York Times. A majority of the complaints revolved around him masturbating in the presence of women he knew professionally.
Some of the women said they feared their careers would suffer if they discussed the incidents, which took place more than a decade ago.
Following publication of the Times report, Louis C.K. released a statement saying "these stories are true."
The revelations came at the height of the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse in the workplace and they led to the cancellation of the performer's numerous TV contracts. Louis C.K.'s feature-length film, "I Love You, Daddy," was also scrapped shortly before release.
He made headlines once again in December 2018, when audio of him mocking student survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting during a set was circulated on the internet.
Asked about the comedian's sexual misconduct, Dwyer said, "I kind of try and stay out of it a little bit, in a way. I do read about it and I know both sides and what he admitted. I think, you know, it's a hard thing, to admit when somebody's wrong; and I think the #MeToo movement has blown up for, I think, for the right reasons, definitely.
"But it's his livelihood," Dwyer said, "and if you like him for what he does for his work, you might not like him personally, but, you know, you can kind of pick and choose what you support."

What's up with 'Better Call Saul'? TV Q&amp;A

Texto completo: Q: What happened to "Better Call Saul"?
A: It took a break. It may have felt like a long one, but many shows take longer hiatuses (and make fewer episodes) than in TV's olden days. "Better Call Saul" will begin a 10-episode fifth season Feb. 23 on AMC.
According to the network: "Jimmy McGill's decision to practice law as 'Saul Goodman' creates unexpected and profound waves of change for those in his orbit."
AMC also will set the stage with a big showcase of "Breaking Bad," the series that led to "Better Call Saul." A five-week "Breaking Bad" marathon will present all the episodes of that series on each Sunday from Jan. 19 to Feb. 16. Also on Feb. 16, AMC will air "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie," which picks up after the end of "Breaking Bad" and debuted on Netflix.

Q: For years I've recorded CNBC's "Nightly Business Report" on PBS to watch the next morning as I'm getting ready for work. Co-host Bill Griffeth made an announcement on the Dec. 27 episode that the program was ending and that it was its last broadcast. Why? It was fair, succinct, politically neutral and remarkably helpful in understanding how current happenings affect the markets. I will definitely miss it.
A: The increased availability of business programming was a major reason for the end of the series after more than 40 years on the air. When it began, news service Current reported, "It was the only television show to offer a full evaluation of daily events on Wall Street." But since then, entire cable channels and online services devoted to business have come along, including CNBC, which bought the show in 2013 and has produced it for public television since then. But cuts in staff and funding had begun even before then, and more changes followed under CNBC, eventually leading to this biggest change of all.

Q: What happened to the handsome Frenchman who was on "Dancing with the Stars"? He almost won the mirror ball but lost to a little blonde gal who had been in the Olympics.
A: You are remembering Gilles Marini, a model and actor who famously showed all his stuff in the first "Sex and the City" movie. He was on "Dancing with the Stars" twice, finishing second to gymnast Shawn Johnson in the eighth season in 2009 and sixth in the 2012 "all-stars" season. He has acted often on television, including extensive stints on "Brothers & Sisters," "2 Broke Girls," "Devious Maids," "The Bold and the Beautiful" and, not too long ago, "Days of Our Lives."

Q: I just finished watching all seven seasons of "The West Wing" on Netflix. It ended with Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen) ending his time as president and Matt Santos taking over. Was anything ever done to continue the series or start a spinoff? I really wanted to see what was going to happen next.
A: The drama about the folks working in the White House certainly left the door open for a continuation with a new administration with its 2006 series finale, but sagging ratings prompted NBC to end things then. Now the show seems loved even more now than when it ended in 2006 - "an idealistic alternative reality" to current politics, as the New York Times put it late last year. If you Google "West Wing sequel" you will find nearly annual reports of this or that possible new "West Wing." But so far none appears to have gotten past chatter.

Q: I really enjoyed the Navy SEALs series "Six." Is it coming back this year?
A: No. The show ended in 2018 after two seasons on History. Deadline.com reported the reason was a huge drop in the ratings from the first to the second season.

Texto completo: For every Greta Thunberg and school-skipping climate change protester, there is another member of Generation Z buying inexpensive clothes on a smartphone.
Their purchasing choices - fueled by influencer culture and catered to by a new wave of ultra-fast-fashion retailers such as Fashion Nova, PrettyLittleThing and Missguided - are as much about how an outfit will look on social media as in the real world.
Two Gen Z shoppers, one in America and one in Britain, invited us into their homes to talk about what they buy, and why. All of them work after school or save money to pay for their own purchases.
Mia Grantham is a 16-year-old British high school student. She lives with her father and her younger sister in Wilmslow, England. Her bedroom is small but immaculately kept, with a pillow shaped like a speech bubble reading "You've Got This" on her bed.
Mia's interest in clothes ramped up about 18 months ago, when she started getting an allowance and attracting followers on her social media accounts. She has more than 1,500 followers on Instagram, gets around 500 views per story on Snapchat and spends three hours per day on her iPhone XR (about five hours on weekends).
Her favorite going-out look is a red dress. She owns 14 of them.

Q: How often do you shop?
A: I browse every single day - at least once - on the PrettyLittleThing phone app. It's my favorite, and I don't look anywhere else, except if I see something on an Instagram influencer I like. Normally I look at shopping apps at the end of the day before bed for about 10 to 15 minutes. But if there is an event coming up that I want a new outfit for, then I could browse for more than an hour. I don't really go to bricks-and-mortar stores.

Q: Why is PrettyLittleThing your favorite fashion brand?
A: I pay 8.99 pounds as part of a yearly subscription, which gives me unlimited next-day delivery on anything I buy. I know all the delivery people really well now - they always know when I have plans on a Friday or Saturday night. I buy something at least once a week. Seventy percent of the time I send some ordered items back.

Q: How many pieces of clothing do you think you've bought in 2019?
A:Eighty? One hundred? Those are pieces I've kept.

Q: What is your favorite piece that you've bought?
A:The ones I probably wear the most are gray leggings that cost 2.50 pounds. For going out, I bought a silky red dress with a cutout for a house party. I've worn it out three times, which is a lot for me.

Q: What else do you look for?
A:Social media is a big consideration. I'm on Snapchat and Instagram, and occasionally Facebook. I take selfies for social media every single time I go out. I'm on Snapchat the most because of its messenger function, then Instagram, where I have both a public and a private account and spend an hour per day.
Q: What do you think of sustainable fashion?
A: I am hearing more and more about it because a lot of brands are now bringing out sustainable fashion capsule collections, where clothes are made out of recycled materials, for example. A lot look the same as the normal collection but cost a few pounds more. But if I'm honest, I do think: Why would I pay more, when I can get the same for less?

Andrea Vargas, an 18-year-old freshman at Hofstra University, loves hunting for sales. She looks for them on websites such as PrettyLittleThings and Boohoo, as well as physical stores like H&M.
"I go shopping when the season sales are on," she said one Saturday night at her family's home in Farmingdale, New York. She commutes to school and spends most weekend nights out with friends. Her plan for this particular evening was to go to P.F. Chang's with three girlfriends.
Her absolute favorite piece of clothing is a red plush jacket."It's just so cute," Vargas said. "I feel like it dresses up an outfit."
Vargas pays for her clothes herself, using money she earns by working at Target. The red jacket cost her around $40, and she said it was worth every penny.
But, she said, "I feel like there's no point in spending $40 on a T-shirt. Especially since I'm in college, I need to buy all these books."
Vargas guessed she had purchased between 100 and 200 items this year, including shoes and jewelry, and that her wardrobe comprises 500 or 600 total pieces.
She doesn't generally check where her clothing is made, and she doesn't feel guilty about how much of it she has. After she's done wearing something, it can have a second life.
"My mom is from El Salvador and my dad is from Nicaragua," she said. "They're not wealthy countries, so I like to give back to people who don't have a lot."
She estimates she wears each piece 15 times before ultimately donating it or selling it on Depop - but she also doesn't want to be seen wearing the same thing every day on Instagram.
"If I have a shirt in one of my previous pictures, I try not to take a picture again in it," she said. "I don't like to repeat."

Texto completo: Scott Morrison,
"Of course, global changes in the environment and the climate have a broader impact on the world's weather systems. What we've always said, though, is you cannot link any individual single emissions reduction policy of a country -- whether it's Australia or anyone else -- to any specific fire event. I mean, that's just absurd. And to suggest that that is the case would be simply wrong. It is, and always has been, the policy of our government to understand the need to take action on climate change and the impact that has on the world's broader weather systems."
Jennifer Mills,
The Washington Post:
"Australians see ourselves as tough characters who take care of each other in a crisis. In rural areas, volunteer firefighters give up days and nights to respond to incidents as they arise. We do this because someone has to. When we rise to challenges such as this one, we expect something similar from our leaders. Months into the crisis, defense force reserves are finally being deployed to provide much-needed logistical support. But Morrison still must answer for all the delays, for failing to communicate with rural fire services and for his government's continued advocacy of fossil fuels."
Margaret Renkl,
The New York Times:
"If 2019 is truly 'the year we woke up to climate change,' then 2020 should be the year we start actually doing something about it. Because we are very nearly out of time. Listen, I know: Dryer balls won't save the world. Saving the world will take a level of political will the likes of which we have not seen before and which we will categorically never see from this administration. Which makes it all the more crucial to do our part, however small."
Deseret News of Salt Lake City, Editorial Board:
"Utahns should pay considerable attention to the wildfires in Australia. In some parts of the state, the snowpack decreased almost 80% between 1955 and 2013. Because of this, forests are more susceptible to diseases and pests, which helps wildfires to become more frequent and destructive."

National critics select artists for $2,500 awards

Texto completo: The Shreveport Regional Arts Council awarded Artist Fellowships, provided by the City of Shreveport, to outstanding Artists in each of three disciplines: Taffie Garsee (Visual Arts), David Havird (Literary Arts), and Joanie Nerrettig (Performance Arts). These $2,500 cash awards enable each artist to pursue further artistic goals.
The City of Shreveport recognizes the Arts as an essential part of life in Shreveport. The city also partners with The Shreveport Regional Arts Council (SRAC) to serve as the catalyst for participation, education, development, and promotion of excellence in the arts and therefore assigns SRAC to administer the process for selection of the City's Artist Fellowships. SRAC recognizes that individual artists are the lifeblood of the arts and commits to acknowledging distinguished fellows of the highest caliber in each discipline of the arts. Fellowships may be awarded in six categories: Visual Arts, Literary Arts, Performance Arts, Dance, Music, Theatre, and Multi-Disciplinary Arts. The critics reserve the right not to make an award in a category.
Ann Hackett, Lauren Smart, and David Ulin served as the professional jurors making The 2020 Fellowship selections, with the help of Robert Pincus who has been SRAC's Curator of Critics since 2013.
Visual Artist Fellow Garsee's work is bold in the same way that her personality is bold. She often paints in bright, exaggerated colors. She creates unique works by combining fluid painting and brushwork, usually centered on examples of nature she finds in Korthwest Louisiana.
There is a secret in each of her paintings and people are always saying, "OK, where is the critter hiding?" She says that she paints little critters into her paintings that many people think are gross or ugly, but she puts them in human situations where people are restricted from forming biases based on race, gender, and political affiliation.
Hackett, the professional visual arts juror reviewing Garsee's work says that Garsee creates meticulous representations of some of the world's smallest creatures, and you know immediately that she is immensely technically gifted.
"She can paint the silver sheen on the translucent wing of a cicada and the compound eyes of a fly, and somehow she endows her subjects with humor and pathos. A viewer feels as if they could grasp these objects, pull them from the canvas, and feel their weightiness in their hands," Hackett said.
Havird submitted works of both prose and verse in applying for the Fellowship. The prose included a recent 3,700-word essay on a book of poems, Like, by A.E. Stalings, which appeared in Literary Matter and a 5,500-word critical memoir, "Southern Relations: With Robert Lowell at Timrod's Grave," which appeared in The Hopkins Review.
The writer's newest work, Weathering, seems to have set him on a new trajectory. Since the acceptance of the manuscript for book publication, the writer says that he has three additional autobiographical essays in draft and two more in mind.
He intends to continue to chisel at poems and has a new poem set here in Shreveport, but thinks he is possibly foreseeing a new book of creative nonfiction. Havird will retire as a professor from Centenary College in May of 2020.
Ulin, the professional literary arts juror reviewing Havird's work, said that what he finds inspiring about the work of the 2020 Literary Fellowship Award recipient is not only the care and depth with which it is assembled but also a sense of the poet reaching out, testing (or even stepping beyond altogether) the boundaries of genre and of form. Ulin goes on to say, "I am compelled by the openness of the work of this writer, the way it moves in unexpected directions and finds unexpected shapes and juxtapositions. It really is remarkable work."
Nerrettig has created quite the reputation for herself as a local performer and a friend to the Arts. This performance artist has registered 90 songs with BMI since 2014. She was a Music Prize finalist in 2018, named a SRAC Collectible Artist in the same year, and can be seen performing some of the area's favorite festivals and venues including Cirque du Lake Street Festival, RedBud Festival, and Red River Revel Festival as well as Superior Grill, Nobel savage, Margaritaville, and artspace and the Central ArtStation.
Nerrettig said she is always interested in music as a leveling element to unite and enhance the people she is exposed to. In her words, she creates music to engage her audience and to help make the world a better place. She uses her music to help tell stories, create moods, enrich lives, and inspire growth. She refers to her genre Porch Rock and likes to create tracks with authentic analogue rhythm.
Smart, the professional performance arts juror reviewing Nerrettig's work said, "I chose Joanie Nerrettig for the Fellowship award for both her talent and her commitment to building a body of work. She takes every opportunity to seek mentorship, workshop her music, collaborate with other musicians and refine her craft."
Smart praises Nerrettig for taking it upon herself not just to develop her craft, but also to learn the art of both artist management and audio production. Smart said this fellowship-winning artist is a talented songwriter with a quirky personality, a polished stage presence, and a great voice.
Hackett is a writer, editor, and producer, who received her BA from New York University in Art History in 2010. She received her MFA in Creative Writing from the University of New Orleans in 2017. She has published articles, essays, art criticism, and interviews in the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Pelican Bomb, and BURNAWAY.
Ulin is the author or editor of 10 books including Sidewalking: Coming to Terms with Los Angeles, shortlisted for the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay; The Lost Art of Reading: Books and Resistance in a Troubled Time; and Writing Los Angeles: A Literary Anthology, which won a California Book Award.
He is the recipient of a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship; a Tom and Mary Gallagher Fellowship from Black Mountain Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; and a Lannan Foundation Residency Fellowship.
For 10 years, he has been the book editor and book critic of the Los Angeles Times. He now teaches at the University of Southern California. Currently, he is editing the Collected Joan Didion for the Library of America.
Smart is a journalist and critic and on the faculty of Southern Methodist University. She recently worked as the arts and culture editor for the Dallas Observer newspaper and is a contributor to The Dallas Morning News, Arts + Culture Texas, and American Theatre magazine. She holds a master's in arts journalism from Syracuse University and bachelor's degrees in journalism and English from SMU.
Robert Pincus has written regularly for numerous magazines, including Art in America, Artforum, and Art News, and he has contributed commentary and stories to many other publications, including The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. He teaches courses in writing, theory, and criticism for the graduate art program at California State University, Long Beach and has been on the faculty of the art, architecture and art history program at the University of San Diego since 1998.
In 2016, he was the curator of an exhibition at the Cannon Art Gallery, Poetic: Artists in a Visionary Mode. Since 2012, he has been the curator of an innovative visiting critics program of the Shreveport Regional Art Council, Critical Mass.
Eligibility for the Fellowship Awards begins with an Artist being registered on the Northwest Louisiana Artist Directory. Each has demonstrated professional experience in his or her field with a serious career commitment and some degree of peer acceptance, either as an emerging artist of outstanding promise or as an established artist with a body of work.
The Shreveport Regional Arts Council offers the Fellowship Awards in each Art Discipline on an annual basis. For more information visit the Shreveport Regional Arts Council website, shrevearts.org.

Put Trump on shorter leash during impeachment

Texto completo: Surely the threat of imminent removal could pose as serious an impairment of sound executive judgment.
Most of us would think it strange if a teacher charged with sexually molesting his students or a surgeon accused of maiming his patients were allowed unrestricted access to other potential victims while awaiting a jury trial.
So why is a president who stands formally accused of abusing his constitutional authority for personal political gain permitted to exercise that authority with no restrictions whatsoever, even as he faces his own trial before the U.S. Senate?
It's a question that has acquired new urgency in the week since President Donald Trump rang in the new year by authorizing a drone strike that killed Iran's top general, an act of war that Iran answered by firing ballistic missiles at two U.S. bases in Iraq.
Because the attack came from Iran rather than from some Iraqi militia group in thrall to Tehran, alarmists are calling it a game-changing escalation that demands an even-harsher U.S. response. Even before the missiles were launched, Trump threatened to answer any Iranian retaliation in kind, "perhaps in a disproportionate manner."
But Iran provided Iraq with advance warning of Tuesday's missile attack, allowing both Iraqi and U.S. forces time to move their personnel out of harm's way, and there is evidence Iranian missiles may have been deliberately targeted to minimize casualties.
Whether an attack that may have been more bark than bite restores a fragile equilibrium, or triggers an increasingly destructive cycle of escalations, depends largely on Trump's next moves.
Diversionary ploy or US best interests? Did Trump deliberately court the prospect of all-out war merely to distract his constituents from the impeachment articles he faces at home?
Perhaps not. The president has indignantly rejected any insinuation that the assassination of Qasem Soleimani was a diversionary ploy, insisting he ordered the hit only after reviewing "exquisite" intelligence suggesting that Soleimani was poised to launch attacks on U.S. assets in the Middle East.
Trump said Soleimani "was planning a very big attack and a very bad attack for us and other people, and we stopped him."
But lawmakers who received no advance notice of the assassination continue to complain that the White House has disclosed no evidence of such an imminent threat, even in classified briefings, and Trump has spent most of his three-year-tenure disparaging the reliability of the intelligence analysts he now credits for spurring his initiative.
"Between no weapons of mass destruction, no clear and present danger, the Afghanistan papers — there's plenty to be skeptical about," Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, told the New York Times.
Which brings us back to Trump's unique credibility burden, and the dearth of resources available to congressional and military leaders worried about the president's motives.
What you lose when you're accused We're fortunate to live in a country where even those accused of the most heinous crimes are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Even so, the government routinely restricts the liberties of criminal defendants awaiting the judgment of their peers.
Impeachment is not a criminal process, and Trump has not been charged with any crime (although he may be more susceptible to indictment after he leaves office). Yet Trump's current circumstances are strikingly similar to those of a defendant who has been accused but not yet tried in court. You needn't believe the president deserves to be removed from office to understand that the prospect of such a verdict, however remote, has dramatically altered his risks and incentives.
Check power of impeached presidents But though he stands accused of abusing the highest office in the land, Trump faces fewer restrictions than a storefront accountant suspected of cheating his clients. He can still issue executive orders, veto bills adopted by Congress, order the assassination of a foreign leader or put American lives and assets at risk as effortlessly as any president not encumbered by impeachment.
This makes no sense. The 25th Amendment, adopted after the assassination of President John Kennedy, establishes a process by which a president disabled by illness or injury can be temporarily relieved of his duties until those impediments are resolved. Surely the threat of imminent removal could pose as serious an impairment of sound executive judgment.
It's standard operating procedure for corporations to require that CEOs indicted for serious crimes step aside while charges are pending. But allowing the House of Representatives to sideline a president merely by adopting articles of impeachment would radically alter the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.
Even so, wouldn't it make sense to require that any impeached president face conditions on the exercise of his most powerful executive prerogatives? Shouldn't some other executive authority – the cabinet, say, or the Joint Chiefs of Staff – be required to sign off on presidential orders that threaten to embroil the nation in war or destabilize financial markets?
I'm not enough of a constitutional authority to guess which mechanism would be most practicable and least disruptive to the legitimate exercise of presidential authority. But surely the meager restraints currently in place are unequal to the dangerous circumstances our country confronts today.

Texto completo: So CNN has settled the defamation suit brought against it by the lawyer for Nick Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School kid who was vilified for smiling (smirking?) at a drum-beating Native American activist last year in Washington, D.C.
That's one out of about 40 organizations and people Sandmann's lawyer has sued or threatened to sue for things they said or wrote about his 17-year-old client after a misleading video of the event went viral.
When, later, more video and facts came out about what really happened that day, many news outlets revised their coverage, but didn't retract their initial reporting or comments. Former New York Times writer Kurt Eichenwald was quick to accuse Nick and his classmates of being "MAGA thugs." He accused them of harassing 64-year-old Nathan Phillips and declared their behavior "disgusting and inexcusable."
Eichenwald didn't wait to hear Nick's explanation for what he was trying to do when Phillips walked up to him that day pounding a drum in his face. He didn't wait to find out that an angry fringe group called the Black Hebrew Israelites kicked off the confrontation by yelling vile insults at both the CovCath boys AND the Native Americans protesters who were nearby.
What led the drum-banging Phillips to march toward the CovCath kids, as opposed to the real instigators of this weird happening, is still unclear to this day. Perhaps, the boys looked less threatening to him than the angry Black Hebrew Israelite adults. Maybe he thought it better to head in a direction where he was less likely to get punched in the face.
Phillips claimed to the media he wanted to defuse the situation, but referred to the schoolboys as "the beast" and the Black Hebrew Israelites as their "prey." As ridiculous as that claim was, it played well to the media, and they didn't disappoint.
Speaking of getting punched in the face, it was CNN contributor Reza Aslan, who tweeted a photo of the Nick with the words, "Honest question: Have you ever seen a more punchable face?"
This from a man in his mid-40s, a father of three, a former student at Harvard Divinity School, and a member of the American Academy of Religion, the Society of Biblical Literature and the International Qur'anic Studies Association. Well, there is nothing libelous or defamatory about asking such "honest questions." But there is something nasty and adolescent about it, which even Mr. Aslan must know by now. The "question" and photo have disappeared from his Twitter account.
And then there is Bill Maher. "I don't blame the kid, the smirk-face kid," Maher told his audience. "I blame lead poisoning and bad parenting. And, oh yeah, I blame the f------ kid. What a little p----." Ha ha ha. Wait, Maher has something against smirking? The man is a world-class smirker. The man has a resting smirk-face. I blame his parents. But he's 63. So I think it's fair to blame him, too.
When it comes to kids who recently made it into the middle of national and international controversies, Nick seems to me to be one the least attention-seeking or obnoxious. Two others leap to mind: Greta Thunberg and David Hogg.
Hogg, then 17 and now 19, became a gun-control activist after a mass shooting at his high school in Florida. He was cheered on by adult activists when he said of pro-Second Amendment lawmakers: "The pathetic f------ that want to keep killing our children, they could have blood from children splattered all over their faces and they would take no action because they all see those dollar signs."
Hogg parlayed his activism into admission to Harvard University, though his SAT scores (and his race) argued against him getting in. His obnoxiousness won him many detractors on the right, who wrote and said nasty things about him. He reveled in it and gave back as good as he got. Better!
Greta, who has Asperger's syndrome, a milder form of autism, was invited to the United Nations to lecture the world about the dangers of global warming. "I shouldn't be up here," the scowling Swedish teen told world leaders. "Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!" she spat. "You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words."
Yes, I blame her parents. And I also blame the parents of the Time magazine editors who named that poor girl the "Person of the Year." They must've been raised very badly, too. This little girl is being used by adults to push an agenda she has no competence to understand.
But then when it comes to adults using children, certainly some are using Nick, too. They are using o him to punish the media and others for their rush to judgment, liberal bias and downright nastiness.
How about a little less ignorant sanctimony and a little more thoughtful humility.
I know that's a tough ask with that horrible orange man in the White House, but I believe it's good advice just the same.

Business News: Startup CEO, in Reversal, Decides Not to Resign Post

Texto completo: A month after she said she would step down as chief executive of online luggage seller Away, Steph Korey now says she is keeping her job.
Ms. Korey, who resigned in December after an article in the Verge criticized her management style as harsh, said she and her presumptive successor will be co-CEOs of the New York-based startup. She was previously going to become executive chairman.
In a message Monday to employees that was provided by Away, Ms. Korey, who is in her early 30s, said the initial decision to reshuffle the leadership ranks was an attempt to protect the company after the article "unleashed a social media mob." She told the New York Times it was a mistake to "let some inaccurate reporting influence the timeline of a transition plan that we had."
The episode highlights the rising power of employees to put pressure on leaders whose behavior they don't like, and the potential perils for companies that respond quickly and forcefully to the criticism and ensuing backlash.
"There is that pressure to do something, but doing something doesn't always have to be making a final decision," said Erik Bernstein, the president of Bernstein Crisis Management.
Away is a fast-growing startup that has touted its transparent workplace, where most employee communications were public on the Slack messaging application, according to the Verge article. The company said it employs about 500 people.
The Verge article included accusations that Ms. Korey regularly criticized employees in public channels. It also said the company sought to stifle private communication between employees, forbidding them from sending emails to each other.
The article elicited strong criticism of Ms. Korey on social media, including calls for her firing.
After it was published, Ms. Korey apologized in a Dec. 6 statement shared on Twitter, calling her behavior "wrong, plain and simple." She also said she was working with an executive coach to "improve as a leader."
Away is demanding unspecified corrections and retractions to the Verge article, Ms. Korey wrote in Monday's message to employees. The Verge didn't respond to a request for comment. The Verge told the New York Times it stands by its reporting.
Away already had recruited Stuart Haselden from Lululemon Athletica Inc. before the Verge article was published. The company sped up its plans as the reaction intensified, saying last month that Mr. Haselden would become CEO, and Ms. Korey would shift into an executive chairman role, effective Jan. 13.
Ms. Korey will now share the top role with Mr. Haselden, Lululemon's former operating chief, but their responsibilities would follow the original plan, she said Monday.
She said the initial executive changes were misinterpreted as her exiting the company. "So, let me clear that up: I am not leaving the company," she wrote.
Ms. Korey's decision to stay in her role was reported earlier by the New York Times.

U.S. News: Russian Hack Seen at Firm Tied to Biden's Son

Texto completo: Hackers believed to be affiliated with Russia's military breached the Ukrainian gas company where former Vice President Joe Biden's son had served on the board as it became a focus of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, according to a U.S. cybersecurity firm.
Attempts to hack into Burisma Holdings began last November, as Congress was holding hearings into whether Mr. Trump abused his office by pressuring his Ukrainian counterpart to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, according to research published Monday by Area 1, a California-based company.
The hacking attempts are ongoing and linked to the Russian military intelligence unit previously known as the GRU, which hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential election, Area 1 said.
The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment. Russia has denied hacking into U.S. elections.
It wasn't known what information the hackers were seeking or what they obtained, the firm said. In at least one instance, the hackers tricked the recipient of a phishing email into sharing login credentials that allowed them access into one of Burisma's servers, the company said. Area 1's findings were earlier reported by the New York Times.
Messrs. Trump and Giuliani have argued, without evidence, that Mr. Biden's anticorruption push in Ukraine was designed to head off any investigation of Burisma. Both Bidens have denied wrongdoing and said they never discussed Hunter's business in Ukraine.

Air Force to conduct health study amid cancer concerns
Officials at an Air National Guard base in New Hampshire announced that the Air Force will conduct a study amid concerns about exposure to carcinogens at the base.
The occupation health study will take place at the Pease Air National Guard Base and will be conducted with assistance from the Air National Guard surgeon general, the Portsmouth Herald reported Sunday.
The study will examine personnel records of service members that were assigned to the base between January 1970 and December 2019 in order to determine if there was a higher incidence of cancer among those who were assigned to the guard base and the former Pease Air Force base.
The announcement of the study comes after concerns were raised by a group of widows of men who served at the bases.
Officials closed a well at the base in 2014 because of high levels of perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA. Exposure to high levels of the toxic chemical is linked to some forms of cancer.
The women believe people who worked at the base suffered an usually high number of cancer and other health ailments.
Col. John Pogorek, commander of the 157th Air Refueling Wing, said the study is "a defining step toward addressing the health concerns of the men and women who have worked on Pease Air Force Base and Pease Air National Guard Base."

Police say man shot in leg while driving
A Rhode Island man was shot in the leg while driving, according to a police report.
A man was driving Sunday near an elementary school in Providence when he heard a loud noise and felt a pain in his left ankle, WPRI-TV reported.
The man realized he was shot and drove himself to Roger Williams Hospital.
Officers later inspected the car and found a bullet hole in the driver's side door, according to the report. The man told police he was the only one in the car at the time.
HARTFORD, Conn.
Agency expects influx of students from Puerto Rico
State education officials said Monday they're ready to help Connecticut school districts handle an expected influx of students displaced by the earthquakes in Puerto Rico.
The Connecticut State Department of Education issued a statement saying the agency will provide "any guidance and programmatic technical assistance" local districts may need, such as training in trauma-informed education and the best strategies for helping new students who are English learners.
"We will also work closely with the governor's office, the legislature, and members of Connecticut's congressional delegation to identify and advocate for state and federal funding to ensure districts will be able to obtain fiscal support - as it becomes available - in order to cover the costs of serving and educating this new population," read the statement.
Connecticut received a large influx of students from Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island in 2017. The state has a large population of people of Puerto Rican descent.

Professor sues paper over story related to Epstein
A Harvard University law professor announced Monday that he is suing The New York Times for what he calls "clickbait defamation" over a story the newspaper published related to donations from financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Lawrence Lessig filed the lawsuit in response to a story the Times published on Sept. 14 about his thoughts on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology receiving anonymous donations from the wealthy sex offender.
In the lawsuit, Lessig's attorney says the Times published a "sensationalized, false and defamatory "clickbait" headline and lede," USA Today reported.
The story's headline reads, "A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein's Money, Do It in Secret." The first sentence reads, "It is hard to defend soliciting donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law professor, has been trying."
The story was based on an interview with Lessig and a Medium essay he published defending Joi Ito, the director of MIT's Media Lab, who resigned amid an uproar over the lab's ties to Epstein.
WATERTOWN, Conn.
Woman says autistic son denied spot on team
A Connecticut mother has filed a complaint with the state Department of Education alleging that her 12-year-old autistic son was prevented by school officials from joining his middle school's cross country team in violation of federal law.
Maura Kearns, of Watertown, says in her complaint that administrators at Swift Middle School allowed her son to attend one practice last fall before they decided not to allow him to participate on the team, the Republican American of Waterbury reported Sunday.
Kearns wrote in her complaint that school officials later suspended her son from any after-school activities because he bit a teacher and posed a safety risk.
The Bureau of Special Education has assigned an investigator to look into Kearns' complaint, the department said.

Texto completo: Stacey Abrams, the Georgia state legislator who became the first black woman to win a major party gubernatorial nomination in U.S. history, will speak at the University of New England's Portland campus Jan. 22 at noon.
Abrams, a Democrat, lost the 2018 Georgia governor's race to Republican Brian Kemp in a contest she has described as illegitimate. Kemp, who was secretary of state while campaigning for governor, had overseen the implementation of some of the country's strictest voting laws and a purge of 670,000 voter registrations in 2017. His margin of victory was fewer than 55,000 votes, leading Abrams to declare the result tainted.
"I legally acknowledge that Brian Kemp secured a sufficient number of votes under our existing system to become the governor of Georgia," Abrams told the New York Times Magazine last year. "I do not concede that the process was proper, nor do I condone that process."
Abrams, a lawyer and successful romance novelist, is considered a rising star in the Democratic Party for running competitively in a Deep Southern state, and she considered running for U.S. Senate this cycle. In February 2019, she became first African-American woman to deliver an official response to a presidential State of the Union address.
Abrams will speak at Innovation Hall, 716 Stevens Ave., on UNE's Portland campus. The speech is free and open to the public, with seating available on a first-come, first-serve basis. She will be joined by Theodore R. Johnson of the Brennan Center for Justice, who studies race and elections.

Texto completo: DES MOINES — Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday said that Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive and a longtime liberal ally, told her during a private meeting in 2018 that he believed a woman could not win the presidency.
“Among the topics that came up was what would happen if Democrats nominated a female candidate," Warren said in a statement. “I thought a woman could win; he disagreed."
The allegations about Sanders' comments during the meeting, which were first reported by CNN on Monday morning, ruptured the already-strained detente between the two Democrats and brought questions about sexism and politics to the fore a day ahead of the final presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses.
Sanders described the report as “ludicrous" earlier Monday and his aides called it a “lie," setting the stage for a clash when the two senators take the stage with four other candidates here on Tuesday night.
In his statement to CNN, Sanders said that the issue of sexism and politics had come up when the two met privately to discuss their deliberations about running for president in a meeting in Warren's apartment in Washington in late 2018.
“What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could," Sanders told CNN in a statement. “Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016."
The day's developments amounted to a bizarre twist at a crucial moment in the campaign, and left progressives deeply worried the fight between Warren and Sanders would hurt them both in a tight presidential primary.
Warren had no public events on Monday, and her campaign hunkered down for most of the day, ignoring calls and e-mails from reporters as the story rocketed around the Internet. Reached by phone in the early evening, her campaign manager, Roger Lau, did not offer a comment.
But after the CNN report, Sanders' aides moved quickly to tamp the story down.
“I don't believe Elizabeth Warren has commented on it or said it directly, it is because it is a lie," Faiz Shakir, Sanders' campaign manager, told reporters Monday, before Warren's statement. “Everyone's coming at us right now. Come at us, that's fine. But don't spread lies about Bernie Sanders."
Sanders supporters shared two videos on social media of him from the late 1980s supporting the idea of a woman president. “One of the very important things that I hope that all the girls in this class understand is that you just as much as the boys have a right to become president," he told an elementary school class in 1987. A year later on C-Span, Sanders said, “In my view a woman could be elected president of the United States."
Finally, Warren released an evening statement confirming the report, but emphasizing she wanted to move on to other topics.
“I have no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry," Warren said in her statement. “I'm in this race to talk about what's broken in this country and how to fix it — and that's what I'm going to continue to do. I know Bernie is in the race for the same reason."
The two candidates' de facto nonaggression pact snapped Sunday after Politico reported Sanders' volunteers were given a script directing them to persuade Warren supporters to abandon her by claiming she attracted only “affluent" voters. Warren shot back, telling reporters after a town hall in Iowa she was “disappointed" in Sanders for telling volunteers to “trash" her.
Then Warren aimed a dig of her own back at Sanders, suggesting he does not work hard enough to appeal to a broad swath of Democrats. “We cannot nominate someone who takes big chunks of the Democratic coalition for granted," she said. “We need someone who would bring our party together."
Speaking to reporters in Iowa City, Sanders did not dispute the authenticity of the script but downplayed its significance and suggested he had nothing to do with it.
“No one is gonna trash Elizabeth Warren," Sanders said. “We have hundreds of employees. Elizabeth Warren has hundreds of employees. People sometimes say things that they shouldn't."
The heightened tensions — after nearly a year of avoiding attacks on each other — come after a Des Moines Register poll showed Sanders leading the Iowa caucuses, with Warren close behind him. Warren's Iowa organization is rated by local experts as the strongest, but the poll showed Sanders' supporters as the most committed to him compared to his rivals' backers. The squabble between the two progressives could boost former vice president Joe Biden or former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who are also polling in the top four in the crucial state.
“Their nonaggression pact has lasted a very long time, but he broke it," said Boston-based Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh. “It's a risk because it could be mutually assured destruction."
But Marsh added that the dust-up could hurt Sanders among female voters, who have helped power Democratic victories post-Trump. “Women are driving politics, and anyone who doesn't understand that is going to get run over by them," she said.
Despite those victories by women candidates in the 2018 midterms, some Democratic voters have fretted over whether a female candidate would be at a disadvantage against President Trump — a dynamic that has created a double standard in the Democratic primary and forced women candidates to work harder to prove they are “electable."
Speaking earlier this month, former vice president Joe Biden noted the role of sexism in the 2016 campaign, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton, and said “That's not going to happen with me," according to The New York Times. An aide said he was not trying to suggest he was more electable than a woman.
The leaders of the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which backs Warren, urged the two progressives to deescalate with each other.
“We also believe that a back-and-forth about this private meeting is counter-productive for progressives," the group's cofounders said in a statement. “In this pivotal moment of the campaign, progressives must work together to defeat Donald Trump and prevent a less-electable establishment candidate like Joe Biden from getting the nomination."
And Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the liberal group Democracy for America, warned that a failure of the two to work together “can cost us the election."
“This fire was started," Chamberlain said, but “it can be put out by leadership by example from the top."

New Lodestar For BlackRock: Climate Crisis

Texto completo: In his influential annual letter to chief executives, Larry Fink said his firm would avoid investments in companies that "present a high sustainability-related risk."
Laurence D. Fink, the founder and chief executive of BlackRock, plans to announce Tuesday that his firm will make investment decisions with environmental sustainability as a core goal.
BlackRock is the largest in its field, with nearly $ 7 trillion under management, and this move will fundamentally shift its investing policy -- and could reshape how corporate America does business and put pressure on other large money managers to follow suit.
Mr. Fink's annual letter to the chief executives of the world's largest companies is closely watched, and in the 2020 edition he said BlackRock would begin to exit certain investments that "present a high sustainability-related risk," such as those in coal producers. His intent is to encourage every company, not just energy firms, to rethink their carbon footprints.
"Awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance," Mr. Fink wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times. "The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance."
The firm, he wrote, would also introduce new funds that shun fossil fuel-oriented stocks, move more aggressively to vote against management teams that are not making progress on sustainability, and press companies to disclose plans "for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized."
Mr. Fink has not always been the first to address social issues, but his annual letter -- such as his dictum two years ago that companies needed to have a purpose beyond profits -- has the influence to change the conversations inside boardrooms around the globe.
And now Mr. Fink is sounding an alarm on a crisis that he believes is the most profound in his 40 years in finance. "Even if only a fraction of the science is right today, this is a much more structural, long-term crisis," he wrote.
A longtime Democrat, Mr. Fink insisted in an interview that the decision was strictly business. "We are fiduciaries," he said. "Politics isn't part of this."
BlackRock itself has come under criticism from both industry and environmental groups for being behind on pushing these issues. Just last month, a British hedge fund manager, Christopher Hohn, said that it was "appalling" of BlackRock not to require companies to disclose their sustainability efforts, and that the firm's previous efforts had been "full of greenwash."
Climate activists staged several protests outside BlackRock's offices last year, and Mr. Fink himself has received letters from members of Congress urging more action on climate-related investing. According to Ceres and FundVotes, a unit of Morningstar, BlackRock had among the worst voting records on climate issues.
In recent years, many companies and investors have committed to focusing on the environmental impact of business, but none of the largest investors in the country have been willing to make it a central component of their investment strategy.
In that context, Mr. Fink's move is a watershed -- one that could spur a national conversation among financiers and policymakers. However, it's also possible that some of the most ardent climate activists will see it as falling short.
Even so, the new approach may put pressure on the other large money managers and financial firms in the United States -- Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and JPMorgan Chase, among them -- to articulate more ambitious strategies around sustainability.
When 631 investors from around the world, representing some $ 37 trillion in assets, signed a letter last month calling on governments to step up their efforts against climate change, the biggest American firms were conspicuously absent.
BlackRock's decision may give C.E.O.s license to change their own companies' strategy and focus more on sustainability, even if doing so cuts into short-term profits. Such a shift could also provide cover for banks and other financial institutions that finance carbon-emitting businesses to change their own policies.
Had Mr. Fink moved a decade ago to pull BlackRock's funds out of companies that contribute to climate change, his clients would have been well served. In the past 10 years, through Friday, companies in the S&P 500 energy sector had gained just 2 percent in total. In the same period, the broader S&P 500 nearly tripled.
In an interview, Mr. Fink said the decision developed from conversations with "business leaders and how they're thinking about it, talking to different scientists, reading different research." Mr. Fink asked BlackRock to research the economic impacts of climate change; it found that they are already appearing in a meaningful way in the form of higher insurance premiums, for fires and floods, and expects cities to have to pay more for their bonds.
Wherever he goes, he said, he is bombarded with climate questions from investors, often to the exclusion of issues that until recently were once considered more important. "Climate change is almost invariably the top issue that clients around the world raise with BlackRock," he wrote in his letter.
He wrote that he anticipated a major shift, much sooner than many might imagine, in the way money will be allocated.
"This dynamic will accelerate as the next generation takes the helm of government and business," he wrote. "As trillions of dollars shift to millennials over the next few decades, as they become C.E.O.s and C.I.O.s, as they become the policymakers and heads of state, they will further reshape the world's approach to sustainability."
While BlackRock makes its green push, the Trump administration is going in the opposite direction, repealing and weakening laws aimed at protecting the environment and promoting sustainability. Indeed, Mr. Fink's effort appeared to be another example of the private sector pressing on issues that the White House has abandoned.
Still, Mr. Fink made plain that while he intends for the firm to consider climate risks, he would not pursue an across-the-board sale of energy companies that produce fossil fuels. Because of its shear size, BlackRock will remain one of the world's largest investors in fossil-fuel companies.
"Despite recent rapid advances in technology, the science does not yet exist to replace many of today's essential uses of hydrocarbons," he wrote. "We need to be mindful of the economic, scientific, social and political realities of the energy transition."
BlackRock manages money for countries across the globe as well as states and municipalities across the nation. It could face opposition for its new stance in areas that benefit from fossil fuels, like countries in the Middle East or states where oil has become a significant part of their economies.
Mr. Fink said that because much of the money BlackRock manages is invested in passive index funds like those that track the S&P 500, the firm was unable to simply sell shares in companies that it felt were not focused on sustainability. But he did say that the firm could do so in what are known as "actively managed funds," in which BlackRock can choose which stocks are included.
BlackRock also plans to offer new passive funds -- including target-date funds that are based on a person's age and are meant to be used to prepare for retirement -- that will not include fossil fuel companies. Investors will be able to choose these instead of more traditional funds. To the extent that fossil fuel companies are in an index, BlackRock plans to push them to consider their eventual transition to renewable energy. Mr. Fink said the company would vote against them if they are not moving fast enough.
"We will be increasingly disposed to vote against management and board directors when companies are not making sufficient progress on sustainability-related disclosures and the business practices and plans underlying them," he wrote.

Re "Carefully Nourishing a Dying Language" (news article, Jan. 8):
You quote Ross Perlin, a linguistics professor at Columbia University, as saying: "Languages are not dying a natural death. They're disappearing because people have been marginalized and pressured and made to feel bad to speak their language."
I see this daily when I talk with clients in my organization, which helps integrate immigrants into their new communities. I also experienced this myself, as the child of immigrants who came to this country speaking Spanish.
When new arrivals are pressed to speak only English, native languages and dialects fade away. This is a tragic loss because with those languages go precious aspects of a people's history and culture.
This is just one of many reasons for schools to offer dual language education. Another is that we will better prepare our children to succeed in an increasingly multicultural world.

Texto completo: Two psychiatrists offer perspectives on our current political climate.
To the Editor:
Re "Why Is America So Depressed?" (Op-Ed, Jan. 3):
Lee Siegel cites statistics showing alarming increases in anxiety, depression and suicide in the United States, noting (rightly) that the actual numbers would be even higher if they included those who suffer in silence. He attributes this increase in part to the "frightening environment" in which we live. In fact, the World Health Organization identifies depression as a leading cause of disability worldwide.
But his personal story is a good-news story. He acknowledged his illness and he obtained help, though not easily. And then he identified things to live for, to help him find the positive when feeling swallowed up by the negative.
Many stresses (climate change, the culture of violence, the perils of the internet) are worldwide. The United States is a big part of that world, and we need strong leaders to guide us. But while we debate about our polarized country, we should individually take our own emotional pulse, know what our risk factors are, and seek help, preferably before hitting the wall.
John M. Oldham
Houston
The writer, chief of staff at the Menninger Clinic, is a past president of the American Psychiatric Association.
To the Editor:
Lee Siegel writes courageously about his struggles with depression and suicidal thinking. While many in the mental health field have questioned President Trump's fitness to serve, Mr. Siegel touches on a way in which Mr. Trump poses a danger to our country: He is bad for our mental health.
For half the country, this means increased rates of depression and anxiety along with feelings of despair and helplessness and, I imagine, increased levels of cortisol, a stress hormone. For rabid Trump supporters, it means a loss of conscience and a full embrace of living in a world of made-up facts. How else to make sense of the enormous evangelical support this amoral president garners?
Many argue that Donald Trump is the symptom rather than the cause of our predicament. Yet it is hard not to wonder how different our world would be if the most qualified person ever to run for the office of presidency had been elected.

Quentin Tarantino's evocation of 1969 Los Angeles clings to an era it doesn't want to end, even if it has to rewrite history a little to do it. With the story of a fading western star (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his trusty stunt double (Brad Pitt), Tarantino accesses the period through a side door, allowing him the space to cruise top-down through the streets, hang out on Hollywood sound stages and follow the actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) in the blissful days before the Manson family goes to Cielo Drive.

A family of penniless con artists infiltrates the lives of a much wealthier family in Bong Joon Ho's genre-straddling mix of dark comedy, nerve-jangling suspense and incisive social commentary. The less known about the intricacies of the plot going in, the better, since Bong has nested the many twists so meticulously. But as the two families grow more closely intertwined, their fates are tied up in duplicity, an uneasy tension between classes and one very big secret that's primed to detonate.

'The Irishman'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Nominated for: Best picture, director, adapted screenplay, supporting actor (twice), cinematography, costume design, editing, production design and visual effects.
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
Based on Charles Brandt's book "I Heard You Paint Houses," the movie is about Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), who claims to have worked as a hit man for the Bufalino crime family, and to have been responsible for the unsolved disappearance of the former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Yet the dubious facts of Sheeran's "confession" are folded into a uniquely meditative Martin Scorsese gangster epic, which slows the metabolism of films like "Goodfellas" and "Casino" to reflect on death and the consequences of a sinful life.

'Joker'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Nominated for: Best picture, director, actor, adapted screenplay, cinematography, editing, costume design, makeup and hairstyling, original score, sound editing, and sound mixing.
How to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
Standing in stark contrast to the bright, can-do heroism of the Marvel Cinematic Universe -- and going down a darker road than even its DC brethren, like the Christopher Nolan "Batman" series -- "Joker" frames a villain's origins as a grimy tale of urban alienation. As Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who lives with his mother, Joaquin Phoenix more or less slaps clown makeup on Travis Bickle from "Taxi Driver," though the director Todd Phillips lays some of the blame for Fleck's psychosis on a broken social system.

How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
Thirty years after "Kramer vs. Kramer" won best picture, the writer-director Noah Baumbach gets into the excruciating particulars of divorce, especially when child custody is at stake. Adam Driver stars as a New York theater director who's left reeling when his wife (Scarlett Johansson), an actress trying to resume her Hollywood career, hires a skilled attorney (Laura Dern) and works to resettle their 8-year-old son in Los Angeles. The process gets uglier from there, but Baumbach cushions the blows with humor and sneaky optimism.

Director Forced Out At Museum

Texto completo: Joshua Helmer was removed at the Erie Art Museum after a New York Times article about complaints during his tenure at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
The director of a Pennsylvania museum was forced out of his job on Monday in the wake of allegations about a pattern of misconduct at his former job as a manager at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
The director, Joshua Helmer, "is no longer employed at the Erie Art Museum," the Erie museum's board said in a statement. It did not elaborate on whether Mr. Helmer was fired or asked to resign.
The action against the museum director, who had been appointed to the Erie post in 2018, followed a New York Times article on Friday that reported that multiple women had accused Mr. Helmer of making advances toward them in the workplace while he was at the Philadelphia museum and that an intern had made a similar complaint in Erie.
Two women he dated during his four years in Philadelphia directly reported to him, an apparent violation of museum policy, and said in interviews that Mr. Helmer had warned them not to report it. Two others who said they had relationships with him were not direct subordinates, but he outranked them and represented to them that he could hire, fire and promote whom he pleased, the women said. Some of them also described Mr. Helmer berating them in view of other employees.
"This is a victory for women," said Gina Ciralli, who dated Mr. Helmer. She said she had left the institution because of his mistreatment. "Removing Josh from his position of authority creates a safer work environment for everyone in the field. We can all breathe again."
Mr. Helmer, 31, did not respond to requests for comment. In an interview last month, he declined to discuss accounts of his conduct or his relationships with women, but he said he had always followed museum policy.
The Philadelphia Museum had no comment on Monday. It said last week that Mr. Helmer had been "separated" from his post there in February 2018, but that it could not discuss the reasons for his departure because such matters were confidential.
It was unclear what information the Erie Museum had about Mr. Helmer's tenure at Philadelphia before it hired him. But in a statement on Friday, it had defended the thoroughness of its hiring process.
"Prior to offering Mr. Helmer the position at the Erie Art Museum, the board, with the help of an employment consultant, conducted due diligence including background checks," the statement said. "No issues were identified during our due diligence."
Shortly after joining the Erie staff, Mr. Helmer sent texts to a college student working there, suggesting she come to his house. "Coffee my place I have a cool back deck," it said, according to a screenshot the woman, Asla Alkhafaji, provided to The New York Times.
After she told him she could only meet in public, Ms. Alkhafaji said, he began ignoring her at work and one day told her, "You're the most useless intern we have."
The museum said that it had investigated a complaint by Ms. Alkhafaji and found no reason to discipline Mr. Helmer.
"I hope the board will be honest and transparent," said Kelly Armor, a former Erie Art Museum manager who had reported Mr. Helmer's treatment of Ms. Alkhafaji, and who left the museum after clashing with Mr. Helmer. "They need to rebuild a lot of trust."
The pressure on the museum had grown in recent days. The Times's report led to the circulation of an online petition calling for Mr. Helmer's removal in Erie. "Whatever benefit this man provides the art museum pales in comparison to the damage that he has done to women," the petition said.
In addition, more than 250 current and former workers at the Philadelphia Museum signed a statement in solidarity with the women who worked there.
Much of the concern focused on whether the cultural institutions had done enough to scrutinize Mr. Helmer's behavior and work history. On Facebook, the Museum Studies Program at the University of Delaware called the Philadelphia Museum's response and the Erie museum's vetting procedures "inadequate."
At the Philadelphia Museum, Mr. Helmer was made assistant director for interpretation in 2014, just four months after arriving. Last October, ARTNews named him one of the country's museum directors under 40 who were shaping their institutions.
Several women interviewed by The Times described Mr. Helmer as repeatedly building them up and breaking them down. At least three employees who were familiar with these accounts said they reported their concerns to museum managers, starting as early as 2016.
In recent days, another woman, Ashley Scrivener, has come forward to say that she resigned in 2016 from her position in the information technology department at the Philadelphia Museum because of the "toxic work environment" created by Mr. Helmer. She said he had repeatedly asked her out to drinks.
"During my exit interview with the head of human resources, I told them everything about Josh that was disturbing me," she recalled. "H.R.'s response was, 'Oh my God, that's crazy, he shouldn't be saying that.' But in reality, he worked there for another two years."

Texto completo: Moustafa Kassem, detained in Cairo in 2013 and suffering from serious medical problems, had protested his innocence.
CAIRO -- An American imprisoned in Egypt for six years on what he insisted were false charges, and whose case had been championed by Vice President Mike Pence, died on Monday after a long hunger strike, the State Department said.
Moustafa Kassem, 54, a dual Egyptian-American citizen from New York, was arrested in central Cairo in August 2013 during a bloody crackdown following the military takeover that brought to power Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, then an army general and now the president of Egypt.
Mr. Kassem insisted he had no links to opposition politics and had been wrongfully detained by Egyptian soldiers who snatched his American passport and stomped it on the ground.
After years in dire conditions at a high-security prison, where he said his diabetes and a heart ailment went largely untreated, he was sentenced to 15 years in September 2018.
Soon after that, Mr. Kassem went on the first of several hunger strikes, refusing solid food for months on end to protest what he called his unjust imprisonment.
"Moustafa was as apolitical as it gets," said Mohamed Soltan, an Egyptian-American human rights campaigner who spent four months in prison with Mr. Kassem, and was released in 2015. "He was just a bystander who got picked up -- wrong place, wrong time. It's ridiculous that he has died."
Tens of thousands of people have been imprisoned on political charges in Egypt since Mr. Sisi came to power in 2013, including at least seven Americans currently being held. Mr. Kassem was the first of these Americans to die in custody.
The death last year of Mohamed Morsi, the democratically elected president ousted by Mr. el-Sisi who collapsed in court after years of ill health, brought fresh attention to persistent accusations of gross medical negligence by Egypt's prison authorities.
Mr. Kassem was transferred to a hospital in central Cairo last Friday after he began to refuse to take liquids, said Mr. Soltan, who works for the Freedom Initiative, a prisoners' rights group that represented Mr. Kassem. He died Monday afternoon, leaving behind a wife and two children.
His case had been a focus at the top levels of the Trump administration. On a trip to Cairo in September 2018, Mr. Pence pressed his case with Mr. el-Sisi, as well as that of another imprisoned American, Ahmed Etiwy.
Mr. el-Sisi promised to give "very serious attention" to the matter, Mr. Pence told reporters, "I told him we'd like to see those American citizens restored to their families and restored to our country," the vice president said.
Egypt is the second-biggest recipient of United States military aid after Israel, receiving $ 1.3 billion a year. Mr. Trump has regularly lavished praise on Mr. el-Sisi, hailing him for doing a "fantastic job" and calling him "my favorite dictator," even as the Egyptian leader has overseen Egypt's harshest crackdown on freedom of speech and political opposition in decades.
For years, Mr. Kassem pinned his hopes for release on the hope that American officials could use that aid leverage to obtain his freedom. But he became disillusioned, relatives said.
"Moustafa saw his blue passport as a shield, his bulletproof armor, which carried the protection and the force of the United States government behind it," his brother, Mustafa Ahmed, wrote in an article for The New York Times in October 2018.
In April 2017, Mr. Trump pressed the Egyptians to release Aya Hijazi, an American aid worker imprisoned in Egypt. She was quickly brought to the White House amid considerable fanfare. The following year, days after he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment along with 700 other defendants, Mr. Kassem wrote to Mr. Trump to petition him for help.
"Like you, I'm from New York," he said in the handwritten letter, which was smuggled out of the maximum security Tora prison. "I am going on hunger strike knowing full well that I may not survive it," he wrote.
The letter finished: "I am putting my life in your hands."
The Working Group on Egypt, a bipartisan group of foreign affairs experts, raised Mr. Kassem's case in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in June, warning that he was a diabetic with a heart condition who was in imminent danger of death.
Mr. Pompeo responded that the well-being of detained American citizens was a "top priority" for him.
"I am deeply saddened to learn today the death of U.S. citizen Moustafa Kassem who'd been imprisoned in Egypt," the State Department's assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, David Schenker, said at a Monday news briefing. "His death in custody was needless, tragic and avoidable."
The issue of medical negligence in Egyptian prisons came to the fore last June, when Mr. Morsi collapsed in a soundproof cage during a legal hearing and died. Mr. Morsi's family, who had complained for years about inadequate medical treatment in prison, blamed Mr. el-Sisi for his death.
The death put pressure on the Egyptian authorities to improve conditions in prisons, and in November they led foreign reporters on a stage-managed tour of the Tora prison complex south of Cairo, where many political prisoners are held.
Prisoner advocacy groups say that in reality little has changed.
In August, Human Rights Watch said that Khaled Hassan, an Egyptian-American limousine driver imprisoned on terrorism charges, had tried to kill himself in his cell.
On Monday, the Egyptian National Action Group, an opposition group, said that over 300 detainees in the maximum security wing of Tora prison had been on hunger strike since Jan. 5, when a 47-year-old inmate died in detention because of inadequate medical care.

More Money To Be Shifted For the Wall, Officials Say

Texto completo: The amount far exceeds what Congress allocated for border barriers this year as the president, with his eye on his re-election campaign, rushes to show major progress on a signature promise.
President Trump plans to divert an additional $ 7.2 billion in military funding for the construction of a wall on the southern border, according to two people familiar with the plans, as officials rush to show major progress on his signature campaign promise in time for the 2020 election.
The money would be stripped from Defense Department construction and counterdrug projects, the officials said, and amounts to even more than the billions the administration transferred from the Pentagon last year to pay for Mr. Trump's border wall.
Congress allocated a fraction of that in December in the 2020 budget for border barrier construction -- just $ 1.375 billion. But there were also no limitations placed on Mr. Trump's ability to transfer funds from Pentagon accounts. The administration has now allocated more than $ 18 billion for Mr. Trump's border wall.
The funding would allow the administration to complete more than 880 miles of border wall by 2022, the officials said. But Mr. Trump is still far behind on his promise to deliver 450 miles of wall by the end of this year. Just last Friday, the acting homeland security secretary celebrated the completion of 100 miles of border wall, much of it on land already owned by the federal government.
"The wall system you see behind me is an undeniable impediment to smugglers, traffickers and other criminals who have exploited our lack of effective border infrastructure to smuggle drugs, illicit goods and engage in human trafficking," the acting secretary, Chad Wolf, said on Friday.
Mr. Trump's pursuit of a border wall picked up momentum last Thursday when a federal appeals court allowed the administration to use $ 3.6 billion in military construction funds, a move that delayed or suspended 127 military projects. The ruling overturned a decision by an El Paso judge who had found that Mr. Trump's emergency proclamation, which allowed him to obtain the military funds, was unlawful.
"Multiple courts have already ruled that President Trump has no authority to take billions from service members for his xenophobic wall," said Dror Ladin, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project. "The A.C.L.U. won't rest until the president's illegal power grab is blocked once and for all."
The plans to transfer more funds from the Pentagon, first reported by The Washington Post, reaffirm that Mr. Trump is likely to again center his campaign on the border wall, a project that was initially used as a mnemonic device to remind him to focus on immigration at 2016 presidential campaign rallies.
Mr. Trump faces other impediments for his construction, including an investigation into a $ 400 million contract for wall construction awarded to Fisher Sand & Gravel by the Office of Inspector General for the Defense Department. The company's chief executive, Tommy Fisher, has repeatedly pushed for the wall on Fox News, the president's favorite news channel, which has helped others win senior positions in the Department of Homeland Security.
Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, has taken a lead role in Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and specifically the construction of the wall. Mr. Kushner has held meetings with military leaders to discuss moving money to Mr. Trump's border wall.
But money is not the only obstacle: Even as the administration secures funding for the wall, the potential path of the project still runs through land the government does not own.
Mr. Trump has encouraged officials to use eminent domain powers to seize land from private landowners. But many owners of land in the wall's path are fighting the federal government in court, a process that delayed previous administrations' efforts to construct border barriers for years.

Texto completo: In an interview with the editorial board of The New York Times, the senator touched on a broad range of subjects, including China, gun control and wishing people happy birthday.
WASHINGTON -- Senator Bernie Sanders said in an interview that he would consider releasing a list of potential Supreme Court appointees he would name if elected president, and noted that his wife, Jane, also believes he should offer a roster of jurists in the way President Trump did during his 2016 campaign.
Mr. Sanders suggested that it was premature right now to unveil the names of his prospects for the nation's highest court -- "got to kind of win the nomination first," he said -- but he warmed to the idea in an interview with the editorial board of The New York Times.
"It's not a bad idea," Mr. Sanders said, noting that his wife, perhaps his most influential adviser, supported it. "It's a reasonable idea. My wife agrees with you. Yeah. I'll take that into consideration."
Mr. Sanders, a progressive Vermont senator who remains a political independent, does not face the sort of ideological suspicion that many on the right harbored toward Mr. Trump when he ran, but he is viewed warily by some Democrats. And with polls in the states that begin the presidential nominating process showing him at or near the top of the field, his willingness to name his potential Supreme Court appointments at a moment the court is sharply divided could offer a measure of comfort to uneasy primary voters.
The editorial board, which is separate from the publication's newsroom, is making its candidate interviews public this year. It will endorse a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination on Jan. 19.
The board's interview with Mr. Sanders, which lasted 90 minutes and was conducted last month, touched on a broad range of foreign and domestic issues.
Mr. Sanders said he would push the Senate to pass his legislative priorities with a simple majority; called Xi Jinping, China's top leader, a dictator; and acknowledged he had changed his views to become more supportive of gun control.
In his characteristic gruff fashion, he also tangled with the Times editorial board members over whether higher immigration levels can push down domestic wages; bridled at a comparison between Mr. Trump's rallies and the events he said he would hold as president to pressure Republican lawmakers; and, in an exchange that with little embellishment could double as a sketch of Larry David playing Mr. Sanders on "Saturday Night Live," explained why he had little patience for offering people birthday wishes.
Asked by the editors of a paper he reads religiously but often criticizes what he's most likely to fare poorly at as president, Mr. Sanders initially responded, "talk to The New York Times," drawing laughter. But then, with no prompting, he acknowledged: "I don't tolerate bullshit terribly well."
Mr. Sanders conceded that he's not "good at pleasantries" and singled out one particularly grating part of retail politics.
"If you have your birthday, I'm not going to call you up to congratulate you, so you'll love me and you'll write nice things about me," he said. "That's not what I do. Never have. I take that as a little bit of a criticism, self-criticism. I have been amazed at how many people respond to, 'Happy Birthday!' 'Oh Bernie, thanks so much for calling.' It works. It's just not my style."
Mr. Sanders, 78, was equally candid about his exercise and diet struggles since suffering a heart attack last fall, an event that he said came as "a shock" because he had been otherwise healthy.
"I'm eating better. I'm exercising," he began. "Well, not as much as I should. It's hard when you're on the campaign trail, but I am trying to do better."
Mr. Sanders, who allowed that he had eaten ribs the previous night, said he viewed his health "as a public responsibility" and revealed that one of his daughters was prodding him toward a new fitness regimen.
"She's into yoga," he said. "She's a yoga instructor. She's been trying to get me to do this."
Mr. Sanders, though, was more eager to discuss what he calls his "political revolution," his vision for a grass-roots uprising that he believes will apply so much pressure on both Republican and Democratic lawmakers that they will rally to, or at least won't obstruct, his progressive agenda.
He spoke with particular relish about the prospect of taking Air Force One into Kentucky, the home state of Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and mobilizing voters there on issues like "Medicare for all" and addressing climate change.
"This is what makes me a little bit different than other candidates, and that is not only will I be commander in chief, I will be organizer in chief," he said, dismissing the prospect of "sitting with Mitch in the Oval Office or wherever it is, negotiating something."
Such a message represents a contrast to the claims offered by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has said he thinks he can work with Republican lawmakers and find a consensus that has been elusive in Washington.
Yet even some of Mr. Sanders's ideological allies are skeptical he'll be able to push through his agenda without ending Senate rules that require a 60-vote majority to pass most legislation.
He has been reluctant to say he would do away with the legislative filibuster entirely, and again declined to do so in this interview, but without indicating exactly how, he said he would suspend it for his top priorities.
"I like the idea of members of the minority having the freedom to voice their objections, but we will not require 60 votes to save the planet or to pass Medicare for all, or to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, that's for sure," he said.
On foreign policy, which Mr. Sanders has sought to highlight more in this campaign than he did four years ago, he did not offer extensive details on many issues. But he was notably critical of Mr. Xi's effort to further consolidate power in a country that is emerging as the United States' top competitor. While allowing that he's "not the world's greatest authority on China," Mr. Sanders said, "They are an increasingly authoritarian country and that concerns me."
Mr. Xi, he said, "has made the situation even worse."
In Latin America, Mr. Sanders defended his support for some of the hemisphere's left-wing leaders but was more willing to level criticism of them than he often is when the subject is raised.
He said the recently deposed Bolivian president Evo Morales had "a pretty good record" but added, referring to Mr. Morales's attempt to eliminate term limits: "Should he have run for another term although they made it legal? Probably not."
Mr. Sanders has far more support among younger voters than among his generational peers, something he conceded he needed to improve, but he sounded every bit like a septuagenarian when the interview took a more personal turn.
"What's an app on your phone that you have that might surprise people?" he was asked.
"Nothing," Mr. Sanders replied.
He also was unaware of the term "cancel culture." "Help me out a little bit," he asked. "Give me a hint."
And Mr. Sanders declined a request to give an example of when he had his heart broken.
"I won't," he said. "Even candidates for president of the United States have a limited amount of privacy."
In another interview, the editorial board pressed Tom Steyer, a hedge fund billionaire who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination, on why the party would nominate a businessman who, like Mr. Trump, has absolutely no experience in government.
The board also questioned him on controversial investments made by his fund, Farallon Capital, in companies that resisted unions as well as the fund's use of offshore havens to shelter income from taxation.
Mr. Steyer emphasized his decision more than a decade ago to leave his business and devote much of his money to nonprofit causes.
"I have spent a decade running props and building grass-roots organizations, taking on the companies who I believe actually get their way in Washington, D.C., who are getting their way in climate change," he said, a list that he said included fossil fuel and financial services executives.
"If you ask me when I look back at 2008, one of the overwhelming facts is that nobody was criminally prosecuted. To me, that's wrong," Mr. Steyer said, arguing, for example, that J.P. Morgan Chase should have faced criminal charges after the financial crisis.
At another point in the interview, Mr. Steyer teared up as he discussed female mental health workers he met while campaigning in Iowa recently.
"Look, they're being mistreated across the board," he said. "They weren't getting overtime pay, they weren't getting raises, they're underpaid, they were getting physically abused and then fired for not coming back to work fast enough. It was illegal for them to tell the truth outside their job function or they'd be fired. There was a treatment of working people in the United States that's wrong."

Trump Had No Role In Health Care Act

Texto completo: His tweets Monday morning misrepresent his record on health care.
President Trump was not in Washington when the Affordable Care Act established a right to health insurance for Americans with pre-existing health conditions. His first legislative priority as president was a bill that would have repealed key parts of Obamacare and weakened such protections. His Justice Department is arguing in court that the entire law should be overturned.
His tweets Monday morning, describing himself as "the person who saved pre-existing conditions," contradict this record.
It is true that Mr. Trump signed a law eliminating the tax penalties for Americans who go without health insurance -- the so-called individual mandate. That provision was one of the least popular parts of Obamacare. But that legislative change has not improved protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions. If anything, it has placed them in jeopardy, by forming the basis of a lawsuit that could erase the Affordable Care Act.
Here's a brief history of President Trump's record on pre-existing health conditions.
Did he pass the Affordable Care Act?
No. The president was not in Washington and not in politics when the Affordable Care Act was written, debated and passed in 2009 and 2010. The health law established consumer protections for Americans who buy their insurance, including a rule that health insurers must offer coverage to anyone who wishes to buy it, with prices varying only by region and the age of the customer.
Before Obamacare, some states protected people with pre-existing conditions in this way, but most did not. Americans with prior illnesses like cancer, asthma, even acne, often had trouble buying insurance for themselves and their families. One state that did protect people with pre-existing conditions was New York, where the media executive and presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg currently resides and where Mr. Trump did at the time. (Mr. Bloomberg's recent television advertisements, which attack Mr. Trump's health care record, appear to have prompted the tweets.)
The Affordable Care Act was a large and complex law, with many provisions that have proved controversial. But the protections for people with pre-existing conditions enjoy widespread public support.
Has he tried to weaken pre-existing conditions protections as president?
Yes. President Trump's first legislative priority after his election was to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act. Republicans in Congress voted on several different bills, but each of them had provisions that would have substantially eroded the current protections for Americans with prior health conditions, by weakening the regulations that make such insurance available, affordable and useful.
The bills would have weakened rules that require insurance to cover a standard set of health benefits, for example, and would have established policies that would have raised prices for people with a history of health problems.
Those bills didn't pass, in part because of public concern about the erosion of these popular protections. The Republican-led Senate was unable to muster a majority to vote for any of several repeal bills.
The president is also responsible for a number of regulatory changes that critics have characterized as "sabotage" of Obamacare. Despite these changes, Obamacare markets have remained fairly stable. But economists and actuaries say that some of the changes, which allow the sale of insurance lacking protections for pre-existing conditions, probably raise insurance prices for sicker customers, if only by a little.
Has he supported a lawsuit to erase pre-existing health protections?
Yes. The Justice Department filed its latest brief in the lawsuit just last week. If the Trump administration wins the case, all of Obamacare would be declared unconstitutional and eliminated.
Such a change would cause many changes and could set off widespread disruption throughout the health system. Among the changes, the protection for pre-existing conditions in Obamacare would go away if the courts agreed with the White House's legal position.
The basis of this case is the change to the health law that Mr. Trump mentioned in his tweet. By eliminating the tax penalty for people who do not buy insurance, the White House argues that Congress has made all of the health law legally invalid. So far, a Federal District Court judge in Texas has agreed with this argument. An appeals court in New Orleans is waiting for more analysis to decide whether it agrees, but it has signaled openness to the argument.
The president has promised on numerous occasions to release a new health plan, which he presumably would champion should he win in court. But he has never released such a plan or even discussed its broad contours.
His silence on concrete policy preferences makes it hard to assess his statement that this plan will "protect your pre-existing conditions." His record so far has not been strong.
What about the Democrats?
The party has been consistent and united in defense of Obamacare's pre-existing conditions protections. Preserving them was a centerpiece of 2018 midterm campaigns. Democratic state officials and the House of Representatives have intervened in the Obamacare lawsuit to defend the law.
Some Democrats support large changes to the health system. "Medicare for all," a proposal endorsed by more than 100 Democratic House members and two major presidential candidates, would reshape the health system by eliminating private health insurance and replacing it with generous government coverage funded with tax revenues. But by providing identical health coverage for every American, this proposal would do nothing that could plausibly weaken access for people with a history of illness.
What does this have to do with Michael Bloomberg?
Mr. Bloomberg responded to the president's tweets with sarcasm, focusing on the lawsuit.
Mr. Bloomberg is blanketing airwaves with an advertisement on his own health care record. The ad opens with a very critical assessment of the president's health care record, describing it as "threatening coverage for millions of Americans."
It is worth noting that Mr. Bloomberg also had no role in passing Obamacare. His ad claims credit for cutting the uninsured rate in New York City in half while he was mayor. The main cause of that change was the Affordable Care Act, not any particular action he took.
But Mr. Bloomberg has taken no positions that would directly imperil the health law's pre-existing conditions protections. His campaign's health care plan, released recently, would tend to expand insurance access and make insurance more affordable for groups that struggle to buy insurance now. Assessments of various Trump proposals, including legislation that Congress considered and the effects of a legal victory in the lawsuit, support the "millions" claim.

Warren Says Sanders Told Her a Woman Could Not Win the Presidency

Texto completo: Earlier on Monday, Bernie Sanders had denied making the remark in a private 2018 meeting with Elizabeth Warren, accusing her campaign staff of "lying about what happened."
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Monday night that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont told her in 2018 he did not think a woman could win the presidency. Ms. Warren's description of the comment, from a private one-on-one meeting, represents a remarkable salvo at her leading liberal rival in the 2020 race just three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.
Mr. Sanders vehemently denied making the remark earlier on Monday and accused the Warren campaign staff of "lying" about it, in a statement intended to refute a news report by CNN that relied on anonymous sources. The New York Times and other outlets confirmed the CNN report on Monday afternoon, while the Warren campaign initially declined to comment.
With the two Democrats set to face off Tuesday night in their next televised debate, they now find themselves in the most tense standoff of the Democratic nomination fight: Mr. Sanders insisting he did not make the explosive remark, which risks alienating many Democrats, and Ms. Warren saying on the record that he did make the comment.
Ms. Warren, in a statement on Monday night, said that Mr. Sanders made the remark at a two-hour meeting in December 2018 where they discussed the 2020 election and "our past work together and our shared goals," in particular defeating President Trump.
"Among the topics that came up was what would happen if Democrats nominated a female candidate. I thought a woman could win; he disagreed," she said. "I have no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry." She added that she and Mr. Sanders were "friends and allies" and said she believed they would continue to work together to beat Mr. Trump.
Internally, the Sanders campaign was roiled by Ms. Warren's statement, which seemed to catch several staff members off guard.
Her statement represents a startling break in the Warren-Sanders relationship, which has largely been cordial and mutually beneficial. The two are both leading candidates in Iowa, where they are fighting for a similar voter slice, and the back-and-forth will most likely animate not only Tuesday night's debate but the jockeying among the liberal groups and activists who are aligned behind either candidate.
Ms. Warren's advisers insisted that she had no intention of making this private meeting a public spectacle. However, after Mr. Sanders's team forcefully denied the reports, some advisers said they believed she had no choice but to offer her account firsthand.
Mr. Sanders, in his statement earlier on Monday, said it was "ludicrous" to think he would have made such a comment.
"It's sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened," Mr. Sanders said. "Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by three million votes in 2016."
Mr. Sanders added that he had told Ms. Warren "that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could."
The people familiar with the 2018 meeting, who were briefed on it shortly after it took place but were not authorized to speak publicly, said Mr. Sanders offered the comment while giving his assessment of the coming race. In relaying to Ms. Warren the challenges he thought her campaign would face, he said not only that President Trump would weaponize sexism, but also that such attacks would preclude a woman from being elected, according to the private accounts.
Larry Cohen, a longtime friend and adviser to Mr. Sanders, had said earlier Monday that Mr. Sanders told him about the meeting after it happened and that he did not believe the report.
"Everything I know about Bernie Sanders for 30 years tells me he would never speak like that, let alone to a woman he admires tremendously," Mr. Cohen said.
Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, had called on Ms. Warren Monday afternoon to refute the accusation.
"We need to hear from her directly," Mr. Shakir said, "but I know what she would say -- that it is not true, that it is a lie."
The existence of the meeting has been public since shortly after it happened in December 2018. The New York Times reported shortly after the meeting took place that Ms. Warren had sought it "as a courtesy," and that neither party had tried to gain the other's support or discourage the other from running. But the two senators were the only people in the room, and all reports of what was said had been secondhand.
Asked last March whether Mr. Sanders had urged her not to run, Ms. Warren said, "Bernie and I had a private dinner, and my view is that dinner stays private."
The full political impact of the controversy could hinge on what happens during Tuesday's debate in Des Moines. Up to this point, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have focused their attacks on more moderate rivals, a consequence of their friendship and a desire to not damage the party's left wing.
However, tensions between the two campaigns -- and among their most fervent supporters -- have increased in recent days. One well-respected poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN placed Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren as the top two candidates in Iowa, with Mr. Sanders leading the pack.
Beyond how the candidates grapple with the issue is the matter of how exactly it's perceived -- as a sexist gibe by a candidate whose 2016 campaign faced complaints from female staff members, an 11th-hour smear by a candidate who has lost ground or some combination of both.
Over the weekend, Politico reported on a script distributed to volunteers for the Sanders campaign that suggested telling backers of Ms. Warren to support Mr. Sanders instead. "The people who support her are highly educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what," the script said. "She's bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party."
Responding to the leaked script, Ms. Warren said that Mr. Sanders had been "sending his volunteers out to trash me."
She urged against repeating the "factionalism" seen among Democrats during the 2016 primary, in which Mr. Sanders faced off against Mrs. Clinton. "We can't have a repeat of that," she said. "Democrats need to unite our party and that means pulling in all parts of the Democratic coalition."
Mr. Sanders said that he had never personally attacked Ms. Warren, and that both campaigns had hundreds of employees, who "sometimes say things that they shouldn't."
Late Monday, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, another Democratic presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter that she had also met with Mr. Sanders before announcing her bid.
"We had a nice one-on-one conversation and I informed him that I would be running for president," she said. "In that meeting, he showed me the greatest respect and encouragement, just as he always has."
Democracy for America, a prominent progressive group, expressed alarm on Monday at the growing tensions.
"You both are progressive champs & our movement needs to see you working together to defeat your corporate Dem opponents -- not attack each other," the group tweeted. "Progressives will win in 2020, but only if we don't let the corporate wing or Trump divide us."

Texto completo: Norwegian research raises questions about whether certain ways of sharing of information violate data privacy laws in Europe and the United States.
Popular dating services like Grindr, OkCupid and Tinder are spreading user information like dating choices and precise location to advertising and marketing companies in ways that may violate privacy laws, according to a new report that examined some of the world's most downloaded Android apps.
Grindr, the world's most popular gay dating app, transmitted user-tracking codes and the app's name to more than a dozen companies, essentially tagging individuals with their sexual orientation, according to the report, which was released Tuesday by the Norwegian Consumer Council, a government-funded nonprofit organization in Oslo.
Grindr also sent a user's location to multiple companies, which may then share that data with many other businesses, the report said. When The New York Times tested Grinder's Android app, it shared precise latitude and longitude information with five companies.
The researchers also reported that the OkCupid app sent a user's ethnicity and answers to personal profile questions -- like "Have you used psychedelic drugs?" -- to a firm that helps companies tailor marketing messages to users. The Times found that the OkCupid site had recently posted a list of more than 300 advertising and analytics "partners" with which it may share users' information.
"Any consumer with an average number of apps on their phone -- anywhere between 40 and 80 apps -- will have their data shared with hundreds or perhaps thousands of actors online," said Finn Myrstad, the digital policy director for the Norwegian Consumer Council, who oversaw the report.
The report, "Out of Control: How Consumers Are Exploited by the Online Advertising Industry," adds to a growing body of research exposing a vast ecosystem of companies that freely track hundreds of millions of people and peddle their personal information. This surveillance system enables scores of businesses, whose names are unknown to many consumers, to quietly profile individuals, target them with ads and try to sway their behavior.
The report appears just two weeks after California put into effect a broad new consumer privacy law. Among other things, the law requires many companies that trade consumers' personal details for money or other compensation to allow people to easily stop the spread of their information.
In addition, regulators in the European Union are stepping up enforcement of their own data protection law, which prohibits companies from collecting personal information on religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, sex life and other sensitive subjects without a person's explicit consent.
The Norwegian group said it planned to file complaints on Tuesday asking regulators in Oslo to investigate Grindr and five ad tech companies for possible violations of the European data protection law. A coalition of consumer groups in the United States said it was also sending letters to American regulators, including the attorney general of California, urging them to investigate whether the companies' practices violated federal and state laws.
In a statement, the Match Group, which owns OkCupid and Tinder, said it worked with outside companies to assist with providing services and shared only specific user data deemed necessary for those services. Match added that it complied with privacy laws and had strict contracts with vendors to ensure the security of users' personal data.
In a statement, Grindr said it had not received a copy of the report and could not comment specifically on the content. Grindr added that it valued users' privacy, had put safeguards in place to protect their personal information and described its data practices -- and users' privacy options -- in its privacy policy
The report examines how developers embed software from ad tech companies into their apps to track users' app use and real-life locations, a common practice. To help developers place ads in their apps, ad tech companies may spread users' information to advertisers, personalized marketing services, location data brokers and ad platforms.
The personal data that ad software extracts from apps is typically tied to a user-tracking code that is unique for each mobile device. Companies use the tracking codes to build rich profiles of people over time across multiple apps and sites. But even without their real names, individuals in such data sets may be identified and located in real life.
For the report, the Norwegian Consumer Council hired Mnemonic, a cybersecurity firm in Oslo, to examine how ad tech software extracted user data from 10 popular Android apps. The findings suggest that some companies treat intimate information, like gender preference or drug habits, no differently from more innocuous information, like favorite foods.
Among other things, the researchers found that Tinder sent a user's gender and the gender the user was looking to date to two marketing firms.
The researchers did not test iPhone apps. Settings on both Android phones and iPhones enable users to limit ad tracking.
The group's findings illustrate how challenging it would be for even the most intrepid consumers to track and hinder the spread of their personal information.
Grindr's app, for instance, includes software from MoPub, Twitter's ad service, which can collect the app's name and a user's precise device location, the report said. MoPub in turn says it may share user data with more than 180 partner companies. One of those partners is an ad tech company owned by AT&T, which may share data with more than 1,000 "third-party providers."
In a statement, Twitter said: "We are currently investigating this issue to understand the sufficiency of Grindr's consent mechanism. In the meantime, we have disabled Grindr's MoPub account."
AT&T did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The spread of users' location and other sensitive information could present particular risks to people who use Grindr in countries, like Qatar and Pakistan, where consensual same-sex sexual acts are illegal.
This is not the first time that Grindr has faced criticism for spreading its users' information. In 2018, another Norwegian nonprofit group found that the app had been broadcasting users' H.I.V. status to two mobile app service companies. Grindr subsequently announced that it had stopped the practice.
The report's findings also raise questions about the extent to which businesses are complying with the new California privacy law. The law requires many companies that benefit from trading consumers' personal details to prominently post a "Do Not Sell My Data" option, allowing people to stop the spread of their information.
But Grindr's stance challenges that idea. By agreeing to its policy, its site says, users "are directing us to disclose" their personal information "and, therefore, Grindr does not sell your personal data."
Mr. Myrstad said many consumers were comfortable sharing their data with apps they trusted. "But this study clearly shows that many apps abuse that trust," he said. "Authorities need to enforce the rules we have, and if they are not good enough, we have to make better rules."

Texto completo: Two psychiatrists offer perspectives on our current political climate. Also: Dying languages.
To the Editor:
Re "Why Is America So Depressed?" (Op-Ed, Jan. 3):
Lee Siegel cites statistics showing alarming increases in anxiety, depression and suicide in the United States, noting (rightly) that the actual numbers would be even higher if they included those who suffer in silence. He attributes this increase in part to the "frightening environment" in which we live. In fact, the World Health Organization identifies depression as a leading cause of disability worldwide.
But his personal story is a good-news story. He acknowledged his illness and he obtained help, though not easily. And then he identified things to live for, to help him find the positive when feeling swallowed up by the negative.
Many stresses (climate change, the culture of violence, the perils of the internet) are worldwide. The United States is a big part of that world, and we need strong leaders to guide us. But while we debate about our polarized country, we should individually take our own emotional pulse, know what our risk factors are, and seek help, preferably before hitting the wall.

The writer, chief of staff at the Menninger Clinic, is a past president of the American Psychiatric Association.
To the Editor:
Lee Siegel writes courageously about his struggles with depression and suicidal thinking. While many in the mental health field have questioned President Trump's fitness to serve, Mr. Siegel touches on a way in which Mr. Trump poses a danger to our country: He is bad for our mental health.
For half the country, this means increased rates of depression and anxiety along with feelings of despair and helplessness and, I imagine, increased levels of cortisol, a stress hormone. For rabid Trump supporters, it means a loss of conscience and a full embrace of living in a world of made-up facts. How else to make sense of the enormous evangelical support this amoral president garners?
Many argue that Donald Trump is the symptom rather than the cause of our predicament. Yet it is hard not to wonder how different our world would be if the most qualified person ever to run for the office of presidency had been elected.

Don't Let Minority Languages Die
To the Editor:
Re "Carefully Nourishing a Dying Language" (news article, Jan. 8):
You quote Ross Perlin, a linguistics professor at Columbia University, as saying: "Languages are not dying a natural death. They're disappearing because people have been marginalized and pressured and made to feel bad to speak their language."
I see this daily when I talk with clients in my organization, which helps integrate immigrants into their new communities. I also experienced this myself, as the child of immigrants who came to this country speaking Spanish.
When new arrivals are pressed to speak only English, native languages and dialects fade away. This is a tragic loss because with those languages go precious aspects of a people's history and culture.
This is just one of many reasons for schools to offer dual language education. Another is that we will better prepare our children to succeed in an increasingly multicultural world.

Texto completo: For nearly four decades, his lyrical columns for The Times brought readers to the banks of clear-running streams and the hushed glades of majestic forests.
Nelson Bryant, whose lyrical columns in The New York Times for nearly four decades chronicled his love affair with fishing, hunting and outdoor life, and made him the dean of outdoor writers in America, died on Saturday in Oak Bluffs, Mass., on Martha's Vineyard. He was 96.
His longtime partner, Ruth Kirchmeier, confirmed the death, at Martha's Vineyard Hospital. He lived on the Vineyard, in West Tisbury.
From the mangroves of the Yucatán watching for green-winged teals to the grand ballet of fly-fishing on the Salmon River in Nova Scotia, Mr. Bryant's often-poetic, first-person accounts took readers to many places, but perhaps none more so than the mythical past, when boys went fishing with their fathers, watched rainbow trout hover above the pebbles in a brook and learned that patience, cultivated during hours in a duck blind, was more than a needlepoint virtue. His insights appealed to many readers who had never set foot in woods or a stream.
Raised on Martha's Vineyard, Mr. Bryant was a seaman, a carpenter, a ditch digger, a logger, a cook and a dock builder. He was also a Dartmouth College graduate and a reporter and the managing editor of The Claremont Daily Eagle in west-central New Hampshire for more than a decade in the 1950s and '60s.
But he was never far from the hunting, fishing and outdoor life he had learned from his father, and his storehouse of field skills and lore were deployed in the sports section of The Times from 1967 to 2005, often in four or five columns a week, under the rubrics "Wood, Field and Stream" and later "Outdoors."
Unlike news articles, columns reflect an author's opinions and experiences, and Mr. Bryant, who often took his two sons on camping, fishing and hunting expeditions, offered readers not only his knowledge of wildlife and the rods, reels, lures and guns to bag it, but also insights into what his experiences meant to him.
"A duck blind is a marvelous spot for a good talk, because it encourages both intimacy and inspired storytelling," he wrote about a hunt with his son Jeff in 2004. "There are occasions when the talk becomes so animated that neither inhabitant notices that a brace of mallards has landed among the decoys."
After a hunt with his son Steve, he wrote: "Deer camp talk is almost always more animated and revealing than that encountered in fishing camps. The early darkness, the long, cold evenings, the smell of woodsmoke and the necessity to remain indoors together in the cabin create a primal intimacy."
Challenged occasionally by readers who objected to killing animals and urged him to use a camera instead, Mr. Bryant responded by calling hunting "honorable" and noting that he ate what he killed. He suggested ways to prepare fish and fowl for the table, and illustrated columns with photographs he took.
With his white beard and weather-beaten face, an old pipe clenched in his teeth, he looked like a 19th-century seafarer: a big, sturdy outdoorsman who climbed mountains, portaged canoes and carried his load of guns and tents. But he was remarkably graceful in a trout stream, and his cast was delicate and precise -- plop, into the distant pool where the rainbows lurked.
"Every sport has a supreme chronicler," The Philadelphia Inquirer said in 1994. "Nobody has written about baseball like Roger Angell. Nobody has written about golf like Bernard Darwin. Nobody has written about boxing like A.J. Liebling. Nobody has written about the outdoors like Nelson Bryant."
Nelson Steele Bryant was born in Red Bank, N.J., on April 22, 1923, to Nelson and Olga (Griffin) Bryant. His father lost a stake in a Jersey Shore hotel and later his Depression-era job as an accountant in Boston, and the family moved to West Tisbury in 1932.
The boy found himself in paradise. He attended island schools, went hunting and fishing with his father and grew up amid the idyllic beauty of the dunes and salt ponds, the marshes chattering with wildlife and the Atlantic pounding the pristine barrier-island beaches from Chappaquiddick to Gay Head. He would return to the island repeatedly over the years before taking up residence there again.
He enrolled at Dartmouth after graduating from Vineyard Haven High School in 1941, but when the United States entered World War II before the year was out, he enlisted in the Army, volunteered for parachute duty and on D-Day dropped into Normandy with the 82nd Airborne Division as the Allies invaded Europe. Behind enemy lines, he was shot in the chest; the slug hit a lung but no major artery. After recovering in Wales, he returned to the war and fought in the Battle of the Bulge.
After the war he was a deckhand on a schooner, working for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.
He married Jean Morgan in 1946, and they had two sons and two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce in 1989, and Jean Bryant died in 2012. Besides Ms. Kirchmeier, Mr. Bryant is survived by his sons, Stephen and Jeffrey; his daughter Mary Bryant Bailey; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. His daughter Alison died in 2009.
Mr. Bryant returned to Dartmouth and earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1952. He began his newspaper career as a reporter for The Claremont Daily Eagle (now The Eagle Times) and from 1954 to 1966 was its managing editor. He also occasionally wrote outdoors columns.
Unable to make ends meet, Mr. Bryant quit the paper, returned to Martha's Vineyard and was building docks to support a growing family when he learned that the author of The Times's "Wood, Field and Stream" column, Oscar Godbout, had died. He applied for the job and was hired.
His first Times column, on Oct. 31, 1967, offered thoughts on pickerel vs. trout, and hints of the writer to come: "The thought of fly casting for a fish that bears a superficial resemblance to a snake may be more than some purists can stomach. Trout are beautiful and wise, pickerel are neither. However, a man cannot always chase rainbows."
For many years, his columns were illustrated with pen-and-ink drawings by Glenn Wolff.
Mr. Bryant was the author of "Fresh Air, Bright Water: Adventures in Wood, Field and Stream" (1971); "The Wildfowler's World" (1973, with Hanson Carroll); "Outdoors," a 1990 collection of his columns; and a memoir, "Mill Pond Joe: Naturalist, Writer, Journalist and New York Times Columnist" (2014).
In a valedictory in The Martha's Vineyard Times in 2012, he confessed to being a romantic about the outdoor life.
"More than anything else, I wanted to be alone in the forest primeval," he wrote. "I didn't want to encounter another hunter. I enjoyed sitting on a rocky ledge looking down into the valley through which an enchanting trout river, the Dead Diamond, flows. I enjoyed sharing my backpack lunch with chickadees and chipmunks, then wandering so deep into the woods, I knew that darkness would fall before I made it back to the cabin."
Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.

Texto completo: The poll, conducted by Monmouth University, found Mr. Biden's top three competitors in close pursuit.
Joseph R. Biden Jr. has regained some of his strength in Iowa, but his three closest rivals for the Democratic nomination remain clustered at his heels, according to a Monmouth University poll released on Monday.
The poll, published three weeks before Iowa's first-in-the-nation nominating contest, found the former vice president with support from 24 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, a bump of five percentage points since Monmouth's most recent Iowa poll, in November.
Mr. Biden's three closest competitors are clumped together in a statistical tie, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont earning 18 percent support, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., 17 percent, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts earning 15 percent. The poll had a five-point margin of error.
Mr. Sanders has leapt five points since the last Monmouth poll of the state, Mr. Buttigieg experienced a five-point drop, and Ms. Warren experienced a three-point drop.
The Monmouth poll's results differ somewhat from those of a CNN/Des Moines Register poll released late last week that showed Mr. Sanders atop the Democratic field, with 20 percent support, though Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg were in a statistical tie with him. That poll, which was taken in the days just before the Monmouth poll was conducted, found Mr. Biden at just 15 percent.
Taken together, those polls -- while conflicting -- affirm the general impression that this race remains competitive for each of the four leading candidates, at least in the first two nominating states. All have robust field operations in Iowa and have consistently polled in the double-digits there since early fall. And in New Hampshire, which will hold the country's first primary just a week after the Iowa caucuses, polls suggest that all four candidates have a viable shot at winning.
The Monmouth poll of Iowa was taken from Jan. 9 to Jan. 12, and surveyed 405 likely caucusgoers. It found that a slim majority of Democratic voters still have not firmly decided on a candidate, meaning that there is still a great deal of fluidity in the state.
It was conducted before the departure of Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who dropped out of the race on Monday and who pulled 4 percent support in the poll.
Under the rules of the Iowa caucuses, many voters who support less popular candidates will have to back someone other than their top choice in the final balloting. Ms. Warren has strength in this regard: She is by far the most popular second-choice pick among voters, with 23 percent naming her as their personal runner-up, according to the poll. No candidate enjoys a higher favorability rating than Ms. Warren, who is seen positively by 73 percent of likely caucusgoers.
Still, when voters were asked to choose from among only the top four candidates, it was Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg who benefited the most. In this scenario, Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders were all bunched up in the mid-to-high 20-percent range, while Ms. Warren's support was at 16 percent.
The Iowa Democratic electorate remains focused mostly on domestic issues, with 45 percent calling health care their top concern and another 18 percent naming either jobs or income inequality, according to the Monmouth poll.
But with President Trump embroiled in a tense standoff with Iran this month, some voters have also turned more attention to foreign policy. The share of likely caucusgoers who named international affairs as their main focus jumped by 10 points since November, to 16 percent.
Also on Monday, Quinnipiac University released a national poll that showed Mr. Biden at the top of the heap, with 25 percent support among Democratic voters nationwide, followed by Mr. Sanders at 19 percent and Ms. Warren at 16 percent. Mr. Buttigieg commanded just 8 percent nationwide. Since the primaries and caucuses take place over a series of months, the national picture is almost certain to shift as the season continues.

Texto completo: More than half are children's books, but "1984," "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Fahrenheit 451" also made the list.
New York Public Library books have been circulating among New York City homes for 125 years. Now the library system, the largest of its kind in the United States, has crunched the numbers to come up with the 10 most checked-out books in its history.
Perhaps not surprisingly, more than half are books for children or young readers. No. 1 is "The Snowy Day," Ezra Jack Keats's picture book that is one of the first to depict an African-American boy, which has been checked out 485,583 times. Next is Dr. Seuss's "The Cat in the Hat" (469,650).
Maurice Sendak's "Where the Wild Things Are" (436,016), "Charlotte's Web," by E.B. White (337,948), J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" (231,022) and "The Very Hungry Caterpillar," by Eric Carle (189,550) also made the top 10.
Librarians and analysts spent over six months parsing through hundreds of titles to compile the list. They considered all book formats, including e-books and foreign-language editions.
"There was a little bit of art to the science of doing this," said Andrew Medlar, who runs the library's book-buying operation and led the team that worked on the list.
Because the library's central circulation system only goes back several decades, the team used recent circulation data, best-seller lists, archives from the National Book Awards and Newbery Medals, and the library's best-of lists to figure out what books were most beloved by patrons.
"The idea was to see what has been generally popular out in the world," Medlar said. "We wanted to start from the love of books and the love of reading rather than the numbers."
Books that had been in circulation longer had a clear advantage, as they had more time to rack up checkouts. "To me it's amazing that 'Harry Potter' made it onto this top 10 list," Medlar said, considering the book was published a little more than 20 years ago. The oldest book on the list, "How to Win Friends and Influence People," was only one slot above "Harry Potter" despite being around since 1936.
The list also includes an honorable mention: "Goodnight Moon," by Margaret Wise Brown.
"We know that book is incredibly popular and has a lot of checkouts," Medlar said, but because of the tastes of Anne Carroll Moore, an influential children's librarian at the time of the book's publication, in 1947, "Goodnight Moon" was not added to the collection until 25 years later. Every other book on the list was added to the collection the year it was published.
This list kicks off the library's programming for its 125th anniversary, which will include public events, the reopening of the circulating central library in Midtown Manhattan and a special edition MetroCard and library card inspired by "The Snowy Day," Medlar said.
He encouraged patrons to keep voting with their library cards. "New Yorkers created this list," he said. "We just counted it."
Here are the 10 most checked out books:
1. "The Snowy Day," by Ezra Jack Keats (485,583 checkouts)
2. "The Cat in the Hat," by Dr. Seuss (469,650)
3. "1984," by George Orwell (441,770)
4. "Where the Wild Things Are," by Maurice Sendak (436,016)
5. "To Kill a Mockingbird," by Harper Lee (422,912)
6. "Charlotte's Web," by E.B. White (337,948)
7. "Fahrenheit 451," by Ray Bradbury (316,404)
8. "How to Win Friends and Influence People," by Dale Carnegie (284,524)
9. "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," by J.K. Rowling (231,022)
10. "The Very Hungry Caterpillar," by Eric Carle (189,550)

Texto completo: A search of the van used by the man and woman in the attack also uncovered enough material for a second bomb, officials said.
A bomb found in the van used by the man and woman who attacked a kosher market and killed four people in Jersey City, N.J., last month could have killed or wounded people up to five football fields away, federal officials said on Monday.
The man and woman, David N. Anderson and Francine Graham, also had materials to make a second bomb, officials said at a news conference.
In addition, officials provided new details on Monday about the activities of Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham in the hours, days and weeks before their deadly rampage and, for the first time, linked them to a highway shooting near Newark on Dec. 3.
The Dec. 10 attack on the JC Kosher Supermarket, in a small but growing Jewish slice of Jersey City's Greenville neighborhood, is being treated as an act of domestic terrorism by law enforcement authorities. Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham were killed by police officers during the attack.
Investigators believe that Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham, who killed a police officer and three bystanders in Jersey City, were "fueled both by anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs," New Jersey's attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal, said last month.
"We know now that they planned greater acts of mayhem on both communities," Craig Carpenito, the United States attorney for New Jersey, said on Monday, referring to Jews and law enforcement officers.
The broader plot was thwarted, Mr. Carpenito added, by the intervention of Joseph Seals, a Jersey City police detective who was fatally shot by Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham in a cemetery about a mile from the kosher market.
Detective Seals, officials said, was in the cemetery to meet with a man about the potential return of a vehicle that the Jersey City police had impounded.
In the Dec. 3 shooting, a man, described as "visibly Jewish" by officials, was driving on Routes 1 and 9 near Newark and Elizabeth when two shots were fired at his car, they said. No one was injured, but the rear window was shot out, officials said.
The driver of the car did not immediately report the shooting to the authorities, said Rabbi Jack Meyer, the president of Misaskim, a nonprofit Jewish organization.
But several days after the Jersey City attack, Mr. Meyer said, the man "put two and two together" and contacted him. The man told Mr. Meyer that he was on his way to work at about 9:45 a.m. when he saw a U-Haul van ahead of him on the highway.
Moments later, Mr. Meyer said, a bullet flew through the driver side window. Mr. Meyer said he had put the man in touch with the authorities.
Ballistics tests showed that the bullet had come from a .22-caliber handgun found in the rental van used by Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham on Dec. 10, officials said. Cellphone records also indicated that Ms. Graham's phone was in the area where the highway shooting occurred around the time it happened, officials said.
Officials had previously identified Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham as the leading suspects in the killing of a taxi driver who was found dead in the trunk of a Lincoln Town Car in Bayonne on Dec. 7, officials said.
On Monday, officials said that ballistics tests had linked the same .22-caliber handgun used in the highway shooting to the death of cabby, who was bludgeoned and shot in the head.
The authorities also tied Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham to the taxi driver's killing with other evidence. His blood was on a Bible found in the rental van and his DNA was on clothing found there, officials said.
The authorities also disclosed that Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham had searched online at various points in December for information about a Jewish community center in Bayonne, about cab companies in Jersey City and about whether a car door would stop a bullet fired at an angle.
Officials said they had uncovered surveillance video that showed the two taking target practice with long guns in Austintown, Ohio, on Dec. 1.
Also, officials said, one of two notes found in Mr. Anderson's pockets after he and Ms. Graham were killed in a standoff with the police on Dec. 10, read, "FBIs war on black America 35:45," a reference to a 1990 documentary in which the Black Panther leader Fred Hampton describes law enforcement officers as "fascist pig cops."
The second note had the phone number of a Keyport, N.J., man who was later charged with illegally possessing guns.
Video from inside the market before Mr. Anderson was killed, Mr. Carpenito said, captured him saying, "They stole our heritage, they stole our birthright, and they hired these guys to stop us."
Other footage showed the rental van appearing to scout the market several times in the week leading up to the attack, the last time about an hour and a half before the first calls about it came in.
Andrea Salcedo contributed reporting.

Texto completo: The Indian hospitality start-up is losing hotel rooms and has stepped back from more than 200 cities as part of a broader pullback by firms financed by SoftBank.
MUMBAI, India -- Oyo, once one of India's fastest-growing tech start-ups, is now rapidly scaling back.
In recent weeks, Oyo, a budget hospitality company, has pulled out of dozens of cities, cut thousands of hotel rooms, started laying off employees and slashed other costs as it faced pressure from its biggest investor, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, to curb vast operating losses.
The retreat has been swift and sweeping. In India alone, Oyo has lost more than 65,000 rooms -- or about a quarter of what it had offered to travelers -- since October, according to internal data from current and former employees that was reviewed by The New York Times. This month, Oyo also stopped selling rooms in more than 200 small Indian cities, according to company documents and one current employee and one former employee.
The moves come on top of more than 2,000 layoffs around the world, which Oyo began rolling out last week, according to six current and former employees. Before the cutbacks, Oyo had about 20,000 employees in 80 countries.
Oyo said some of the data obtained by The Times was inaccurate but declined to be specific. In an email to employees on Monday, Ritesh Agarwal, the company's chief executive, said Oyo was focused on sustainable growth and profitability -- which meant layoffs.
"Unfortunately, some roles at Oyo will become redundant as we further drive tech-enabled synergy, enhanced efficiency, and remove duplication of effort across businesses or geographies," he wrote in the email.
The Economic Times, an Indian publication, first reported in December that job cuts at Oyo were coming.
Oyo's actions are part of a broader pullback by start-ups funded by SoftBank. Armed with a $ 100 billion fund known as the Vision Fund, SoftBank has shoveled money into start-ups across the globe in recent years. That has given many young companies fuel to expand, often with little thought for profit.
Last year, some SoftBank-funded start-ups began running into trouble -- most notably WeWork, the office space company, which failed to go public when investors began questioning its losses. WeWork ultimately ousted its chief executive and slashed its valuation to less than $ 8 billion from $ 47 billion.
WeWork's fall led to questions about other start-ups that SoftBank had financed and whether those young firms could make money. Last month, the dog-walking service Wag underwent several rounds of layoffs before SoftBank sold its shares at a loss. The construction start-up Katerra, another SoftBank-funded company, also cut its staff.
This month, layoffs have gathered momentum at start-ups that SoftBank had invested in. The South American delivery service Rappi and the San Francisco car-sharing start-up Getaround said they were laying off employees. Zume, a company that used robots to make pizzas and had been valued at $ 2 billion, cut more than half of its work force. It also stopped making pizzas.
Some investors and start-ups said they were now approaching SoftBank's Vision Fund cautiously -- or, in some cases, avoiding it altogether.
"We have advised almost all of our companies to steer clear," said Josh Wolfe, an investor at the venture capital firm Lux Capital who has been critical of SoftBank's strategy. "Everyone else was fearful to say the emperor had no clothes."
SoftBank declined to comment on Oyo and other start-ups in which it has invested.
Mr. Agarwal founded Oyo in 2013 to organize India's small independent hotels into a chain. The company markets rooms online and takes a cut of each stay. Mr. Agarwal, who has become a business star in India, has said he aspired to make Oyo the world's largest hotel chain by 2023, displacing Marriott.
But as Oyo tried to expand globally, in part pushed by SoftBank, it spent heavily on incentives to attract hotel owners and customers to its site. That resulted in losses in India, where Oyo has said it will lose money through at least 2021.
Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's chief executive, began investing in Oyo in 2015. SoftBank and its Vision Fund now own half its stock. While Mr. Son has called Oyo a jewel of his fund and urged it to grow quickly, he has since changed his stance.
As Oyo's losses have mounted, senior leaders at the company have told employees that SoftBank had demanded that it become profitable on a basis known as EBITDA -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- by mid-2020, according to current and former employees.
In another sign of SoftBank's shifting position, Yahoo Japan, which is half-owned by SoftBank, pulled the plug in November on a Japanese apartment-rental venture with Oyo. Most of the Oyo employees involved in the Japan venture have been laid off or relocated, current and former employees said.
Oyo faces other troubles in India. On Friday, the Indian income-tax authorities visited the company's headquarters just outside New Delhi, requesting reams of documents. The tax department and Oyo said the government was examining whether the company was properly withholding and remitting income taxes on payments to vendors.
The Times reported this month that Oyo had offered thousands of unlicensed hotel rooms and sometimes offered free rooms to government officials to deter enforcement. The Times also described how some Oyo employees worked together to commit fraud against the company.
In his email on Monday, Mr. Agarwal said the behavior described by The Times would violate the company's code of conduct. "We take all the allegations very seriously and are looking into each and every one," he wrote.
To stem losses, Oyo has also cut back on staff and supplies such as mineral water and cleaning fluids in the hotels it runs itself, according to the current and former employees. Oyo staff members managing some of the hotels have been instructed to save more money on electricity bills by switching off lights, elevators and even boilers for hot water, they said.
Morale has plummeted among thousands of Oyo workers globally, current and former employees have said.
Prabhjeet Singh, an Oyo business development manager who left the company in September, said employees who criticized the company ran a greater risk of losing their jobs.
"It's a culture of silence," he said.
Oyo's reputation has deteriorated so much in India that other employers are reluctant to hire its former workers, said Mr. Singh, who has been unable to land another job.
"They look at me as if I've done a crime working at Oyo," he said.

Texto completo: United States military personnel recount what it was like when Iranian missiles hit their base last week.
AYN AL ASAD AIR BASE, Iraq -- The first of several Iranian missiles to hit the American military base rammed into the airstrip, nearly destroying a guard tower where two young army specialists were on watch duty. Another crashed next to a dining hall and destroyed part of a building where some drone operators were still working.
The base, Ayn Al Asad, in western Iraq, was one of two hit last week in an Iranian attack in retaliation for the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force. As flames, dust and debris filled the air and the building shook, the drone operators dived under their desks. The lights swung madly, and then went out.
They had remained in the building despite warnings of an imminent assault because they wanted to get their drones into the air so they would not be destroyed by the missiles, and because "we didn't know if there was going to be any ground attack," said First Sgt. Wesley Kilpatrick.
For the most part, they succeeded in preserving the drones.
Moments after the attack ended, one of the drone operators, Staff Sgt. Costin Herwig, 26, stumbled outside to look for his colleagues.
"It was like a scene from an action movie," he said. "I tried to get to a desk so I could bring down my drone, but my electrical wires were fried and I couldn't get it back."
On Monday, though, despite simmering tensions between Iran and the United States, and looming questions about whether the American military would be ordered to leave Iraq, as the Iraqi Parliament demanded last week, the base seemed mostly normal.
It was still forbidden to eat in the dining hall because it was not bombproof. So everybody grabbed their food -- a reduced menu -- and left. Some housing units were destroyed as well as work places -- all empty when the missiles hit -- but the rebuilding had already begun.
The drone lost by Sergeant Herwig was one of the few casualties of the missile attack on the base, which was opened by Saddam Hussein in 1987. No one was killed or wounded in the five barrages of multiple missiles that night, although several military personnel who were working were checked for concussions.
The absence of casualties seemed to be the result of luck and warnings. The first came early in the day, when all the bases in the region went on high alert. Another warning was issued around 11 p.m., putting the bases into lockdown.
Finally, the American military detected the missile launches in Iran and determined their likely targets, giving the military personnel at Asad Air Base 15 minutes to take cover.
Most retreated to concrete bunkers where the greatest danger anyone faced was the collapse of one of the concrete walls. But they were able to jump out of the way in time.
The base has about 1,500 American servicemen and women and 500 others from coalition countries, principally Danes, Norwegians and Polish.

Texto completo: Rank-and-file senators and party leaders made clear on Monday that even if they wanted to pursue dismissal, the votes simply were not there to succeed -- at least not at the outset of the trial.
WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans indicated on Monday that they would not seek to summarily dismiss the impeachment charges against President Trump, proceeding instead to a trial with arguments and the possibility of calling witnesses that could begin as soon as Wednesday.
Dismissal was always a long shot given Republicans' narrow control of the Senate, but it was the subject of renewed discussion after Mr. Trump said on Sunday that he liked the idea put forward by some conservatives as a way to deny the House's case the legitimacy of a trial. Other Republicans had signed on to a resolution that would have dismissed the House's impeachment articles if they were not promptly brought to trial.
In interviews, rank-and-file senators and party leaders made clear on Monday that even if they wanted to pursue dismissal, the votes simply were not there to succeed -- at least not at the outset of the trial. They did not rule out considering a motion to dismiss the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress after opening arguments from both sides.
"Our members generally are not interested in a motion to dismiss," said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a top Republican leader. "They think both sides need to be heard. They believe the president needs to be heard for the first time in a fair setting."
In the House on Monday, Democrats leaving meetings with Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated that the chamber was most likely to vote on Wednesday to name lawmakers to prosecute the case and to send its two impeachment charges to the Senate.
Behind the scenes, aides in the House and Senate were carefully choreographing the next steps, and some Democrats in the House cautioned that a vote could still slip to Thursday, as the Senate seeks to deal with a pending War Powers Resolution and Mr. Trump's new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. In any case, a trial would not be expected to start in earnest, with opening oral arguments, until next week.
Asked when Democrats would name their impeachment prosecutors, or managers, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, Ms. Pelosi's No. 2, said that it "could be Wednesday." He pointed out that the Senate would have "practical problems" if the House moved sooner, including missing three senators who are expected to take part in Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate.
For Republican leaders, the decision to bypass an attempt at dismissal reflected competing interests as they sought to navigate a complex constitutional process with little precedent.
As the trial has approached, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has seemed increasingly keen to keep it as tightly controlled and speedy as possible. He is wary of what could happen if Democrats succeed in picking off moderate Republican senators to form a majority able to call witnesses and prolong the proceeding.
But he also wants to ensure that those same moderate senators -- several of whom are up this fall for re-election in swing states -- can credibly claim to voters that they took their constitutional duties seriously.
One of those lawmakers, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, made clear on Monday that she was not interested in a dismissal motion now, or most likely ever.
"I would anticipate voting against a motion to dismiss, as opposed to going through the whole process and going to final arguments and having a vote on each article of impeachment," she told reporters.
Democrats offered a motion to dismiss the charges against President Bill Clinton in his 1999 impeachment trial after the House and White House had made their opening arguments. But the resolution failed and the trial lasted several more weeks before senators ultimately voted to acquit Mr. Clinton on both charges against him.
Mr. Trump endorsed the idea of outright dismissal on Sunday, though his own views have oscillated wildly in recent weeks. On Twitter, the president warned that holding a full trial "gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have."
Ms. Collins was not the only Republican who spoke out against the idea on Monday.
"At this stage, the allegations that have been made are serious and deserve to be given consideration with the arguments for and against," said Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah.
And Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who will not seek re-election in 2020, said he would vote against an immediate dismissal if it were proposed.
"We're taking an oath to be impartial," he said, "and that to me means we have a constitutional duty to hear the case, ask our questions and then decide whether we want additional evidence in terms of documents or witnesses."
All three senators, plus Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, also said Monday that they were pushing Mr. McConnell to allow votes on calling additional witnesses and evidence after opening arguments, though only Mr. Romney stated he would outright support calling witnesses.
Catie Edmondson, Michael D. Shear and Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

Texto completo: Racial bias still affects many aspects of health care.
Racial discrimination has shaped so many American institutions that perhaps it should be no surprise that health care is among them. Put simply, people of color receive less care -- and often worse care -- than white Americans.
Reasons includes lower rates of health coverage; communication barriers; and racial stereotyping based on false beliefs.
Predictably, their health outcomes are worse than those of whites.
African-American patients tend to receive lower-quality health services, including for cancer, H.I.V., prenatal care and preventive care, vast research shows. They are also less likely to receive treatment for cardiovascular disease, and they are more likely to have unnecessary limb amputations.
As part of "The 1619 Project," Evelynn Hammonds, a historian of science at Harvard, told Jeneen Interlandi of The New York Times: "There has never been any period in American history where the health of blacks was equal to that of whites. Disparity is built into the system."
African-American men, in particular, have the worst health outcomes of any major demographic group. In part, research shows, this is a result of mistrust from a legacy of discrimination.
Tuskegee and lower life expectancy
At age 45, the life expectancy of black men is more than three years less than that of non-Hispanic Caucasian men. According to a study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, part of the historical black-white mortality difference can be attributed to a 40-year experiment by the U.S. Public Health Service that shook African-Americans' confidence in the nation's health system.
From 1932 to 1972, the Public Health Service tracked about 600 hundred low-income African-American men in Tuskegee, Ala., about 400 of whom had syphilis. The stated purpose was to better understand the natural course of the disease. To do so, the men were lied to about the study and provided sham treatments. Many needlessly passed the disease on to family members, suffered and died.
As one scholar put it, the Tuskegee study "revealed more about the pathology of racism than it did about the pathology of syphilis." In fact, the natural course of syphilis was already largely understood.
The study was publicized in 1972 and immediately halted. To this day, it is frequently cited as a driver of documented distrust in the health system by African-Americans. That distrust has helped compromise many public health efforts -- including those to slow the spread of H.I.V., contain tuberculosis outbreaks and broaden provision of preventive care.
According to work by the economists Marcella Alsan and Marianne Wanamaker, black men are less likely than white men to seek health care and more likely to die at younger ages. Their analysis suggests that one-third of the black-white gap in male life expectancy in the immediate aftermath of the study could be attributed to the legacy of distrust connected to the Tuskegee study.
Their study relies on interpreting observational data, not a randomized trial, so there is room for skepticism about the specific findings and interpretation. Nevertheless, the findings are consistent with lots of other work that reveals African-Americans' distrust of the health system, their receipt of less care, and their worse health outcomes.
The Tuskegee study is far from the only unjust treatment of nonwhite groups in health care. Thousands of nonwhite women have been sterilized without consent. For instance, between the 1930s and 1970s, one-third of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age were sterilized, many under coercion.
Likewise, in the 1960s and 1970s, thousands of Native American women were sterilized without consent, and a California eugenics law forced or coerced thousands of sterilizations of women (and men) of Mexican descent in the 20th century. (Thirty-two other states have had such laws, which were applied disproportionately to people of color.)
For decades, sickle cell disease, which mostly affects African-Americans, received less attention than other diseases, raising questions about the role of race in how medical research priorities are established.
Outside of research, routine medical practice continues to treat black and white patients differently. This has been documented in countless ways, including how practitioners view pain. Racial bias in health care and over-prescription of opioid painkillers accidentally spared some African-Americans from the level of mortality from opioid medications observed in white populations.
"While African-Americans may not have died at similar rates from opioid misuse, we can be sure needless suffering and, perhaps even death, occurred because provider racism prevented them from receiving appropriate care and pain medication," said Linda Goler Blount, president and chief executive of the Black Women's Health Imperative.
Black patients and black doctors
Of course, health outcomes are a result of much more than health care. The health of people of color is also unequal to that of whites because of differences in health behaviors, education and income, to name a few factors. But there is no doubt that the health system plays a role, too. Nor is there question that a history of discrimination and structural racism underlies racial differences in all these drivers of health.
Reinforcing the fact of racial bias in health care, a recent study found that care for black patients is better when they see black doctors. The study randomly assigned 1,300 African-Americans to black or nonblack primary care physicians. Those who saw black doctors received 34 percent more preventive services. One reason for this, supported by the study, is increased trust and communication.
The study findings are large. If all black men received the same increase in preventive services as those in the study (and received appropriate follow-up care), it would reduce the black-white cardiovascular mortality rate by 19 percent and shrink the total black-white male life expectancy gap by 8 percent, the researchers said.
But it is unlikely all black men could see black doctors even if they wished to. Although African-Americans make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, only 4 percent of current physicians -- and less than 7 percent of recent medical school graduates -- are black.
This study does not stand alone. A systematic review found that racially matched pairs of patients and doctors achieved better communication. Other studies found that many nonwhite patients prefer practitioners who share their racial identity and that they receive better care from them. They view them as better than white physicians in communicating, providing respectful treatment and being available.
Racial bias in health care, as in other American institutions, is as old or older than the republic itself.
Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act stipulates that neither race, color nor national origin may be used as a means of denying the "benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance." As nearly every facet of the American health system receives federal financing and support, well-documented and present-day discrimination in health care suggests the law has not yet had its intended effect.

Texto completo: During eight appearances on Fox News and Fox Business Network in early January, Jack Keane was introduced several ways: as 'a retired four-star general,' as the former 'vice chief of staff for the U.S. Army,' and as Fox News's 'senior strategic analyst.'
All of those are accurate descriptions. Keane is a distinguished veteran, having commanded American troops in such places as Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. Fox employs him to provide analysis of national security and military operations, such as the unfolding hostilities between the United States and Iran.
But another part of Keane's résumé wasn't mentioned: the former general is also executive chairman of AM General, a leading defense contractor, best known as the manufacturer of the Humvee and other tactical military vehicles. He is also a partner at a venture-capital firm that specializes in the defense industry.
In other words, viewers never learned that Keane has a direct financial interest in the war policies he was assessing on the air.
Fox News's nondisclosure of Keane's role in the military-industrial complex is standard operating procedure for network news shows. Many of the retired military leaders employed by the networks as paid contributors have secondary affiliations that are rarely, if ever, mentioned, leaving viewers in the dark about whose interests they're promoting.
Like Fox News, none of the leading networks " ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and MSNBC " makes a regular practice of announcing its military analysts' financial ties to the Pentagon, connections that could color their on-air comments.
NBC News and MSNBC, for example, often turn to retired Adm. James Stavridis, the networks' 'chief international security analyst,' for commentary. But neither NBC nor MSNBC has mentioned that Stavridis, NATO's former supreme allied commander, currently works for the Carlyle Group and McLarty Associates. Stavridis advises Carlyle on its multibillion-dollar portfolio of defense companies; he is chairman of the board of counselors at McLarty, which advises military contractors, among others.
CBS's own in-house military expert, retired Adm. James 'Sandy' Winnefeld Jr., is a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is also on the board of Raytheon, a major defense contractor, a fact that hasn't come up during Winnefeld's recent appearances on the network.
News organizations typically prohibit their employees and contributors from working for another entity that might profit, even indirectly, from the employee's analysis or reporting. Others permit such affiliations but disclose them to readers or viewers.
The underlying principle is transparency. Disclosures help readers and viewers understand a commentator's personal stake and possible motivations.
'While former officials employed by defense contractors are indeed experts and have useful insight, they also have financial interests that are reason for concern when those interests align with a certain course of action,' said Daniel Auble, a senior researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based organization that tracks lobbying and money in politics. 'Failing to make that clear to the viewers just amplifies those concerns.'
Representatives of ABC News, Fox, NBC News and MSNBC declined to comment on their contributors, but as a general matter, the networks said they do background checks on their analysts and require them to list any possible financial conflicts. The network representatives declined to explain what they deemed to be a conflict or to detail their on-air disclosure policies.
A CBS News spokeswoman, Brooke Lorenz, said in a statement: 'We always consider the background and affiliations of contributors when making booking decisions to avoid any potential conflict of interest. At times, there may be a need for an on-air disclosure either in writing or verbally or other opportunities within a discussion to provide more context if appropriate.'
She declined to offer examples of on-air disclosures.
Former military officials played a key role in promoting the Bush administration's policies before and after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. As documented in a Pulitzer Prize-winning series in the New York Times in 2008, the Pentagon orchestrated the commentary of 75 former officers who served as radio and TV analysts, turning them into 'message force-multipliers' for the administration's point of view.
Many of the retired officers who appeared on TV worked for companies that counted on military contracts, creating a built-in conflict that news organizations didn't mention when introducing the analysts. Some of the analysts said they were dubious about the Pentagon's war claims but didn't express their reservations on the air because they were concerned it could jeopardize future contracts for their companies.
Among others, James 'Spider' Marks, a retired Army general, served as an analyst for CNN between 2004 to 2007, at the same time he sought military and intelligence contracts for a company, McNeil Technologies. (CNN said at the time that it didn't know the nature of Marks' work for the company.)
Marks, who has resumed his role as a CNN military analyst, is no longer affiliated with McNeil. Instead, he is a venture partner and adviser to a company that invests in veteran-led companies, including military contractors. CNN didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.
Several other CNN analysts and frequent guests also have defense-industry connections that haven't been mentioned on the air.
Among others, CNN political contributor David Urban is president of American Continental Group, a Washington lobbying firm whose clients include General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Textron, which are among the largest defense firms in the world. CNN typically introduces Urban as an adviser to President Trump's reelection campaign without mentioning his lobbying activities.
After Iran shot down a U.S. drone aircraft in June, Urban told host Jake Tapper, 'If I were a betting man, I'd bet that there'd be some sort of a Tomahawk missile strike on the site that launched this, a very limited response, to the missiles that struck this, and not very escalating.' The Tomahawk is made by Raytheon, one of Urban's clients.
Regular guests also include former administration officials with close ties to the defense industry, such as former Homeland Security secretaries Michael Chertoff and Jeh Johnson. Chertoff is chairman of the board of BAE Systems, the U.S. subsidiary of the British-based defense giant; Johnson is on the Lockheed board.
Another frequent guest is Stephen Hadley, the former national security adviser to President George W. Bush. In an appearance by Hadley last week to discuss Iran, CNN identified Hadley's role in the Bush administration but didn't mention that he has been a Raytheon board member for the past decade.
(Hadley's Raytheon connection also wasn't disclosed in a Washington Post op-ed last week, drawing some criticism. In response, Post editorial editor Fred Hiatt said: 'More disclosure is usually better than less, and maybe we got this one wrong. But given that his column was so clearly antiwar and pro-diplomacy, I think much of the criticism is off-base.')
The larger issue is whether viewers " or readers " are adequately informed about where pundits are coming from on matters of life and death, said Mandy Smithberger, director of the Center for Defense Information at the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group.
'When there is so much public concern about these wars, including among veterans, it becomes that much more important for people to know what the financial connections are,' she said. News organizations 'should absolutely disclose this. It could change the conversation around war' if people were aware of who was profiting from it.

Texto completo: What a time to be alive: 2020 is the year that Adam Sandler and Jennifer Lopez didn't receive Oscar nominations and it was considered a snub.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Monday announced nominations, which included few surprises but plenty of such omissions. Predictably, 'Joker,' 'The Irishman,' 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' and '1917' led the pack with the most nods. But other films, including 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,' 'The Farewell' and 'Uncut Gems,' received little to no love from the academy.
With so many contenders who had hovered around the cusp completely out of the running, let's break down which exclusions are most glaring.
Female directors After presenting the best director category, presenter Issa Rae quipped, 'Congratulations to those men,' recalling Natalie Portman's oft-referenced introduction while presenting the 'all-male nominees' at the Golden Globes ceremony two years ago.
Four names were more or less cemented ahead of Monday morning's nominations: Martin Scor sese for 'The Irishman,' Quentin Tarantino for 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,' Bong Joon-ho for 'Parasite' and Sam Mendes for '1917.' Many had hoped Greta Gerwig, who earned a directing nomination two years ago for her solo debut, 'Lady Bird,' would again appear for her critically acclaimed adaptation of 'Little Women.' But the fifth slot went to Todd Phillips, whose box-office juggernaut 'Joker' landed the most nominations of any project despite being one of the year's most divisive films.
There weren't too many other women who stood a chance in this arena, though it's worth noting that Marielle Heller, who has delivered two Oscar-caliber films with this season's 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood' and last year's 'Can You Ever Forgive Me?,' is consistently snubbed. Tom Hanks, who was nominated for his supporting role as Mister Rogers in the former film, told the New York Times that he wanted to work with Heller after reading a story that inspired him to work with more female directors and, then, seeing her debut film, 'The Diary of a Teenage Girl.'
Supporting actress Jennifer Lopez Was J-Lo ever really going to win an Oscar? Well, no, probably not. But that didn't stop the hype machine from going into overdrive over her captivating role in 'Hustlers' as Ramona, the ringleader of a group of strippers who start drugging wealthy clients to steal their credit cards. (Her pole-dancing scene instantly became legendary and probably immediately caused a spike in moviegoers googling her age. She's 50, for the record.) Alas, despite earning nods for a Golden Globe and Critics' Choice Award, an Academy Award nomination was not in the cards " and the writing seemed to be on the wall as the buzz for other actresses grew louder throughout award season. But if social media was any indication, quite a few people were very angry: 'There is no way that Kathy Bates in Richard Jewell was better than Jennifer Lopez in Hustlers and I will die on that hill!' one user tweeted.
Lead actors Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler This past year saw two comedic icons " both with track records of making films torn apart by critics " give award-worthy performances. And they were totally snubbed by the voting academy.
Eddie Murphy was literally and metaphorically hanging out on his couch the past few years, but he decided to return to the spotlight for what he has called his 'bookend' period. 'I don't want to sit on the couch after 'Mr. Church,'' he told the New York Times, referring to the 2016 drama. And while Murphy received a best actor nod at the Globes for playing blaxploitation star Rudy Ray Moore in 'Dolemite Is My Name,' he got no love from the academy.
Sandler, who previously offered nuanced performances in 'Punch-Drunk Love' and 'The Meyer owitz Stories,' joked that if he didn't get awards consideration for 'Uncut Gems,' he would return to making terrible movies 'on purpose just to make you all pay.' So expect that.
'The Farewell' and star Awkwafina Though industry awards tend to more reliably predict Oscar nominations than the Golden Globes, it's still worth noting that Awkwafina, who took home a Globe for her lead performance in 'The Farewell,' was snubbed in the Oscars' best actress category. As Billi, an American woman who travels to China to say goodbye to her ailing grandmother, Awkwafina left her comedy roots behind to try her hand at a dramatic role " a successful effort, according to critics.
'The Farewell' has earned a number of acting, writing and best picture nominations at other ceremonies but wasn't at all embraced by the academy. Writer-director Lulu Wang stood a decent chance of landing an original screenplay nomination, while Shuzhen Zhao, who plays Billi's grandmother, has been recognized by a slew of critics awards. (Zhao's chances, however, were much slimmer.)
Lupita Nyong'o in 'Us' Horror movies notoriously have a difficult time at the Oscars, but it was hard to stop thinking about Lupita Nyong'o's unsettling double role in the psychological thriller 'Us.' But even though plenty of critics felt that Nyong'o deserved the nomination alongside front-runners such as Scarlett Johansson ('Marriage Story') and Renée Zellweger ('Judy'), it unfortunately wasn't a huge surprise when she was left off the list " although it certainly angered plenty of fans, particularly because Johansson got two separate nods (the other for 'Jojo Rabbit').
People of color, in general The Oscar nominations aren't as devoid of diversity as last week's backlash-inducing BAFTA nominations, which included not a single actor of color. But people of color are still overwhelmingly underrepresented among this year's slate of nominees.
One of the more glaring omissions " aside from Awkwafina and J-Lo " is the academy's failure to nominate renowned costume designer Ruth E. Carter for 'Dolemite Is My Name.' Carter made history last year as the first black costume designer to win her craft's most prestigious award for 'Black Panther.' (Her longtime collaborator Spike Lee is probably not very happy right now.)
The lead and supporting actor categories are dominated by white men. The lead actress category, meanwhile, includes a nod for Cynthia Erivo, the British actress who somewhat controversially portrayed Harriet Tubman in a long-awaited biopic. But Erivo's nod underscores the idea that actors of color only win praise for playing certain types of roles. (Remember how Jadakiss pointed this out back in 2004?). Nyong'o, whose devilishly dual role was left out of the running this year, famously won an Oscar in 2014 for portraying a slave in Steve McQueen's period drama '12 Years a Slave.'
'Y'all love your black women in the key of slave narrative over there in Hollywood,' one social media user tweeted Monday, noting that Nyong'o technically played two roles in one film.
The academy could have surprised Oscar viewers by honoring bolder choices " the polarizing romantic drama 'Queen and Slim' or Jamie Foxx's SAG-nominated performance in 'Just Mercy' " for example. But that seems too much to ask for a voting body that gave its top honor last year to 'Green Book.'
A few good men It would have been a shock at this point if Joaquin Phoenix, Adam Driver and Leonardo DiCaprio weren't recognized for their performances in 'Joker,' 'Marriage Story' and 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,' respectively, making the last two best actor slots all the more interesting. Antonio Banderas has consistently been in the mix for his role in Pedro Almodóvar's 'Pain and Glory,' a Spanish film nominated in the international feature category; 'The Two Popes' actor Jonathan Pryce has been as well, nominated alongside scribe Anthony McCarten and supporting actor Anthony Hopkins.
Two big-name actors nominated elsewhere but snubbed by the academy include Robert De Niro, the anchor of Martin Scorsese's crime drama 'The Irishman,' and Christian Bale, who plays a racecar driver in James Mangold's 'Ford v Ferrari,' which fared quite well in the technical categories. Taron Egerton, who campaigned like crazy for his performance as Elton John in 'Rocketman,' won a Golden Globe but, alas, isn't in contention for an Oscar.
Documentary 'Apollo 11' The best feature documentary category may have given some predictable love to 'American Factory,' the Netflix documentary produced by Barack and Michelle Obama's production company, but nothing for the one documentary considered the front-runner to win: 'Apollo 11.' Todd Douglas Miller used archival footage, including images never seen before by the public, to depict the Apollo 11 moon landing. It had an impressive haul for a documentary, earning $15 million worldwide at the box office, and won the Sundance Film Festival's U.S. documentary grand jury prize.
But this category can be wild. Last year, 'Won't You Be My Neighbor?' was thought to be the movie to beat. The critically acclaimed feature about Fred Rogers earned $22 million at the box office, the most of any documentary in 2018, showing that there is still a strong appetite from the moviegoing public for heartwarming stories about real people who are actually kind. But, stunningly, it didn't receive an Oscar nomination.
Earworm supplier 'Frozen II' The sequel to Disney's beloved, Oscar-winning 2013 film about a princess trying to reunite with her estranged ice crystal-wielding sister has received mixed reviews, but we still expected to see it, among the indies and Pixar's 'Toy Story 4,' on the best animated films list. In the end, 'Frozen II' managed only to get nominated in the best original song category (for 'Into the Unknown'). That's no small feat, considering Beyoncé failed to get a nod for 'Spirit,' her rousing gospel-infused track from 'The Lion King.'
Beyoncé Does the academy want to make a powerful enemy of the Beyhive? The superstar's fans weren't thrilled when her ballad from the 'Lion King' remake was left off the list for best original song. Although she would have faced tough competition with Elton John's '(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again' from 'Rocketman' and Cynthia Erivo's 'Stand Up' from 'Harriet,' it's still surprising that Beyoncé's star power couldn't at least edge out 'I Can't Let You Throw Yourself Away' from 'Toy Story 4.'
'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood' A movie about America's hero, Mister Rogers, played by America's actually-a-good-person-actor, Tom Hanks, sounds like it was tailor-made for some Oscars love, right? Nope. The nihilistic and dark 'Joker' led the pack with 11 nominations, while only one nomination went for the movie about a cynical journalist's friendship with the beloved children's TV host. 'A Beautiful Day' is a feel-good-yet-grounded narrative depicting transformation and how to face one's demons in an actually healthy manner (so, the opposite of 'Joker'). Call this a snub for nontoxic masculinity.

Texto completo: Harold Burson, a public relations giant who co-founded Burson-Marsteller and built it into one of the world's largest PR firms, developing a reputation for deft crisis management that made him a favorite of embattled corporations and foreign governments, died Jan.-10 at a rehabilitation center in Memphis. He was 98.
The cause was complications from a fall, said Catherine Sullivan, a spokeswoman for what is now the PR firm Burson Cohn - Wolfe.
Soft-spoken and unassuming, Mr. Burson was considered a chief architect of the modern public relations industry, which he believed was as much about behavior as messaging. 'In the beginning, top management used to say to us, 'Here's the message, deliver it,' ' he once said, according to the textbook 'Public Relations: Strategies and Tactics.' 'Then it became, 'What should we say?' Now, in smart organizations, it's 'What should we do?' '
A 1999 survey by the trade magazine PRWeek named Mr. Burson the most influential public relations figure of the 20th-century, a title he reluctantly accepted as 'the prize for survival,' having outlasted so many of his peers. He met President Ronald Reagan for monthly lunches, logged 125,000 flying miles a year while serving as Burson-Marsteller's chief executive and went to his Manhattan office each day well into his 90s, encouraging clients to treat him as an extension of their company.
Those clients included corporations " Coca-Cola, General Electric, McDonald's and Merrill Lynch " as well as the British government, the Saudi royal family and the regime of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. And although Burson-Marsteller offered everything from news conference preparation to the selection of wine for key dinner meetings, the firm was perhaps best known for its crisis-management work.
Mr. Burson advised Johnson - Johnson in the aftermath of the cyanide-laced-Tylenol murders in 1982, and two years later, he represented Union Carbide after a gas leak killed at least 2,000 people near its pesticide plant in Bhopal, India " an industrial disaster that ultimately killed thousands more and affected some 600,000 people.
'We are being paid to tell our client's side of the story,' Mr. Burson told the New York Times that year. 'We are in the business of changing and molding attitudes, and we aren't successful unless we move the needle, get people to do something. But we are also a client's conscience, and we have to do what is in the public interest.'
Mr. Burson began his career as a journalist, working as a newspaper copyboy and then paying his way through college as a stringer for the Memphis Commercial Appeal. He interviewed William Faulkner as a teenager, reported on the Nuremberg war crimes trials for the military's American Forces Network and formed his own PR firm in 1946, concluding that public relations offered a more lucrative path than journalism.
Seven years later, he partnered with advertising executive William A. Marsteller to form Burson-Marsteller, offering an integrated service they called 'total communications' from their offices in New York and Chicago. It became only the second international public relations firm after opening a branch in Geneva in 1961, and by 1984, it was the world's largest PR firm by net fee income " then $63.8-million, with some 4,100 employees in 42-offices worldwide.
Mr. Burson traced the company's growth in large part to the decision to expand internationally. But it undoubtedly benefited from exposure related to the Tylenol case, in which seven people in the Chicago area died as a result of apparent tampering with bottles of the pain reliever on store shelves. No one was ever charged with the murders, and copycat poisonings followed around the country.
Johnson - Johnson recalled 31-million bottles of Tylenol, at a cost of more than $100-million, and redesigned its bottles to include a foil seal and childproof cap, among other safety features that were announced at a Manhattan news conference meticulously planned by Mr. Burson. His firm worked to ensure that everything from the telephones to the bathrooms would be ready for a wave of arriving journalists.
The event went off successfully, but it was overshadowed by 'one of those things that public relations people dread,' Mr. Burson said " an unexpected piece of breaking news, namely the death of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.
Mr. Burson and his firm also worked with Pan Am after the bombing of Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 and with repressive governments in Nigeria, Argentina and Indonesia. Its charm offensives and other efforts on behalf of those governments (and companies such as the cigarette giant Philip Morris) garnered notoriety in some quarters, with MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow declaring in 2012, 'When evil needs public relations, evil has Burson-Marsteller on speed dial.'
Mr. Burson rejected that characterization, declaring that companies and governments had a right to representation " and that he and his firm were not above turning down clients over ethical concerns. In recent years, it rejected the Libyan government as well as a 'major oil company' trying to lift sanctions on Iraq, he told PRWeek in 2014. 'And,' he continued, 'we said no to the National Rifle Association.'
The son of English immigrants, Harold Burson was born in Memphis on Feb.-15, 1921. His father ran a hardware store that closed during the Depression, leading his mother to support the family by selling clothing door to door.
A precocious reader, Mr. Burson started school in the third grade, graduated from high school at 15 and studied English and economics at the University of Mississippi while writing for the Commercial Appeal, filing stories at a rate of 14-cents per inch.
He received his bachelor's degree in 1940 and, after reporting on labor problems surrounding the construction of a new munitions plant in Tennessee, was hired by the builder to do public relations. He spent more than two years at the construction firm, H.K. Ferguson, before joining the Army in 1943.
Mr. Burson later served on the board of groups including Kennedy Center Productions in Washington, where he was credited with soliciting $3-million from the Japanese government and private groups to construct the 500-seat Terrace Theater in the late 1970s.
In 1979, he sold Burson-Marsteller to the advertising agency Young - Rubicam, continuing to serve as the firm's chief executive until 1988, one year after the death of Marsteller. The firm merged with Cohn - Wolfe in 2018 to form Burson Cohn - Wolfe.
His wife of 62 years, the former Bette Ann Foster, died in 2010. Survivors include two sons, Scott Burson of Lexington, Mass., and Mark Burson of Westlake Village, Calif.; and five grandchildren.
After turning 85, Mr. Burson began blogging about business and current affairs, an activity that he likened to 'taking dope.' ('The more I blog, the more I like it,' he told the Dallas Morning News.) By then, he had become a gray-haired elder for his profession, with a poise and good humor that made him widely beloved, said his onetime client Geoff Bible, the former chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris parent company Altria.
' 'Make no enemies' " I think that's one of the great lines I heard in my life,' Bible told Ad Age magazine in 2012. 'I must have made a million, and he made none.'

Russians Breached Burisma During Trump Impeachment Probe; Effort is linked by U.S. cybersecurity firm to unit that targeted Democrats in 2016

Texto completo: Hackers believed to be affiliated with Russia's military breached the Ukrainian gas company where former Vice President Joe Biden's son had served on the board as it became a focus of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, according to a U.S. cybersecurity firm.
Attempts to hack into Burisma Holdings began last November as Congress was holding hearings on whether Mr. Trump abused his office by pressuring his Ukrainian counterpart to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, according to research published Monday by Area 1, a California-based company.
The hacking attempts are ongoing and linked to the Russian military intelligence unit previously known as the GRU, which hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential election, Area 1 said.
The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia has denied hacking into U.S. elections.
It wasn't known what information the hackers were seeking or what they obtained, the firm said. In at least one instance, the hackers tricked the recipient of a phishing email into sharing login credentials that allowed them access into one of Burisma's servers, the company said. Area 1's findings were earlier reported by the New York Times.
Messrs. Trump and Giuliani have argued, without evidence, that Mr. Biden's anticorruption push in Ukraine was designed to head off any investigation of Burisma. Both Bidens have denied wrongdoin g and said they never discussed Hunter's business in Ukraine.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think the purported Burisma hack will affect the Trump impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
Senior U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly warned that Russia and other hostile foreign powers remain intent on interfering in the coming presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have provided classified briefings to the Senate showing that the Kremlin has labored to seed the narrative, espoused by Mr. Trump and some of his allies, that it was Ukraine and not Russia that hacked the 2016 election, according to people familiar with the matter.
The hacking technique used to target Burisma, though common, bears strong resemblance to how the Kremlin infiltrated the email inbox of the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign chairman. The scheme involved creating fake websites that posed as sign-in pages for Burisma subsidiaries and directing Burisma employees via emails to the malicious websites, where they would be asked to enter their credentials.
In a statement, Mr. Biden's campaign said the purported hack of Burisma demonstrated his strength as a challenger to Mr. Trump and called on the president to denounce any attempt by foreign powers to interfere in U.S. politics.
"Donald Trump tried to coerce Ukraine into lying about Joe Biden and a major bipartisan, international anticorruption victory because he recognized that he can't beat the vice president," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the campaign. "Now we know that Vladimir Putin also sees Joe Biden as a threat. Any American president who had not repeatedly encouraged foreign interventions of this kind would immediately condemn this attack on the sovereignty of our elections."
The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Oren Falkowitz, co-founder of Area 1 and a former National Security Agency official, said the company was "100%" confident that Russia's military intelligence was responsible for the breach. Mr. Falkowitz said that the company had made a series of disclosures about its findings to U.S. intelligence agencies before its publication of the research Monday. Area 1 wasn't hired to conduct the research.
Mr. Falkowitz said the company discovered evidence of a Russian phishing campaign on New Year's Eve and determined in the following days that each of the targets were subsidiaries of Burisma.

Texto completo: Joe Biden has regained some of his strength in Iowa, but his three closest rivals for the Democratic nomination remain clustered at his heels, according to a Monmouth University poll released Monday.
The poll, published three weeks before Iowa's first-in-the-nation nominating contest, found the former vice president with support from 24 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, a bump of 5 percentage points since Monmouth's most recent Iowa poll, in November.
Biden's three closest competitors are clumped together in a statistical tie, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont earning 18 percent support; Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., 17 percent; and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts earning 15 percent. The poll had a five-point margin of error.
Sanders has leapt five points since the last Monmouth poll of the state, Buttigieg experienced a five-point drop, and Warren experienced a three-point drop.

Booker drops out of presidential race
Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey dropped out of the Democratic presidential race Monday, ending a nearly yearlong quest built around a message of peace and unity that failed to resonate with voters eager for a more aggressive posture against President Trump.
The departure of Booker, 50, from the crowded Democratic field, heralded at the outset as the most diverse in history, leaves just one African-American candidate, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, vying for the nomination in a party in which black voters are an essential bloc of the Democratic base.
The decision came after Booker, who never cracked the top tier of Democratic contenders and consistently polled in the low single digits, fell short of qualifying for a second consecutive debate. The setback, the Booker campaign conceded in the past few weeks, would most probably doom the underdog candidacy at a time when the Democratic race for president is being overshadowed by an impeachment trial in Washington and a growing conflict with Iran.
“I got in this race to win, and I've always said I wouldn't continue if there was no longer a path to victory," Booker said in a statement to supporters.
Booker, who is also up for reelection to the Senate this year, still enjoys favorable ratings in New Jersey, which leans decidedly Democratic and hasn't elected a Republican senator in more than 40 years.
New York Times
Sanders would consider list of Supreme Court picks
Senator Bernie Sanders said in an interview that he would consider releasing a list of potential Supreme Court appointees he would name if elected president, and noted his wife, Jane, also believes he should offer a roster of jurists in the way President Trump did during his 2016 campaign.
Sanders suggested it was premature right now to unveil the names of his prospects for the nation's highest court — “got to kind of win the nomination first," he said — but he warmed to the idea in an interview with the editorial board of The New York Times.
Sanders, a progressive Vermont senator who remains a political independent, does not face the sort of ideological suspicion that many on the right harbored toward Trump when he ran, but he is viewed warily by some Democrats. And with polls in the states that begin the presidential nominating process showing him at or near the top of the field, his willingness to name his potential Supreme Court appointments at a moment the court is sharply divided could offer a measure of comfort to uneasy primary voters.
Sanders said he would push the Senate to pass his legislative priorities with a simple majority; called Xi Jinping, China's top leader, a dictator; and acknowledged he had changed his views to become more supportive of gun control.

Mueller witness pleads guilty on child sex charges
A key witness in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation will be sentenced to at least 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of child sex trafficking and possessing child pornography.
Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, 60, entered a plea deal Monday in federal court in Alexandria.
Nader admitted transporting a 14-year-old boy from the Czech Republic to Washington, D.C., in 2000 to engage in sexual activity with him. He also admitted possessing child pornography depicting infants or toddlers.
The pornography charge carries a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. Prosecutors agreed as part of the plea bargain to recommend a 10-year sentence when Nader is sentenced in April, though the judge will be free to impose a significantly longer sentence if she chooses.
Nader's name appears more than 100 times in Mueller's report. It details Nader's efforts to serve as liaison between a Russian banker with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and members of President Trump's transition team.
Nader is also under indictment in Washington along with seven others on charges of conspiring to conceal the source of more than $3.5 million in political donations to Hillary Clinton.
Nader previously served as an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, a close Saudi ally, and in 2017 wired $2.5 million to a top Trump fund-raiser, Elliott Broidy, through a company in Canada, The Associated Press reported in 2018. The goal was to persuade the United States to take a hard line against Qatar, a longtime American ally but now an adversary of the UAE.

NAACP lawsuit says Census Bureau is unprepared
Calling preparations for the 2020 Census “conspicuously deficient," the NAACP is suing the US Census Bureau, demanding that the agency send more workers into the field and spend more money on encouraging people to participate in the once-a-decade head count.
The civil rights group and Prince George's County, a majority African-American county in Maryland, filed the lawsuit last Friday in federal court in Maryland. It claims the Census Bureau wasn't planning to put enough workers in the field and hadn't opened up a sufficient number of field offices.
The lawsuit also faulted the bureau for conducting limited testing, particularly when, for the first time, it is encouraging most respondents to answer the questionnaire online.
The 2020 census will help determine the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal spending and how many congressional seats each state gets. It starts for a few residents next week in a remote part of Alaska, but most people won't be able to begin answering the questionnaire until mid-March.

Plame says Trump has her tweeting again

Texto completo: Former spy Valerie Plame still works in a secluded nerve center, though this time it's unintentional. Her rented campaign office is in a hard-to-find space on the third floor of a building near Santa Fe's historic square.
A rendering of a Navajo Code Talker who helped defeat the Japanese in World War II adorns a wall of her stark quarters. A bracelet emblazoned with the word "vote" is on Plame's wrist. Twitter is on her mind.
Plame has returned to the social media forum where she wrote her way into trouble in 2017. She had avoided Twitter even after becoming a Democratic candidate for the open congressional seat in Northern New Mexico last May.
Republican President Donald Trump brought her back to the keyboard. Plame, once an operative for the CIA, described Trump as a reckless opportunist after he issued the order to kill an Iranian general. Plame said she was worried enough about disastrous fallout to tell her 49,000 followers on Twitter what she thought of the president.
"An 'imminent threat.' Fabricated intelligence that will lead to the loss of American lives. A cynical attempt to become a 'wartime president' to ensure re-election. We've seen all of this before," Plame wrote. "Because we're on the verge of another catastrophic war in the Middle East, I'm trying a restart on Twitter - a platform I left because of its toxicity - to add a personal view on the abuse of power by a dangerous president. Hopefully, Twitter can still be a force for good."
Plame, 56, said she never expected to run for public office or be in a position to publicly criticize the commander in chief.
At this stage of her life, she said, she believed she would still be working in covert operations. "I thought I would be overseas, chief of station in a really beautiful place," Plame said. "I loved my job. No one knew my name. No one knew what I did."
Her career with the CIA crashed to a halt in the form of political retribution.
Plame's then-husband, the late U.S. diplomat Joe Wilson, wrote a piece in 2003 for the New York Times highlighting a faulty intelligence report that President George W. Bush had used to justify the invasion of Iraq. Wilson's account saying Bush had gone to war over false pretenses riled an administration already being pelted with criticism.
Bush's camp questioned if Wilson had received his information because of his wife's work in the CIA.
Soon after, someone in Bush's administration leaked Plame's name and her clandestine job to conservative columnist Robert Novak. He printed it, killing Plame's career with the CIA.
Her anonymity taken away, Plame began a new life. She, Wilson and their twins moved to Santa Fe.
Plame had served her country for 20 years but was not yet 50 when Novak outed her. Her resignation at a young age disqualified her from receiving a pension. She turned to writing books, including spy novels featuring an agent named Vanessa Pierson.
Politics followed. Plame considered running for the U.S. Senate when Democrat Tom Udall announced he would not seek a third term. "I thought about it for a hot minute," she said.
The open seat in the House of Representatives seemed more winnable.
With her experience in foreign policy and intelligence gathering, she feels she is on sure footing in criticizing Trump's aggression against Iran.
She said he has made life more dangerous for U.S. soldiers. "There is no stability. There is no coherent strategy," Plame said from a seat in her campaign office.
She's been on the national stage, too, appearing with MSNBC's Chris Matthews on his Hardball program.
"I wanted to get in more points, but with Chris Matthews that's impossible," she said.
Her series of postings on Twitter gave her the range she wanted, an irony to be sure.
Plame in 2017 used Twitter to distribute an anti-Semitic article headlined "America's Jews Are Driving America's Wars." She initially defended linking to the piece, then soon backtracked. She said she hadn't read it thoroughly and was sorry for tweeting it.
Political adversaries continue to bring up that episode in the congressional campaign.
Plame says she has Jewish ancestry. Her great-grandfather on her dad's side was a rabbi in Ukraine. This, she said, was a factor in steering her to attend Temple Beth Shalom.
"I am deeply enjoying exploring my Jewish heritage. And I'm doing so in a welcoming community," she said.
"After the Twitter fiasco, for which I have apologized multiple times, I found my way to Rabbi Neil [Amswych] and we began our dialogue."
Plame so far has campaigned in 13 of the 16 counties in the congressional district. Not once, she said, has any voter at a public event brought up the tweet about Jews or challenged her sincerity in attending temple.
Voters, she said, want to talk about cellphone service, education, bad roads and an array of other issues that have nothing to do with Twitter.
She and a half-dozen other candidates are seeking campaign contributions and petition signatures as they compete for a place on the June primary ballot.
Quarterly fundraising totals won't be announced until the end of January, but Plame is confident of a good showing.
"I think we're going to post some terrific numbers," she said. "I have contributions from every county in the district and every single state in the nation."
Then her campaign manager piped up, saying he average donation is $25 and change.
Democrats seeking the congressional nomination have "broad agreement in values," Plame said. The question for voters is who will represent their concerns most clearly.
Plame says they know the kind of congresswoman they want. The former secret agent was being overt.
She made a point of saying New Mexico's 3rd District will send a woman to Congress for the first time.

A burning Australia shows us the road to hell

Texto completo: In a rational world, the burning of Australia would be a historic turning point. After all, it’s exactly the kind of catastrophe climate scientists long warned us to expect if we didn’t take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
Furthermore, although it may seem callous to say it, this disaster is unusually photogenic. You don’t need to pore over charts and statistical tables; this is a horror story told by walls of fire and terrified refugees huddled on beaches.
So this should be the moment when governments finally began urgent efforts to stave off climate catastrophe.
But the world isn’t rational. In fact, Australia’s anti-environmentalist government seems utterly unmoved as the nightmares of environmentalists become reality. And the anti-environmentalist media, the Murdoch empire in particular, has gone all-out on disinformation, trying to place the blame on arsonists and “greenies” who won’t let fire services get rid of enough trees.
These political reactions are more terrifying than the fires themselves.
Climate optimists have always hoped for a broad consensus in favor of measures to save the planet. The trouble with getting action on climate, the story went, was that it was hard to get people’s attention: The issue was complex, while the damage was too gradual and too invisible.
In addition, the big dangers lay too far in the future.
But surely once the evidence for global warming became sufficiently overwhelming, climate action would eventually become the moral equivalent of war — an emergency transcending the usual political divides.
But if a country in flames isn’t enough to produce a consensus for action, what is? The Australia experience suggests that climate denial will persist come hell or high water — that is, through devastating heat waves and catastrophic storm surges alike.
You might be tempted to dismiss Australia as a special case, but the same deepening partisan division has long been underway in the United States. Democrats are increasingly likely to see climate change happening (as indeed it is), while Republicans increasingly see and hear no climate evil.
Let’s be honest with ourselves: Things are looking pretty grim. However, giving up is not an option. What’s the path forward?
The answer, pretty clearly, is that scientific persuasion is running into sharply diminishing returns.
This means that climate action will have to offer immediate benefits to large numbers of voters, because policies that seem to require widespread sacrifice — such as policies that rely mainly on carbon taxes — would be viable only with the kind of political consensus we clearly aren’t going to get.
What might an effective political strategy look like? I’ve been rereading a 2014 speech by eminent political scientist Robert Keohane, who suggested that one way to get past the political impasse on climate might be via “an emphasis on huge infrastructural projects that created jobs” — in other words, a Green New Deal.
Can such a strategy succeed? I don’t know. But it looks like our only chance given the political reality — namely, that powerful forces on the right are determined to keep us barreling down the road to hell.

'Bold moves': LSC boosts pay, training to fill workforce void at ex-Donnelley plants

Texto completo: It’s a common quandary among Lancaster County manufacturers:
How can we replace an older workforce that’s reaching retirement age in droves?
For the owner of two former R.R. Donnelley printing plants here, though, the answer is clear.
LSC Communications wants to bring back the buzz about working at the Greenfield Road and Harrisburg Pike plants, where a combined 1,200 people are employed.
“For many years, Donnelley was seen as an employer of choice in the market,” said Nate Martin, director of talent acquisition and management for the two sites.
“It’s fair to say that over the last decade or so maybe that’s changed as other players came into the market, the market changed and we weren’t always the quickest to adapt,” he said.
“But one of things that’s most important to Tom Quinlan, our CEO, is regaining that status as the employer of choice in Lancaster and really for all of our plants,” Martin said.
Though the goal is simple, getting there will be complex, as LSC has built a far-reaching strategy that improves pay, training and benefits.
LSC hopes the effort will draw 110 to 160 new employees in 2020 and help retain employees already on board.
To accomplish that feat and underscore LSC’s commitment to the Lancaster area, LSC’s two plants here will be spending $5 million in 2020 to:
— Raise entry-level starting pay for new hourly workers, now $13 and $13.50 an hour, depending on responsibilities, to $15. That took effect Jan. 1.— Give existing hourly worker raises of $2.50 an hour (on average). That takes effect Jan. 19.
— Launch a new training program for new hires who have factory experience.
— Starting this spring, separate six-month sessions will be held for workers going into the offset pressroom, gravure pressroom and bindery.
— Accelerate the pace of training for existing employees who want to advance to more challenging jobs.
— And open a walk-in primary-care clinic at the Greenfield Road plant this fall for employees (and, later, for their dependents too) at prices lower than commercial walk-in clinics.
Clinic services will include preventive-care screenings, routine lab work, immunizations, minor acute care services (stitches, etc.) and dispensing of some basic prescriptions.
“If you want to do bold things, you have to make bold moves,” Martin said.
‘Silver Tsunami’ arrives
With about 200 local employees reaching retirement age in the next five years, LSC is one of many manufacturers here scrambling to cope with the “Silver Tsunami.”
That wave of imminent retirements and a shortage of young workers to replace them is among the most vexing issues facing industry and educators.
Cathy Rychalsky of the Lancaster County Workforce Development Board has noticed what jobseekers find appealing.
“Our newest workers are attracted to companies which support their lifestyle and work preferences,” she said.
“Companies that are adapting to this new group of workers are positioning themselves to be successful in hiring and retaining talent,” said Rychalsky, the board’s executive director.
Higher pay, more benefits and tailored training like LSC is introducing are not the only levers that employers can push, she said.
Other approaches tested, studied or implemented by LSC and other firms include job sharing, transportation help, English as a second language classes and business-education partnerships.
Business-education partnerships are collaborations between employers and schools, Rychalsky explained.
Examples include employers visiting classrooms to discuss career opportunities, educators visiting employers to learn which skills are needed for workplace success, educators and employers jointly preparing school-class curriculums and employers offering job shadowing to students.
County manufacturers are scrambling for new workers even as the county’s manufacturing workforce has shriveled in recent decades due to automation and outsourcing. The number of county manufacturing jobs has fallen 33% since 1990, state statistics show.
Longtime leader
The two LSC plants have been part of Lancaster County’s industrial base for nearly 50 years. Together, they make LSC one of the county’s 10 biggest employers, according to state statistics.
The 216 Greenfield Road plant once housed Schick Inc., which made electric shavers, hair-dryers and other personal care products there until its closing in 1979, idling 390 workers.
Donnelley bought the plant later that year for $7.7 million and started production there of TV Guide and other publications in 1980, according to LNP files.
Today it prints Reader’s Digest, Prevention, newspaper stuffers, direct-mail pieces, The New York Times Sunday Magazine and other material.
The 1375 Harrisburg Pike plant was opened in 1972 on the former site of the Lancaster Fairgrounds and twin Brookside swimming pools, next to Long’s Park.
Its main business is printing catalogs. It once printed phone directories but that work was phased out in 2015.
In 2016, Chicago-based Donnelley spun off the plants and their sister locations around the country as part of a new company, LSC, also Chicago-based.
One of LSC’s first local initiatives came the next year, when LSC began filling the void in the Harrisburg Pike plant caused by the phone-book-printing shutdown.
The service is called comailing — sorting 42 catalog and magazine titles, printed by LSC and others, into street-delivery order for the U.S. Postal Service.
The USPS charges less to deliver these sorted materials, generating a savings for the owner of the materials that’s greater than what LSC charges for sorting.
LSC added the initial comailing line here in 2017 and two more in 2018, creating 60 jobs. The cost of the comailing equipment is part of $15 million LSC has invested in the local sites since LSC was formed.
That’s not the only new task being handled by a LSC plant here.
LSC also is bringing “quite a bit of work” here that was previously done by its plants in Lynchburg, Virginia, and Reno, Nevada, Martin said. LSC closed those plants in 2019.
Even without the new work, the local plants already were LSC’s largest producers of magazines and catalogs.
That new work ratchets up the urgency to hit the local plants’ combined hiring goals — 50 to 100 entry-level hires and 60 experienced-craftspeople hires.
The latter category includes people with mechanical skill and machine-operating experience on their resume but no printing-industry work.
“Lancaster is unique in that people stayed with their employers for a long time. And that was great for the Armstrongs and the LSCs and other companies in the area,” Martin said.
“But it (their retirement) is going to mean a pretty big talent gap in the next five to 10 years,” he said. “So we need to develop that next generation of skilled labor.”
Tight market
Intensifying the challenge is Lancaster County’s unemployment rate, perpetually one of the lowest in the state.
The most recent data, for November, show that continues to be the case.
The jobless rate was 3.5% that month, third lowest among the 18 metropolitan areas in Pennsylvania, according to the state Department of Labor & Industry.
But difficult or not, LSC is committed to adding and retaining employees it needs to keep the plants humming at the highest level.
“For years and years and years, the quality of the work done in Lancaster has been I would say legendary for our customers,” Martin said.
“They know, if they want the best work done, they want it done in the Lancaster plants — to the extent that we even have customers who demand to have their work done in Lancaster.
“We’ve been really lucky to have such a great, solid and stable workforce in the county,” he continued. “We want to make sure as we look ahead into the next decade that we’re making those investments in the employees in the county who continue to help us do great work.”

Texto completo: 2020 Democratic front-runner Joe Biden is casting himself as the candidate Russian President Vladimir Putin fears the most.
Biden's team seized on a New York Times report Monday, which said Russian hackers attempted to hack into Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas firm that employed Biden's son Hunter and is at the center of President Trump's impeachment, to claim it is not just Trump who is intimidated by the former vice president.
“Donald Trump tried to coerce Ukraine into lying about Joe Biden and a major bipartisan, international anti-corruption victory because he recognized that he can’t beat the vice president,” said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates.
“Now we know that Vladimir Putin also sees Joe Biden as a threat,” Bates said. “Any American president who had not repeatedly encouraged foreign interventions of this kind would immediately condemn this attack on the sovereignty of our elections.”
Researchers from Area 1, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, discovered on New Year's Eve that Russian hackers from the GRU targeted subsidiaries of Burisma as well as Kvartal 95, a Ukrainian television production company founded by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a similar manner to which Democrats were targeted in the 2016 election. The report, which notes that it is unclear what the hackers were looking for or what they may have found, does not have any immediate comment from the Russian government or Burisma.
Biden's son Hunter, 49, earned $50,000 per month to serve on the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, from 2014 to 2019. The impeachment effort began last year after a whistleblower complaint revealed that Trump pressured Zelensky in a July phone call to open investigations into political rivals, including the Bidens, while withholding congressionally approved military aid.
Last week, Bloomberg reported that U.S. officials are investigating whether Russia is targeting Biden with a disinformation campaign echoing the attacks on Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016.
In response to that report, Bates said, "Vladimir Putin has interfered in our elections before, and it's no surprise he's doing so again to prop up President Trump."

Texto completo: Top Democratic leaders in Congress said they were caught completely off guard by a report on Russia hacking the Ukrainian natural gas company at the center of President Trump's impeachment.
In back-to-back interviews Monday evening, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed they were only just hearing of the breach when asked by MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.
"I have to say, Rachel, I'm a bit distressed to see this for the first time in a newspaper report. If the intel community is aware of this, that should have been brought to our attention by now," Schiff said.
"But I don't find it surprising. I do find it deeply disturbing, and I would hope that maybe both parties can get out ahead of this, even if the president won't, and condemn any Russian effort to influence the next election," the California Democrat added.

The New York Times reported that researchers from Area 1, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, discovered on New Year's Eve that Russian hackers from the GRU targeted subsidiaries of Burisma as well as Kvartal 95, a Ukrainian television production company founded by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The report, which notes that it is unclear what the hackers were looking for or what they may have found, does not have any immediate comment from the Russian government or Burisma.
Former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, from 2014 to 2019. The impeachment effort began last year after a whistleblower complaint revealed that Trump pressured Zelensky in a July phone call to open investigations into political rivals, including the Bidens, while withholding congressionally approved military aid. The elder Biden is now a Democratic candidate for president.
Both Schiff and Schumer are members of the "Gang of Eight," a bipartisan group of leaders from both parties in the House and Senate with access to classified intelligence. In recent days, Democrats have complained over what they say is the Trump administration's reluctance to share intelligence, particularly after U.S. officials failed to consult Congress before carrying out a drone strike killing Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani.
Schiff, suggesting that Trump conveyed a signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin to interfere in the 2020 election, said the first thing he intends to do is communicate with U.S. intelligence agencies to find out if they knew of the reported hack.
Schumer said the news "shows the great need" for Congress to pass election security legislation but cited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as a "complete ally" to Trump in frustrating those efforts.
In a Sunday interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump is "in complete denial" about Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2020 election and accused McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, of being an "accomplice" to Russian interference, claiming that she wonders about his allegiance to the United States.

Will anyone notice that Cory Booker dropped out?

Texto completo: Cory Booker has suspended his presidential campaign — which is to say, he's out — admitting that he no longer sees “a path to victory.”

The lack of adequate campaign funding, his failure to qualify for the last two Democratic presidential debates, and the timing of the Senate’s upcoming impeachment trial all contributed to Booker’s decision to drop out.
"Our campaign has reached the point where we need more money to scale up and continue building a campaign that can win — money we don’t have, and money that is harder to raise because I won’t be on the next debate stage and because the urgent business of impeachment will rightly be keeping me in Washington,” he said in a statement.

Booker was hoping for a late surge in Iowa, but last week’s poll showed no sign of improvement. And now that the Senate is getting ready to begin the impeachment trial of President Trump, Booker will not be able to campaign in the important primary states he’d need to remain in the race.

On paper, Booker was everything the Democratic base claims to want: a progressive minority with enough congressional experience to appease the establishment and policies that resemble those of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. And he did everything he could to gain national attention: He racked up endorsements, performed fairly well at the debates, and led a consistent, drama-free campaign team.

Still, Booker’s campaign failed to make a significant impression — on black voters, progressive voters, or older, establishment voters. Perhaps that’s because his message was so unoriginal. Even his signature policy, gun control, was associated more with Beto O’Rourke’s campaign than with Booker’s. And many of Booker’s other proposals have been dominated by Warren and Sanders.

Once he failed to make an impression on the issues, Booker pivoted to cultural wokeness. He’s blamed racism for the Trump phenomenon and pandered to the cultural Left by announcing his gender pronouns, and he still failed to win it over. Some Democratic voters said it’s because his sincerity felt too forced, as did his campaign. And as a result, very few will miss his campaign or even notice that it’s gone.

Harvard law professor sues the New York Times for 'clickbait defamation' in Epstein story

Texto completo: Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig is suing the New York Times, accusing the newspaper of misrepresenting his views of Jeffrey Epstein’s financial support for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Lessig announced the lawsuit in a post on his Medium page on Monday. The 58-year-old academic sued the New York Times over a story it published on Sept. 14, 2019, titled, "A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein’s Money, Do It in Secret."
The lawsuit takes aim at the article’s headline and opening sentences, which say: "It is hard to defend soliciting donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law professor, has been trying."
"This title and lede are false," Lessig wrote, calling the New York Times’s description of his views "clickbait defamation."
"Senior editors reviewed the story after Professor Lessig complained and were satisfied that the story accurately reflected his statements," a New York Times representative told the Washington Examiner in a statement. "We plan to defend against the claim vigorously."
Lessig wrote a Medium post on Sept. 8, 2019, accusing journalist Ronan Farrow and MIT administration officials of "scapegoating" former director of MIT’s Media Lab Joichi Ito for accepting multiple anonymous donations from Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide last year.
In the post, Lessig said that he and Ito are friends and admitted that he had advised Ito on taking the donations long before the information was known publicly. Lessig said he and Ito wrongly thought that accepting donations from Epstein, who Ito believed had stopped sexually abusing children at the time, was acceptable as long as the donations were kept anonymous and did not allow Epstein to "launder" Epstein's reputation as a pedophile.
His post spurred New York Times reporter Nellie Bowles to ask to interview Lessig about Epstein’s donations. In the interview, he restated that Ito and MIT never should have accepted the Epstein donations because "when [the donations were] discovered, it would do real and substantial pain to the people within the Media Lab who would come to see that they were supported in part by the gift of a pedophile."
The law professor asserted that Ito should not take all the blame for accepting the donations because members of MIT’s administration, including MIT President L. Rafael Reif, knew about and gave their approval to Ito to accept the donations. If the university was set on accepting the money, Lessig said, it "damn well better make it anonymous."
Lessig was a Democratic presidential primary candidate in 2016, jumping into the race that was dominated by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. His campaign lasted a couple months, and he dropped out after missing the first primary debate.
An independent report recently revealed that Epstein donated $525,000 to the MIT Media Lab after his conviction.

Brother of Democratic state senator accuses him of child abuse and drug dealing

Texto completo: A New York state senator denied allegations of child molestation and drug trafficking made by his imprisoned brother.
Democrat Sen. Luis Sepulveda, 55, represents the Bronx in the state legislature. Before the 2020 session opened, Sepulveda’s brother, Jose Elias Sepulveda, sent a 13-page letter to state lawmakers claiming that the senator committed multiple crimes from abusing children to smuggling drugs, according to the New York Times.
"Let me make it clear that these allegations are unequivocally false," Senator Sepulveda said in a Thursday statement. "Unfortunately, my brother is currently in a difficult place in his life. But despite his situation, he still enjoys the love and support of my family and I."
His brother's accusations came with signed affidavits from other family members attesting to the charges in the letter. Sepulveda expanded on his statement in an interview with the New York Times, calling his brother an extortionist.
"All I would say is that I will never give in to extortionists, no matter if they are related to me by blood or not," he said. "This is clearly an attempt to extort, and it’s unfortunate that someone put that out there without speaking to us first, but I have to deal with the consequences."
Jose Elias Sepulveda, 64, was sentenced to life in prison in 1998 after he was caught attempting to traffic thousands of kilograms of marijuana, cocaine, and hashish oil throughout the United States. In 2017, his father supposedly signed an affidavit admitting to neglecting Jose Elias Sepulveda and coercing him into running a drug business.
Gloria Reyes, who dated Jose Elias, said that the Sepulveda brothers’ father has been senile and bedridden for years and could not have knowingly signed the affidavit. She also said that Jose Elias Sepulveda had coerced or conned other family members into signing fake affidavits.
Reyes said that Sepulveda has held a grudge against his brother, believing that as a senator, he has the power to pardon him and release him from prison.

Texto completo: The Academy Awards didn’t get the Oscar nominations right Monday morning because they didn’t get Yesterday right.
The joyously creative movie Yesterday, accurately described in Forbes as the “summer’s lone sleeper hit,” received not a single Academy Award nomination. Instead, the Oscar nominations are dominated by the usual mix of the pompous, the dark and moody, the homages to Hollywood itself, and, of course, the annual over-stylized mob flick. (Okay, Little Women, which I haven’t seen yet but I’m told is wonderful, doesn’t fit any of these categories, but Hollywood likes it probably because Hollywood considers it to be slyly feminist more than because the academy actually recognizes quality.)
The professional critics, haughty as always in dismissing movies that are fun and sweet and smile-inducing, over-analyzed Yesterday. The critics would sometimes acknowledge its winsomeness but kept complaining that the film doesn’t satisfy their “inner pedant,” who wants a more serious examination of the ramifications of its “daft, ingenious premise.”
In truth, that premise, namely that some sort of weird analog of an electromagnetic pulse suddenly made almost everyone in the world forget that the Beatles (and a few other pop-culture staples) ever existed, works so well specifically because the film itself doesn’t try to over-analyze it. The characters are so likable, the pacing so perfect, and the Beatles songs so seamlessly and happily woven into the plot that the audience is happy to suspend disbelief.
But, “what if the popularity of the Beatles’ music was as much a product of a specific time and set of circumstances as the music itself?” asks A.O. Scott of the New York Times. “What if things had developed so differently in the Beatles' absence that people would have no idea what they were missing, and, frankly, wouldn't care?” asks Sheila O’Malley at RogerEbert.com.
Audiences know not to take things so absurdly seriously. They are perfectly happy with “daft” if it is accompanied by “ingenious.” They have no problem with a movie that wears lighthearted sincerity on its sleeve. If the Beatles could be sappy, with Let It Be and Long and Winding Road, or daftly silly with Yellow Submarine and Octopus’s Garden, why shouldn’t a movie homage to the Beatles be the same?
The self-important academy often forgets that the first and most basic job of a movie is to entertain. As it was put by one “ordinary viewer” at IMDB who gave the movie a perfect “10” rating, “If you need two hours to forget about all the bad things in this world or in your life and to just feel happy, go see this movie!”
Hollywood rarely honors “just feeling happy.” Nor does it like “messages” as simple as “if you love a girl, let her know” and “always try to tell the truth.” That’s not dark enough, not twisted enough, not complicated enough, not tortured enough, for the academy.
It should, though, be celebrated. My wife and I, despite neither of us being particularly avid Beatles fans, both decided Yesterday was our favorite movie. Not necessarily the grandest, the most meaningful, the most inspirational, but definitely our favorite — not just of 2019, but the entire decade.
When a fun, little flick unexpectedly earns $150 million at the box office, the academy should pay attention. Then again, if the fools in the (Hollywood) hills miss the boat, as they often do, well, ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra, la-la how the life goes on.

Texto completo: MSNBC host Rachel Maddow condemned the New York Times for its coverage of investigations related to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over the years.
Particularly during the 2016 campaign, when Clinton was a Democratic candidate for president, Maddow said on her show Friday that the Gray Lady has really stuck it to Clinton in a way that would fill her political rivals with glee.
"I'll tell you, as a matter of my opinion that the New York Times is one of the great wonders of the world, and we are a better country and a better world for having the New York Times in it, but the New York Times has something wrong with it when it comes to reporting on Hillary Clinton," Maddow said with a laugh.
"They've got some sort of unresolved internal issues when it comes to their reporting on Hillary Clinton. I don't know if they will ever resolve it," Maddow continued. "But the Times, more than any other mainstream print publication, has hammered away at the Hillary Clinton email thing as if it really was as big a scandal as people like Mike Flynn and Donald Trump were saying it was."
During the segment, Maddow put on display several Times reports over the years with alarming headlines related to investigations into Clinton and her emails. The host said such articles appeared on the front page of the print edition "countless" times. But, when a State Department investigation found "no persuasive evidence of systematic, deliberate mishandling of classified information" last fall, Maddow said the story ended up on Section A, Page 16 of the Saturday print edition with a headline that called it a "quiet ending" to the inquiry.
"Yes, it was a quiet ending. Yes, New York Times, you gave it quite a quiet ending, especially compared to how big an opening you gave it on the front page for months," Maddow said.
The segment Friday came after the Washington Post reported last week that a federal investigation into the allegations of corruption involving Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, and Uranium One was nearing completion.
Maddow noted the Times's controversial dealings with author Peter Schweizer, whose book Clinton Cash, gave rise to the Uranium One controversy. She also said the Times has yet to do its own report on the winding down of U.S. Attorney John Huber's inquiry, despite giving the Uranium One deal controversy a great deal of coverage.
"Thus far, at least, the New York Times has not reported on the conclusion of that review at all. It's been reported in the Washington Post and in CNN, thus far, but we haven't seen the Times touch it. I bet they will," Maddow said. "I look forward to seeing their story and how they contend with the fact that they, more than anybody else in the mainstream media, promoted that story. I also look forward to seeing whether the "lock her up" chant about Hillary Clinton will nevertheless live forever even after Mike Flynn's sentencing."
A representative for the New York Times did not immediately return a request for comment on Maddow's segment. The Times did publish a Reuters write-up on the Post report.

Liberal Media Scream: Former New York Times critic says Trump aides are cultists, 'toadies'

Texto completo: It’s hard to imagine supporters of President Trump being ’dissed worse than Hillary Rodham Clinton’s slap as “deplorables,” but a former New York Times critic has gone way beyond that, comparing them to cultists such as those who adored Charles Manson and even Adolf Hitler.
For our weekly Liberal Media Scream feature, we present Frank Rich, who was featured on MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell’s show to elaborate on his New York Magazine feature, “What Will Happen to the Trump Toadies? Look to Nixon’s defenders, and the Vichy collaborators, for clues.”
On the Thursday episode, Rich said, “Whatever crimes are found out now or in the course of the Trump presidency is nothing compared to what’s been buried that none of us know about."

He also described Trump supporters as part of a “cult,” warning “the cult leader, whether it be the Reverend [Sun Myung] Moon, who was a Nixon supporter, or Jim Jones or whomever, Charlie Manson, they’re never going to be reformed.”
Rich on Thursday’s Last Word with O’Donnell on MSNBC:
“What I tried to do in this piece is make the point whoever goes to jail or doesn’t go to jail, whatever crimes are found out now or in the course of the Trump presidency, is nothing compared to what’s been buried that none of us know about, not even a very zealous investigative press has found yet. And people are going to be turning over rocks for decades. And you look back at history, General Motors and Ford both had executives who were essentially Hitler appeasers, and in the case of General Motors, were involved in the armaments that were used against American troops in manufacturing them in Germany during the war. It took 40 years to find all that out, but it all came out.
“And people who support these kind of regimes, whether it be appeasement then or America first in the ‘30s or Trump, which is, you know, let’s face it, a criminal presidency however you want to slice it, there’s going to be a reckoning. And one other thing I wanted to mention is, you can only take the Nixon analogy so far because, yes, Nixon abused his office. He also tried to throw a presidential campaign. But it would never occur to him to collaborate and aid the Soviet Union, America’s own enemy. It would never occur to him, to my knowledge, to break up immigrant families at the border and turn away refugees from horrors in other countries. It would never occur to him to, quite the contrary, to fight climate change science and to downgrade a regulation of environmental poisons. And so these are really serious crimes and whether they produce jail sentences or not for the people who did them, they’ll be implicated and so will their children and their grandchildren. There’s going to be a stain.
“Here, it is a cult because they absolutely — people who, in some cases, did have reputations that they’ve now destroyed, good reputations, have made fools of themselves for their dear leader. And the thing about cults is they always do come to an end. And the cult leader, whether it be the Reverend Moon, who was a Nixon supporter, or Jim Jones or whomever, Charlie Manson, they’re never going to be reformed. And that’s certainly true of Trump. They will never see the problems with their ways. But the people who swirl around them and were taken in, they’re going to pay a price, a human price, and a reputational price forever.”
Brent Baker, Media Research Center vice president of research, explains our weekly pick: “The very definition of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS), getting all the paranoia into one article and TV segment, though transferring his disdain from President Trump directly to those working for Trump. Supporters are like those who worked on behalf of the Nazis, the legally enacted policies staff helped implement are ‘serious crimes’ and those in Trump’s orbit are in a cult similar to the one led by Charles Manson. Liberals were upset by the ‘Lock Her Up’ chants against Hillary Clinton, but isn’t that just what Rich is doing here in criminalizing policy disagreements?”
Rating: Five out of five SCREAMS.

Texto completo: Former host and producer of Candid Camera Peter Funt mourned the death of "man on the street" style reporting, arguing that reporters today "really don’t have to bother with the general public."
"When I was a rookie at ABC News decades ago, our coverage of big stories—from war to impeachment to the World Series—always included plenty of 'man on the street,' or MOS," he wrote in a Sunday opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal titled "The Man on the Street Has Died." "As soon as important news broke, a pack of reporters from TV, radio and print dashed to New York’s iconic crossroads, Times Square or Grand Central Terminal, to learn what “average” folks were thinking."
While "MOS was never scientific," Funt said the style of reporting consisted "of quick sound bites from people given little time to think before blurting opinions" that were "almost always edited to create balance."
"The process was quaint and sometimes misleading, but it did serve as a reminder that not all issues are black or white," he wrote. "The man on the street as we knew him is dead. He may reappear occasionally after natural disasters or in political battleground states. Most MOS coverage, however, has been replaced by a plethora of faceless polls—and even polling averages—along with tallies of likes, tweets and Google searches."
As an example, Funt pointed to a USA Today report following a July Democratic debate in which the publication declared Rep. Tulsi Gabbard the "clear" winner because Google searches for the 2020 candidate skyrocketed after the event. He also noted a New York Times story on who won the December Democratic debate, which consisted "almost entirely of tweets."
"Who are these googling masses? Where do they live? How old are they? Do they look you in the eye when they speak?" he wondered. "These metrics have a scientific sheen, but they’re no replacement for MOS. Neither are the other digital facsimiles ... In some ways reprinting tweets is more journalistically careless than MOS ever was."
Funt acknowledged that "the power of Twitter shouldn’t be underestimated" but noted that "only 22% of American adults use Twitter, and it has a tendency toward groupthink." Funt said the only place MOS "remains a staple is in local news coverage."
"In the media lexicon, MOS has another meaning in addition to 'man on the street': 'mit out sound.' Mit is German for 'with' and this use of MOS refers to footage that is silent. You might say what remains of MOS in the digital age is now mostly MOS," he concluded. "The more tools we develop to give individuals a voice, the less we care about what they have to say."
In addition to producing and hosting Candid Camera, which his father, Allen Funt, created in 1948 and that ended in 2014, Funt, 72, also worked for Denver radio station KHOW, the ABC Radio Network, the New York Times, and various other media organizations.

Daily on Healthcare: Alcohol deaths are climbing but proposed reforms are controversial

ALCOHOL LIMITS ABSENT AMID OVERDOSE CRISIS: New federal data shows that alcohol deaths have been climbing steadily over time, but the policy tools that health agency officials have raised to address excessive drinking are controversial.
According to new data from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, deaths from over-drinking have doubled in almost two decades, from 35,914 in 1999 to 72,558 in 2017.
This means that deaths from alcohol are even higher than deaths from opioids, which totalled 49,060 in 2017. And the data doesn’t account for other downsides of over-drinking, including being violent while under the influence, giving birth to babies with fetal alcohol syndrome, or the productivity costs of alcoholism.
But while Congress and the Trump administration have worked on ideas to reduce deaths from prescription drugs, heroin, and fentanyl, they have been notably silent about alcohol. They may be reluctant to propose limitations on alcohol because it’s far more likely to spur a backlash than doing so for other drugs would.
Tobacco-style limitations, such as restrictions on where and when alcohol is sold, taxes, or bans on certain types of marketing, get met with accusations of Prohibition-era methods, as they would affect people who drink only moderately and would potentially fail to address alcoholism altogether. The alcohol industry has instead supported policies to strengthen law enforcement and education, as well as targeted approaches aimed at people who have a dependency on alcohol.
But in recent years public health agencies, including the World Health Organization, have been far more vocal about calling for limits on alcohol. Under President Trump, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended limiting hours and locations for alcohol sales. The surgeon general under Barack Obama issued a report that recommended reducing problem drinking in states through restrictions, which, like the Trump administration guidelines, would also hit people who only drink occasionally. The CDC during Obama's tenure also issued controversial guidance saying women of childbearing age shouldn’t drink alcohol unless they are also on birth control.
States don’t appear to be heading in the direction the CDC recommended. Even as deaths have climbed, states have largely moved to make alcohol more available in what many see as a more modernized approach to drinking. A quick look at recent state laws shows that more states are allowing alcohol to be sold on Sundays, or in grocery stores, or earlier in the day.
Plus, there isn’t all bad news on the drinking front. For example, underage drinking, including college binge drinking, is at record lows, and drunken driving deaths account for 29% of overall driving deaths, the lowest percentage since 1982.
We’ll be watching the rhetoric on this, particularly after the CDC releases its annual figures on life expectancy sometime in the next month. In recent years, excessive drinking has shown itself to be one of the big contributors to people dying younger.

INDIANA MOUNTS DEFENSE OF ABORTION LAWS: Attorney General Curtis Hill has filed a brief in U.S. district court rebuttin arguments by Whole Woman’s Health Alliance, which provides abortions, to have 25 sections and sub-sections of Indiana law declared unconstitutional.
“Indiana’s abortion regulations are carefully designed to further our important and legitimate interests in expressing respect for fetal life and promoting women’s health,” Hill said in a statement. “At the same time, our laws respect the woman’s ultimate decision whether or not to bear a child. The federal district court should protect the delicate balance fashioned by the Supreme Court’s abortion precedents.”
Whole Woman’s Health filed suit in 2018 after Indiana regulators rejected its license to open a clinic in South Bend. Last summer, a court permitted the clinic to open as the broader challenges to Indiana restrictions went forward. Some of the restrictions Whole Woman’s Health is seeking to strike: preventing medical providers other than doctors from performing abortions, banning abortion clinics from using telemedicine, and requiring parental consent for abortions.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKS SCOTUS NOT TO RULE ON OBAMACARE BEFORE ELECTION: The Department of Justice requested that the Supreme Court put off deliberating the constitutionality of Obamacare until after the lower courts have decided, despite GOP members’ common argument that the law should be struck down. If the Supreme Court agrees with Solicitor General Noel Francisco’s written request, the GOP may be able to push off coming up with an Obamacare replacement plan in the middle of campaigning. Francisco told the court: “The accelerated review petitioners seek is unnecessary,” and that coming to a decision before the lower courts have finished deliberating would be “premature.”
LEGALLY MANDATING VACCINATIONS WORKED IN EUROPE: Twenty-nine European countries that mandated vaccines for measles and pertussis had markedly higher vaccination rates than other countries, according to a study by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Countries with mandatory vaccines had a nearly 4 percentage point higher rate of measles vaccination and over 2 percentage point higher rate of pertussis vaccination.
ATYPICAL FLU SEASON IS STILL GOING STRONG: The influenza B strain, which usually starts to hit later in the flu season, has already killed 21 children since July 2019 when the flu season began, according to the CDC. There have already been five pediatric deaths since the start of 2020, making a total of 32 pediatric deaths from both A and B strains and 4,800 deaths overall.
Researchers have to develop a flu vaccine well before flu season starts, which is usually in early autumn, and before they know which strains will be circulating the most. Still, the CDC says the vaccine developed for the 2019/2020 flu season will still be effective. Even though the strain in the vaccine differs from the one currently getting people sick, CDC officials say the strains are similar and the vaccine will help.
CALIFORNIA GUN OWNERS SUPPORT BUYBACK PROGRAMS AND PURCHASING RESTRICTIONS: The California Safety and Wellbeing Survey found that a slim majority of California gun owners support a five-year prohibition on firearm purchases for people with at least two DUIs in the past five years as well as a high-capacity magazine buyback program. About 50% of gun owners supported restricting purchasing power for those with DUIs and an overwhelming majority of non-gun owners, as well as those who live with gun owners, support the proposal — 72% and 67% respectively. Similarly, 51% of gun owners believe in buyback programs, which would allow owners of high-capacity magazines to sell their firearms to police.

Texto completo: After a blistering primary victory, President Trump managed to reclaim the good graces of the GOP establishment by releasing two short lists of his top Supreme Court nominees were he to win the presidency. The lists assembled by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society earned Trump the endorsement of Sen. Ted Cruz and, more importantly, convinced enough of the Republican establishment that Trump could have his wacky wall and Twitter tirades but would still abide by conservative tradition when push came to shove.
Three years later, we have Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, arguably the finest addition to the bench since Clarence Thomas nearly three decades ago, and Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh was not on the original list that was released during the election but was later added to a list Trump released during his presidency with a nudge from Anthony Kennedy.
In an interview with the New York Times editorial board, Sen. Bernie Sanders claimed that he would consider publishing a list of his own. The second-place Democratic candidate called the idea "reasonable" and noted that his wife supported it.
Just as with Trump, a measured list of establishment-approved judicial picks could bolster Sanders's perceived electability among skeptics. Although the socialist's base and fundraising are the strongest of the Democratic primary, Sanders has failed to expand his national support past a simple quintile of the primary vote. A list of judges with acceptable, liberal jurisprudence could provide a boon to his polling among Democrats worried he'd tap candidates ideologically wedged between Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.
Sanders could stand the most to gain from releasing such a list, but there's no reason why every candidate in the race shouldn't embrace radical transparency when it comes to the judiciary. After all, presidential hopefuls can make all the legislative promises they please with zero practical odds of achieving them, but the judiciary is different. Picking judicial nominees is one the strongest and most influential powers of the presidency, and voters deserve to know how each candidate would wield it.
After our exceptional economy, Trump's judicial nominations and confirmations shepherded through by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remain the best case for his presidential reelection. It doesn't even seem fully likely that Trump would have won the White House in the first place without those lists signaling the importance and direction of the federal judiciary under his presidency. Trump's 2020 competitors ought to give their own side of the aisle the same gift, their own Supreme Court short lists outlining their visions for one-third of the federal government.

Texto completo: Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey dropped out of the Democratic presidential race Monday, ending a nearly yearlong quest built around a message of peace and unity that failed to resonate with voters eager for a more aggressive posture against President Donald Trump.
The departure of Booker from the crowded Democratic field, heralded at the outset as the most diverse in history, leaves just one African American candidate, Deval Patrick, vying for the nomination in a party in which black voters are an essential bloc of the Democratic base.
The decision came after Booker, who never cracked the top tier of Democratic contenders and consistently polled in the low single digits, fell short of qualifying for a second consecutive debate. The setback, the Booker campaign conceded in the past few weeks, would most likely doom the underdog candidacy at a time when the Democratic race for president is being overshadowed by an impeachment trial in Washington and a growing conflict with Iran.
It’s with a full heart that I share this news—I’m suspending my campaign for president.
To my team, supporters, and everyone who gave me a shot—thank you. I am so proud of what we built, and I feel nothing but faith in what we can accomplish together. pic.twitter.com/Fxvc549vlJ
— Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) January 13, 2020
“I got in this race to win, and I’ve always said I wouldn’t continue if there was no longer a path to victory,” Booker said in a statement to supporters. “Our campaign has reached the point where we need more money to scale up and continue building a campaign that can win — money we don’t have, and money that is harder to raise because I won’t be on the next debate stage and because the urgent business of impeachment will rightly be keeping me in Washington.”
Booker, who is also up for reelection to the Senate this year, still enjoys favorable ratings in New Jersey, which leans decidedly Democratic and hasn’t elected a Republican senator in more than 40 years. Sen. Robert Menendez won reelection there by nearly 10 percentage points in 2018 after weathering a federal corruption trial.
Booker often made his case for the presidency through his biography: as a black man whose family had to overcome racist housing discrimination in New Jersey; as a mayor of a majority black city who saw the uneven impact of hard-line criminal justice laws and the scourge of gun violence as a daily menace in his community. Yet he also never attracted substantial support from black voters, many of whom view mere representation as not enough to lock down support.
Booker began his campaign last Feb. 1, the first day of Black History Month, with a clarion call for unity in a deeply polarized time. Throughout his campaign, he was unrelenting in his optimism and his calls for love and healing, a message that apparently fell flat with an electorate energized by a fervent dislike of Trump.
Though the core of his campaign was built on emotional ideals, Booker focused heavily on policies that deeply affected cities like Newark, New Jersey, where he was mayor for seven years. He pledged to offer sweeping clemency to thousands of nonviolent drug offenders, and he pushed some of the other Democratic candidates to embrace more aggressive stances on gun control, becoming the first candidate in the field to propose a national gun-licensing program.
And he focused constantly on addressing the racial wealth gap, including an economic proposal known as baby bonds that would create a government-run savings account for every child born in the United States.
He cast himself as the candidate best suited to rebuild the “Obama coalition,” and his campaigning took him beyond the rotation of the four early primary and caucus states to key swing-state cities like Detroit, Philadelphia and Miami. His argument was based in a general election narrative, that in order to defeat Trump, Democrats needed to revive the massive turnout in cities to offset Trump’s rural appeal.
But Booker was never able to attract the support of black voters in both national polling and key early states like South Carolina, who were either supporting former Vice President Joe Biden or looking at more progressive candidates. As Booker held up his identity and lived experience as a rationale for his candidacy, he proved unable to bridge a party split more along ideological lines between the moderate and progressive wings.
Nonetheless, Booker seemed to confound supporters, donors and pundits who remained mystified about why he never had his “moment” during the primary. He started his campaign with a limited base of online donors and a heavy reliance on traditional big-dollar fundraisers. Without ever experiencing the kind of surge in support that could have led to a surge in online fundraising, Booker was forced to run a shoestring campaign, unable to finance the frequent television advertising that has helped candidates like Tom Steyer become mainstays on the debate stage.
Booker, despite years of relationships in the finance world of New York and the high-tech corridors of California, had struggled to raise money throughout 2019. All told, he collected about $22.1 million — less than Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Biden or former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, raised just in the fourth quarter.
Money was so tight that Booker had scheduled fundraisers in the final two-week sprint of his campaign in California and New Jersey — far from the crucial battlegrounds of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Booker had not invested heavily in a digital donor program in advance of his run, and he never successfully turned on the spigot of small, grassroots contributions like some of his rivals. Entering October, he had raised only $4.3 million from donations of less than $200; less than the total haul, for instance, of Sanders in his first 24 hours as a candidate.
Still, he had an enviable stable of more than 100 bundlers who are now up for grabs, including billionaire Donald Sussman, one of the Democratic Party’s most generous donors.
In a final push to inch up in Iowa polling and make the January debate stage, Booker’s campaign ran roughly $300,000 in television ads in Iowa in the past two weeks, a modest sum in a race dominated by the millions spent on the airwaves by Steyer and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York. The ads pushed Booker’s advertising budget to its limit.
And he struggled to shine as a unique political figure in a crowded and diverse field. His resume, which had drawn national attention for its breadth throughout his career, was matched at every point. A Rhodes Scholar and former mayor? That also applied to former Buttigieg. The first black person to be elected senator from his state? That also applied to Sen. Kamala Harris of California.
Though his departure from the race is unlikely to have much of an impact on other candidates’ polling, the Booker campaign was a leader in endorsements in Iowa and New Hampshire and had a particularly notable staff of Iowa organizers, setting up a likely scramble by the remaining candidates to secure both endorsers and staff members in the early nominating states.
Nearly all of the remaining Democratic candidates praised the campaign Booker ran, and many shared photographs of Booker offering them a hug or posing for a selfie with a voter. Biden said Booker had “campaigned with joy and heart.” Andrew Yang, who formed a personal friendship with Booker on the campaign trail and regularly exchanges text messages with the senator, said he will miss seeing Booker (and his girlfriend, actress and activist Rosario Dawson) on the trail.
“You’ve always been a powerful voice for justice and equality, and you’ve made this primary stronger,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
In a video message released Monday, which was backed by a gospel-like piano track and drumbeat and featured a greatest-hits rundown of his message on the campaign trail, Booker was upbeat until the end.
“So now I recommit myself to the work,” Booker said. “I can’t wait to get back on the campaign trail and campaign as hard as I can for whoever is the eventual nominee and for candidates up and down the ballot.”
Booker also showed a touch of humor Monday. When a celebrity gossip website published an article noting that Booker’s exit had fans mourning the possibility of Dawson becoming first lady, Booker responded on Twitter, his favorite medium.
“Have you been talking to my mom?” he said.

Texto completo: Hackers de la unidad de inteligencia militar rusa conocida como GRU atacaron con éxito Burisma , la compañía de gas ucraniana en cuya junta directiva se sentó el hijo de Joe Biden y alrededor de la que se desató el escándalo ucraniano.
The New York Times ha informado este lunes sobre el ataque cibernético a la empresa que está en el centro del juicio político de Donald Trump . El presidente presionó a su homólogo ucraniano Volodimir Zelensky para que investigara a Biden y a su hijo Hunter por las implicaciones que este último tenía en la compañía de gas. De momento, las acusaciones del presidente a los Biden no tienen fundamento alguno.
Ya el Departamento de Justicia ha acusado a siete funcionario de GRU de interferir en las elecciones presidenciales de Estados Unidos en 2016. Según la acusación, el equipo ruso hackeó y publicó correos de demócratas para perjudicarles en la contienda.
Según el análisis de Axios, el ataque a Burisma puede perjudicar tanto las campañas presidenciales del vicepresidente Joe Biden como la reelección de Trump. El equipo de campaña del primero de ellos sabe que los documentos podrían hacerse públicos en cualquier momento y que su revelación amenaza con ser dañina . Por su parte, los de Trump saben que Rusia puede mancillar a su antojo dichas revelaciones.

Surveillance has become ubiquitous in our lives

Texto completo: In 2006, State Police officers hovered in a helicopter above the Taos County property of Norman Davis. Spotting a telltale patch of bright green, they alerted officers on the ground, who searched Davis’ property and arrested him.
He pleaded guilty to a count of possession of marijuana, reserving his right to appeal, and was put on a year’s unsupervised probation. Although the punishment was light, a principle was involved and he tenaciously fought his conviction. The Court of Appeals considered his case three times and the Supreme Court twice. The judges agreed on the key point, that Davis’ conviction had to be reversed, though they disagreed about why. Finally, in 2015 they settled on the rule that low-altitude aerial surveillance by police is unconstitutional unless authorized by a judge.
I was reminded of the case when I heard about the fleets of drones sighted over northeastern Colorado and southwestern Nebraska in recent weeks. According to CNN and The New York Times, the drones are large (“wingspans of up to 6 feet”) and fly in formations of as many as 30 aircraft. They fly after dark, which suggests some purpose other than mapping.
I assume there’s a mundane explanation, which may have come out by the time this column appears. In the meantime, everyone agrees there’s nothing unlawful about a private company sending drones to hover over people’s homes. Highly intrusive surveillance that would be unconstitutional if done by our government is legally hunky-dory when done by any random private company.
Over the past year, an outfit called World View Enterprises has been sending up high-altitude surveillance balloons from Spaceport Tucson. As explained by Wired magazine, “stratospheric balloons promise cheap access to incredibly high-resolution images that can be collected anywhere on Earth.” The balloons “can take photos with 15-centimeter resolution from 75,000 feet,” with even higher resolution coming soon. The company’s CEO boasts that’s good enough to tell if a person on the ground is “holding a shovel or a gun.” What World View is capable of doing isn’t just similar to a creepy neighbor taking pictures over your back wall. It’s actually the same thing.
Now imagine the detail a similarly equipped drone could capture from 300 feet.
The Federal Aviation Administration is considering baby steps toward regulating the spy cams over our heads. It’s proposed a rule that would require drones larger than 0.55 pound to emit identifying signals. While remote ID (as it’s known) might clear up mysteries such as the Colorado drone swarms, it would do nothing in itself to stop the intrusiveness of private surveillance.
Some forms of private tracking have been with us for ages, of course. Until the rise of telemarketing, a listed phone number was just a convenience. Frequent buyer cards allow stores to monitor our shopping habits. The banks that issue our credit and debit cards know all our fiscal secrets. But those forms of surveillance are knowingly invited and can be stopped at any time. The same can’t be said about camera-equipped drones and balloons. Or internet trackers, for that matter, which work like pen registers, a type of phone tap.
Government surveillance can send a person to jail. But it wouldn’t be true to say that private surveillance can never be used as evidence in a criminal prosecution. What’s to stop private spies, acting on their own, from gathering data and then deciding to share it with the government? In some circumstances, a private surveillance company might even have an ethical duty to turn over material to authorities – for example, if it records a clandestine burial on the West Mesa. Uses in civil litigation are limited only by lawyers’ imaginations.
More generally, what makes surveillance by low-flying police helicopters unconstitutional isn’t the possibility that criminals might be prosecuted. The law isn’t opposed to enforcing the law. Rather, the Constitution protects against unreasonable “intrusions on personal dignity and privacy,” in the words of the late Justice Thurgood Marshall. The intrusion itself doesn’t become less obnoxious because the intruder works in the private sector.
Google camera cars aren’t a problem, in my opinion, because they record what’s visible to anybody on the street. Low-resolution aerial images on internet maps duplicate what anyone can see looking out a plane window. It’s the level of prying detail and real-time monitoring that distinguishes the new forms of aerial surveillance. We shouldn’t allow companies to treat our physical privacy as ore to be strip-mined.
If we as a society are actually concerned about shielding citizens against intrusions on their dignity and privacy, then surveillance that’s unconstitutional for the police without a warrant should be unlawful for private companies, period.

Texto completo: Hackers de la unidad de inteligencia militar rusa conocida como GRU atacaron con éxito Burisma , la compañía de gas ucraniana en cuya junta directiva se sentó el hijo de Joe Biden y alrededor de la que se desató el escándalo ucraniano.
The New York Times ha informado este lunes sobre el ataque cibernético a la empresa que está en el centro del juicio político de Donald Trump . El presidente presionó a su homólogo ucraniano Volodimir Zelensky para que investigara a Biden y a su hijo Hunter por las implicaciones que este último tenía en la compañía de gas. De momento, las acusaciones del presidente a los Biden no tienen fundamento alguno.
Ya el Departamento de Justicia ha acusado a siete funcionario de GRU de interferir en las elecciones presidenciales de Estados Unidos en 2016. Según la acusación, el equipo ruso hackeó y publicó correos de demócratas para perjudicarles en la contienda.
Según el análisis de Axios, el ataque a Burisma puede perjudicar tanto las campañas presidenciales del vicepresidente Joe Biden como la reelección de Trump. El equipo de campaña del primero de ellos sabe que los documentos podrían hacerse públicos en cualquier momento y que su revelación amenaza con ser dañina . Por su parte, los de Trump saben que Rusia puede mancillar a su antojo dichas revelaciones.

Abcarian: #MeToo’s day in court

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein hobbled into a New York court, leaning on a walker cushioned by two bright green tennis balls. Bent and shuffling, he no longer appeared to be the entitled movie mogul who believed he could help himself to any woman he desired.
Instead, the man whose sexual bullying helped fuel the rage behind the #MeToo movement now appears weak, pale and pathetic. It all feels very calculated.
Just last month, he told the New York Post that he’s the victim here.
“I feel like the forgotten man,” he told the Post. “I made more movies directed by women and about women than any filmmaker, and I’m talking about 30 years ago. … I did it first! I pioneered it! It all got eviscerated because of what happened.”
Note the semantic sleight of hand: “because of what happened,” not “because of what I did.”
Though more than 80 women have accused the once-fearsome producer of sexual misconduct over decades, he is facing charges in this trial for the harm he is alleged to have inflicted on only two: a woman who says he raped her in a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and another who says he forced oral sex on her at his home in 2006.
In an excellent turn of events, he may also face a second criminal trial. A week ago, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced she would file four counts of rape and sexual battery against Weinstein involving alleged sexual attacks on two women in hotels in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills in 2013, just before that year’s Oscars.
Whether he will be convicted on any of these counts is far from certain, but just seeing him in court is a balm.
“It’s good to see Lady Justice staring him down,” said one of his earliest accusers, Rose McGowan. “It feels like a huge win already.”
Weinstein’s wretched behavior left a trail of destruction behind him: The ruined or stymied careers of women who fought him off at their own peril, the stars who got work only at a steep cost to their well-being, the enablers and defenders who tossed their scruples out the window to protect him by helping silence accusers with financial settlements, which came with non-disclosure agreements that enabled him to continue behaving as he always had.
I can’t look at Weinstein without thinking about Bill Cosby, who finally got what was coming, and now sits, remorseless, in a Pennsylvania jail. Or men like Matt Lauer, Les Moonves, Charlie Rose and dozens of others who lost their jobs but never really took responsibility for their actions.
But have things changed?
Certainly, that’s the case in the upper professional echelons. One year after the Weinstein scandal broke, the New York Times reported that of the 201 powerful men who lost their jobs as a result of sexual misconduct allegations, nearly half were replaced by women.
Tanzina Vega replaced John Hockenberry on WNYC’s “The Takeaway.” Jennifer Salke replaced Ted Price as head of Amazon Studios. Alex Wagner replaced Mark Halperin as co-host of Showtime’s “The Circus.” Rachel Rosenfelt replaced Hamilton Fish as publisher/president of the New Republic, and she was herself replaced last year by another woman, Kerrie Gillis.
At least a dozen states have passed new legislation addressing workplace sexual harassment, including California, the leader of the pack, which not only tightened laws on harassment and non-disclosure agreements, but also now requires that publicly traded companies based in the state appoint women to their boards.
I watched a live feed of Weinstein’s courthouse entrance last week, then a nearby press conference by seven of his accusers, including McGowan, Rosanna Arquette and TV journalist Lauren Sivan. They call themselves the Silence Breakers. “Living in silence,” McGowan said, “is a death sentence for your soul.”
The women watched as Weinstein entered the court flanked by attorneys and beefy bodyguards.
“Did you see the thugs who were protecting him?” asked Arquette. “Like a Scorcese movie!”
Sivan genially introduced herself as “the potted plant girl.”
In 2007 at a Manhattan business dinner, she has alleged, Weinstein lured her into the restaurant section of a club he had invested in, trapped her, then masturbated into a potted plant when she refused him.
“I’m OK being known as ‘the potted plant girl’ as long as he’s forever known as the predator … that he is,” she said.
Sivan has the distinction of having been targeted by both Weinstein and Roger Ailes, the late Fox News Network chairman who both personally fostered and allowed a culture of harassment to flourish at the network until he was exposed by former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson, who sued him personally. Carlson won $20 million and an apology.
Jury selection in the Weinstein case began Tuesday. The trial is expected to last weeks.
As for his fear of being forgotten, Sivan said, he shouldn’t worry for a single moment.
“We will definitely remember him,” she said. “He put MeToo on the map, a movement that has taken over the country and the world. He has changed sexual harassment policies in workplaces around the nation, even in our own government. He has made it more effective and safe for people to report sexual harassment and abuse.”
Heck of a legacy, Harvey.

Obligan a joven a someterse a prueba de embarazo para poder viajar a Estados Unidos

Texto completo: La joven japonesa Midori Nishida se aprestaba a abordar en Hong Kong un vuelo hacia Saipán , una isla estadounidense en el océano Pacífico, para visitar a sus padres cuando la aerolínea le impuso un requisito adicional nada habitual: debía hacerse una prueba de embarazo si deseaba viajar.
La aerolínea, Hong Kong Express Airways, obligó a la mujer, de 25 años, a declarar que efectivamente no estaba embaraza . Además, le pidió que autorizara a un proveedor médico para realizar una evaluación de “ajuste para volar ”, con el objetivo de detectar si tenía una silueta corporal similar a la de una embarazada.
Por último, según informa el diario The Wall Street Journal, personal aéreo escoltó a la mujer a un baño para que se hiciera la prueba de embarazo .
La aerolínea ha dicho que estas medidas obedecen a “las preocupaciones planteadas por las autoridades en Saipán”, donde el llamado turismo de partos dio como resultado que en 2018 naciera más bebés de turistas que de residentes.
Este territorio del archipiélago de Marianas tiene unos 50,000 habitantes y un estatus similar a la isla de Guam o Puerto Rico, lo que permite obtener la nacionalidad estadounidense por nacimiento de forma automática.
Hong Kong Express Airways además especificó que la prueba de embarazo estaba destinada a “ayudar a garantizar que las leyes de inmigración de Estados Unidos no se vean socavadas”, según el citado diario.
La aerolínea ha suspendido esta práctica y se ha disculpado con los pasajeros afectados, cuyo número e identidad se desconoce.
En enero de 2019, tres personas que operaban negocios multimillonarios de este tipo en el sur de California fueron arrestadas en la mayor investigación criminal federal hasta la fecha.
Las empresas entrenaron a sus clientes para engañar a los funcionarios de inmigración , pagando tarifas como si fueran personas sin recursos en los hospitales donde nacieron los bebés a pesar de que muchos eran ricos, según los investigadores.
Algunas parejas chinas cobraron hasta 100,000 dólares por paquete de turismo de parto, que incluía alojamiento, niñeras y excursiones de compras de lujo.
Las acusaciones en ese caso incluyen fraude de visas, fraude electrónico y robo de identidad , entre otros.
Mark Zito, agente especial de Aduanas en Los Ángeles, dijo al diario The New York Times que los investigadores también hallaron evidencia de actividades similares por parte de rusos (que se centran en el Noreste del país o en el sur de la Florida) y nigerianos (en Texas).
“Estamos tratando de aplacarlo, pero está aumentando”, dijo Zito, “otras naciones han comenzado a aprovecharse de esto”.

La aerolínea, Hong Kong Express Airways, obligó a la mujer, de 25 años, a declarar que efectivamente no estaba embaraza . Además, le pidió que autorizara a un proveedor médico para realizar una evaluación de “ajuste para volar ”, con el objetivo de detectar si tenía una silueta corporal similar a la de una embarazada.
Por último, según informa el diario The Wall Street Journal, personal aéreo escoltó a la mujer a un baño para que se hiciera la prueba de embarazo .
La aerolínea ha dicho que estas medidas obedecen a “las preocupaciones planteadas por las autoridades en Saipán”, donde el llamado turismo de partos dio como resultado que en 2018 naciera más bebés de turistas que de residentes.
Este territorio del archipiélago de Marianas tiene unos 50,000 habitantes y un estatus similar a la isla de Guam o Puerto Rico, lo que permite obtener la nacionalidad estadounidense por nacimiento de forma automática.
Hong Kong Express Airways además especificó que la prueba de embarazo estaba destinada a “ayudar a garantizar que las leyes de inmigración de Estados Unidos no se vean socavadas”, según el citado diario.
La aerolínea ha suspendido esta práctica y se ha disculpado con los pasajeros afectados, cuyo número e identidad se desconoce.
En enero de 2019, tres personas que operaban negocios multimillonarios de este tipo en el sur de California fueron arrestadas en la mayor investigación criminal federal hasta la fecha.
Las empresas entrenaron a sus clientes para engañar a los funcionarios de inmigración , pagando tarifas como si fueran personas sin recursos en los hospitales donde nacieron los bebés a pesar de que muchos eran ricos, según los investigadores.
Algunas parejas chinas cobraron hasta 100,000 dólares por paquete de turismo de parto, que incluía alojamiento, niñeras y excursiones de compras de lujo.
Las acusaciones en ese caso incluyen fraude de visas, fraude electrónico y robo de identidad , entre otros.
Mark Zito, agente especial de Aduanas en Los Ángeles, dijo al diario The New York Times que los investigadores también hallaron evidencia de actividades similares por parte de rusos (que se centran en el Noreste del país o en el sur de la Florida) y nigerianos (en Texas).
“Estamos tratando de aplacarlo, pero está aumentando”, dijo Zito, “otras naciones han comenzado a aprovecharse de esto”.

Texto completo: Two weeks from now, thousands of pro-life teenagers will converge on the nation's capital to rally in support of the unborn at the 47th annual March for Life.
Unfortunately, many people are uncomfortable with the idea that young people would raise their voices to oppose abortion. The image of young kids standing together with signs that read "Choose Life" and "Abortion Stops a Beating Heart" can be disconcerting when you are used to hearing it's only old white men who want to strip women of the "right to choose."
That's the only explanation I have for what some people did to a young student from Kentucky last year, when he and his classmates from Covington Catholic High attended the March for Life. As a bunch of them waited for their bus, a Native American activist named Nathan Phillips approached banging his drum. Some of the boys reacted chanting their school song while one, Nicholas Sandmann, stood face to face with Phillips. The boy was smiling, although many characterized his expression as a "smirk." The screen shot of that encounter went viral, and was used to attack Sandmann as a bigoted, privileged white boy who was mocking both ethnic minorities and a woman's "right to choose."
Now Sandmann has gotten some vindication via a settlement announced last week with CNN, whom Sandmann sued for defamation - and was just one of many outlets and public figures who took shots at the teen.
One of the most offensive comments was from Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who incorrectly tweeted, "The boys were protesting a woman's right to choose & yelled 'it's not rape if you enjoy it.'" She later deleted the tweet.
Maggie Haberman of the New York Times observed that "there are dozens of students laughing and egging on the behavior. Will be interesting to see if anyone is actually expelled, as officials suggest is possible," creating the false impression that the Catholic high school students were the aggressors.
HBO host Bill Maher called Sandmann a word normally used to describe a man's sexual organ.
The Washington Post came out with an initial story that falsely claimed the Covington Catholic students, some of whom wore MAGA hats, chanted "build that wall" without any audio or video corroboration.
Some of the worst offenders were affiliated with CNN. Bakari Sellers, a regular contributor tweeted: "[Sandmann] is a deplorable. Some ppl can also be punched in the face." Reza Aslan, another personality who also appeared on CNN, picked up the assault theme by tweeting: "Honest question. Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid's?" (He reportedly only deleted that tweet this past week.) Conservative commentator S.E. Cupp, who hosts a CNN show called Unfiltered, tweeted: "Teens in MAGA gear mock a Native American Vietnam vet." She later walked that back and apologized, but the damage was done.
Because of the overwrought, under-researched comments from many in the public eye, Sandmann and his family were subjected to months of harassment. His family had to leave their house for a time, they received death threats, and he was told not to come back to school in the days immediately after the incident. Even a Kentucky Catholic diocese initially condemned Sandmann.
In response, his family filed a defamation lawsuit against numerous media outlets including CNN and the Washington Post. CNN settled for an undisclosed amount, and the Post case is ongoing.
As an attorney, I know settlements are not a legal admission of guilt. But as a human being who understands it is natural to defend yourself when you think you are right, I'm convinced CNN believed it would lose where it counts the most: the court of public opinion.
Journalists can be heard wailing these days about assaults on the press. I think it is important, though, to examine those cases where they themselves are the assailants. This is one.
Based on incomplete facts and in a desire to get the story out as quickly as possible, some very powerful media outlets defamed a young boy, and created an environment where he was threatened. I am convinced this was, in large part, because he was a young white man with pro-life beliefs.
Sandmann: 1, CNN: (lots of) 0s.

Elizabeth Warren says Bernie Sanders told her a woman couldn't win the presidency

Texto completo: DES MOINES — Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday said that Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive and a longtime liberal ally, told her during a private meeting in 2018 that he believed a woman could not win the presidency.
“Among the topics that came up was what would happen if Democrats nominated a female candidate," Warren said in a statement. “I thought a woman could win; he disagreed."
The allegations about Sanders' comments during the meeting, which were first reported by CNN on Monday morning, ruptured the already-strained detente between the two Democrats and brought questions about sexism and politics to the fore a day ahead of the final presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses.
Sanders described the report as “ludicrous" earlier Monday and his aides called it a “lie," setting the stage for a clash when the two senators take the stage with four other candidates here on Tuesday night.
In his statement to CNN, Sanders said that the issue of sexism and politics had come up when the two met privately to discuss their deliberations about running for president in a meeting in Warren's apartment in Washington in late 2018.
“What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could," Sanders told CNN in a statement. “Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016."
The day's developments amounted to a bizarre twist at a crucial moment in the campaign, and left progressives deeply worried the fight between Warren and Sanders would hurt them both in a tight presidential primary.
Warren had no public events on Monday, and her campaign hunkered down for most of the day, ignoring calls and e-mails from reporters as the story rocketed around the Internet. Reached by phone in the early evening, her campaign manager, Roger Lau, did not offer a comment.
But after the CNN report, Sanders' aides moved quickly to tamp the story down.
“I don't believe Elizabeth Warren has commented on it or said it directly, it is because it is a lie," Faiz Shakir, Sanders' campaign manager, told reporters Monday , before Warren's statement. “Everyone's coming at us right now. Come at us, that's fine. But don't spread lies about Bernie Sanders."
Sanders supporters shared two videos on social media of him from the late 1980s supporting the idea of a woman president. “One of the very important things that I hope that all the girls in this class understand is that you just as much as the boys have a right to become president," he told an elementary school class in 1987. A year later on C-SPAN , Sanders said, “In my view a woman could be elected president of the United States."
Finally, Warren released an evening statement confirming the report, but emphasizing she wanted to move on to other topics.
“I have no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry," Warren said in her statement. “I'm in this race to talk about what's broken in this country and how to fix it — and that's what I'm going to continue to do. I know Bernie is in the race for the same reason."
The two candidates' defacto non-aggression pact snapped Sunday after Politico reported Sanders' volunteers were given a script directing them to persuade Warren supporters to abandon her by claiming she attracted only “affluent" voters. Warren shot back, telling reporters after a town hall in Iowa she was “disappointed" in Sanders for telling volunteers to “trash" her.
Then Warren aimed a dig of her own back at Sanders, suggesting he does not work hard enough to appeal to a broad swath of Democrats. “We cannot nominate someone who takes big chunks of the Democratic coalition for granted," she said. “We need someone who would bring our party together."
Speaking to reporters in Iowa City, Sanders did not dispute the authenticity of the script but downplayed its significance and suggested he had nothing to do with it.
“No one is gonna trash Elizabeth Warren," Sanders said. “We have hundreds of employees. Elizabeth Warren has hundreds of employees. People sometimes say things that they shouldn't."
The heightened tensions — after nearly a year of avoiding attacks on each other — come after a Des Moines Register poll showed Sanders leading the Iowa caucuses, with Warren close behind him. Warren's Iowa organization is rated by local experts as the strongest, but the poll showed Sanders' supporters as the most committed to him compared to his rivals' backers. The squabble between the two progressives could boost former vice president Joe Biden or former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who are also polling in the top four in the crucial state.
“Their non-aggression pact has lasted a very long time, but he broke it," said Boston-based Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh. “It's a risk because it could be mutually assured destruction."
But Marsh added that the dust-up could hurt Sanders among female voters, who have helped power Democratic victories post-Trump. “Women are driving politics, and anyone who doesn't understand that is going to get run over by them," she said.
Despite those victories by women candidates in the 2018 midterms, some Democratic voters have fretted over whether a female candidate would be at a disadvantage against President Trump — a dynamic that has created a double standard in the Democratic primary and forced women candidates to work harder to prove they are “electable."
Speaking earlier this month, Vice President Joe Biden noted the role of sexism in the 2016 campaign, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton, and said “That's not going to happen with me," according to the New York Times. An aide said he was not trying to suggest he was more electable than a woman.
The leaders of the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which backs Warren, urged the two progressives to deescalate with each other.
“We also believe that a back-and-forth about this private meeting is counter-productive for progressives," the group's cofounders said in a statement. “In this pivotal moment of the campaign, progressives must work together to defeat Donald Trump and prevent a less-electable establishment candidate like Joe Biden from getting the nomination."
And Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the liberal group Democracy for America, warned that a failure of the two to work together “can cost us the election."
“This fire was started," Chamberlain said, but “it can be put out by leadership by example from the top."

Australia's fires cannot be linked to just any individual emissions policy: Other views

Resumen: What Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and others are saying about the wildfires and climate change.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Australia%27s+fires+cannot+be+linked+to+just+any+individual+emissions+policy%3A+Other+views&amp;author=&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2020-01-13&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, 7. 30 on ABC: “Of course, global changes in the environment and the climate have a broader impact on the world’s weather systems. What we’ve always said, though, is you cannot link any individual single emissions reduction policy of a country — whether it’s Australia or anyone else — to any specific fire event. I mean, that’s just absurd. And to suggest that that is the case would be simply wrong. It is, and always has been, the policy of our government to understand the need to take action on climate change and the impact that has on the world’s broader weather systems. ”
Jennifer Mills, The Washington Post: “Australians see ourselves as tough characters who take care of each other in a crisis. . . . In rural areas, volunteer firefighters give up days and nights to respond to incidents as they arise. We do this because someone has to. When we rise to challenges such as this one, we expect something similar from our leaders. . . . Months into the crisis, defense force reserves are finally being deployed to provide much-needed logistical support. . . . But Morrison still must answer for all the delays, for failing to communicate with rural fire services and for his government’s continued advocacy of fossil fuels. ”
Patrick Michaels and Myron Ebell, Washington Examiner: "Alarmists have been quick to blame climate change for the recent, horrific fires in Australia and California. Although human actions do bear a large share of the blame for the scale of this ongoing tragedy, the cause is primarily bad management policies, not dreaded climate change. Governmental decisions, made under pressure from environmental groups, have made what would normally be big fires into hellish conflagrations. The similarities between Australian and Californian politics, vegetation and climate have always been striking. Both places are drop-dead beautiful, far left and politically green. In both places, people like living around vegetation that every year dries out enough to burn sky high — with or without climate change. "
OUR VIEW: Australia's fires provide a scorching warning on climate change
Deseret News of Salt Lake City, Editorial Board: “Utahns should pay considerable attention to the wildfires in Australia. . . . In some parts of the state, the snowpack decreased almost 80% between 1955 and 2013. Because of this, forests are more susceptible to diseases and pests, which helps wildfires to become more frequent and destructive. ”
John D. Sutter, CNN: "What's that worn-out phrase? Shouting into the wind? Well, after a decade of rising pollution, failed politics and worsening disasters, it seems the many, many of us who care about the climate crisis increasingly are shouting into the hurricane, if not the apocalypse. "
Margaret Renkl, The New York Times: “If 2019 is truly ‘the year we woke up to climate change,’ then 2020 should be the year we start actually doing something about it. Because we are very nearly out of time. Listen, I know: Dryer balls won’t save the world. Saving the world — and by extension the human race — will take a level of political will the likes of which we have not seen before and which we will categorically never see from this administration. Which makes it all the more crucial to do our part, however small. ”
Matthew A. Winkler, Bloomberg: "The American companies most reliant on embracing green technology are outperforming every broad measure of the stock market, delivering a greater return last year than all but two (Russia and Greece) of the world’s 94 leading equity indexes. These are the 92 publicly traded firms with at least 10% of their revenues derived from clean energy, energy efficiency or clean technology, according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. They're proving that the threat of climate change is also an investor's opportunity. "

Texto completo: BOSTON — A prominent Harvard University law professor sued the New York Times on Monday, accusing the newspaper of defamation for the headline and lede of a story related to donations from sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court, an attorney for Lawrence Lessig — a law professor, legal scholar and activist — contends the Times published a "sensationalized, false and defamatory 'clickbait' headline and lede" that was the "direct opposite" of his position.
At issue is a Sept. 14 Times story with the headline, "A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein’s Money, Do It in Secret. " The first sentence reads, "It is hard to defend soliciting donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law professor, has been trying. "
The lawsuit says the Times story was met with "mass outrage in Cambridge and Somerville, in Lessig's nationwide social media following, by countless victims of sexual assault, and in the infinite depths of the 'Twittersphere. ' Within hours, Lessig became associated with the notoriety surrounding the Epstein scandal, and the community that quietly or silently tolerated such monstrosity. "
Danielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of communications for the New York Times, said the newspaper defended the story's accuracy and will fight the claim.
"When Professor Lessig contacted The Times to complain about the story, senior editors reviewed his complaint and were satisfied that the story accurately reflected his statements. We plan to defend against the claim vigorously. "
The Times article was based on comments Lessig made a week earlier in a 3,500-word online essay on the website Medium, and subsequent interviews with a Times reporter, about his take on donations a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, Joi Ito, took from Epstein to benefit MIT's Media Lab.
In his essay, Lessig explained why he signed a petition expressing support for Ito, who resigned as director of the MIT Lab in September when it was revealed by the New Yorker he took $525,000 in donations from Epstein that he marked as anonymous. The donations came to light after Epstein, a wealthy financier, died in federal prison in August while awaiting new federal sex trafficking charges.
Lessig wrote at the time, "Everyone seems to treat it as if the anonymity and secrecy around Epstein’s gift are a measure of some kind of moral failing. I see it as exactly the opposite. IF you are going to take (this) money, then you should only take it anonymously. "
But the lawsuit argues that Lessig did not say he supports universities accepting money from donors like Epstein — and in fact repeatedly said doing so was "a mistake" — but believes they should at minimum take the money anonymously to avoid laundering the reputation of donors. In the same essay, Lessig wrote, "I believe it was a mistake to take this money, even if anonymous. "
The lawsuit says Lessig asked the Times to edit the headline and lede after the story was published but the newspaper did not.
Lessig wrote that he chose to defend Ito because his friend was being "scapegoated" when MIT deserved to be held accountable.
In an addendum Lessig tacked on to his original essay before the Times story published, he reiterated that "if" a great university takes contributions from criminals like Epstein then they should be anonymous.
"That conditional has been heard by some to mean I support the idea of a great university taking (contributions from people like Epstein. ) I do not," the addendum read. "I believe a great university should say, absolutely, it won’t take money from criminals. "

Chief of Online Luggage Seller Away Reverses Course on Resignation; Steph Korey apologized last month for her behavior at the startup and said she would step down

Texto completo: A month after she said she would step down as chief executive of online luggage seller Away, Steph Korey now says she is keeping her job.
Ms. Korey, who resigned in December after an article in the Verge criticized her management style as harsh, said she and her presumptive successor will be co-CEOs of the New York-based startup. She was previously going to become executive chairman.
In a message Monday to employees that was provided by Away, Ms. Korey, who is in her early 30s, said the initial decision to reshuffle the leadership ranks was an attempt to protect the company after the article "unleashed a social media mob." She told the New York Times it was a mistake to "let some inaccurate reporting influence the timeline of a transition plan that we had."
The episode highlights the rising power of employees to put pressure on leaders whose behavior they don't like, and the potential perils for companies that respond quickly and forcefully to the criticism and ensuing backlash.
"There is that pressure to do something, but doing something doesn't always have to be making a final decision," said Erik Bernstein, the president of Bernstein Crisis Management. "You can buy yourself some time and just acknowledge the issue and avoid this sort of embarrassing and damaging back and forth."
Away is a fast-growing startup that has touted its transparent workplace, where most employee communications were public on the Slack messaging application, according to the Verge article. The company said it employs about 500 people.
The Verge article included accusations that Ms. Korey regularly criticized employees in public channels. It also said the company sought to stifle private communication between employees, forbidding them from sending emails to each other.
The article elicited strong criticism of Ms. Korey on social media, including calls for her firing.
After it was published, Ms. Korey apologized in a Dec. 6 statement shared on Twitter , calling her behavior "wrong, plain and simple." She also said she was working with an executive coach to "improve as a leader."
Away is demanding unspecified corrections and retractions to the Verge article, Ms. Korey wrote in Monday's message to employees. The Verge didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Verge told the New York Times it stands by its reporting.
Away already had recruited Stuart Haselden from Lululemon Athletica Inc. before the Verge article was published. The company sped up its plans as the reaction intensified, saying last month that Mr. Haselden would become CEO, and Ms. Korey would shift into an executive chairman role, effective Jan. 13.
Ms. Korey will now share the top role with Mr. Haselden, Lululemon's former operating chief, but their responsibilities would follow the original plan, she said Monday.
"This is the exact working arrangement Stuart, Jen, and I had envisioned when we announced he was joining, but the shift in titles will hopefully add more clarity," she said in the message, referring to Away co-founder Jen Rubio, who is president and chief brand officer.
She said the initial executive changes were misinterpreted as her exiting the company. "So, let me clear that up: I am not leaving the company," she wrote.
Ms. Korey and Ms. Rubio, both alumni of eyewear seller Warby Parker, co-founded Away in 2015. Last May, investors valued the company at $1.4 billion .
Ms. Korey's decision to stay in her role was reported earlier by the New York Times.

Texto completo: "40-years-old is too soon. ... He just started his dream, from nothing. His dream was
on the climb toward even bigger success – the sky was the limit at this point. He
already achieved so much." Alex Hemeryckx, Owner of Brussel's Cafe
Nathan Miller, owner of Nathan Miller Chocolate, had been making his award-winning treats in Chambersburg since 2013.
Miller died on Jan. 4 after a three year battle with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, despite having received a live liver transplant from his uncle, Douglas Walter, according to his obituary.
Following his passing, it's become clear just how deep of an impact he's had on the downtown business community.
Alex Hemeryckx, owner of Brussel's Cafe, said Miller's friendship was something he'll deeply miss.
"Nathan was kind of a guide to us for Franklin County, saying 'welcome to Franklin, welcome to downtown Chambersburg, where we are all going do great things for the community,' he said.
Hemeryckx and Miller bonded over the European baking experience - Hemeryckx is from Belgium and Miller studied under a pastry chef in Germany.
"I respect everyone equally, but my respect for Nathan was over the top, simply because he was the real deal," he said. "If somebody is going to put their heart and soul into their product, that was Nathan."
It's going to be hard not having Nathan around anymore, Hemeryckx said. Both men understood just how difficult it is to make chocolate.
"The guy got his own beans and was making his own chocolate and I know all too well what it's like to work with chocolate every day," Hemeryckx said. "It is extremely difficult. It's not a job anymore, it has to be an art and a passion because, without any of those two, the whole process will swallow you."
But Nathan wasn't swallowed up - he thrived - according to Daniela Crawford, an assistant chef at Falafel Shack who used to work at Nathan Miller Chocolate.
"He was always making up new combinations," she said. "The level of inspiration and spark were incredible. I loved working with him because of that."
Hemeryckx and Crawford can both attest to Nathan's dedication.
"He was so hard-working," Crawford said. "He would always be there before I got there in the morning and still be there after everyone left at night, long after cafe hours."
It wasn't just his skill that Nathan's fellow business owners respected, but his kindness and generosity as well, according to Gearhouse Brewing Vice President Erin Kozloski.
"During our planning phase, Nate showed up with 36 pounds of chocolate he'd over-roasted, so it was still perfectly good, but darker than he wanted," she said. "He gave it to our head brewer, David, who used that batch to develop our Nathan Miller Chocolate Porter. Nate then took some of that beer and made a chocolate bar with it."
Kozloski said Miller and his talent will be sorely missed by those who knew and worked with him.
"Nate was soft-spoken, deeply kind-hearted and wholly dedicated to his craft and our community," she said. "He was funny, friendly, and open, and we will miss him."
Amer Chaudhry, owner of Falafel Shack, was lucky enough to have experienced that kindness from Miller as well.
"Our experience with him was very encouraging from day one," Chaudhry said.
Miller's shop was the first place in town to sell Falafel's hummus. Falafel started out as a staple at the Farmer's Market. Without access to an ice machine, Chaudhry would have to buy ice every week, until a small act of kindness from Miller.
"He told us to get as much ice we needed from his chocolate place," he said. "Every Saturday, we would be there with our coolers and even though they were busy, they would always fill our coolers. That was so generous, helping somebody out like that."
Miller's absence has already been felt by the Chambersburg community. Miller won't just be missed locally, as his talent gave him the opportunity to be featured in the New York Times and in magazines and blogs such as Real Simple and Vogue, according to his obituary.
Many say his life - and passion - was cut short. His willingness to support the businesses around him will be missed nearly as much as his chocolates and pastries.
"40-years-old is too soon," Hemeryckx said. "He just started his dream, from nothing. His dream was on the climb toward even bigger success - the sky was the limit at this point. He already achieved so much."

Fighting the fight against climate change

Texto completo: The daughter of a school teacher, she came of age before Doppler radar, 10-day weather forecasts, and sophisticated orbiting satellites capable of detecting hurricanes as they form off of Africa and take deadly aim at our Atlantic coast.
As a little girl growing up in Canton she had a favorite TV weatherman: Don Kent, the longtime WBZ-TV forecaster who informed generations of New Englanders about gathering autumn storms, warm summer sunshine, and the icy winds of winter.
And recently, as meteorologists from around the country assembled in Boston for their annual convention, Gina McCarthy took center stage, carrying an even darker forecast than those of epic storms like the Blizzard of '78, which she keenly remembers.
It's nothing less than an urgent bulletin.
Our planet is warming. It's not an opinion. It's real.
And the consequences are more dire than canceled school classes or thousands of cars stranded on highways from Marshfield to Marblehead.
“The big deal is that global warming is changing the entire system of the way energy is distributed in the planet," McCarthy told me the other day at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where she is a professor.
“Our climate is temperate. It's not going to be anymore. The climate isn't tomorrow. Or five years from now. The climate is forever. It's a system of change over 30 to 40 years. So you are literally going to see places that flourish as farmlands today that will be deserts tomorrow. This is an entire shift in how the globe's going to look if we don't do something about it."
Gina McCarthy intends to do something about it.
And those who know her track record — her long and well-earned reputation for no-nonsense, plain-spoken advocacy, her tenacity in the face of nay-sayers or climate-change deniers — say she is a formidable weather system all her own.
Inexorable. Relentless. Blunt.
“Gina is a rock star," said Jenni L. Evans, president of the American Meteorological Society. “We see climate change. It's there. She will talk about how to think about it. How do we give people a sense of self-determination and not a sense that they should slit their wrists?"
There is nothing academic or hypothetical about this. Evans grew up in Australia, parts of which have been blackened by historic wildfires.
Last year, record temperatures were broken in France and Germany. Greenland's ice sheet saw historic melting. Average global temperatures were the second highest on record, less than one-tenth of a degree cooler than 2016.
So Evans knows what hangs in the balance.
And so does McCarthy, who has made this work the centerpiece of her professional life.
As a young woman, she was the health agent for Canton's Board of Health. Governor Michael Dukakis named her to a hazardous waste facility site safety council. After that, she served four Republican governors in Massachusetts and one in Connecticut, Jodi Rell.
In March 2013, President Obama nominated McCarthy as the nation's 13th administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, which she led until 2017, becoming the chief architect of Obama's plan to combat climate change.
And now, the Natural Resources Defense Council has named McCarthy as its president and chief executive, calling her one of the most effective environmental champions of the modern era.
The challenges, particularly in the age of Donald Trump, are daunting.
According to a recent New York Times analysis, Trump has rolled back more than 90 environmental rules and regulations, raising the prospects for a significant increase in greenhouse gases. That means dirtier air. It means weaker auto pollution standards. It means looser rules governing toxic industrial emissions.
“We haven't reached the point of no return, but we don't have as much time as we thought we had," said Mitch Bernard, NRDC's chief counsel. “The next 10 years will be critical in terms of trying to avert the most severe catastrophes from the changing climate.
“Gina is going to try to mobilize the energy and enthusiasm that is out there, especially among young people, for appropriate and vigorous action on climate. Climate change is not out there on the horizon. It's creating misery and huge health problems."
Still, amid all those storm clouds, McCarthy finds a way to be optimistic. For one thing, she's shut off the endless cable TV chatter, a limitless electronic feedback loop of bad news, an echo chamber that serves only to reinforce embedded political views on the right and the left.
And then she looks for silver linings.
“The environment has had tremendous improvement," said McCarthy, who, at age 65, is old enough to remember wiping oily residue off her legs after taking a dip in a polluted Boston Harbor. “But it didn't improve by people saying, 'We can't do it.' It improved by saying, 'OK, we've got to do it.' That's my attitude. I'm not going to give up. I'm not going to claim defeat.
“I'm not going to focus on President Trump and his nonsense, which I know I can't fix right now. We can fight it. And one of the reasons to go to NRDC is because that's what they do. They fight it every day so we can get into the courts. And in most cases, we're winning."
During the Trump presidency, the NRDC has sued the federal government 96 times, fighting his administration on issues ranging from efficiency standards for lightbulbs to endangered species. Its track record? The NRDC says it has emerged victorious in 54 of the 59 cases so far resolved.
“Those are pretty good odds," McCarthy told me. “I'm optimistic because they don't govern well. So even on the stuff they're rolling back in the courts they think they've stacked, we can win."
What does McCarthy want? More electric cars and buses. Energy efficient lightbulbs and toilets. More trees and playgrounds. Public transportation systems that work. Farms that don't contaminate drinking water supplies.
“I need people to be motivated to act," she said. “Not to be hiding out in their closets."
There are no closets in her future. No sandy beaches either.
Retirement, she told me, will have to wait.
“I can't let it go," she said. “How do I do that? I don't just have three kids, I have two grandchildren. And I listen to the young people now. And they're all debating, and many of them deciding not to have children. That breaks my heart. They don't see a future."
From across the table, she shook her head slowly and sadly. And then, with resolve, added this:
“So somehow the energy they're generating needs to be channeled into something more meaningful than giving up. I just think we have to figure out where the positive energy is. It's out there. We've got to nurture that and at some point you're going to see people who, like this president, prey on people's most negative thoughts and amplify those as if that's a path to the future.
“And I'm not going to buy that. And I'm never going to buy that. And I'm never going to stop fighting it."
And then, with all those forecasters calling for unusually warm January weather, Gina McCarthy left for her next appointment.
And her next fight.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump said U.S. troops in Iraq had not been harmed by Iranian missile strikes launched in retaliation for a U.S. airstrike that killed one of Iran’s top military leaders, Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
“Our great American forces are prepared for anything,” Trump said in a White House address Jan. 8. “Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world.”
He also made a number of statements about Soleimani and U.S. relations with Iran. Here’s a roundup of key claims, fact-checked and with additional context.
Iran was “given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash.”
This is partially accurate. The $150 billion is an exaggerated number that refers to Iranian assets freed under the 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The assets had been frozen under sanctions. The $150 billion is the highest and least-sourced estimate we’ve found of the freed assets; other estimates vary from $25 billion to $56 billion.
It’s important to note that this money was Iran’s to begin with, not a payment given to it by any government, and little of that money was under the control of the United States or any U.S. bank. Most of those funds were in central and commercial banks overseas.
The “$1.8 billion in cash” refers to an amount that U.S. and Iranian negotiators settled on to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran that predated the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Iran had paid the United States for military equipment, but the United States never delivered the weapons.
The United States sent Iran the money in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies.
“Instead of saying thank you to the United States, they chanted ‘death to America.’ In fact, they chanted ‘death to America’ the day the agreement was signed.”
This probably happened around the time the deal was signed — and it would have been routine for Iran, where government-sanctioned Friday prayers sometimes include chants of “death to America,” as we’ve noted several times before.
Experts have told us the chant is a revolutionary slogan that amounts to “political theater.” In 2015, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the chant “means death to the U.S.’s policies, death to arrogance,” as opposed to “death to the American nation,” per the Guardian.
The Iran deal was signed in 2015 by Iran, the United States, China, Russia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, with assistance from the European Union. The New York Times reported that there were “death to America” demonstrations days before the deal was signed.
“The very defective (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) expires shortly anyway and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.”
This is False.
The Iran deal put a cap on enriched uranium that would have lasted until 2030, at which point other agreements would have continued to limit Iran’s nuclear development.
Some of the deal’s restrictions would have eased beginning in 2025, but the key elements that prevented Iran from enriching the levels of uranium needed to make a bomb would have remained in effect until 2030.
Other terms would have lasted forever, including the prohibition on manufacturing a nuclear weapon and a provision requiring compliance with oversight from international inspectors.
“We are now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.”
The United States is the world’s top producer of oil and natural gas. But this is not a new feat.
The United States has been the world’s largest oil producer since 2012 and the top natural gas producer for years.
“We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil.”
It’s not accurate to say the United States has stopped relying on the Middle East for oil and other sources of energy. But the country seems to be moving in this direction. When Trump said in September that “we are very energy independent,” we rated his claim Half True.
The United States produced slightly more than it consumed in both fossil fuels and total energy over the first nine months of 2019.
The United States imported some petroleum in 2019 from Persian Gulf countries and countries belonging to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which includes several Middle Eastern nations. But the share of total petroleum imports from both groups has been declining in recent years, with net imports from some Middle Eastern countries also down.

France's pedophile, literary genius

Autor: Goldberg, Jonah.

Texto completo: Gabriel Matzneff is not a good man, but it's taken France a long time to realize it.
Norimitsu Onishi of The New York Times reported an astonishing story this week. It begins:
"The French writer Gabriel Matzneff never hid the fact that he engaged in sex with girls and boys in their early teens or even younger. He wrote countless books detailing his insatiable pursuits and appeared on television boasting about them. 'Under 16 Years Old,' was the title of an early book that left no ambiguity.
Mr. Matzneff, now 83, spent decades as a French literary darling. His work was supported by leading newspapers and literary publications. He'd appear on highbrow TV shows where he'd regale interviewers and audiences with the sublime pleasures of having sex with children in France and on sex tours of southeast Asia.
His overdue comeuppance is the result of a memoir by one of his victims, Vanessa Springora, who was preyed upon by a then-50-something Mr. Matzneff when she was 14.
"He was not a good man," Ms. Springora writes. "He was in fact what we're taught to dread since childhood: an ogre."
In his book "Under 16 Years Old," Mr. Matzneff writes, "To sleep with a child, it's a holy experience, a baptismal event, a sacred adventure." The book was first published in 1974 but was republished, apparently with no controversy in 2005. In 2013, Mr. Metzneff received a major French literary prize.
How could a country that prides itself on being so enlightened celebrate an ogre? After all, we're not talking about a Jeffrey Epstein, as horrible as he was. The well-connected billionaire spent vast sums to keep his sexual abuses at least somewhat secret. Mr. Matzneff not only confessed to his crimes, his confessions were celebrated as literary contributions.
The answer stems in part from the fact that Mr. Matzneff was a "Child of '68" - i.e., a product of the left-wing "May 68" movement that shook France in the 1960s. These radicals subscribed to the idea that anything smacking of traditionalism or bourgeois morality was backward. Conventional sexual morality was part of the same rotten edifice as imperialism and racism. True liberation meant not just freedom from, say, capitalism, but also from the old-fashioned view that sex with kids was wrong. "It's forbidden to forbid" was a rallying cry.
Some argued "for abolishing age-of-consent laws, saying that doing so would liberate children from the domination of their parents and allow them to be full, sexual beings," Mr. Onishi writes.
A few years ago, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the famous former radical and leader of the European Green movement, got in hot water for his earlier writings and statements about "erotic" encounters with 5-year-olds. He dodged major consequences by disavowing his own words, saying they were merely intended to provoke. Mr. Matzneff can't make such claims. His whole identity was invested in the seduction of children and teenagers.
Sociologist Pierre Verdrager, the author of "L'Enfant Interdit," or "Forbidden Child," which chronicled the politics of pedophilia in 1970s France, told Mr. Onishi: "There was an aristocracy of sexuality, an elite that was united in putting forth new attitudes and behavior toward sex. And they were also grounded in an extreme prejudice toward ordinary people, whom they regarded as idiots and fools."
America, so backwardly bourgeois in the eyes of these aristocrats, doesn't have France's problems, but it is hardly immune to such dynamics. Director Roman Polanski, who fled America rather than face sentencing for statutory rape, is routinely defended by Hollywood royalty in part because of a similar aristocratic attitude.
Mr. Matzneff is a good example of what can happen when people who share a self-styled radical worldview capture the commanding heights of the culture and consider themselves above the rubes from whom they make their money.
There's a reason Ricky Gervais struck such a chord at the Golden Globes on Sunday when he told the assembled Hollywood royalty to get over themselves.
"If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech," Mr. Gervais said. "You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg."
This should be a cautionary tale for all cultural aristocrats. Not all radical fads hold up well over time. Perhaps in 50 years, a memoir from someone who as a child was subjected to hormone blockers to change his or her gender will provoke similar retroactive outrage.

Cancer death rates show a record drop, and Americans who quit smoking get the credit

Texto completo: Cancer remains a dreaded diagnosis, but there's heartening news. America is showing great progress against some of the most deadly forms of the disease, particularly lung cancer and the aggressive skin cancer melanoma.
Researchers have reported the largest-ever one-year decline in the U.S. cancer death rate, a drop of 2.2% between 2016 and 2017, according to the American Cancer Society. The rate has fallen resoundingly -- nearly 30% -- from 1991 to 2017, affecting nearly 3 million lives. Anyone who lost a loved one to cancer in that quarter-century can applaud this progress.
What drove the improvement? Both personal choices and medical advances contributed, researchers say. Lung cancer is by far the biggest killer of the cancers, and smoking -- which is also implicated in other types of cancer -- has been declining for decades. There are powerful new ways to diagnose and treat lung cancer, and even patients with advanced disease are living longer. "It's an exciting time," Dr. Jyoti Patel, a Northwestern University lung cancer expert, told The Associated Press.
Skin cancer death rates dropped even more dramatically, falling 7% annually in recent years, thanks to improved drug treatments, the report said.
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, behind heart disease. It still claims too many lives and strikes at our hearts in personal or public life. (We're rooting for you, Rep. John Lewis and "Jeopardy" host Alex Trebek.) While treatments have improved, in many cases their toll on patients remains too harsh.
The report came with some cautions: Death rates have increased for some cancers linked to obesity, including those of the thyroid, pancreas and uterus, The New York Times reports. Declines in death rates from prostate, breast and colon cancer are slowing, though that follows massive drops of 40% to more than 50%. There are geographic and racial disparities in death rates.
On the positive side, the decline in smoking cigarettes, not-that-affectionately known as cancer sticks, should continue to pay off for years to come. The HPV vaccine will continue its march against cervical cancer. Immunotherapy shows great promise.
And researchers keep chasing innovations in treatment. The Wall Street Journal reports on an approach harnessing ideas from evolution and -- stay with us here -- pest control. The approach aims to reduce tumors by just 25% to 50% and make the cancer manageable and leave some in place, but without empowering the bad cells that manage to survive. It's a philosophy similar to that used in exterminating bugs. "I think pest managers are about 30 years ahead of the oncologists," Carlo Maley, an evolutionary cancer biologist, told the Journal.
Cancer is complicated, and the solutions are too. Bad habits, pollution and complex risk factors like obesity won't just go away. But this record year of improvements shows that better choices and investment in more effective -- and less destructive -- ways to diagnose and heal are making a dent. Wouldn't it be nice to see The Big C downgraded from nemesis to nuisance?

Bloomberg open to spending $1B in bid to defeat Trump

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg did not rule out spending a billion dollars of his own money on the 2020 presidential race, even if he does not win the Democratic nomination, and said he would mobilize his well-financed political operation to help Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren win in November if either is the party nominee, despite their sharp policy differences.
Bloomberg's plans would effectively create a shadow campaign operation for the general election, complete with hundreds of organizers in key battleground states and a robust digital operation, ready to be inherited by the party nominee -- regardless of who that nominee may be.
Bloomberg has spent more than $200 million on advertising, putting him on pace to spend by early March about the same as what President Barack Obama's campaign spent on advertising over the course of the entire 2012 general election. If Bloomberg fails to win the nomination, future spending would be redirected toward attacking Trump.
"It depends whether the candidate needs help; if they're doing very well, they need less. If they're not, they'll need more," Bloomberg said Saturday during a campaign swing through Texas.
While he did not rule out dropping $1 billion on his effort, the former mayor of New York City blanched slightly at the size of the number, before mentioning the $2.8 billion he spent on charitable contributions last year, with the bulk going to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University.
"You know how much money a billion dollars is?" said Bloomberg. "It's a lot of money to me. It's a lot of money to anybody."
His extraordinary wealth, estimated at more than $50 billion, has drawn a series of attacks from the liberal candidates in the field, who argue he is essentially trying to purchase the party nomination.
Bloomberg said he would mobilize his operation behind any of the Democratic candidates, even Warren, the Massachusetts senator, or Sanders, the Vermont senator. Bloomberg said he did not plan on running negative ads against any Democratic candidate, even those he strongly disagreed with.
"I really don't agree with them," he said, of Sanders and Warren, "but I'd still support them, yes, because compared to Donald Trump, that's easy."
While most of the candidates are spending the bulk of their time in the first four primary states, Bloomberg is orienting his operation toward the Super Tuesday primaries in states like Texas on March 3, when about 40% of all the delegates are at stake.
With recent polling showing four candidates -- Sanders, Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana -- all in a position to win both Iowa and New Hampshire, Bloomberg could play an influential role in the primary process, once the race moves past the early contests. His aides have indicated that Bloomberg is not inclined to keep pouring money into an extended contest with Biden and would instead reorient his campaign into an organization dedicated to battering Trump, should the former vice president emerge as the leader in the race.
His spending, entirely self-funded, has meant that though Bloomberg meets the polling requirement for the party debates, he does not meet the donor qualifications for participating.
As he campaigned across Texas, Bloomberg cast that decision as a strength, illustrating his independence from financial interests.
Yet he also criticized the party's process, echoing concerns leveled by other candidates who say the rules set by the Democratic National Committee are excluding qualified contenders. Bloomberg will not appear on the debate stage Tuesday, when the candidates meet in Des Moines for their final faceoff before the Iowa caucuses.
"I think (New Jersey Sen.) Cory Booker's got a good complaint. If I wanted to complain, I could make a good case that it wasn't fair," he said. "In the meantime, while they're debating, I'm out visiting a whole lot of people. I'm not wasting the time."

Texto completo: Mamie Lang Kirkland died last month at her home in upstate New York. She was the mother of nine, the matriarch of another 158, a longtime saleswoman for Avon Products, and, at the time of her death, at 111, the oldest resident of Buffalo.
That only begins to describe Kirkland.
She was also the embodiment of the African American experience of the 20th century, her life's long journey altered repeatedly by the racial violence and bigotry coursing through the United States. Lynchings, riots, the Ku Klux Klan -- she survived it all, and spent her centenarian years working to ensure that these realities never slipped from collective memory.
Her life helped inspire the creation, in 2018, of the Legacy Museum and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, in Montgomery, Alabama. Both document the country's history of racial terrorism and encourage social justice.
Kirkland figures in two of the exhibits, said Sia Sanneh, a senior attorney with the Equal Justice Initiative, the nonprofit that started the memorials. "Her life was such an inspiration to us," Sanneh said. "It embodied all those things."
Mamie Lang was born on Sept. 3, 1908, in the rural Mississippi town of Ellisville, the daughter of Edward Lang, a laborer and fledgling minister, and Rochelle (Moore) Lang, who minded the family's rented home. Kirkland would remember the large peach tree in the yard, and the strange brew concocted by her grandmother that saved her from a typhomalarial fever when she was near death at age 5.
When she was about 7, her father awakened the family to announce that it was time to leave -- some local white men were preparing to lynch him and his friend, John Hartfield. The two men slipped out of town that night; Rochelle and the five Lang children, including a nursing baby, escaped by train in the morning.
The family friend, Hartfield, eventually returned to Ellisville, and in the summer of 1919 he was accused of raping a white woman. Some townspeople set a date for his lynching, a public event that the governor of Mississippi claimed he was powerless to prevent. At an appointed time announced in The Jackson Daily News, crowds gathered near a large gum tree beside the train tracks. There Hartfield was strung up and hanged, after which his body was riddled with bullets and burned. Body parts became souvenirs.
"Could have been my father," Kirkland said in an interview with The New York Times in 2015.
Though the Lang family had fled to East St. Louis, Illinois, they still could not outrun the racist violence. In 1917, white men responded to the pressures of changing demographics and job competition by rioting in black neighborhoods, burning down homes and shooting residents. Dozens died, thousands were left homeless, and 9-year-old Mamie was seared by the memory of seeing a deaf man shot dead because he could not hear an order to halt.
The family moved again, this time to Alliance, Ohio, reflecting another aspect of the black experience: the Great Migration of the last century, when 6 million African Americans left the rural South for the urban Northeast and Midwest -- some seeking economic opportunity, others hoping to escape racial terrorism.
Sometimes it followed them north.
In Alliance, in the 1920s, members of the Ku Klux Klan -- whose rallies were casually announced in the local press -- came to the family's home, hoods donned and torches afire, to burn a cross on their lawn. The Langs always wondered what would have happened if armed white neighbors hadn't arrived to chase away the aggressors.
At 15, Mamie married an itinerant railroad worker named Albert Kirkland, and the couple moved to Buffalo. He found work as a grinder at the Pratt & Letchworth plant; she gave birth to nine children, six of whom reached adulthood, and immersed herself in the First Shiloh Baptist Church, of which she was a foundational member.
After her husband died in 1959, Kirkland worked as a domestic helper and baby sitter before becoming a door-to-door saleswoman for Avon. She never learned to drive, and often attributed her longevity to her faith and those many years walking the Buffalo streets. She was still taking orders until a few weeks before her death on Dec. 28, according to her son Tarabu Betserai Kirkland.
Tarabu Kirkland, her youngest child at 70, said that his mother's experience with Avon helped her to shed her shyness and embrace her ability to connect with people. Over time, he said, she became a kind of door-to-door life coach.
But there was one place that Kirkland refused to visit: the state of her birth, where the terror of racism had scarred her childhood. She often said that she didn't even want to see Mississippi on a map.
Her son had been nudging her to tell her life's powerful story, and in 2015 he showed her a report by the Equal Justice Initiative called "Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror." It included an image of an old newspaper's headline: "John Hartfield Will Be Lynched By Ellisville Mob at 5 O'Clock This Afternoon."
"We had never seen anything documented about John Hartfield," Tarabu Kirkland said. "For a long time we didn't know if it was fact or fiction. But then she pointed to my laptop and said, 'That's him.' And chills went up my back."
A few months later,. Kirkland returned to Ellisville with her son, who has been working on a documentary film about his mother's journey. It was an emotional visit to a place that seemed to have erased the Hartfield lynching from memory. Kirkland took time to pray at the approximate spot where a mob had killed her father's friend.
"She always maintained this level of grace and forgiveness," Tarabu Kirkland said.
In addition to her son, Kirkland's survivors include her daughters Juanita Hunter, Beatrice Kirkland, Margaret Kirkland and Jeanette Clinton.
In 2016, the Equal Justice Initiative honored Kirkland at a fundraising gala in Manhattan. She and her son worked for weeks on her short speech, in which she planned to say stories like hers needed to be told again and again; that stories like hers were just as important now as they were a century ago; that she should know, because she had been there.
Her speech reflected a resilient optimism; a determination to triumph over tribulation. "I left Mississippi a scared little girl of 7 years old," Kirkland said at the event. "Now I'm 107 -- and I'm not frightened anymore."
Organizers fretted about how their guest would ascend to the stage, and they offered her a wheelchair. She declined, saying that she intended to walk on her own.
And she did.

Texto completo: For half a century Centreville, the oldest surviving town in Wayne County, was also seat of justice. That changed in March of 1873 when a Circuit Court ruled Richmond the new county seat because it was the population center despite the fact Centreville was geographically more centrally located. As soon as the new courthouse was ready in August, county records were removed from the county seat to Richmond. All that remained was to dismantle the Centre Township jailhouse and the iron fence around it, and to transport the materials to Richmond.
Work crews began the task in October, but found the work hampered when unidentified vandals destroyed the equipment.
On Tuesday evening, Oct. 28, seven armed guards from Richmond paced to Centreville to occupy the sheriff's jailhouse residence in order to watch over the contractor's equipment. At around 11 p.m. a mob gathered in front of the jail and began firing pistols and demanding entrance, which the guards refused. Not satisfied, "Centreville ruffians" hauled out Black Betty, a six-pound cannon used to fire salutes on Independence Day. After filling it with iron scraps, nails and bolts, they aimed squarely at the jail. Two canon blasts erupted. The door of the jail was blown from its hinges. The face of the jail was marred with brick chunks blasted away.
The Richmond deputies retreated further into the recess of the jail, where they remained until about 4 a.m. when they were forced to surrender.
The guards were unceremoniously marched to the edge of town and ordered to "git" back to Richmond.
The "conflagration" made the front page of The New York Times, and the scars of the encounter are still visible on the front of the old sheriff's residence, which is now the Centerville and Center Township Public Library.
Over the front door are the holes in the wall made by the canon.
Centreville unfortunately had lost its county seat status. According to the Richmond Telegram, the pent-up wrath of the populace in the final moments as materials were loaded into wagons "unraveled and became unsanctified," finding occasional utterances in incessant "groans and damns."
The dispute was over. Yet the former county seat remains preeminent historically.
Centerville residents have fought in all American wars and conflicts. Crown Hill Cemetery is testament to this.
Civil War generals Ambrose E. Burnside and Lew Wallace are biographically tied to Centerville, as is George W. Julian, Wayne County's only vice presidential candidate for the second highest office in the nation.
Six U.S. governors spent their developmental years in Centreville.
James B. Ray, fourth governor of the state of Indiana and the youngest ever to hold the job, was a Wayne County prosecutor in 1819 who practiced law in Centerville from 1837 to 1840. John A. Burbank was born in Centerville in 1827 and later became Governor of the Dakota Territory. Joseph H. Kibbey was born in Centerville on March 4, 1853, and became the 16th Territorial Governor of Arizona. Whitewater native Ambrose E. Burnside came to Centerville about 1840 and worked as an assistant in a tailor shop; he later became a Union General in the Civil War and governor of Rhode Island. Lew Wallace was born in the upper Whitewater Valley in 1827 and attended Centerville's Whitewater Seminary. He credited Centerville teacher Samuel K. Hoshour with instilling in him an ability to write, which served him well when he penned 'Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ' as governor of New Mexico Territory from 1878 to 1881.
Governor Oliver P. Morton was born in Salisbury on August 4, 1823. He practiced law in Centerville and was Indiana's famous Civil War governor.
Morton led Indiana during the Civil War with no tax support for two years, which is unprecedented. Early on he raised men in arms and hundreds of thousands of dollars through loans and donations on his good name. President Lincoln said, "Had it not been for Governor Morton sending money and men to the front when most needed, the war probably would have been lost by the North."
Morton's home in Centerville still exists.
The greatest athlete in Wayne County history was born in Centerville. A rambunctious little colt foaled there on April 4, 1910, humbly entered the world without benefit of human assistance. The ungainly little specimen was dubbed Single G. The ragged little horse was a super-horse hailed as "the greatest pacer of all time" and "the most marvelous piece of horseflesh every foaled."
The Inter-State Publishing Company's 1884 'History of Wayne County, Indiana' comments on the former county seat by saying, "Rarely does it fall to the lot of any small place to be the home of so many eminent men, conspicuous in the affairs both of state and the nation, as have lived in Centreville."
What was said then is true now.
Although Centreville has reversed its "re" to "er", Centerville is home to people of imminence and dignity.
The once muddy ground surveyed as a town and recorded on Jan. 2, 1815, just 215 years ago this week, is hallowed ground not just for east central Indiana but also for the nation.

Why Golden State 'booms' are a bust for so many

Texto completo: Californians, being tougher than we look, have found ways to survive our economic busts.
It's the booms that really break us.
This essential truth is now being missed. Today, politicians and media alike juxtapose the hallmarks of California's current boom with our deep problems — as if they represented a paradox. How can a place be so wealthy and progressive, they ask, and yet so poor and ungenerous at the same time?
"California Is Booming," the New York Times asked recently, "Why Are So Many Californians Unhappy?"
The answer to that question lies in the question itself: So many of us are unhappy precisely because California is booming.
This is no paradox, because our successes and our problems are intertwined. California's tendency to turn everything — from housing to health — into an investment, full of speculation — has made everything, even our booms, volatile and risky.
The signature effect of the now-concluding decade of boom is, of course, homelessness. When the economy grows here, so does homelessness.
Why? In this decade, our boom in jobs and income among the wealthy and middle class created more housing demand. But we couldn't produce enough housing to keep up with demands. Housing prices soared. And as people moved into cheaper neighborhoods and paid higher rents, they effectively forced out poorer longtime residents, some of whom ended up on the streets.
Booms exacerbate California's already significant income gap. Rising wages have been good for our most successful, high-income workers, but they also fuel cost of living increases for middle class and poor families, whose gains have not kept up. These higher costs are why California ranks at or near the top on national poverty measures, and why the state has seen an exodus of middle- and low-income people.
When this state really soars, it feels like it's flying away.
California booms are dangerous in other ways, too.
Our state has made its costliest policy mistakes during good times, often to help people deal with skyrocketing growth. Most famously, as housing prices surged in the late 1970s, voters eager to cut soaring property taxes approved Proposition 13, without considering how the ballot initiative might make it harder to govern California.
That is hardly the only example.
Our local governments now face fiscal peril because of the unsustainably high boosts of public employee pensions approved during the late 1990s tech boom. And today's investor-owned utility crisis, which is literally sparking fires across the state, is rooted in poorly conceived deregulation during that same '90s boom.
When the booms are this tough, it's not hard to find Californians who remember our busts fondly. Downturns create moments when things are cheap enough to take a risk, start a business and snap up a piece of the California dream.
I'm here writing this column because of a bust: The Great Recession. The 2008 collapse, which led to a decline in housing prices, made it possible for me to take a chance on a lower-paying nonprofit media job. Then, in 2011, when prices were still depressed, I bought a small San Gabriel Valley home that would have been unaffordable before that economic collapse — and that I couldn't dream of affording today.
Governments also tend to treat citizens better during busts. The state was far more generous with subsidies and tax breaks for businesses during the Great Recession; today it is busy imposing more regulations and costs.
That recession also saw the federal government take big steps that assisted Californians, via the economic stimulus legislation and Obamacare. But, today, during the boom, our state and its people find themselves under attack from the same federal government — precisely because our boom and its successes are seen as a threatening counter-example to the president's reactionary policies.
The other bad news about California good times is that future booms are likely to be even tougher.
Over the years, all of our booms have changed our character as a state. Once, we were a place of arrival, a destination for new immigrants and the young and ambitious. Back in those days, our busts allowed for surges of new residents. But now, the cost of entry for newcomers has become prohibitively high. That means we are less a state of immigrants and more a state of longtime Californians struggling to hold on.
Perhaps our state and its governments should stop encouraging booms — our de facto policy for decades — and instead pursue more policies that reduce our natural volatility. But that will require us to think of California as a place where we want to spend our lives, rather than a stock exchange of bungalows and beaches.
So happy new year, and good luck finding shelter from the boom.

Tips for how to budget in the new year

Texto completo: The ball drops. The lights flash. The fireworks explode. "Auld Lang Syne" plays. When all those things happen at once, it can only mean one thing: A new year!
We all love a good New Year's celebration, but with it comes the reminder of goals, responsibilities and resolutions for the upcoming year. And if you're like most people, somewhere in the middle of all your resolutions is money — as in, the desire to manage it better.
If any of your resolutions for 2020 involve money, then your success will start with a budget. I know, the dreaded "B" word. Sure, creating a budget doesn't really sound like much fun.
But doesn't it sound better than feeling stressed because you're living paycheck to paycheck? How much better would it be to know that all your bills are paid, and you're working toward becoming debt-free or saving to pay cash for your summer vacation? That's what you can do when you make a plan for your money!
You'll give up on your resolution much more quickly without a plan. How do you start? First, figure out how much money you have to work with for the upcoming month — before the beginning of each month. This includes your income, your spouse's income and any extra income you may have.
Give every dollar a name. Spend every dollar, on purpose, on paper, before the month begins. This is called a zero-based budget, and it works. Basically, when you're planning for the month ahead, you should be able to subtract your expenses (outgo) from your income to equal zero. When you're done writing the budget, you shouldn't have anything left over. My favorite way to manage my budget is the free app EveryDollar. It helps my husband and me stay on track.
A good plan lives and changes as your life changes. You'll need to review your budget each month throughout the year to make adjustments. If you find you've budgeted too little or too much in an area, then adjust.
If you've been living without a budget, it will probably take a few months to get the hang of it, and that's OK. But soon you should have a budget you can rely on. A budget doesn't limit your freedom; it gives you freedom to spend. It's about knowing where your cash is going, instead of wondering where it went. Just imagine how great it would feel to be in charge of your finances in 2020.
Sounds like a happy new year to me.

Texto completo: After almost two years in Mexico, Jorge Garcia — whose deportation in January 2018 became a national story after a Free Press report — is back home in metro Detroit.
Garcia, 41, arrived at Detroit Metro Airport last month on Christmas Day, hugged by his two children and wife shedding tears of joy, his family members said.
"I'm really happy" to be back, Garcia, of Lincoln Park, said Friday. "The last year was very stressful, it got to the point where my blood pressure was very high, I was getting anxiety attacks. ... I see it like a nightmare ... something like a bad dream."
Garcia was granted two waivers by U.S. immigration officials with the Department of Homeland Security, said his attorney Mayra Lorenzana-Miles. He is now a lawful permanent resident of the U.S., getting his official card , and is on a path to U.S. citizenship in a few years, she said.
"Welcome Home Jorge," read a large banner inside a room at the Lincoln Park public library on Friday afternoon, where supporters gathered to celebrate his homecoming.
The Free Press reported on Garcia's deportation on Jan. 15, 2018, capturing his emotional farewell at Detroit Metro Airport as tearful family members hugged him one last time before he was escorted through security by a federal immigration agent. After 30 years living in the U.S. with no criminal record, he was kicked out of the country.
The Free Press story was picked up my numerous media outlets, including CNN, New York Times, BBC, prompting a national debate over immigration enforcement in the Trump administration. The Free Press later went to Mexico to report on Garcia's struggles in an unfamiliar country.
Garcia was born in Mexico and was brought to the U.S. as a child when he was 10 years old by an undocumented relative. He was too old to qualify for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), missing the age requirement by just one year. Since 2004, he and his family have been trying to obtain legal status, hiring attorneys and following the law.
Garcia was previously ordered removed from the U.S., but had gotten stays of removal. That changed after Donald Trump became president as authorities toughened immigration enforcement. In November 2017, Garcia was ordered to leave.
ICE officials have defended his deportation, saying that Garcia was "an unlawfully present citizen of Mexico" who "was ordered removed by an immigration judge in June 2006."
Garcia had no criminal record, worked as a landscaper, and paid his taxes, said advocates and U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn.
"He never got a traffic ticket," Dingell said at the homecoming celebration on Friday. "He worked hard. ... He had never done anything wrong."
Garcia got an interview in February at an American consulate office in Mexico, but was denied, said his wife, Cindy Garcia. His waivers were then approved in September, said his attorney.
Cindy Garcia was hoping he would be home in time for Halloween or maybe Thanksgiving, but authorities kept on asking for paperwork such as medical history, she said.
"The whole two years, we had PTSD, anxiety, depression," Cindy said.
"It was anxious not knowing when he could come home, your hopes resting on the timeline of government officials," she said.
"We just didn't know when" he could come home, she said.
Finally, he was approved just a few days before Dec. 25.
Cindy then bought him a plane ticket.
"I was on my way to the airport" in Mexico City, Jorge said, recalling his trip back to the U.S. "But I was in denial. I was thinking it wasn't true."
It wasn't until he got the necessary stamp after arriving in Detroit Metro Airport and seeing his family greet him that he finally did breathe a sigh of relief.
Cindy Garcia said she had told the children they were going to the airport to pick up an uncle because she wanted it to be a surprise and because she was still uncertain whether he would make it.
Almost two years prior, Cindy and her two kids sobbed at Detroit Metro Airport as they hugged Garcia before he was escorted away by immigration agents. On Dec. 25, they cried again at Detroit Metro Airport, but this time, there were tears of joy.
"I was surprised," said his son, Jorge Garcia Jr., 14, recalling the Christmas Day scene. "I started crying when I saw him."
Being without a father at home for two years "felt weird," he said. "It's been hard, not having a dad."
His daughter Soleil, said: "When I first saw him, I was crying because I was happy."
Soleil had to celebrate her Quinceañera (15thbirthday), a rite of passage for many Mexican American teenage girls, without her father. There's a traditional father-daughter dance she had to do instead with a grandfather.
"It was just very sad knowing that he wasn't here with us during certain events," she said.
The Garcias thanked Rep. Dingell and the UAW Local 600, of which Cindy is a member, and was supportive of them.
Rep. Dingell said "there are too many families that are being torn apart."
Pastor Jack Eggleston of Unity Lutheran Church in Southgate spoke at the homecoming at the library, introducing the Garcias.
"This has been a long ordeal," he said. "But the community has been aching with them."
Cindy said the two years without Jorge was emotionally tough for the family, with her and the two kids going through tough moments.
"My children have suffered," she said. "We screamed and yelled" at times, "but we got through this."
Meanwhile, Jorge was alienated living in Nicolas Romero, about one hour from Mexico City. He lived with an aunt, but didn't have any social connections that could help him establish a new life.
Now, Cindy said she intends to continue fighting for others who were in her situation, with families broken up by deportations. When Garcia was deported two years ago, supporters held up signs at the airport reading: 'Stop Separating Families.'
Cindy told the Free Press: "I am going to fight more than ever now for these broken immigration laws to be fixed so that no other family has to endure what we did because I know the feeling and I don't want any other children separated from their families because it's a hardship on the kids, on the parents, the whole family in general."
While in Mexico, Jorge bought a chain and medallion with an image on the front of Jesus Christ and on back of Our Lady of Guadalupe, an iconic figure for many Mexican Catholics.
He said his faith in her and religion gave him strength over the past two years.
"Basically, every day I was praying," Jorge told the Free Press. "I was praying for something to change. And it did."

Texto completo: GAINESVILLE, Ga. - The tiny white church has new locks, peepholes and brass plates. While its parishioners pray, the sanctuary is bolted shut and a police officer is now stationed outside. Soon, surveillance cameras will be installed, and the 47-member congregation will participate in active-shooter training.
This is the next chapter for the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, which the authorities said was targeted in mid-November. Gainesville police charged a 16-year-old white girl with planning a racially motivated knife attack to kill the black worshippers, a plot they said bore eerie similarity to a 2015 massacre at a storied African American church in Charleston, South Carolina.
In Gainesville, a small city of 40,000 residents in the heart of Georgia's poultry industry, the police chief has urged church members to use low-tech force to protect themselves. They should hurl Bibles or hot coffee, chairs or fire extinguishers, anything, he said, that can be weaponized if they are under attack and cannot safely escape.
"It's a shame that we live in a world today where we have to protect our institutions of worship, our schools, but evil knows where we are most vulnerable," Chief Jay Parrish told church leaders during a recent introduction to the active-shooter training. "The lightning bolt got too close this time."
Faced with a rise in attacks on houses of worship, the Rev. Michelle Rizer-Pool, the pastor of Bethel, and other religious leaders across the country are fortifying their buildings and preparing for the possibility of mass shootings. Some have also turned to armed security and organized law enforcement patrols.
Last week, a gunman opened fire during Sunday service at a Texas church, killing two congregants before an armed member of the church's volunteer security team fatally shot him. And over the past two years, gunmen have targeted worshippers at synagogues in Poway, California, where one person died, and in Pittsburgh, where a man shouting anti-Semitic slurs gunned down 11 people, and at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people were killed and 20 more were wounded.
"Unfortunately, this is what it has come to. We have to be ready to fight back," said Rizer-Pool, a retired Army major who has led Bethel for about 18 months. "We are having to get our arms around this idea of praying and praising our God in what is supposed to be a place of peace, but having to be watchful and on the lookout."
Faith groups have responded to the growing threat of hate crimes and violence, in part, by offering specialized training and producing safety guides. The Council on American-Islamic Relations published a safety manual for religious institutions and began holding training sessions after a mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012.
"Our thinking is, if you substitute 'mosque' for 'church' or 'synagogue' or 'temple,' the concerns are the same, so we made the guide available to the entire faith community," said Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the group.
After a gunman stormed the small church in Sutherland Springs in November 2017, a Dallas-area megachurch organized an active-shooter training session, which more than 600 church leaders from across the country attended. Since then, the church and the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention have provided training and security assessments at 150 churches in Texas, Oregon and Missouri. Texas legislators responded, too, by passing laws that allow anyone with a concealed-carry license to bring firearms into churches.
In Gainesville, 55 miles northeast of Atlanta, the police department has conducted training and security assessments across the city since a gunman stormed an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 people, including 20 children, in 2012.
At Bethel on one recent dreary Saturday morning, after the hymn, the prayer and the scripture reading, Parrish and Sgt. Kevin Holbrook talked to the church's leadership about fear - and fighting back. They had gathered in a backroom to discuss the creation of a security team and response plan to protect the congregation.
The new reality, the police officers said, calls for adding a layer of vigilance to the church's general culture and spirit of inclusion. Now, parishioners need to know alternate exits. They need to make eye contact with visitors. They need to set up patrol details.
But the most important strategy, the officers said, is knowing how to react if attacked: Run, hide or fight. Run to safety; hide from the attacker; or, as a last resort, fight back with anything available.
"A fire extinguisher makes a huge cloud, and if it gets on your skin, it burns. If it gets in your eyes, it blinds. And if you get hit in the head with it, it will knock you out," Parrish said. "If you have to fight, know you're fighting for your life."
The Gainesville High School student arrested a few weeks before this training session was on a mission to kill Bethel church members, the authorities said. In a carefully orchestrated plan, they said, the teenage girl acquired butcher knives, researched online, took meticulous notes and had scouted the church's location on Mill Street.
On the day she went to the church - either to launch the attack or to collect more information, the police said - she found an empty building. Authorities said the girl's plan was likely inspired by Dylann Roof, the convicted white supremacist who murdered nine worshippers during Bible study at a church of the same denomination, Emanuel AME, in Charleston, South Carolina.
The Gainesville plot was foiled by classmates who told a high school counselor about the girl's notebook, which contained the chilling plans. Police said the level of detail in her notes may have saved Bethel.
The student, who has not been identified by the authorities, was charged with criminal intent to commit murder.
Though police said her plan was racially motivated, she was not charged with a hate crime because the state is one of four across the country with no such law. But after the planned attack was made public, a group of black legislators announced that they would continue to push for a bill to create stiffer penalties for crimes motivated by hate.

Texto completo: The ball drops. The lights flash. The fireworks explode. "Auld Lang Syne" plays. When all those things happen at once, it can only mean one thing: A new year!
We all love a good New Year's celebration, but with it comes the reminder of goals, responsibilities and resolutions for the upcoming year. And if you're like most people, somewhere in the middle of all your resolutions is money — as in, the desire to manage it better.
If any of your resolutions for 2020 involve money, then your success will start with a budget. I know, the dreaded "B" word. Sure, creating a budget doesn't really sound like much fun.
But doesn't it sound better than feeling stressed because you're living paycheck to paycheck? How much better would it be to know that all your bills are paid, and you're working toward becoming debt-free or saving to pay cash for your summer vacation? That's what you can do when you make a plan for your money!
You'll give up on your resolution much more quickly without a plan. How do you start? First, figure out how much money you have to work with for the upcoming month — before the beginning of each month. This includes your income, your spouse's income and any extra income you may have.
Give every dollar a name. Spend every dollar, on purpose, on paper, before the month begins. This is called a zero-based budget, and it works. Basically, when you're planning for the month ahead, you should be able to subtract your expenses (outgo) from your income to equal zero. When you're done writing the budget, you shouldn't have anything left over. My favorite way to manage my budget is the free app EveryDollar. It helps my husband and me stay on track.
A good plan lives and changes as your life changes. You'll need to review your budget each month throughout the year to make adjustments. If you find you've budgeted too little or too much in an area, then adjust.
If you've been living without a budget, it will probably take a few months to get the hang of it, and that's OK. But soon you should have a budget you can rely on. A budget doesn't limit your freedom; it gives you freedom to spend. It's about knowing where your cash is going, instead of wondering where it went. Just imagine how great it would feel to be in charge of your finances in 2020.
Sounds like a happy new year to me.

Tariff, tax policies thicken 'swamp'

Texto completo: Campaign chants of "Drain that swamp!" once promised an end, or at least a blow, to special-interest influence in government.
The swamp, however, seems to be breeding new life forms.
The Trump administration's domestic taxes on imports - called tariffs - created a sub-industry for lobbyists seeking to get this burden on their clients lifted.
The bureaucracy of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Commerce Department and other agencies makes many decisions about whom to exempt from tariffs case by case and product by product.
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the number of clients lobbying on tariff and trade issues has jumped in the past two years.
Firms that won tariff exclusions include those with which Trump inauguration committee chief Brian Ballard, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trump campaign fundraiser Marc Lampkin are affiliated, the news site ProPublica reported.
Varian, a medical company, paid Ballard and a colleague to lobby the White House, the trade office and Vice President Mike Pence. Four of Varian's five tariff exclusion requests were approved, ProPublica reported, citing securities filings.
Big companies that hire connected lobbyists to do their government bidding traditionally enjoy a competitive advantage over small firms that cannot afford to do the same.
At the same time, President Donald Trump keeps repeating that China is funding the federal tariff revenue. If China were doing that, of course, U.S. manufacturers would have little motive to pay top-dollar lobbyists to try to avoid the tariffs.
"U.S. tariffs continue to be almost entirely borne by U.S. firms and consumers," Mary Amiti, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, states in a new National Bureau of Economic Research paper.
Tariffs overall haven't brought the catastrophe some critics predicted. And trade officials still see them as key to prodding eventual concessions from rival China.
The administration also has helped spin the revolving door between industry and government.
As of October, the number of lobbyists who had moved into government jobs far exceeded the same number for the Obama administration's first six years, a research project by ProPublica and Columbia Journalism School found.
Often the ex-lobbyists are assigned to help regulate industries they worked in.
While the White House imposed tariffs on U.S. businesses for various materials and products, tax rates fell for various kinds of corporations.
New taxes were included in the massive tax bill hastily crafted by Congress in 2017. These were aimed at raising hundreds of billions of dollars from companies that had been avoiding tax payments, in part by asserting their profits were earned outside the United States.
Lobbyists for big companies besieged the Treasury Department to influence the way the rewritten tax law would be carried out. Their campaign succeeded, The New York Times reported. Exceptions were crafted with the result that some top U.S. and foreign firms will owe little or nothing in new taxes on their offshore profits.

Texto completo: In Pursuit of Fashion: The Sandy Schreier Collection
The Met Fifth Avenue, through May 17
New York -- Exhibitions based on the collection of a fashionista don't always thrill. Recalling the 2006 Met show "Nan Kempner: American Chic," I still see a floating rack bunched with way too many lunching-lady blazers. And the 2015 show on Jacqueline de Ribes, a countess who was a couturier for a time and deeply cultured, nevertheless smacked of society first, design second, which is why her own work went only so far. When you're too inside, you can't see how narrow your vision has become. "Rara Avis," a 2005 exhibition fashioned from the wardrobe of woman-about-world Iris Apfel, was inspiring because Ms. Apfel has kept herself outside, honing a textile-driven bohemian style that is wide-eyed (look at her signature eyeglasses -- two big round O's), enlarged by historical and cultural references. The Met exhibition "In Pursuit of Fashion: The Sandy Schreier Collection" introduces us to another outsider.
Truth be told, the name Sandy Schreier -- and the Ali Baba's treasure connected with it -- has been reverently mentioned in fashion circles for decades, not least by museum curators. But Ms. Schreier lives way outside those circles, in a suburb of the city in which she was born, Detroit. Her parents moved there in the 1930s so that her father, who worked for the Manhattan specialty store Russeks, could manage the fur salon of the fledgling Detroit branch. All that auto-industry money! All those couture-wearing wives! When a new sister demanded her mother's attention, Sandy accompanied her father to work -- she was only 3 or 4 years old -- and pored over Vogue and Harper's Bazaar while experiencing hands-on the enchantment of French and American high design. No igniting moment, no epiphany. The little girl instinctively knew that fashion could be art and she would collect it. (New York's Museum of Modern Art still hasn't figured this out.)
Ms. Schreier was not curating her own wardrobe -- as another prescient girl, Marjorie Merriweather Post, decided to do back in the early 1900s -- but preserving "beauty." The power of her passion led Detroit wives to give her their once-worn, still-perfect pieces. As she told the New York Times in July, "One Halloween my mother insisted I wear one of the dresses as my costume and I had a huge temper tantrum and refused. Even then, I didn't want anyone wearing them. I always said, 'If I owned a Picasso, it would not be on my back.'"
Piece by piece, her pristine "Picassos" -- eventually numbering in the thousands -- added up to one of the finest private collections in the country. Planning for the future, Ms. Schreier recently invited the Met's Costume Institute to choose "promised gifts" for its collection. The current exhibition displays 80 of the 165 pieces the Institute picked -- all from the 20th and 21st centuries, many filling gaps in its archive -- and they are choice.
The garment that greets viewers as they enter the downstairs gallery sets the tone. It's a magnificent evening sheath circa 1923, a lace of pink silk gauze with Egyptian motifs in gold-metal thread; across the hips is the stylized image of a flying ibis rendered in pink and aqua stones. The dress was owned by Matilda Dodge Wilson, widow of the founder of Dodge Motor Co., and it speaks to the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, an archaeological find that had everyone buzzing. The ibis symbolizes fertility, so its spread-winged placement upon the pelvis is dramatically pointed, but it also symbolizes communication. One of Ms. Schreier's important early acquisitions, the dress is emblematic of her collecting criteria: expression on many levels at once -- historical, poetic, social -- with imaginative flight sewn in. Created by Madeleine & Madeleine, a short-lived Parisian house that most of us have never heard of, it's a first for the Met collection.
Organized by Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute, associate curator Jessica Regan and assistant curator Mellissa Huber, this focused show, elegantly paced, is divided into four main areas of interest -- Ms. Schreier's interests. The first section, "In Pursuit of Beauty: Origins of a Collection" -- exquisite and allusive postwar pieces -- holds the fewest surprises, though the late-Dior "Du Barry" dress (autumn/winter 1957-58) is scrumptious, and the juxtaposition of Charles James's floating black "Swan" dress (1952-54) and Jacques Griffe's pyramidal black taffeta (c. 1955) is fascinating for what they say about below-the-waist storytelling.
"The Past Recaptured," in a word sublime, offers an array of Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo's jackets, tunics and pleated "Delphos" dresses alongside the work of the Italian designer, another name new to me, Maria Monaci Gallenga, who took inspiration from Fortuny and appears every bit his match. Upon velvet, both designers printed antiquity's brocade patterns in gold and silver, using secret processes that left the fabric supple and comfortable to wear. Gallenga's two evening capes, circa 1925, are mesmerizingly operatic -- held notes scaled to history. "L'Esprit Nouveau: The Interwar Era" captures the swift cycling of silhouettes from the 1920s to the '30s -- from the Lanvin and Boue Soeurs "robe de style" silhouette of flat chest and wide hips, to electrically beaded flapper shifts, to body-skimming gowns by Chanel and Vionnet.
Perhaps the fourth section, "The Message Is the Medium: Fashion That Speaks," best captures Ms. Schreier's desire for articulate invention. Rudi Gernreich's trompe l'oeil, Christian Francis Roth's sunny-side-up surrealism, Patrick Kelly's silvery sleight of hand, Moschino's metaphor (a glove is a hand) and Philip Treacy's metamorphosis (a brainstorm of multicolored Monarch butterflies) -- the room is alive with wit. The little Bes-Ben "doll" hat, circa 1946, with six small red-leather lobsters grouped on top, nods literally to the lobsters of Elsa Schiaparelli and Charles James -- designers who consciously fused fashion and art. I'm guessing Ms. Schreier had to have it.

Texto completo: When I was a rookie at ABC News decades ago, our coverage of big stories -- from war to impeachment to the World Series -- always included plenty of "man on the street," or MOS. As soon as important news broke, a pack of reporters from TV, radio and print dashed to New York's iconic crossroads, Times Square or Grand Central Terminal, to learn what "average" folks were thinking.
MOS was never scientific. It consisted of quick sound bites from people given little time to think before blurting opinions. And it was almost always edited to create balance: If there were two sides to a story, we sought to represent them equally. The process was quaint and sometimes misleading, but it did serve as a reminder that not all issues are black or white.
The man on the street as we knew him is dead. He may reappear occasionally after natural disasters or in political battleground states. Most MOS coverage, however, has been replaced by a plethora of faceless polls -- and even polling averages -- along with tallies of likes, tweets and Google searches.
Following the Democrats' debate in Miami last June, USA Today reported: "Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard emerged as the clear winner by one objective standard: She got the most Google searches after the debate." There was nothing "clear" or "objective" about the story. Did people search for information about Ms. Gabbard because they liked her positions? Or were they simply curious about that outspoken woman in the red blazer?
Who are these googling masses? Where do they live? How old are they? Do they look you in the eye when they speak? These metrics have a scientific sheen, but they're no replacement for MOS. Neither are the other digital facsimiles.
Today when news breaks, reporters don't have to trek to Times Square. They can open Twitter and have the world's opinions at their fingertips. But they really don't have to bother with the general public. Politicians, entertainers and denizens of the B List also dish their digital opinions.
Following the Dec. 20 Democratic debate the New York Times ran a story titled "Who Won the Democratic Debate? Experts Weigh In." The report consisted almost entirely of tweets, more than a dozen of them, from "experts" such as former Obama adviser David Axelrod, and Meredith Kelly, a former spokeswoman for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's presidential campaign.
In some ways reprinting tweets is more journalistically careless than MOS ever was. The statements aren't spontaneous, they're crafted as mini news releases. There's no follow-up, no back and forth with the reporter.
Yet the power of Twitter shouldn't be underestimated. From #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter to scores of other influential hashtags, it has a profound effect on what journalists and politicians think about and report. But only 22% of American adults use Twitter, and it has a tendency toward groupthink.
One place where MOS remains a staple is in local news coverage. At the scene of a fire or horrific car crash, reporters still go after quotes such as, "It looked like a war zone" (the line we heard most over the years at ABC News), usually spoken by people who had never been to an actual war.
In the media lexicon, MOS has another meaning in addition to "man on the street": "mit out sound." Mit is German for "with" and this use of MOS refers to footage that is silent. You might say what remains of MOS in the digital age is now mostly MOS. The more tools we develop to give individuals a voice, the less we care about what they have to say.

MATZNEFF FLAP A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR CULTURAL ARISTOCRATS

Texto completo: Gabriel Matzneff is not a good man, but it's taken France a long time to realize it.
Norimitsu Onishi of The New York Times reported an astonishing story this week. It begins:
"The French writer Gabriel Matzneff never hid the fact that he engaged in sex with girls and boys in their early teens or even younger. He wrote countless books detailing his insatiable pursuits and appeared on television boasting about them. 'Under 16 Years Old,' was the title of an early book that left no ambiguity."
Mr. Matzneff, now 83, spent decades as a French literary darling. His work was supported by leading newspapers and literary publications. He'd appear on highbrow TV shows where he'd regale interviewers and audiences with the sublime pleasures of having sex with children in France and on sex tours of southeast Asia.
His overdue comeuppance is the result of a memoir by one of his victims, Vanessa Springora, who was seduced by a then-50-something Matzneff when she was 14.
"He was not a good man," Ms. Springora writes. "He was in fact what we're taught to dread since childhood: an ogre."
In his book "Under 16 Years Old," Mr. Matzneff writes, "To sleep with a child, it's a holy experience, a baptismal event, a sacred adventure." The book was first published in 1974 but was republished, apparently with no controversy in 2005. In 2013, Mr. Metznaff received a major French literary prize.
How could a country that prides itself on being so enlightened celebrate an ogre? After all, we're not talking about a Jeffrey Epstein, as horrible as he was. The well-connected billionaire spent vast sums to keep his sexual abuses at least somewhat secret. Mr. Matzneff not only confessed to his crimes, his confessions were celebrated as literary contributions.
The answer stems in part from the fact that Mr. Matzneff was a "Child of '68" - i.e., a product of the left-wing "May 68" movement that shook France in the 1960s. These radicals subscribed to the idea that anything smacking of traditionalism or bourgeois morality was backward. Conventional sexual morality was part of the same rotten edifice as imperialism and racism. True liberation meant not just freedom from, say, capitalism, but also from the old-fashioned view that sex with kids was wrong. "It's forbidden to forbid" was a rallying cry.
Some argued, Mr. Onishi writes, "for abolishing age-of-consent laws, saying that doing so would liberate children from the domination of their parents and allow them to be full, sexual beings."
A few years ago, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the famous former radical and leader of the European Green movement, got in hot water for his earlier writings and statements about "erotic" encounters with 5-year-olds. He dodged major consequences by disavowing his own words, saying they were merely intended to provoke.
Mr. Matzneff can't make such claims. His whole identity was invested in the seduction of children and teenagers.
America, so backwardly bourgeois in the eyes of these aristocrats, doesn't have France's problems, but it is hardly immune to such dynamics. Director Roman Polanski, who fled America rather than face sentencing for statutory rape, is routinely defended by Hollywood royalty in part because of a similar aristocratic attitude.
Mr. Matzneff is a good example of what can happen when people who share a self-styled radical worldview capture the commanding heights of the culture and consider themselves above the rubes from whom they make their money.
There's a reason Ricky Gervais struck such a chord at the Golden Globes earlier this month when he told the assembled Hollywood royalty to get over themselves.
"If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech," Mr. Gervais said. "You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg."
This should be a cautionary tale for all cultural aristocrats. Not all radical fads hold up well over time.

Harold Burson, 98; considered a giant of public relations industry

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Like many young veterans, Harold Burson came home from World War II full of ambitious dreams. He was 25, had worked in public relations before the war and decided to try it again in New York. It was 1946, and there were 540 local phone listings for “public relations" and “publicity" — a scrimmage of press agents who took reporters to lunch, hoping to plant items for clients.
Over the next five decades, Mr. Burson became one of the nation's most celebrated PR men, a founder of the giant Burson-Marsteller agency who broke ground not only by enhancing corporate images but also by helping clients soften the blows of potentially ruinous crises. These included a Tylenol-tampering case that panicked Americans in 1982 and the 1984 toxic gas leak that killed thousands in Bhopal, India, considered the world's worst industrial disaster.
Mr. Burson, who was hailed by the industry publication PRWeek in 1999 as the most influential PR person of the 20th century, and whose standards gave a luster of respectability to a business often seen as a confraternity of spin doctors, died Friday in Memphis, the city of his birth. He was 98.
A spokeswoman for his company, now known as Burson Cohn & Wolfe, said the cause was complications of a fall in November. He had donated archives of his work to Boston University, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1988.
Public relations has long been an easy target of critics, who liken its faceless practitioners to Machiavelli's Prince or Orwell's Big Brother, manipulating public opinion to hide truths and maximize profits. But to Mr. Burson, it was a profession that used the arts of persuasion for corporations and governments to publicize facts, not lies, for worthy social, political, and commercial goals — and, by the way, to make the clients look better.
“We are advocates," he told The New York Times in 1984. “We are being paid to tell our clients' side of the story. We are in the business of changing and molding attitudes, and we aren't successful unless we move the needle, get people to do something. But we are also a client's conscience, and we have to do what is in the public interest."
In 1995, Boston University established a faculty chair in Mr. Burson's name. Early in his career, a mentor had brought him to BU to speak to students.
“And I found myself learning as much from them as they learned from me," he said in a BU video interview that is posted online, in which he praised the creation of a public relations college curriculum.
“Today one of the big faults that we run into time after time is we get exquisite answers to the wrong problems," he said. “I think that the educational process has gone a long way toward defining the steps to be taken."
In 1953, after seven years at his own agency, Mr. Burson and William Marsteller agreed over a breakfast at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan to team up and call the new agency Burson-Marsteller, with offices in New York and Chicago. Over the next 35 years it became one of the world's largest and most successful public relations firms, rivaling Hill & Knowlton, as the industry evolved into mass marketing and global communications.
Burson-Marsteller's clients included Philip Morris, Merrill Lynch, Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil, General Motors, Dow Chemical, IBM, and American Express. The firm also served Nigeria, Argentina, and Romania — countries that had dictatorships and image problems.
Mr. Burson often was called in crises. When cyanide-laced capsules of Tylenol, the pain medication, killed seven people in the Chicago area in 1982, its manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, made the best of a bad situation. After consulting Mr. Burson, the company's chief, James Burke, announced a recall, ordered new tamper-resistant caplets and packaging seals, and mounted a campaign that acknowledged the facts, stressed safety measures, and eventually restored his company's credibility.
After the 1984 gas leak at a Union Carbide plant in India that killed as many as 3,800 people overnight and thousands more later, Burson-Marsteller helped get out the story of the disaster and company efforts to alleviate the suffering. Mr. Burson defended the work, insisting that Union Carbide, which paid $470 million in 1989 to settle lawsuits, had been forthright and ethical.
Burson-Marsteller promoted trade and tourism in Romania and Argentina. Human rights advocates said the work supported brutal regimes in the 1960s and '70s, but the company insisted it did not answer for the conduct of dictators.
Mr. Burson advised corporate CEOs to get bad news out quickly and fully, making it a one-day story rather than letting it drag out. He urged them to be candid and refused to take clients who could not be.
He married Bette Ann Foster in 1947. She died in 2010 at 85. Mr. Burson leaves their sons, Scott and Mark, and five grandchildren.
In 1979, Burson-Marsteller was acquired by Young & Rubicam, the advertising agency, which was absorbed by communications giant WPP Group in 2000. Mr. Burson remained as chief executive of Burson-Marsteller until 1989, when he became founder-chairman.
Harold Burson was born in Memphis on Feb. 15, 1921, a son of English immigrants, Maurice and Esther (Bach) Burson. He graduated from high school at 15 and worked his way through the University of Mississippi writing articles, at 14 cents per column inch, for The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. One article, in 1937, was an interview with William Faulkner; it made the front page.
He joined the Army in 1943 and removed land mines from Normandy beaches after the 1944 Allied invasion. He was later a radio reporter for the American Forces Network, covering early trials of Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg. On the eve of the trial of Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess, and others who had been close to Hitler, he caught the mood of an empty courtroom when, in a script, he wrote, “Tomorrow morning, the conscience of the world will be present."
He added: “These trials have a meaning even greater than the immediate importance of doing justice in reference to those men charged in the indictment with plunging the world into war. The real long-range importance of these trials would subsequently mean that we have, in our time, established an agency to which we could hold accountable the rulers of all nations of the world in years to come."

Texto completo: Oprah Winfrey is disassociating herself with a new documentary about Russell Simmons and the #MeToo movement.
In December, Winfrey announced that she would serve as executive producer on a still-untitled film from Oscar-nominated directors Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick that centers on some of the 20 women who have publicly accused Simmons of sexual harassment and assault. The movie was to stream on Apple TV+ after its Jan. 25 premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.
But on Friday, Winfrey released a statement saying she was removing herself as an EP of the film, meaning it will also not play on Apple TV+, where she has a deal set up through her Harpo Productions.

"First and foremost, I want it to be known that I unequivocally believe and support the women. Their stories deserve to be told and heard," said Winfrey. "In my opinion, there is more work to be done on the film to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured and it has become clear that the filmmakers and I are not aligned in that creative vision. Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering are talented filmmakers. I have great respect for their mission but given the filmmakers' desire to premiere the film at the Sundance Film Festival before I believe it is complete, I feel it's best to step aside."
The film, however, will still debut at Sundance, according to its directors. In their own statement, Ziering and Dick said that although they were "disappointed" that Winfrey had pulled her name from the project, they were "gratified that Winfrey has unequivocally said she believes and supports the survivors in the film."
"Revealing hard truths is never easy, and the women in our documentary are all showing extraordinary strength and courage by raising their voices to address sexual abuse in the music industry," said the filmmakers. "The film is a beacon of hope for voices that have long been suppressed, and an inspiration for anyone wanting to regain their personal power."
Winfrey, for her part, made it clear Friday that she would continue to work with Time's Up to support those who have been sexually harassed. Tina Tchen, the foundation's president and chief executive, issued a release stating that Time's Up was "in full support" of those who made allegations against Simmons.
"We support Oprah Winfrey in maintaining that the victims' stories deserve to be heard on their own terms," said Tchen. "Too often, black women are silenced, disbelieved, or even vilified when they speak out. On top of that, for years, these women have been attacked by powerful forces surrounding Russell Simmons -- illustrating how difficult it is to speak out against powerful men. And how important it is for powerful men to be held accountable for their actions. ... As Oprah made clear in her statement, any decision by her and Apple regarding this documentary does not change the underlying facts."
Winfrey is no stranger to controversy in the documentary field. Last January, the two-part series "Leaving Neverland" -- in which two men disclosed what they said was years of sexual abuse at the hands of Michael Jackson -- debuted at Sundance. When the project premiered on HBO two months later, Winfrey interviewed its two subjects, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, for a one-hour special that was shown immediately after the broadcast of "Leaving Neverland."
"I haven't had that much hateration since I did the puppy episode with Ellen [DeGeneres]," Oprah told Trevor Noah on "The Daily Show" in April, referring to a 1997 episode of her talk show in which DeGeneres revealed she was a lesbian.
The Simmons documentary has been shrouded in secrecy since news of its premiere was disclosed. Not only has the project's name yet to be publicly revealed -- it is still listed as "Untitled Kirby Dick/Amy Ziering Film" on the Sundance website -- but press materials still do not say the movie is about the former head of Def Jam Records. It does, however, say that the film follows Drew Dixon, who told the New York Times in 2017 that she was raped by Simmons while working as an A&R executive at his company.
Simmons has denied all of the accusations of violence made against him since late 2017, when Keri Claussen Khalighi became the first woman to accuse him of sexual abuse in the Los Angeles Times. Shortly after news of the Sundance project broke, Simmons took to Instagram to call out Winfrey directly, saying he found it "troubling" that she had chosen to support the film. Rapper 50 Cent followed with a post of his own, arguing: "I don't understand why Oprah is going after black men. No Harvey Weinstein, No Epstein, just Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons this s-- is sad."
Representatives for Simmons did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the documentary.

CITY &amp; STATE; Review calls for changes to military's legal wing

Texto completo: A review of the Navy and Marine Corps' legal community -- ordered after the court-martial of then-Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher -- found ethical and systemic problems and recommends organizational changes and increased training, senior officers said Friday.
The review of the Judge Advocate General's Corps was ordered Aug. 1 by then-Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson after President Trump lashed out at the Navy on Twitter about awards that were to be given to the prosecutors in the Gallagher case.
The review, done by an executive panel, found systemic problems relating to other military law cases in addition to Gallagher's.

For instance, it cited ethical problems relating to the Glenn Defense Marine Asia case, in which contractor Leonard Glenn "Fat Leonard" Francis bribed dozens of naval officers with lavish meals, often with the approval of staff JAGs -- the Navy's lawyers -- from the early 1990s through the time of his arrest in 2013 on bribery and fraud charges.
Although the review mentions Gallagher once in its 273 pages, the timing of it leaves little doubt that Gallagher's case, and Trump's anger at the Navy over it, was a factor in the report.
Gallagher was acquitted of several war crimes in July, including charges he shot civilians and stabbed a wounded Islamic State fighter in the neck, killing him, in 2017. In the end, he was convicted of posing for a photo with the fighter's corpse, a crime for which the jury reduced him in rank.
Gallagher's case was marred by prosecutor misconduct. The Navy trial judge ruled an email-tracking scheme cooked up by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and implemented by the lead prosecutor violated the SEAL's constitutional rights.
That prosecutor was removed from the case weeks before trial and replaced.
The case was a lightning rod in conservative media, with the Navy JAG Corps bearing the brunt of criticism from pundits and Trump.
Trump intervened in the case several times -- he overturned a Navy judge's decision and had Gallagher released from confinement, he signaled his intent to pardon the SEAL before the trial began, and one of the president's personal attorneys joined Gallagher's defense team.
After Gallagher's acquittal on most charges, Trump congratulated the SEAL via Twitter and intervened weeks later when Navy prosecutors were given achievement medals for their work on their case. Trump revoked those medals, again via Twitter.
The same day Richardson ordered the review of the JAG Corps, he also assumed authority over Gallagher's war crimes case and the case against Navy SEAL Lt. Jacob Portier, Gallagher's platoon commander, who faced charges that he facilitated a cover-up.
Richardson dismissed the charges against Portier and ordered the JAG review.
A few days later, the Navy regional commander in San Diego, Rear Adm. Bette Bolivar, dropped war crimes charges against four other San Diego-based SEALs accused of abusing detainees in Afghanistan in 2012.
A Navy spokesman told the San Diego Union-Tribune in August that evidence in those cases had degraded and that convictions were unlikely.
The four cases also were plagued with allegations of unlawful command influence after leaders were supposedly pressured to reopen the cases after a story by the New York Times. Unlawful command influence, often called the "mortal enemy of military justice," occurs when a commander uses his position of authority to influence court proceedings.
After the Navy upheld Gallagher's conviction of posing with a corpse and reduced him in rank, Trump stepped in and restored it.
When the commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Adm. Collin Green, moved to strip Gallagher of his coveted SEAL trident and status in the elite community, Trump again stepped in.
That move reportedly angered civilian Pentagon leadership and, days later, Navy Secretary Robert Spencer was fired.
The review did not address what a senior Navy official described as a crippling morale hit suffered by the JAG Corps -- and the Navy at large -- after the president's actions.
"Both the president's and Richardson's interventions impacted morale and people's belief in themselves," said the senior officer, who was not authorized to comment. "There is no certainty that leadership would have their backs. There was significant concern in the Navy, from [lieutenants to admirals], about Trump's involvement and whether it would affect careers and how it would impact the military justice system."
Adm. Robert Burke, vice chief of naval operations, declined to answer questions about the JAG morale issue when asked by the Union-Tribune during a Q&A session with reporters Friday.
"We have talented judge advocates in the Navy who provide excellent service," Burke said. "There are things we can work on to get better ... but the individuals are absolutely talented individuals."
The review of the JAG Corps recommends that both the Navy and the Marines standardize training for officers and senior enlisted personnel on the military justice system and their responsibilities to avoid unlawful command influence.
It recommends the Navy address cultural issues and professionalism in the JAG Corps, finding that there are no training procedures in place for attorneys to learn from the mistakes of others.
It found the entire organizational structure of the Navy JAG Corps needs revamping to relieve pressure on regional legal services offices, which are responsible for a wide variety of legal practices in addition to prosecuting military justice cases.
It suggests the Navy establish an independent trial service office to conduct courts-martial.
The review also found courtroom facilities in both services lacking, especially for the Marine Corps.
It recommends the Navy secretary and the service chiefs appoint an oversight body to implement its recommendations. No timetable has been set.

New Decade, Same Old Trouble in Washington

Texto completo: If the tech industry was hoping for some relief from lawmakers' pressure, the start of the year had to have been a disappointment.
Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
WASHINGTON -- Big Tech did not get the fresh start it had hoped for in the first full week of the new decade. Debate over political ads, privacy and the market power of the biggest companies were again front and center. And Facebook, the biggest target of criticism, picked up where it left off at the end of last year.
Hi, I'm Cecilia Kang. I write for The New York Times about the tech industry's often fraught relationship with the regulators and lawmakers of Washington.
Facebook's tough week kicked off with a Times report on an internal company post by Andrew Bosworth, a senior executive of Facebook and a self-described liberal, who warned against actions that could thwart President Trump in the 2020 election.
The post, obtained by Kevin Roose, Sheera Frenkel and Mike Isaac, was a winding, 2,500-word essay in defense of the social network and Mark Zuckerberg's stance on free expression -- including misinformation -- in political speech.
The post from Mr. Bosworth, known as Boz and one of Mr. Zuckerberg's closest lieutenants, didn't sit well with many employees who had grown uncomfortable with the company's hands-off approach. Other big social media companies, notably Twitter and Google, have set limits or banned political ads outright.
Mr. Bosworth admitted Facebook probably helped elect Mr. Trump. But he said it was not for the reasons critics said. It wasn't Facebook's reckless handling of data, which allowed Cambridge Analytica to create psychographic profiles of voters, that did it. It was Facebook's platform for targeted advertising that was so influential in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, he said, used that platform better than anyone.
Alexis Madrigal of The Atlantic explained why Mr. Bosworth's internal post was so divisive in "Why Facebook's Id is showing." Mr. Bosworth argued that Facebook did not really need to change. After all, it's not tobacco, he said. It's more like sugar -- not so bad if you don't consume too much of it.
The next day, Facebook was caught up in an odd kerfuffle over a glowing article about five Facebook managers charged with defeating disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. The article, oddly, appeared in Teen Vogue without a byline. Why was Teen Vogue publishing an uncritical look at Facebook's election integrity efforts?
It got weirder. A label was added that tagged the story as "sponsored" editorial. Then the label disappeared. Then the story disappeared.
I dug into the mystery with my colleague Rachel Abrams. The article was, in fact, a piece of paid content. Teen Vogue and Facebook both said the labeling fracas was all a big misunderstanding.
On Thursday, Facebook was back to serious news: It released its policy on political ads, cementing a decision to allow lies by politicians to go unchecked and for campaigns to micro-target those ads to specific audiences.
The reaction was swift and partisan. The Trump campaign lauded the policy and other Republicans said it was an affirmation of free speech. Democrats, including the leading member of the Federal Election Commission, were angry, and said the decision was nothing short of a threat to democracy.
Will the encryption fight be rebooted?
The F.B.I. and Apple have reignited their battle over encryption. As reported by Jack Nicas and Katie Benner, the F.B.I. asked Apple for the data on two iPhones that belonged to the gunman in the shooting last month at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla., possibly setting up another showdown over law enforcement's access to smartphones.
This is an old battle, covered almost three years ago by Katie and Matt Apuzzo, now a European investigative reporter for The Times. At the heart of the dispute is a disagreement over user privacy and national security, and we'll be watching closely how this plays out.
Sonos takes Google to court
Antitrust enforcement of Big Tech will be a central focus for Washington regulators. And competitors are taking notice. Sonos sued Google in two federal courts. As reported by Jack Nicas and Daisuke Wakabayashi, the speaker company claims Google stole its secrets and used its market dominance to develop lower-priced speakers to squash competition.
The case has the attention of a congressional committee investigating competition violations by Big Tech. Next Friday, the antitrust subcommittee of the House plans to take a road trip to Boulder, Colo., where Patrick Spence, the chief executive of Sonos, is expected testify.

Texto completo: Lawmakers from both parties blame companies like Facebook and Google for the struggles of local newspapers.
CORNELIA, Ga. -- When a sport utility vehicle swerved out of its lane several weeks ago, slamming into a pickup truck and killing a teenager, a reporter from The Northeast Georgian raced to the scene. Within hours, the paper had posted the news on Facebook and updated it twice. It was shared by hundreds of people on the social network.
The fatal wreck consumed the town of Cornelia, Ga., nestled near the Chattahoochee National Forest about 90 miles northeast of Atlanta. The Northeast Georgian was the first to report the news, but unless the people who shared its story on Facebook follow a link to its website, either to see an ad or to subscribe to its twice-weekly print edition, the paper won't get paid.
As with many small papers across the country, that business strategy is not working for The Northeast Georgian. The paper's five employees do not just report and write. They also edit the articles, take photographs and lay out the newspaper.
"My grandmother used to say, 'Honey, if you let them get milk through the fence, they'll never buy the cow,"' said Dink NeSmith, chief executive of Community Newspapers Inc., which owns The Northeast Georgian and 23 other local papers.
But the tough economics facing small newspapers like Mr. NeSmith's has generated rare bipartisan agreement in Washington.
Anger toward big technology companies has led to multiple antitrust investigations, calls for a new federal data privacy law and criticism of the companies' political ad policies. Perhaps no issue about the tech companies, though, has united lawmakers in the Capitol like the decimation of local news.
Lawmakers from both parties blame companies like Facebook and Google, which dominate the online ad industry.
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, gave a big boost last week to a bill that may provide some papers a lifeboat. The proposal would give news organizations an exemption from antitrust laws, allowing them to band together to negotiate with Google and Facebook over how their articles and photos are used online, and what payments the newspapers get from the tech companies. (The bill is backed by the News Media Alliance, a trade group that represents news organizations including The New York Times Company.)
The proposal was sponsored by Representative Doug Collins, a conservative Georgia Republican whose district includes Cornelia. It was written by Representative David Cicilline, a liberal Democrat from Rhode Island. Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, sponsored an identical version in the Senate. Prominent co-sponsors joined, including Democrats like Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.
For the politicians, the issue is personal. They see news deserts in places where one or two local newspapers used to track their campaigns and official actions, keep local police departments and school boards accountable, and stitch together communities with big layouts on Main Street holiday parades and high school sports stars.
"I am a free-markets guy and have fought against the idea that just because something is big it is necessarily bad," Mr. Collins said. "But look, I'm a politician and live with the media and see its importance. These big, disruptive platforms are making money off creators of content disproportionately."
Facebook and Google declined to comment about the legislation. Representatives of the companies say their businesses have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on programs to bolster local journalism. The companies also work with news organizations to promote their articles and videos, driving traffic to their websites.
Facebook recently announced partnerships with major news organizations, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and CNN, that would give publishers a bigger cut of advertising revenue generated from their journalism.
"We know this is a challenging time for journalism," Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice president of global news partnerships, said in a statement. "And we are working closely with publishers to find new ways to address those challenges."
A Google spokeswoman said, "Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 24 billion visits to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue."
Newspapers have faced devastating financial losses for years. One in five newspapers have closed since 2004 in the United States, and about half of the nation's more than 3,000 counties have only one newspaper, many of them printing weekly, according to a report by the University of North Carolina published in late 2018. In the last year alone, Facebook and Google added tens of thousands of employees and reported billions of dollars in profits.
Take Mr. Collins's district in northern Georgia. The Atlanta Journal Constitution, the state's biggest newspaper, has cut its staff by half in the past eight years. In Mr. Collins's hometown, The Gainesville Times, one of the biggest papers in its region, cut its weekly print publication schedule to five days from seven a year ago.
The demand for local news remains. One day shortly after the fatal car crash, all of the discussion at Fender's Diner, a 1950s-inspired eatery in Cornelia, was about the victim and allegations that the woman behind the wheel of the S.U.V. had been drinking.
"I care more about the people who walk through my front door of my place and the issues that matter to them than anything going on in Washington," said Bradley Cook, the owner of the restaurant.
Many local leaders say the power of local newspapers was on display recently in Jesup, in southeastern Georgia. One of Mr. NeSmith's papers in the area, The Press Sentinel in Wayne County, discovered that an Arizona-based company backed by wealthy investors, including Bill Gates, had quietly applied to dump 10,000 tons of coal ash per day in Jesup.
The paper published more than 70 articles about the application, and Mr. NeSmith wrote several editorials. The attention led to public hearings, and the company, Republic Services, to delay its plans.
Many officials also say that without robust local coverage, they are constantly fighting against misinformation that spreads on social media. After the Board of Commissioners in Habersham County, Ga., proposed a bond issue to expand the county jail, speculation spread online about the motivations for the project and the burden for taxpayers, said Stacy Hall, the board's chairman. Voters defeated the proposal in November.
"Disinformation on social media is our No. 1 problem," Mr. Hall said. "There is a crisis in getting the facts -- the basic facts that only community newspapers can provide."
The proposed antitrust exemption for news organizations still faces hurdles. Congress passed few bills of note in 2019 -- and it may pass even fewer this year, in the face of impeachment and the November election. Conservative think tanks and some consumer groups are pushing back on the bill, wary of giving any antitrust exemptions to businesses.
"Instead of trying to innovate and find solutions that way," said Neil Chilson, a senior research fellow for technology and innovation at the Charles Koch Institute, "they are trying to make better deals with people with more money, and that doesn't solve their basic business-model problems."
Supporters of the legislation said it was not a magic pill for profitability. It could, they say, benefit newspapers with a national reach -- like The Times and The Washington Post -- more than small papers. Facebook, for instance, has never featured articles from Mr. NeSmith's newspaper chain in its "Today In" feature, an aggregation of local news from the nation's smallest papers that can drive a lot of traffic to a news site.
"It will start with larger national publications, and then the question is how does this trickle down," said Otis A. Brumby III, the publisher of The Marietta Daily Journal in Georgia.
But the supporters say it could stop or at least slow the financial losses at some papers, giving them time to create a new business model for the internet.
"The tech industry platforms benefit from our news," said Robin Rhodes, the executive director of the Georgia Press Association, which supports the proposal. "And we need to be on a level playing ground."

Texto completo: Kenneth Roth, executive director of the organization, said immigration officials turned him away at the airport in what some saw as the latest sign of deteriorating freedoms in the city.
HONG KONG -- The head of an international human rights group who had planned to criticize China's growing global influence at an event in Hong Kong said he was barred from entry on Sunday in the latest sign of eroding freedoms in the city.
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said he was turned away at Hong Kong International Airport after arriving from New York. Mr. Roth had planned to release a report by his group on Wednesday spotlighting repressive governments around the world, with a lead essay on what he described as China's deepening assault on international human rights efforts.
The barring of Mr. Roth, an American, from Hong Kong follows similar entry bans on a handful of journalists and human rights observers in recent years, raising concerns in a city that has long prided itself on upholding the democratic values of freedom of speech and information.
Hong Kong has been roiled by more than seven months of antigovernment protests rooted in anger at the encroachment of Chinese power on the semiautonomous territory. The local government is under pressure from the authorities in Beijing to restore order as well as defend its image abroad.
Human Rights Watch noted that Mr. Roth had previously visited Hong Kong many times, including in April 2018 to draw attention to a report on gender discrimination in the Chinese job market.
"It's sad testament to the deterioration in basic freedoms in Hong Kong that I would be barred less than two years later," he said by email.
He said officials told him he had been blocked for "immigration reasons." The Hong Kong Immigration Department said it would not comment on an individual case. A Chinese government office that oversees Hong Kong and Macau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hong Kong operates within China under a "one country, two systems" formula that promises the territory a high degree of autonomy, including independent courts, a free news media and extensive protections of civil liberties. It has traditionally been more welcoming to foreign journalists, scholars and human rights observers than the authorities in mainland China, who regularly bar entry and expel people over coverage of sensitive issues.
But in recent years, Hong Kong has been criticized for growing closer to the mainland in using immigration policy to bar those who have criticized the government or sought to discuss politically sensitive topics. Journalist organizations have also complained that the police have interfered with coverage of the protests, arresting reporters and hitting them with rubber bullets and pepper spray.
In 2018, the government expelled Victor Mallet, Asia news editor for the Financial Times, after he hosted a talk by the head of a since-banned political party that called for Hong Kong's independence from China. The talk was held at the Foreign Correspondents' Club, which regularly hosts speakers on various sides of prominent issues, but Beijing and local officials harshly criticized the club.
Matthew Connors, a photographer and professor at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design who had documented the protests, was denied entry in early January. He was arrested while documenting a demonstration in Hong Kong last year, but never charged.
The refusal to grant Mr. Roth access to Hong Kong came amid a sometimes violent protest movement in the territory, which has strained relations between the United States and China. President Trump signed legislation in November that authorized sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for human rights abuses. At the same time, Mr. Trump has been trying to negotiate a trade deal with Chinese leaders.
The strife has also created tensions in the professional sports world. In October, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, posted an image on Twitter supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and LeBron James faced backlash for saying that Mr. Morey "wasn't educated on the situation at hand."
In December, China announced it would impose "sanctions" against several pro-democracy nonprofit organizations based in the United States, including Human Rights Watch.
No further explanation of the so-called sanctions was given, the organization said on Sunday.
Mr. Roth said he landed in Hong Kong at about 2:30 p.m. Sunday, and four and a half hours later he was on a return flight to Newark.
"This disappointing action is yet another sign that Beijing is tightening its oppressive grip on Hong Kong and further restricting the limited freedom Hong Kong people enjoy under 'one country, two systems,"' Mr. Roth said in a written statement. "Concerned governments should take a firm stand against China's creeping repression that massive numbers of people have protested against for months."

Texto completo: In an interview with the local media, Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed regret but reiterated that economic concerns would still play a key role in climate policies.
SYDNEY, Australia -- Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia said on Sunday that he would call for a high-level government inquiry into the response to the country's devastating bushfires. But he did not signal a significant shift in policies to curb carbon emissions, as many had hoped.
The suggested inquiry, which Mr. Morrison proposed during a televised interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, came on the heels of news that a firefighter had died overnight in the state of Victoria, the site of some of the worst of the fires that have swept parts of Australia since October. At least 28 people have been killed in the fires.
Mr. Morrison and his government have been harshly criticized over their response to the monthslong crisis. The proposed inquiry, known as a royal commission, would look at that response, including the deployment of emergency services to deal with blazes that crossed state borders, streaked across mountain ranges and forced the evacuations of thousands of people along the country's eastern and southeastern shorelines.
The journalist who interviewed Mr. Morrison on Sunday, David Speers, said afterward that the prime minister's call for a "historic change," mostly involving how resources are used to combat disasters, fell short of what many Australians were hoping to hear: a plan for a significant shift in his government's policies to curb emissions and invest more in renewable energy.
This fire season has been the worst in Australia's recorded history, burning millions of acres of land and at least 3,000 homes. The number of wild animals killed because of the fires has been estimated at over half a billion and rising. At one point, Royal Australian Navy ships were dispatched to rescue people stranded on beaches after flames and deadly smoke blocked escape routes.
Mr. Morrison has declined to consider major changes to policies on renewable energy, fossil fuels and coal. The mining and export of coal are key industries in Australia's economy, and in his interview on Sunday, he reiterated that he would not put jobs at risk or raise taxes in the pursuit of lower carbon emissions.
Mr. Morrison has repeatedly said that enough was being done to curb emissions, particularly for a nation with Australia's relatively small population. But climate scientists say that the government's targets are low to begin with and that emissions have been rising under Mr. Morrison's government.
On Sunday, Mr. Morrison said Australia's "new normal" was a changing climate that would require the country to adopt better policies for disaster management and relief.
"These are the areas of climate change action that I think need greater attention, because they're the things that are practically affecting people's daily lives here in Australia, where we can do practical things that will make us more resilient and ensure that we're safer," he said.
"It isn't just restricted to bush fires," he said. "It deals with floods. It deals with cyclones. It deals with the drought, which is affected by these broader issues. Adaptation and resilience is key to that. Building dams is key to that. Native vegetation management is key to that. Land clearing is key to that. Where you can build homes is key to that."
"And that is as much a climate change response as emissions reduction," he said.
Some critics said that royal commissions, which can take a year or more to conclude, are often interpreted as a way for the government to delay meaningful action on a divisive subject.
"It's a fob-off -- they always are," said John Blaxland, a professor at the Australian National University in Canberra, the capital. "They give you a good 18 months of political grace for the issue to die down politically and then shelve it when it comes out."
Mr. Blaxland said such inquiries could also be cathartic, giving the government a way to demonstrate action and leadership, a quality that Mr. Morrison has been widely criticized as lacking in recent weeks.
In December, as firefighters battled worsening blazes, Mr. Morrison left for a vacation in Hawaii, returning only after nationwide outrage over his absence. On Sunday, he said that would not happen again.
"In hindsight, I would not have taken that trip knowing what I know now," he said. "I'd made a promise to my kids and we'd taken forward that break, as I explained when I came back, and I thought I was very upfront about my contrition on that."
During visits to some fire-ravaged areas shortly after his return from Hawaii, Mr. Morrison was harangued by residents of one town in a video that spread across the internet and social media.
Regardless of people's views of Mr. Morrison, a recent rule change within his conservative Liberal Party means that he will almost certainly remain prime minister for the next two and a half years, Professor Blaxland said.
Given the present crisis, Professor Blaxland said that Australians needed to rise above politics.
"Our circumstances are so dire, we can't afford to just continue to bicker," he said. "We have this cavalier approach to our security that's fostered and bred a political narcissism that we can no longer afford. We've got to rise above our petty differences and come up with solutions, not just for the next election but for our grandkids."

Texto completo: The "Young Pope" sequel series debuts on HBO. And Ruth Bader Ginsburg's story comes to Showtime.
What's on TV
THE NEW POPE 9 p.m. on HBO. Three years ago, the finale of "The Young Pope" concluded with the title character, Pius XIII (Jude Law), in a heart-attack-induced coma. Its sequel begins in the aftermath: St. Peter's Square is brimming with supporters praying for the contentious Pope Pius XIII's recovery while the Vatican, facing external pressures of its own, appoints a new pope. The new man on the job -- who goes by John Paul III -- is played by John Malkovich, whose iconic personality inspired the character, Phoebe Reilly writes for The New York Times. While John Paul III's serene temperament seems to balance out Pius's chaos, scandal still abounds in the new series.
THE GOOD DOCTOR 10 p.m. on ABC. For a brilliant surgeon whose autism makes emotional connection challenging, Dr. Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore) certainly finds himself in a difficult position when Season 3 of "The Good Doctor" picks up. His abusive father, who was on his deathbed in the winter finale, has died, and Shaun is exploring the joys and complications of his relationship with Carly (Jasika Nicole). Shaun's team must also operate on a patient who refuses anesthesia. While the show still falls under the category of medical melodrama, Shaun's condition, James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The Times, also invokes a deeper question: What does it means to be a "good" doctor?
What's Streaming
ON THE BASIS OF SEX (2018) Stream on Showtime and Sling TV; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. "This is, almost literally, the story of how Ginsburg found her voice," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. Directed by Mimi Leder, the film stars Felicity Jones as Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court Justice. Rather than reciting Ginsburg's biography, Leder focuses on the first sex-discrimination case she argued in federal court in the early 1970s, and on the development of a legal strategy to challenge injustices so deeply ingrained as to seem perfectly natural.Armie Hammer plays Marty, the ultimately supportive husband, and Cailee Spaeny is their inquisitive daughter, Jane; both help and challenge Ginsburg, who is dealing with her own experiences of sexism in day-to-day life.
CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG (1968) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This musical film adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1964 fantasy novel is, at its core, deeply strange and perfectly crafted for children. It stars Dick Van Dyke as Caractacus Potts, a widowed inventor who creates a magical car -- Chitty Chitty Bang Bang -- that can float and fly. Renata Adler wrote in her review for The Times that the movie contains "the joys of singing together on a team bus on the way to a game." It has everything from a number about candy, to an evil villain who snatches children, to a screenplay by Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes. Potts, his two children, and a beautiful woman named Truly Scrumptious brave it all with their "fine, four-fendered friend."

Texto completo: In his new book, the writer sought to create "something that was 100 percent pornographic and 100 percent high art."
Reading Garth Greenwell's new book, "Cleanness," you might sense a bit of déjà vu.
You might even feel, for a moment, that you're still reading his 2016 debut novel, "What Belongs to You." After all, they seem to share its unnamed narrator: a gay American man teaching in Sofia, Bulgaria.
"I opened it up at first and thought, Oh, more of the same," said Edmund White, an elder statesman of gay literature. "But then I thought, Well, nobody ever complained that Proust was more of the same."
Yet "Cleanness" -- out on Tuesday from Farrar, Straus & Giroux -- is not quite more of the same. While it bears surface-level similarities to "What Belongs to You," it is not even really a novel, nor is it a story collection.
"It's a lieder cycle," Greenwell said, borrowing a term from classical music. "That's what the ideal, platonic version of the book is in my head."
Indeed, the nine stories of "Cleanness" have the cohesion of a song cycle, the genre of Schubert's "Winterreise" and Schumann's "Dichterliebe." While they don't appear in chronological order, there is a symmetry to their organization, with a life-altering love affair rippling out from the center.
Greenwell, 41, has taken a long time, and tried out different roles, to find the artistic environment in which he has truly blossomed: prose, for which he has garnered widespread critical admiration, including a spot on the longlist for the National Book Award. But growing up in Louisville, Ky., he began as a singer, which earned him a spot at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan, and later, the prestigious Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y.
While there, in the mid-1990s, he befriended people who are now luminaries in contemporary classical music -- including Alan Pierson, the artistic director and conductor of the ensemble Alarm Will Sound, who described Greenwell as "fiercely devoted and very intense," with a literary approach to singing.
But he was also self-critical, and unsure of his future in performance. "Garth always wants to be the best," Pierson said, "and he always felt a little inadequate as a musician." Finding himself increasingly interested in poetry and literature, Greenwell decided to study them full time.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Frank Bidart, a mentor of Greenwell's and one of his teachers at the New York State Summer Writers Institute, recalled someone who was "serious and ambitious in a way most students aren't." Greenwell's poetry, he added, always aimed for more than mere description and "tested the idea of what poetry should be." Pierson, who keeps the poetry Greenwell has sent him over the years in a treasured Google Drive folder, said it contains "really beautiful language mixed with something deep from Garth's experience mixed with profound observations about human nature."
Greenwell followed his poetry practice to a Ph.D. program at Harvard, but left in his third year to become a high school teacher in Michigan and, eventually, Bulgaria. All the while, he continued to work on his poems, assembling what was shaping up to be a collection.
But Greenwell began to write prose, and, he said, "it destroyed my poems." Bidart felt as though Greenwell has found what he had been aiming at all along.
Greenwell wrote about topics that were rife with complication: desire, Bulgaria, privilege and at times a confluence of all three. It came together in a novella, "Mitko," which was published in 2011. That little book, he recalled, sold only a few hundred copies, but it fell into the hands of gay writers like White and Peter Cameron and was a Lambda Literary Award finalist.
"Mitko" would later become the opening section of "What Belongs to You," which expanded on the story of an American teacher's fraught relationship with a hustler picked up in a public bathroom. Greenwell added a second section -- an extended paragraph about internalized homophobia, shame and the narrator's father -- and a third to provide closure on the novel's initial plot.
The book was a career-maker in the United States, and a firecracker in Bulgaria, where homosexuality remains taboo and is extremely rare in literature. Greenwell expected scathing reviews and hate speech, but they never came. The first printing sold out within two days.
"For me, it was the literary event of the year," said Dimiter Kenarov, a journalist in Bulgaria who has become a close friend of Greenwell's. "Sometimes when foreigners come in, their vision of Bulgaria is very skewed, and the place is either romanticized or demonized. But Garth's writing presents the city I live in and the culture I live in so objectively and so humbly, with a real sense of depth. It's almost like I've been asleep in a city that he awakens me to."
By the time "What Belongs to You" was published, Greenwell had already completed four sections of what would become "Cleanness." From the start, he said, both books were "one project," though the world of his newer one is more expansive.
Physical gestures are enormously significant, each movement a germ of drama and scrutiny. "He'll make an assertion," White said, "then question it and turn it over and massage it." These passages in particular evoke Greenwell's former lives within his current prose: poetic lyricism, and comma splices deployed like musical phrasing.
Two chapters in "Cleanness" recount sexual encounters with unrelenting candor and earnestness. Greenwell said that he doesn't often give himself assignments but that here he wanted "to write something that was 100 percent pornographic and 100 percent high art."
Often, he said, pornography goes to great lengths to "expunge personhood" from people's bodies. He aimed to do the opposite, to show intimacy while exploring the ways in which S&M encounters make representations of power visible, and therefore malleable.
Greenwell's frankness in writing about sex has made for uncomfortable encounters with fans. Because he bears a resemblance to his protagonist, they often assume his writing is autobiographical. (It's not.) Someone once showed him a Facebook profile and asked whether it was one of his characters, and he has been sent explicit photos on social media.
In reality, Greenwell doesn't volunteer conversations about sex. He presents more modestly, and lives a settled-down life with his partner, the poet Luis Muñoz, who runs the Spanish-language M.F.A. program at the University of Iowa.
"If you would ask me seven years ago whether I would ever own a house, I would say no," Greenwell said. "I certainly would not be in Iowa City. And I certainly would not be in a life that had an affective center based on one person. It's been an interesting, pretty wondrous thing to be in a life that is different from anything I imagined for myself."
His next book won't be set in Bulgaria, but in Kentucky, where Greenwell has rediscovered Louisville and become fascinated by its gay history. So he isn't done writing about queer lives.
To some degree, that's because he doesn't buy into the dated belief that gay literature can't reach a wide audience -- a criticism once popular among critics and publishers. "That's just homophobia," he said, "and I refuse to treat it seriously."
"If there is a gay ghetto," Greenwell added, "then that's where James Baldwin is, and Thomas Mann is, and Virginia Woolf is, and that's the only place I would ever want to be. And that's not on the margins of the literary tradition: That's right at the heart of it."

Cancer Death Fell Sharply, And Trump Took Credit

Texto completo: President Trump's recent suggestion that his administration was responsible for the decline drew a rebuttal from the American Cancer Society, which published the findings.
When the American Cancer Society reported that the United States had experienced the sharpest one-year drop in cancer death rate ever recorded, it quickly caught the attention of President Trump.
"U.S. Cancer Death Rate Lowest In Recorded History!" the president said on Twitter on Thursday, one day after the organization reported the finding. "A lot of good news coming out of this Administration."
The rush to claim credit for the decline drew a gentle rebuttal from the cancer society, which said, in effect, that the president should not be patting himself on the back just yet.
The society's latest annual report on cancer statistics, released on Wednesday, noted that the death rate had dropped steadily over 26 years, from 1991 to 2017. The largest single-year decline ever reported, when the rate fell 2.2 percent, occurred from 2016 to 2017. (Mr. Trump took office in January 2017.)
"The mortality trends reflected in our current report, including the largest drop in overall cancer mortality ever recorded from 2016 to 2017, reflect prevention, early detection and treatment advances that occurred in prior years," Gary M. Reedy, the American Cancer Society's chief executive, said in a statement.
Experts attributed the decline in mortality to reduced smoking rates and to advances in lung cancer treatment. New therapies for melanoma of the skin have also helped extend life for many people with metastatic disease, or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.
Mr. Reedy said that, since taking office, the president had signed multiple spending bills that increased funding for cancer research at the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute. But, he said, "the impact of those increases are not reflected in the data contained in this report."
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.
Mr. Trump's critics pointed out that he had also proposed deep cuts in cancer research funding.
In his first budget in 2017, he called for a reduction of $ 5.8 billion, or 18 percent, from the National Institutes of Health, which fund thousands of researchers working on cancer and other diseases. Congress rejected the cuts and members of both parties joined forces to increase spending on biomedical research.
"Cancer rates dropped before you took office," Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, said on Twitter on Thursday, in response to the president's claim. "Hopefully they keep dropping because Congress rejected your cruel research budgets, which sought billions in CUTS to @NIH and the National Cancer Institute. This is good news despite you -- not because of you."
Mr. Trump has a history of taking credit for good news on his watch, bragging of his role in falling gas prices, the "safest year on record" in aviation, the Ethiopian prime minister's Nobel Peace Prize and what he perceived as the return to social acceptability of the greeting "merry Christmas."
In claiming credit for falling cancer death rates, the president was seeing his influence in a trend that the American Cancer Society said was driven by long-term drops in mortality for four major cancers -- lung, colorectal, breast and prostate.
The death rate for female breast cancer, for example, fell 40 percent from 1989 to 2017, while the death rate for prostate cancer dropped 52 percent from 1993 to 2017.
Although those trends largely preceded Mr. Trump's arrival in office, Mr. Reedy urged the president to continue to support the declines by increasing access to health care, ramping up funding for cancer research and enacting policies to lower smoking rates.
"The administration has an opportunity to significantly impact future declines in both cancer incidence and mortality," he said.

Texto completo: Behind the scenes of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," McFarland, a child psychologist, helped shape the groundbreaking show.
Overlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths were given little notice by The Times.
Nearly everyone knows about Fred Rogers, the beloved host of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" who taught millions of children about love, kindness and the magic of make believe. But far fewer people are familiar with Margaret McFarland, the child psychologist who mentored him and helped shape his groundbreaking television show.
Rogers first met McFarland in the 1950s, when he was a puppeteer and a producer on a Pittsburgh public television show called "The Children's Corner." During lunch breaks he attended classes to earn a master's degree in divinity.
When Rogers expressed an interest in learning about the psychology of children, one of his professors recommend that he meet McFarland, who was regarded as one of the most respected child psychologists in Pittsburgh.
She saw great potential in Rogers.
"Fred Rogers is a man who has not closed off the channels of communication between his childhood and his manhood," McFarland told The Washington Post in 1982. "Repression, you see, is not his major defense."
But she felt it was a disservice that "he worked off-camera, behind the scenes, manipulating his various puppets." So she told him: "Fred, the children need to see you. They need you to help them distinguish between reality and fantasy."
Rogers was ordained as a minister and was invited to appear as Mister Rogers on a show in Canada in the early 1960s. He returned to Pittsburgh in 1966 to start "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" on WQED-TV. The show aired for the first time nationally, on public television stations, in 1968. McFarland became his chief consultant.
She and Rogers met nearly every week to discuss scripts and songs that Rogers had written. Her advice became so valuable to Rogers that he took "extensive handwritten notes" and recorded their meetings on audiocassettes, "which I often overheard him replaying in his office," recalled Arthur Greenwald, a producer and writer who worked with Rogers.
She would work on the show for 20 years, and spoke regularly with Rogers until around her death in 1988. (Rogers died in 2003.)
"She will make just one suggestion, and it raises the whole level," Rogers told The Pittsburgh Press in 1987, adding that she was "an enormous influence on me."
His book "Mister Rogers Talks With Parents" (1983, with Barry Head) is dedicated to McFarland. And the creators of "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood," the modern-day animated spinoff of "Mister Rogers," honored McFarland by naming the main character's little sister Margaret.
Even though the show first aired more than a half-century ago, it still resonates. In 2018 a documentary about Rogers grossed more than $ 22 million, and last year he was portrayed by Tom Hanks in the acclaimed movie "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."
Margaret Beall McFarland was born on July 3, 1905, in Oakdale, Pa., a suburb of Pittsburgh, the youngest of three girls of Robert and Gertrude (Messer) McFarland. Her father died when she was 5, an event that would later pique her interest in child psychology.
"All of the subsequent phases of what it means to be loved by a male and loving to a male were lost to me," she told The Pittsburgh Press in 1987. "I wanted a kind of fathering."
She graduated from Goucher College in Baltimore in 1927, received her master's degree from Columbia University in 1928 and later earned her Ph.D. from Teachers College at Columbia University.
After graduating, she became principal of the Kindergarten Training College of Melbourne, Australia, then returned to the United States to serve as director of the children's school at Mount Holyoke College, a women's college in South Hadley, Mass., where she was promoted to associate professor of psychology in 1948.
She returned to her hometown in 1951 and was an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh when she met Rogers.
At the time, she was also working as the executive director of the Arsenal Family and Children's Center, a training ground for pediatric students to study child development; it was founded in 1953 by Benjamin Spock, the pediatrician and best-selling author. He and McFarland collaborated with Erik Erikson, the developmental psychologist known for coining the phrase "identity crisis." (Arsenal is now a preschool and social service agency.)
McFarland believed that an adequate understanding of child development was, as she wrote, "crucial in the solution of many of the problems with which man is grappling." She would often bring in a mother and child to her classroom, ask her students to observe their behavior, then spend hours afterward discussing their interactions.
McFarland was also fond of teaching by parable, gently guiding her students toward clarity by telling stories and asking questions rather than providing critiques. Her methods made a lasting impression.
"There was something very unique about the way she connected with people," said Judith A. Rubin, a therapist who helped people deal with trauma through art. Rubin worked with McFarland at the Arsenal Center and appeared as the "art lady" on "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" in the show's early years.
"I think she had Fred Rogers's capacity to make the person feel as if they were extremely important and interesting," she added.
Serious and reserved, McFarland was content to avoid the spotlight, even as "Mister Rogers" became a staple for generations of children. She preferred to be a "counterpart to the creative person," said Hedda B. Sharapan, a senior fellow at the Fred Rogers Center and a child development consultant at Fred Rogers Productions.
"She gave him the road map of child development and then said, 'Now you take the journey in the way that's right for your creative spirit,"' Sharapan said. "Fred somehow, with Margaret's help, was able to tap into his own childhood."
In 1979, during a symposium honoring Rogers, Erikson surprised her in front of more than 1,000 people at a banquet by acknowledging her research with a special presentation.
"We almost had to drag her out of the chair to stand up," Douglas Nowicki, a friend who is the chancellor of Saint Vincent College in Pennsylvania, said in a phone interview. "She would never have come if she had known in any way she was going to be recognized or honored."
Greenwald, the producer who often worked with Rogers, once suggested that they go out to lunch with friends to celebrate McFarland's birthday.
"Almost predictably, Margaret wouldn't hear of us making such a fuss, and instead invited us to her house, where she would prepare the lunch," he said. "We agreed, because why not? And because beneath that frail exterior was hundreds of years of stubborn Scottish-Presbyterian willfulness that you'd be crazy to mess with."
She loved to feed others. "How she found the time to create the fanciest cookies (in her own kitchen) I'll never know," Rogers wrote in an obituary about her.
McFarland never married or had children. She lived alone in the home in which she grew up, surrounded by her extensive book collection.
Later in life she learned she had myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow disease, but she continued conducting research, and was absorbed in the study of ego development as late as 1987.
News reports of her death at 83, on Sept. 12, 1988, were modest, much like McFarland herself. The New York Times, like several other major newspapers, published a brief obituary by The Associated Press. In Pittsburgh, however, original obituaries appeared in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Pittsburgh Press.
Her books, which numbered in the thousands, were donated to Saint Vincent College, where the Fred Rogers Center was established in 2003, the year of Rogers' death.

Texto completo: He almost single-handedly started the rush for the first wines of the Beaujolais harvest.
Georges Duboeuf, who transformed a quaint Beaujolais harvest ritual celebrating the year's first wine into the global phenomenon of Beaujolais Nouveau, in the process turning his family's small business into a worldwide powerhouse, died on Jan. 4 at his home in Romanèche-Thorins, France. He was 86.
His son, Franck, said the cause was a stroke.
Mr. Duboeuf was already a successful Beaujolais merchant in the 1970s when he set out to mass-market the local tradition of making primeur, a quick, joyous wine born of the year's new grapes.
Many wine regions enjoyed a similar harvest ritual, a festive local practice among friends and colleagues. Beaujolais was an especially enjoyable wine to drink young. It was fresh and easy in a way that, say, young Bordeaux, with tannins that could be unpleasantly astringent, was not.
A thriving local market existed for the young wine. It expanded to the Paris bistros in the 1950s, when distributors began to compete in a race to see who could deliver the first bottles to the capital.
Beginning at 12:01 a.m. on the mid-November day that it became legal to ship the new wine, cartons were loaded onto trucks, and off they went as eager revelers waited. The official release date shifted from year to year, but the authorities eventually settled on the third Thursday of November.
Mr. Duboeuf took this annual race and, through energetic and endless promotion, turned it into much more. He enlisted countless French chefs, restaurants and celebrities to the cause.
A crucial ingredient in the promotion was a dollop of suspense. As the clock struck 12:01, Mr. Duboeuf made sure that cases and cases of the wine were loaded onto trucks, ships and eventually jets for shipment around the world, all duly recorded by cameras. The fact that much of the wine had been shipped in advance was irrelevant to the fun.
"Le Beaujolais Nouveau est arrivé" became an exultant international catchphrase. Television commercials would show the wine being delivered to, by Beaujolais standards, the remotest corners of the earth.
It was particularly popular in the United States in the 1970s and '80s, where that November Thursday coincided with the run-up to Thanksgiving. The wine was marketed as an especially good match for turkey.
As popular as nouveau became, not everybody embraced it. Frank J. Prial, The New York Times's longtime wine columnist, referred to the annual hype as "the silly season."
"As a wine it's so-so; as a marketing gimmick, it's one of the great triumphs of our time," he wrote of Beaujolais Nouveau in 1988.
While Beaujolais Nouveau made up a big part of Mr. Duboeuf's business, Les Vins Georges Duboeuf, it was far from all of it.
With a deep-seated, almost microscopic knowledge of the landscape of Beaujolais farmers and producers, a passion for communicating the singular, joyous nature of Beaujolais and a reputation as a great wine taster, Mr. Duboeuf was able to identify and purchase top-quality grapes and wines. He eventually bought vineyards as well.
Aside from nouveau, his budget-priced, reliably fruity Beaujolais, packaged with bright floral labels, was ubiquitous. He also offered more serious bottles, usually single-vineyard wines from the crus of Beaujolais -- 10 villages in the north of the region thought to have characteristics distinctive enough that their names, like Morgon and Fleurie, became appellations.
Although sometimes called Mr. Beaujolais, he was not technically from that region in eastern France.
Georges Duboeuf was born on April 14, 1933, in Crêches-sur-Saône, just east of northern Beaujolais, and grew up in Chaintré, a nearby town in the Mâconnais region, white wine territory.
His parents, Jean-Claude and Antonia, were vintners who had a small chardonnay vineyard in the Pouilly-Fuissé region. As was typical, they sold their wine in bulk to merchants, who blended it with their other purchases and bottled it under their own names.
His father died when Georges was 2, and Georges's older brother, Roger, took charge of the family business, helped by an uncle. Young Georges eventually joined his brother in tending the enterprise. While their roles overlapped, Roger gravitated toward making the wine and Georges toward selling it.
As recounted in Rudolph Chelminski's 2007 biography of Mr. Duboeuf, "I'll Drink to That: Beaujolais and the French Peasant Who Made It the World's Most Popular Wine," the quality-minded brothers did not like to see their carefully made wines blended with those of producers whose methods were not so painstaking. Perhaps, they thought, they could bottle their wine and sell it themselves.
Though still a teenager, Mr. Duboeuf took a couple of sample bottles of their Pouilly-Fuissé and rode by bicycle to the town of Thoissey, where he left them with Paul Blanc, chef of the Michelin-starred restaurant Le Chapon Fin. Mr. Blanc not only bought the wine; he asked Mr. Duboeuf if he could make red wines that were just as good.
The challenge set Mr. Duboeuf on a path that led him to a collaboration with Alexis Lichine, an American wine expert, merchant and writer, who had bought a chateau in Bordeaux and had set about building a larger wine business. In looking for a representative in Beaujolais, Mr. Lichine identified young Mr. Duboeuf as a comer and hired him to find good wines to bottle under the Lichine label.
When, in a few years, Mr. Lichine decided to focus instead on his Bordeaux business, Mr. Duboeuf already had the relationships and the reputation to step in and establish his own label.
By then he had married, moved to the village of Romanèche-Thorins in Beaujolais and started a family. In addition to his son, who now runs the wine business, he is survived by his wife, Rolande; a daughter, Fabienne Lacombe; and four grandchildren. Roger Duboeuf died in 2006.
Because of Mr. Duboeuf's close identification with the Beaujolais Nouveau fad, he bore some criticism when its popularity waned in the United States in the 1990s, throwing the Beaujolais region into a crisis. The style of his inexpensive wines, a sort of candied fruitiness, was also assailed.
The percentage of the region's grapes that went into nouveau was so high -- as much as 60 percent of the basic Beaujolais appellation in 1988 -- that when its popularity faded, growers were left with an oversupply, and the public was stuck with an image of Beaujolais as a place with insipid wine.
By 2005, the crisis was full-blown. Vineyards were abandoned, as growers could not afford to harvest grapes that they could not sell. The public seemed to have turned its back on a wine it had once embraced.
Through it all, Mr. Duboeuf remained optimistic. He said in 2007 that the problem was a glut of inexpensive wine in a world of diminishing wine consumption. He believed that, if steps were taken to raise quality, the price of Beaujolais would rise, too.
He was correct, in a way. In the United States today, the high-end cru wines of Beaujolais are popular and selling for prices unheard-of 20 years ago. The market for nouveau has never rebounded.
In later years, Mr. Duboeuf took on an elder statesman role. He oversaw the construction of a wine museum in Romanèche-Thorins, and saw his company expand beyond Beaujolais, selling wine from Languedoc, for example.
Slender and ramrod straight, with a puff of white hair, often with a pastel-colored cashmere sweater draped over his shoulders, Mr. Duboeuf remained a venerated figure in Beaujolais, even to those who criticized his wines or his marketing efforts. And he retained a belief in the essential goodness and modesty of Beaujolais.
"We are not so pretentious to think we produce the same as a grand Bordeaux or Burgundy," he said in 2007, "but we try to do the best we can in the spirit and the culture of our wines."

Texto completo: The move by SEA/SEIU Local 1984 stood in contrast to its national affiliate's decision so far to stay neutral in the presidential race.
A local union branch of New Hampshire state and local employees said Sunday that it had voted to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic presidential nomination, another labor endorsement for a candidate whose political stock continues to rise less than a month before the Iowa caucuses.
The endorsement, which will officially be made on Monday, is particularly notable because the union chapter, SEA/SEIU Local 1984, has acted separately from its national affiliate organization, the Service Employees International Union. That group, which represents about two million workers nationally, has remained neutral in the endorsement process up to this point, balancing relationships with multiple candidates and regional concerns that differ across local chapters.
But the New Hampshire chapter wanted to use its political firepower to back Mr. Sanders in time for the state's first-in-the-nation primary, Rich Gulla, the local president, said in a statement. About 10,000 workers across the state are represented by the union's collective bargaining contract.
The chapter also voted to endorse Mr. Sanders during the 2016 presidential election -- even as the national organization backed his rival and the eventual Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
"Senator Sanders has taken the time to stand with us on multiple occasions," Mr. Gulla said, citing a joint news conference that state workers held with Mr. Sanders in December. "This type of unwavering dedication to New Hampshire's workers means that we can trust him to have our backs. For these reasons and more, we are thrilled to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for president."
Both the 2016 primary and general elections for president disrupted many labor organizations and the political process that governs their endorsements. Several groups experienced a split between rank-and-file members and union leadership, emblematic of the larger grass-roots and establishment split that has roiled both political parties in recent years.
As a consequence, many labor organizations have been more transparent, democratic and prudent about their endorsement process in this election cycle. At SEIU, which endorsed Mrs. Clinton in November 2015, well before the Iowa caucuses, there are few plans to back an individual candidate before early-state voting begins in 2020.
Leaders have instead established a lengthy interview process for candidates that includes embracing a "Unions for All" agenda and walking for a day with SEIU members. According to union organizers who were familiar with Local 1984's process, the national group's board was aware that the local was set to endorse Mr. Sanders ahead of the state primary, and did not discourage it from doing so.
It is unclear whether other local chapters will now become more involved in the presidential race. In a statement, Sara Lonardo, a spokeswoman for the national union, said, "SEIU members are paying close attention to this race and are still evaluating candidates on their plans to put power back in the hands of working families and give all working people the ability to join together in unions, no matter where they work"
Ms. Lonardo said. "We will continue engaging our members nationwide to determine who they see as the best candidate for our union to endorse."
Mr. Sanders has increasingly gathered grass-roots support in recent months, as the Democratic Party's left wing has rallied around his candidacy. In October, Mr. Sanders announced endorsements from popular House Democrats including Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. He has also gained the backing of labor organizations like National Nurses United and left-wing advocacy groups including the Center for Popular Democracy Action and People's Action.
Last week, he earned the backing of two progressive issue-focused groups: Dream Defenders, a Florida-based collection of activists that focuses on criminal justice reform, and the Sunrise Movement, a group made up of young climate activists.

To the Editor:
Re "Why Are Young Americans Killing Themselves?," by Richard A. Friedman (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Jan. 6):
While I appreciate Dr. Friedman's effort to call attention to the epidemic of suicide among young people in this country, I can't help but be frustrated by the simplicity of his plan to address it. First, and perhaps most challenging, we need to address some of the underlying causes: a profoundly broken economy that robs young people of opportunities for a healthy and productive life, a constant news cycle full of dire predictions, and, of course, access to lethal means like guns.
But second, Dr. Friedman's assertion that a visit to a family physician or therapist and medication are the first steps to treatment ignores the fact that we face a dire shortage of medical professionals, especially psychiatrists like Dr. Friedman himself, who can properly prescribe medication and provide accompanying therapy -- the combination proven most effective in treating both depression and anxiety.
"What are we waiting for?" Dr. Friedman asks. Probably a callback from the one psychiatrist within hundreds of miles who is taking new patients.

To the Editor:
It seems extraordinary that in a time of relentless school shootings and obvious evidence of climate change that the depression of teenagers is attributed to media and drugs rather than the failure of politicians to care about America's children and their future.
Chandra Mukerji

To the Editor:
Richard A. Friedman calls attention to the very disturbing problem of significant increases in youth suicide and depression. His solution -- depression screening and better access to pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy -- is a good start. However, it does not address the causes of young people's depression and despair: the isolation, cyber-preoccupation and bullying he mentions, and the feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty that fuel and compound them.
What is needed are school programs that teach self-awareness and self-care and offer group support, for teachers and parents as well as all students -- programs that create a communitywide culture of wellness.
Teaching kids to use meditation techniques to reduce their stress and teaching them ways to express their feelings and thoughts in words, drawings and movement will give them greater understanding of, and control over, disturbing emotions.
These approaches improve mood, sleep and focus, decrease anxiety, and make kids feel more competent and hopeful. When they share their challenges and their successes in safe, supportive groups, they overcome the terrible loneliness that contributes so significantly to depression.

The writer, a psychiatrist, is the author of "The Transformation: Discovering Wholeness and Healing After Trauma."
To the Editor:
A 2019 University of Michigan study showed that previously suicidal teens were more likely to be alive 11 to 14 years later if the adults caring for them received education about depression and suicide. Parents are the most likely to recognize that their teen is depressed, most motivated to act and most able to harness resources to help their teen get well.
Too many parents feel immobilized because they don't know how to talk to their teen or find treatment and services. Something as accessible as a webinar or workshop on teen depression can get parents on the right track to supporting their teen.
While social stigma and a shortage of mental health professionals for adolescents are potential barriers, having a parent to advocate for their care and provide emotional support can mean the difference between life and death for a teen.

Texto completo: She endured the horrors of the African-American experience -- lynchings, riots, the Ku Klux Klan -- and worked to ensure that they never slipped from collective memory.
Mamie Lang Kirkland died last month at her home in upstate New York. She was the mother of nine, the matriarch of another 158, a longtime saleswoman for Avon Products, and, at the time of her death, at 111, the oldest resident of Buffalo.
That only begins to describe Ms. Kirkland.
She was also the embodiment of the African-American experience of the 20th century, her life's long journey altered repeatedly by the racial violence and bigotry coursing through the United States. Lynchings, riots, the Ku Klux Klan -- she survived it all, and spent her centenarian years working to ensure that these realities never slipped from collective memory.
Her life helped inspire the creation, in 2018, of the Legacy Museum and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, in Montgomery, Ala. Both document the country's history of racial terrorism and encourage social justice.
Ms. Kirkland figures in two of the exhibits, said Sia Sanneh, a senior attorney with the Equal Justice Initiative, the nonprofit that started the memorials. "Her life was such an inspiration to us," Ms. Sanneh said. "It embodied all those things."
Mamie Lang was born on Sept. 3, 1908, in the rural Mississippi town of Ellisville, the daughter of Edward Lang, a laborer and fledgling minister, and Rochelle (Moore) Lang, who minded the family's rented home. Ms. Kirkland would remember the large peach tree in the yard, and the strange brew concocted by her grandmother that saved her from a typhomalarial fever when she was near death at age 5.
When she was about 7, her father awakened the family to announce that it was time to leave -- some local white men were preparing to lynch him and his friend, John Hartfield. The two men slipped out of town that night; Rochelle and the five Lang children, including a nursing baby, escaped by train in the morning.
The family friend, Mr. Hartfield, eventually returned to Ellisville, and in the summer of 1919 he was accused of raping a white woman. Some townspeople set a date for his lynching, a public event that the governor of Mississippi claimed he was powerless to prevent. At an appointed time announced in The Jackson Daily News, crowds gathered near a large gum tree beside the train tracks. There Mr. Hartfield was strung up and hanged, after which his body was riddled with bullets and burned. Body parts became souvenirs.
"Could have been my father," Ms. Kirkland said in an interview with The New York Times in 2015.
Though the Lang family had fled to East St. Louis, Ill., they still could not outrun the racist violence. In 1917, white men responded to the pressures of changing demographics and job competition by rioting in black neighborhoods, burning down homes and shooting residents. Dozens died, thousands were left homeless, and 9-year-old Mamie was seared by the memory of seeing a deaf man shot dead because he could not hear an order to halt.
The family moved again, this time to Alliance, Ohio, reflecting another aspect of the black experience: the Great Migration of the last century, when six million African-Americans left the rural South for the urban Northeast and Midwest -- some seeking economic opportunity, others hoping to escape racial terrorism.
Sometimes it followed them north.
In Alliance, in the 1920s, members of the Ku Klux Klan -- whose rallies were casually announced in the local press -- came to the family's home, hoods donned and torches afire, to burn a cross on their lawn. The Langs always wondered what would have happened if armed white neighbors hadn't arrived to chase away the aggressors.
At 15, Mamie married an itinerant railroad worker named Albert Kirkland, and the couple moved to Buffalo. He found work as a grinder at the Pratt & Letchworth plant; she gave birth to nine children, six of whom reached adulthood, and immersed herself in the First Shiloh Baptist Church, of which she was a foundational member.
After her husband died in 1959, Ms. Kirkland worked as a domestic helper and babysitter before becoming a door-to-door saleswoman for Avon. She never learned to drive, and often attributed her longevity to her faith and those many years walking the Buffalo streets selling beauty products. She was still taking orders until a few weeks before her death on Dec. 28, according to her son Tarabu Betserai Kirkland.
Mr. Kirkland, her youngest child at 70, said that his mother's experience with Avon helped her to shed her shyness and embrace her ability to connect with people. Over time, he said, she became a kind of door-to-door life coach.
"Folks didn't want her to leave the house," Mr. Kirkland said in a phone interview this week. "She would help them figure out ways to manage."
But there was one place that Ms. Kirkland refused to visit: the state of her birth, where the terror of racism had scarred her childhood. She often said that she didn't even want to see Mississippi on a map.
Her son had been nudging her to tell her life's powerful story, and in 2015 he showed her a report by the Equal Justice Initiative called "Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror." It included an image of an old newspaper's headline: "John Hartfield Will Be Lynched By Ellisville Mob at 5 O'Clock This Afternoon."
"We had never seen anything documented about John Hartfield," Mr. Kirkland said. "For a long time we didn't know if it was fact or fiction. But then she pointed to my laptop and said, 'That's him.' And chills went up my back."
A few months later, Ms. Kirkland returned to Ellisville with her son, who has been working on a documentary film about his mother's journey. It was an emotional visit to a place that seemed to have erased the Hartfield lynching from memory. Ms. Kirkland took time to pray at the approximate spot where a mob had killed her father's friend.
"She always maintained this level of grace and forgiveness," Mr. Kirkland said. "I'm not sure I could do that."
In addition to her son, Ms. Kirkland's survivors include her daughters Juanita Hunter, Beatrice Kirkland, Margaret Kirkland and Jeanette Clinton.
In 2016, the Equal Justice Initiative honored Ms. Kirkland at a fund-raising gala in Manhattan. She and her son worked for weeks on her short speech, in which she planned to tell the young people in the audience that stories like hers needed to be told again and again; that stories like hers were just as important now as they were a century ago; that she should know, because she had been there.
Her speech reflected a resilient optimism; a determination to triumph over tribulation. "I left Mississippi a scared little girl of 7 years old," Ms. Kirkland said at the event. "Now I'm 107 -- and I'm not frightened anymore."
Organizers fretted about how their guest would ascend to the stage, and they offered her a wheelchair. She declined, saying that she intended to walk on her own.
And she did.
Photograph Mamie Lang Kirkland swore she would never return to Mississippi, her birth state, where racism had scarred her childhood. But nudged by a son, Tarabu Betserai Kirkland, she did visit Ellisville, Miss., in 2015. Below left, Ms. Kirkland, with Tarabu, left, and other relatives and supporters, prayed for John Hartfield, a family friend who was lynched in the town in 1919.

Texto completo: When novelist Joanna Kavenna was recently asked what subject she found most challenging to write about, she answered: 'General Reality. What is it? Who decides? Is it just the physical things we can see and touch? Atoms, no atoms? Thoughts only when they become deeds? Whose thoughts? (Whose deeds?)' Her newest novel, 'Zed,' doesn't answer these questions, but rather asks them over and over again, until what begins as a familiar addition to the dystopian or techno-horror genres becomes far stranger and more appealing.
There are notes of both 'Catch-22' and '1984' in 'Zed,' although where the first two focus on government control and endless war, the latter centers on government control and a technocratic corporation called Beetle. By 2023, Beetle, founded by Guy Matthias, has become so integral to the smooth running of Western society that it's basically taken over, using predictive algorithms not only to help people shop for the right things but also to arrest them for future crimes. The 'Custodians Program' tracks everyone through their BeetleBands " obligatory smartwatches without which people are 'unverified' and thus uninsurable and virtually unemployable " as well as various smart appliances, self-driving taxi fleets and ubiquitous cameras. Beetle is, of course, committed to maintaining a fair and free democratic society with plenty of choices for everyone. In fact, when meeting with Beetle's Chinese counterpart, Baoguan, Guy Matthias becomes upset about how far ahead Baoguan's AI predictive technology is, especially because 'the Chinese intended, with these sorts of protocols, to control their populations, rather than merely inspiring them to make more fulfilling choices, for themselves and wider society.'
This kind of ironic statement is par for the course among Kavenna's often humorous descriptions. Additionally, Very Intelligent Personal Assistants (or Veeps) have names like Scrace Dickens and Little Dorrit; a simplified version of speech that eliminates the messiness of nuance by stripping away superfluous words is called Bespoke; and virtual reality is marketed by Beetle as Real Virtuality. But Kavenna's cleverness doesn't come at the expense of the book's depth (and I was impressed at her restraint, for example, in managing to avoid the term 'Beetlemania'). Rather, her wit helps ease readers into what becomes a novel of ideas.

The story begins when an ordinary man named George Mann does something utterly unpredictable: He kills his wife and children, before wandering along the Thames and falling asleep on a bench. None of the algorithms predicted this, and it's a PR nightmare for Beetle, which is supposed to prevent such unpleasantness. The mess is compounded when a robotic cop shoots Lionel Bigman, an innocent bystander and military veteran who happened to be sitting at a table recently vacated by George Mann. Of course, Beetle claims that Bigman intended to be killed, which means the 'robohacks' in the media report the murder as 'another poor civilian [committing] suicide by droid.'
As more events, alternately violent and seemingly meaningless, unfold beyond the predictive abilities of any algorithm, Beetle's employees begin to label such events as 'category Zed.' The company tries to explain that Zed events don't count, because they weren't predicted, and thus, obviously, were impossible to predict, which means that Beetle isn't really at fault for anything, even if its own machines are out there shooting people, because the fault belongs to people getting shot for being unpredictable. Zed, in other words, is a way to explain that human beings don't always make sense.
For all the insights we have into human behavior through psychology and science and algorithms, we are not machines. George Mann's desire to kill his wife and sons rather than let them keep living in what he saw as a doomed world makes no more sense than Guy Matthias suppressing the free press while convincing himself that he believes in democratic ideals and equality. We can no more easily explain the depths at which we feel the loss of a loved one or the lengths we'll go to fight for freedom. Definitive answers are dangerous, 'Zed' suggests; but in asking the questions, perhaps, we come to understand something about being messy, uncertain and human.

Texto completo: January is the traditional time gardeners read seed catalogs. There’s nothing to do outside but maybe prune a few dormant shrubs and trees. It’s also my favorite time to read garden books, old and new.
New “Home Grown Gardening” series
Last year, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt started sending me volumes from their new series, “Home Grown Gardening” and I’m finally getting around to reading them. So far, the series has four installments. They are mostly derived from books published around 1999, several from the Taylor’s Weekend Guide series.
All the books feature detailed introductions and pages and pages of lush new photos, on average one plant per page.
“Container and Fragrant Gardens” is derived from two previous works by Peter Loewer, a prolific garden author in North Carolina.
The plants in the container section are all listed as perennials, including small trees, though in our area, those in Zones 6 and up would be considered annuals. The fragrant part of the book includes annuals and perennials. They could be grown in containers, too.
“Best Perennials for Sun and Shade” is another combination of two books featuring two pages per plant – a nearly larger-than-life photo on one and growing information on the second. What I like is the little box for each plant that sums up growing zone, bloom time, light requirement, height and “interest” – leaf and flower description – in case you hadn’t noticed the full-page photo opposite.
“Best Roses, Herbs, and Edible Flowers” could conceivably have some of the same plants as the previous books. In addition to pages of luscious closeups, there is a chapter on harvesting and preserving herbs.
“Attracting Birds and Butterflies” is a derivation of author Barbara Ellis’s previous work. It is supplemented with excerpts from books published by Bird Watcher’s Digest.
In addition to plant profiles, there’s a page apiece for each butterfly and bird species that appreciates flower nectar. What I like is the critter profiles include a range map so you can concentrate on attracting the species you might see where you garden. However, the western birds profiled don’t include the seed eaters that also visit Cheyenne gardens.
For growing information for perennials – roses, herbs, flowers, shrubs, you would be better off consulting local information – don’t add lime to our soil as recommended in one of the books! And if you are growing our native perennials, don’t try to turn your soil into deep loam as suggested – our hardy prairie flowers don’t think much of luxury.
Old “Garden Gossip”
My favorite winter garden reading is much older garden books. I find them at used bookstores and the local Delta Kappa Gamma annual book sale.
In Houston I found “Garden Gossip, Chronicles of Sycamore Valley” by Dorothy Biddle, editor of Garden Digest, and Dorothea Blom. It was published in 1936 with a price of $1. It was signed by the author as “Dorothy Biddle Johnson” in June of that year.
Informally, this column I write is known as “Garden Gossip” and the online archive is www.CheyenneGardenGossip.wordpress.com, so I couldn’t resist bringing the book home – for $20.
A small book, it has only a few plates of black and white photos inserted, but every chapter heading has a detailed ink sketch. And the chapters seem to be gossip, for instance “Color, Drama and Tomatoes, Mrs. L’s Garden.”
But the cover’s inside flap writeup suggests the people and gardens profiled may be serving an educational purpose, “Through the successes and mistakes of Sycamore Valley gardeners the reader receives a wealth of suggestions, many of which he will apply in his own garden.”
The mythical Sycamore Valley is probably based on Dorothy Biddle’s hometown of Pleasantville, New York, so I take the 85-year-old gardening advice with advisement. But the generalities still work.
For instance, Mr. and Mrs. B manage to make a lovely garden on a very limited budget. Dorothy writes, “Gardeners crave a little money to bury in the soil, but what happened in their garden happened almost entirely from labor and thought blended.” Now there’s a statement that can stand the test of time.
Dorothy Biddle was also Mrs. Walter Adams Johnson. Her co-author, Dorothea Blom, was her daughter. Dorothy founded the Blue Ribbon Flower Holder Company (one of her other books is “How to Arrange Flowers”) and when I checked a couple years ago, her granddaughter still owned the business. Dorothy died in 1974 at age 87, garnering an obituary in the New York Times.

ON SAFARI, IN LUXURY

Texto completo: Headnote Five new camps offer a sumptuous, sustainable nature experience
Safari camps are the stuff of dreams and bucket lists. They can also be leaders in conservation, sustainability, design, eco-sensitivity and hospitality.
Take Kisawa Sanctuary, set to open next summer on an island off the coast of Mozambique. The construction of the marine safari camp incorporated 3D sand printing, along with traditional weaving, thatching and textile work. Care was also taken not to disturb the orcas, humpback whales and manta rays in the surrounding waters.
Or consider Natural Selection's Kwessi Dunes Lodge, due to open next spring in Namibia's staggeringly vast desert wilderness. Each bedroom will feature a "star gazer" room so guests can take in the night sky.
There's also Meridian Adventure SAIL, an ocean safari via six fancy catamarans - based in the pristine coral triangle of Raja Ampát, Indonesia - that leaves almost no footprint at all.
As places to glimpse creatures great and small, or as gateways to the back of beyond (where you can seriously get away from it all), safari camps may be the ultimate hotel. Here are five prospects, all outstanding in their field.
Singita Kwitonda Lodge
On 178 acres at the edge of Volcanoes National Park in northwestern Rwanda, this new lodge sits close to the habitat of one-third of the world's remaining mountain gorillas. It opened in August as the 15th in Singita's collection of conservation-focused and sustainably minded lodges, often used by bluechip travel outfits such as Red Savannah.
The eight suites (plus a private villa) are done up in worldly African elegance, with indoor and outdoor fireplaces, heated plunge pools, woven ceilings and hand-fired brick work (by local artisans), along with views of the Sabyinyo, Gahinga and Muhabura volcanoes from window seats and deep bathtubs.
An unusual amenity: a nursery that so far has provided some 250,000 trees and shrubs as part of the company's reforestation effort to protect and preserve the silverbacks and their families.
Singita Kwitonda Lodge; from $1,495 per person per night (including meals and laundry service but not the $1,500 gorilla trekking permit); Ruhengeri, Rwanda.
Thanda Safari
This Big Five compound inside a 34,000-acre private game reserve began as the site of the Swedish owner's family villa. It has grown to include a series of suites surrounding a central lodge and an encampment of 15 tents - rustic but deluxe - secluded in a thicket of wilderness in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
With canvas walls and wooden floors that extend to outdoor decks, the west-facing tents take full advantage of nature - from sunsets to the sounds of the bush. (There are around 400 bird species to take in here.) Gravel pathways lead from the tents to a common, open-air lounge with a high-beamed ceiling that overlooks a sleek swimming pool and fire pit, where guests can trade stories of the day's sightings.
The black rhino and cheetah can be elusive, but there are spindly giraffes and young zebra dotting the landscape, and herds of elephants trundle along to the watering hole at cocktail hour.
Thanda Safari; from $265 per person per night (including meals and two game drives per day); D242 Rd, 3960, South Africa.
Wilderness Safaris Mombo
Built in 1990, Wilderness Safaris' flagship - at the northern end of Chief's Island in the Moremi Game Reserve, in Botswana's Okavango Delta - has recently unveiled a $10 million renovation.
The project was to bring the traditional camp up to design and environmental standards without disturbing the natural habitat. (An arborist, for example, was enlisted to oversee the protection of trees and roots.)
Behind the scenes, Mombo is now 100% solar powered, with sophisticated sewage and water filtration systems. More obvious is the English oak, from managed forests in Croatia, used for guest-room floors; Iroko hardwood from West Africa for doors and windows; and plenty of original materials repurposed here and there (and at the company's other camps on the continent).
The nine tented suites are big, with a sitting room and bar, separate bathrooms and dressing rooms, indoor and outdoor showers, and sliding louvered shutters that open onto an ample deck, from which to spy the exotic wildlife just out of reach.
An eclectic mix of local grasses and fabrics, brass, copper, wooden furniture - Pygmy beds from Congo used as coffee tables - and cracked-leather headboards give the spaces a sense of globe-trotting chic.
Wilderness Safari Mombo; $2,200 per person per night (including all meals, game drives and park fees); Okavango Delta, Botswana.
Banjaar Tola, a Taj Safari Lodge
The latest of four lodges set up by Taj in association with the travel company &Beyond, this is a good headquarters for tiger-spotting and bird-watching. It sits alongside the Banjaar River at the foot of Kanha National Park (a reserve that is part of a tiger-protection program) in India, with 18 tented huts arranged in east and west camps, each group with its own bar, dining room and pool.
Inside, there are woven bamboo on the walls and raised bed frames, wrought-iron furnishings, art from the nearby Indian state of Chhattisgarh, a soaking tub in the bright bathrooms, ar.d sliding glass doers tnat open onto decks at the water's edge. In the morning, discreet butlers will del.ver coffee or tea via sm all hatches.
Banjaar Tola, A Taj Safari Lodge; from about $410 per night 'including breakfast and naturalist guide); Kanha National Park, Madhya Pradesh, India.
Nayara Tented Camp
Opened in December, this air-conditioned tent camp changes :he luxury game in Costa Rica. It was designee by Luxury Frontiers - the architects noted in Africa for camps such as Zambia's Puku Ridge and Botswana'» Belmond Savute Elephant Lodge - as its first foray into the Americas.
Each fabric-roofed, 750-square-foc t villa has canvas walls, s uspended floors, a tropical modern interior design (see the mosquito netting on the four poster bed and the botanical mural behind it) and an ontdoor deck with a plunge pool filled by local hot springs.
Set in the Arenal Volcano National Park, the camp shares 62 acres with its sister properties, Nayara Gardens and Nayara Springs, all connected by suspended footbridge, or golf cart, if you must. The company has reserved a patch oí the resort's land as a refuge fc r the sloth (the strange, smiling star of the rainforest) and has begun to plant Guaru mo trees to attract and proiect them.
Nayara Tented Camp; from around Îl,200 per night (including breakfast and mor ning yoga); Arenal Volcano National Park, Alajuela Province, San Carlos, Costa Rica.

Texto completo: Who exactly was it the United States killed on Jan. 3 that sparked a ramp-up of aggression between Iran and the U. S.?
Was it Qassem Soleimani?
Was it Qassim Suleimani?
Or was it Qasem Soleimani?
It depends which news source you read.
The first spelling is courtesy of The Associated Press. The "Qasem" variation is employed by The Washington Post.
The New York Times has been going with something completely different: "Qassim Suleimani."
The Daily Herald subscribes to both The Associated Press and Washington Post wire services, so we had to settle on one spelling for consistency. We decided to run with "Qassem Soleimani" because AP is our dominant source for world and national news and because we adhere to The Associated Press Stylebook (for the most part).
We were having this very conversation as Iran started launching rockets at the Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq, which houses U.S. troops.
The issue of the proper spelling of the Iranian general’s name doesn’t hold a candle to the gravity of the story at hand, but as a newspaper we sweat the details, too.
I can’t imagine Iranians are having a lot of trouble spelling the man’s name right. That’s because they spell it as he did — in Arabic, a language that has an alphabet different from ours.
In case you forgot, our 26 letters are not the "English" alphabet but the "Latin" or "Roman" alphabet.
Changing words or names from one language to another without benefit of a shared alphabet is called "transliteration."
It’s a predictable way to convert one character to another character or characters rather than by converting sounds, which is known as "transcription." Think phonetics.
With transliteration, it’s easier to reverse engineer a word to its original language.
So, why the disparity in spellings?
For many clusters of characters there is more than one transliterative system. So you get variations, as with "Soleimani."
One reason could be that there are many dialects of Arabic. I imagine people have different interpretations of spellings because of that. But I’m no expert. If I were, I’d be working for the U.N. or code-breaking or something equally sexy.
When Ukraine became a hot topic of conversation last year after a certain phone call was made, I came to realize that after the country gained its independence its government established rules for transliteration of city names and such from Cyrillic into the Latin alphabet for legal proclamations and such. And it changed "Kiev" to "Kyiv."
I’m not sure why that passed below my radar for 24 years or why mass producers of frozen "chicken Kiev" continue to use a spelling that’s been out of vogue in its namesake for a quarter century.
With some languages there is just no easy pathway to English, which explains Hanukkah and Chanukah.
It’s also why if you use the translation function on your Thai sister-in-law’s Facebook posts to her friends about your shared trip to Mexico, you’re left wondering whether you were on the same trip.
Write carefully!

Texto completo: "Mr. Nobody" by Catherine Steadman; Penguin Random House; 368 pages; mollyspray.com/ "Mr. Nobody," the second novel by New York Times best-selling author Catherine Steadman, is a mesmerizing psychological thriller. A man is found on a beach. He doesn’t know his identity or how he got there. Expert neuropsychiatrist Dr. Emma Lewis is called in to help him regain his memory. This man — the media calls him Mr. Nobody — was found in Emma’s hometown, a place she fled 14 years ago, hoping never to return.
The town holds Emma’s dark family secret, one she has worked hard to keep buried. As she and Mr. Nobody get to know one another in this haunted locale, it becomes clear that he knows something about this secret. In a series of exciting twists and shocking turns, Emma and Mr. Nobody come to discover they are connected in ways neither could have imagined.
Steadman’s story is wholly unique and exceedingly well-executed. Suspense is peppered in all the right places, and every breadcrumb dropped throughout the story returns in wildly imaginative ways.
The writing is as crisp as the story itself. Its decisive urgency will make readers desperate to find out what happens next.

Texto completo: Who exactly was it the United States killed on Jan. 3 that sparked a ramp-up of aggression between Iran and the U. S.?
Was it Qassem Soleimani?
Was it Qassim Suleimani?
Or was it Qasem Soleimani?
It depends which news source you read.
The first spelling is courtesy of The Associated Press. The "Qasem" variation is employed by The Washington Post.
The New York Times has been going with something completely different: "Qassim Suleimani."
The Daily Herald subscribes to both The Associated Press and Washington Post wire services, so we had to settle on one spelling for consistency. We decided to run with "Qassem Soleimani" because AP is our dominant source for world and national news and because we adhere to The Associated Press Stylebook (for the most part).
We were having this very conversation as Iran started launching rockets at the Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq, which houses U.S. troops.
The issue of the proper spelling of the Iranian general’s name doesn’t hold a candle to the gravity of the story at hand, but as a newspaper we sweat the details, too.
I can’t imagine Iranians are having a lot of trouble spelling the man’s name right. That’s because they spell it as he did — in Arabic, a language that has an alphabet different from ours.
In case you forgot, our 26 letters are not the "English" alphabet but the "Latin" or "Roman" alphabet.
Changing words or names from one language to another without benefit of a shared alphabet is called "transliteration."
It’s a predictable way to convert one character to another character or characters rather than by converting sounds, which is known as "transcription." Think phonetics.
With transliteration, it’s easier to reverse engineer a word to its original language.
So, why the disparity in spellings?
For many clusters of characters there is more than one transliterative system. So you get variations, as with "Soleimani."
One reason could be that there are many dialects of Arabic. I imagine people have different interpretations of spellings because of that. But I’m no expert. If I were, I’d be working for the U.N. or code-breaking or something equally sexy.
When Ukraine became a hot topic of conversation last year after a certain phone call was made, I came to realize that after the country gained its independence its government established rules for transliteration of city names and such from Cyrillic into the Latin alphabet for legal proclamations and such.
And it changed "Kiev" to "Kyiv."
I’m not sure why that passed below my radar for 24 years or why mass producers of frozen "chicken Kiev" continue to use a spelling that’s been out of vogue in its namesake for a quarter century.
With some languages there is just no easy pathway to English, which explains Hanukkah and Chanukah.
It’s also why if you use the translation function on your Thai sister-in-law’s Facebook posts to her friends about your shared trip to Mexico, you’re left wondering whether you were on the same trip.
Write carefully!

A drive down Officers Row is enough to inform you that former U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and Nobel Peace Prize winner George C. Marshall once lived in Vancouver.
But did you know that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, blockbuster film star and former professional wrestler, lived in Vancouver as a kid?
His local Twitter followers lost their minds when they saw his December posts touting his connection to the area. He recently invested in the Portland-based ice cream chain Salt & Straw.
“I lived in Vancouver, WA when my old man wrestled for Portland based wrestling promoter, Don Owens,” he tweeted. It wasn't the first time he has mentioned living in Vancouver, although he didn't answer follow-up questions about which neighborhood was his or what school he attended.
Just the same, it made us think about other famous people who have ties to Vancouver and its environs.
Actors
Actor Sam Elliott, known for his gravelly cowboy drawl, graduated from Clark College in the 1960s. He transferred to the University of Oregon and made his way to Hollywood. He was nominated for an Oscar for his supporting role in the 2018 movie “A Star is Born.”
Tobey Maguire, star of the movies “Spider-Man,” “Cider House Rules” and “Pleasantville,” moved to Vancouver at the age of 2 with his parents before moving to Los Angeles at the age of 12.
Jonathan Jackson, who grew up in Battle Ground, played Avery Barkley on the TV show “Nashville,” which aired from 2012 to 2018. He won five Daytime Emmy Awards for his role as Lucky on “General Hospital” from 1993 to 2015.
His brother Richard Lee Jackson is best known for his role as Ryan Parker on “Saved by the Bell: The New Class” (1993), but also appeared other shows, including “Ally McBeal.” The brothers are in the band Enation together.
The band drew another famous person to Battle Ground in the late 2000s. Bethany Joy Lenz is best known for playing Haley James Scott on the drama “One Tree Hill,” which aired from 2003 to 2012. She was married to Enation keyboardist Michael Galeotti. The couple have since divorced, and Galeotti is no longer a member of Enation. Lenz moved to Los Angeles.
Musicians
Country music legend Willie Nelson moved from Texas to Vancouver in 1956. He worked as a disc jockey for KVAN radio in Vancouver and played with a couple of bands in the area. He moved to Nashville at the age of 27, rolled out a series of country classics and won eight Grammy awards.
Bob Bogle moved to Vancouver in 1986 where he lived until his death in 2009. He co-founded The Ventures, a popular band in the 1960s and '70s, best known for the hit song “Walk, Don't Run.” The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.
Rob Hotchkiss lived in Battle Ground for a while, and still owns a house there. Hotchkiss co-founded the band Train, which won a Grammy for the song “Drops of Jupiter” in 2001.
Cubby O'Brien lived in Amboy from 2003 to 2013. He was a cast member on the original version of “The Mickey Mouse Club” and was later a drummer on “The Lawrence Welk Show” and for The Carpenters.
Athletes
Gretchen Fraser, described in newspaper archives as a “Vancouver housewife,” was the first non-European to win an Olympic skiing medal. She won a gold medal in the slalom and a silver medal in the combined event in the 1948 Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
Figure skater Tonya Harding lives in Clark County. Now Tonya Price, she first gained fame in 1991 as the first American woman to stick a triple axel in competition, winning a gold medal at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. In 1994, she was implicated with her then-husband and associates in bashing skating rival Nancy Kerrigan's knee before the Winter Olympics. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy to hinder prosecution. The 2017 movie “I, Tonya” dramatizes the skater's rise and fall.
Professional stock car racing driver Greg Biffle graduated from Camas High School in 1988. In June, he won the SpeedyCash.com 400 at Texas Motor Speedway, his first NASCAR Trucks series start since 2004. He won the Truck title in 2000. In the NASCAR Cup Series, he won 19 races. He also won the championship in what's now known as the Xfinity Series in 2002.
Writers
Karen Kingsbury, New York Times best-selling author of what she has trademarked as “life-changing fiction,” lived in a 10,000-square-foot house near Salmon Creek for many years before moving to Tennessee. One of her many books, “Like Dandelion Dust,” was made into a movie released in 2009.
Best-selling author Chuck Palahniuk has a home near Washougal in Skamania County. He's best known for “Fight Club,” which was made into a movie starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.
Magnates
Before Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft, they roomed together near the Ross Substation just north of Vancouver in 1972. They were hired to work on programming for a major Bonneville Power Administration project called ROD

Recalling Florida hostage’s escape from Iran

Texto completo: Robert Anders was used to hearing protesters chant “Death to America” when he showed up for work each morning, but this morning seemed different, the din louder, the mood darker, the tension a precursor to an escape so valiant it is now
immortalized in both history and Hollywood.
It was Nov. 4, 1979, when a group of Iranian militants scaled a wall at the U.S. embassy in Tehran, setting off a hostage crisis that would define a presidency and disillusion a country. Anders, however, was one of 12 Americans working in the compound who managed to slip out the back door during the chaos and evade apprehension, if not something worse.
Once they reached the rainy street the 12 Americans split into groups of six. One group went north and was captured at gunpoint. Anders’ group headed west, and eventually made it undetected to the home of a Canadian diplomat, where they ate well, played bridge and worried for weeks they would be found and executed.
Meanwhile, as their whereabouts were known only to a few U.S. officials, the Iranians had taken 52 U.S. diplomats and citizens hostage, a crisis that lasted 444 days.
A CIA agent named Tony Mendez devised a plan for the six Americans to escape Iran and it was as risky as it was ingenious. He invented a fake movie company called Studio Six — named for the six escapees — that claimed it was looking for a place to shoot a sci-fi film, something like “Star Wars,” and Iran was among the contenders. The six Americans would be passed off as Canadians working in the company, according to the plan.
No detail was overlooked. They were given fake names and titles — Anders, for one, became Robert L. Baker, location manager — and Canadian passports were forged for them. They had phony business cards. Anders remembers being given a dry cleaning receipt from Ottawa for his pocket in case anyone frisked him.
The phony movie was called “Argo” — named after the vessel Jason used on his journey across the world to retrieve the Golden Fleece — and the CIA rented an office in Hollywood as a front. They even had people answering the phone if anyone ever called the phony numbers that were printed on the phony business cards.
The fake passports were sent to the Canadian embassy in Iran, and Mendez soon arrived to coach them up and bring them home. They even dressed the part. Anders, 54 at the time, wore a shirt two sizes too small, buttoned it only halfway up to expose a silver medallion and combed his hair down to look like a Hollywood director in the ’70s.
They were to fly to Switzerland aboard Swissair, but there was a measure of fear in the airport when it was announced the plane had encountered mechanical problems. When the flight was cleared to take off, Anders remembers walking up the ramp and looking at the name on the plane’s nose. It was the name of an area in Switzerland called Aargau.
Anders nudged Mendez’s shoulder and said, “You guys think of everything, don’t you?” If anything it was an omen, and after three months on the run they boarded flight 363 to Switzerland on Jan. 28, 1980. There was an open bar on the plane, of course.
Only a few people in America knew of the escapees, and the original plan was for them to come to a military base in Florida to hide, Anders said. No one wanted to take the chance of the escapees being discovered with the hostages still in Iran. The plan was aborted because the Canadian press was catching on to the story, and because the escapees did not want to worry their families any longer. Anders’ 90-year-old mother still thought he was a hostage.
After visiting President Carter in the White House, Anders returned to Port Charlotte, where he lived at the time. His in-laws were residents of Punta Gorda. Anders, in an interview with the New York Times from Port Charlotte, gave one of the original firsthand accounts of the ordeal, but left many details out, including the CIA’s involvement, and soon the story faded away.
It wasn’t until 2007 — the 50th anniversary of the CIA — when the full extent of the agency’s involvement was revealed and the story was of interest again. Eventually, it became a movie called “Argo,” winner of the Academy Award for best picture in 2013. Mendez — who died in 2019 — was played by Ben Affleck; Anders by Tate Donovan.
Anders is 94 now, and lives in a retirement community in Maryland. He said he is a “hard-core Republican” who is not enamored with President Trump because he “hijacked the party.”
He sees the assassination of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani as a grave error. “I think it was a big mistake to wipe this guy out.”
He occasionally speaks at a retired diplomats club and to retired CIA agents, whom he came to respect a great deal for the role they played in his escape.
And every so often, when the ordeal comes up, Anders tells the story of how he was among a group of Americans who fled Tehran beneath the nose of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. For proof he will open his wallet and pull out the business card he has kept for 40 years.
It says:

“Tehran is very much with me,” he said. “It’s in the back of my mind every day.”

‘The Seine’ is an engaging memoir of Paris’ overlooked treasure

Texto completo: “The Seine: The River That Made Paris” by Elaine Sciolino; W.W. Norton & Co. 370 pages. $26.95
Tourists usually look up from the boats in Paris that carry them along the Seine, admiring Notre Dame Cathedral, the Eiffel Tower and the magnificent bridges. But if we looked down at the water, we would start to appreciate the source of all the grandeur above.
“Without the Eiffel Tower, Paris would still exist; without the Seine, there never would have been a Paris,” writes Elaine Sciolino, a longtime American in Paris.
Sciolino stumbled into Paris decades ago as a divorced young journalist with feeble French. She thanks the Seine for keeping her grounded as she rebuilt her life. But as the years passed, she came to realize that she knew very little about “the most romantic river in the world,” outside its 8 miles in the city.
The former Paris bureau chief for the New York Times set about fixing that, in the way of a journalist “seduced by a river.” She takes us along in an engaging travelogue/memoir tracing the Seine’s 483 miles from its source to the sea.
She squelches in the Seine where it bubbles to the surface near an ancient temple in Burgundy. She swims in it after it becomes a river (but before it becomes polluted). She cruises it with police and river pilots, and commiserates with frustrated preservationists.
Readers will enjoy Sciolino’s expansive take on the Seine’s role in the history and culture of France, from the Romans to current filmmakers. We also learn some useful things: The river is a woman — “La Seine” — and she is pronounced SEN, not SANE.
It’s fitting that just before publication, Sciolino had time to update the book after an April 2019 fire set Notre Dame ablaze. As the world watched firefighters battling the flames, how many knew that half the water was being pumped from the Seine? If not for the river, the centuries-old cathedral could have been lost. Instead it was saved, as are many humans when they reach out to the Seine.

Texto completo: Robert Anders was used to hearing protesters chant “Death to America” when he showed up for work each morning, but this morning seemed different, the din louder, the mood darker, the tension a precursor to an escape so valiant it is now
immortalized in both history and Hollywood.
It was Nov. 4, 1979, when a group of Iranian militants scaled a wall at the U.S. embassy in Tehran, setting off a hostage crisis that would define a presidency and disillusion a country. Anders, however, was one of 12 Americans working in the compound who managed to slip out the back door during the chaos and evade apprehension, if not something worse.
Once they reached the rainy street the 12 Americans split into groups of six. One group went north and was captured at gunpoint. Anders’ group headed west, and eventually made it undetected to the home of a Canadian diplomat, where they ate well, played bridge and worried for weeks they would be found and executed.
Meanwhile, as their whereabouts were known only to a few U.S. officials, the Iranians had taken 52 U.S. diplomats and citizens hostage, a crisis that lasted 444 days.
A CIA agent named Tony Mendez devised a plan for the six Americans to escape Iran and it was as risky as it was ingenious. He invented a fake movie company called Studio Six — named for the six escapees — that claimed it was looking for a place to shoot a sci-fi film, something like “Star Wars,” and Iran was among the contenders. The six Americans would be passed off as Canadians working in the company, according to the plan.
No detail was overlooked. They were given fake names and titles — Anders, for one, became Robert L. Baker, location manager — and Canadian passports were forged for them. They had phony business cards. Anders remembers being given a dry cleaning receipt from Ottawa for his pocket in case anyone frisked him.
The phony movie was called “Argo” — named after the vessel Jason used on his journey across the world to retrieve the Golden Fleece — and the CIA rented an office in Hollywood as a front. They even had people answering the phone if anyone ever called the phony numbers that were printed on the phony business cards.
The fake passports were sent to the Canadian embassy in Iran, and Mendez soon arrived to coach them up and bring them home. They even dressed the part. Anders, 54 at the time, wore a shirt two sizes too small, buttoned it only halfway up to expose a silver medallion and combed his hair down to look like a Hollywood director in the ’70s.
They were to fly to Switzerland aboard Swissair, but there was a measure of fear in the airport when it was announced the plane had encountered mechanical problems. When the flight was cleared to take off, Anders remembers walking up the ramp and looking at the name on the plane’s nose. It was the name of an area in Switzerland called Aargau.
Anders nudged Mendez’s shoulder and said, “You guys think of everything, don’t you?” If anything it was an omen, and after three months on the run they boarded flight 363 to Switzerland on Jan. 28, 1980. There was an open bar on the plane, of course.
Only a few people in America knew of the escapees, and the original plan was for them to come to a military base in Florida to hide, Anders said. No one wanted to take the chance of the escapees being discovered with the hostages still in Iran. The plan was aborted because the Canadian press was catching on to the story, and because the escapees did not want to worry their families any longer. Anders’ 90-year-old mother still thought he was a hostage.
After visiting President Carter in the White House, Anders returned to Port Charlotte, where he lived at the time. His in-laws were residents of Punta Gorda. Anders, in an interview with the New York Times from Port Charlotte, gave one of the original firsthand accounts of the ordeal, but left many details out, including the CIA’s involvement, and soon the story faded away.
It wasn’t until 2007 — the 50th anniversary of the CIA — when the full extent of the agency’s involvement was revealed and the story was of interest again. Eventually, it became a movie called “Argo,” winner of the Academy Award for best picture in 2013. Mendez — who died in 2019 — was played by Ben Affleck; Anders by Tate Donovan.
Anders is 94 now, and lives in a retirement community in Maryland. He said he is a “hard-core Republican” who is not enamored with President Trump because he “hijacked the party.”
He sees the assassination of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani as a grave error. “I think it was a big mistake to wipe this guy out.”
He occasionally speaks at a retired diplomats club and to retired CIA agents, whom he came to respect a great deal for the role they played in his escape.
And every so often, when the ordeal comes up, Anders tells the story of how he was among a group of Americans who fled Tehran beneath the nose of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. For proof he will open his wallet and pull out the business card he has kept for 40 years.

Texto completo: “The Seine: The River That Made Paris” by Elaine Sciolino; W.W. Norton & Co. 370 pages. $26.95
Tourists usually look up from the boats in Paris that carry them along the Seine, admiring Notre Dame Cathedral, the Eiffel Tower and the magnificent bridges. But if we looked down at the water, we would start to appreciate the source of all the grandeur above.
“Without the Eiffel Tower, Paris would still exist; without the Seine, there never would have been a Paris,” writes Elaine Sciolino, a longtime American in Paris.
Sciolino stumbled into Paris decades ago as a divorced young journalist with feeble French. She thanks the Seine for keeping her grounded as she rebuilt her life. But as the years passed, she came to realize that she knew very little about “the most romantic river in the world,” outside its 8 miles in the city.
The former Paris bureau chief for the New York Times set about fixing that, in the way of a journalist “seduced by a river.” She takes us along in an engaging travelogue/memoir tracing the Seine’s 483 miles from its source to the sea.
She squelches in the Seine where it bubbles to the surface near an ancient temple in Burgundy. She swims in it after it becomes a river (but before it becomes polluted). She cruises it with police and river pilots, and commiserates with frustrated preservationists.
Readers will enjoy Sciolino’s expansive take on the Seine’s role in the history and culture of France, from the Romans to current filmmakers. We also learn some useful things: The river is a woman — “La Seine” — and she is pronounced SEN, not SANE.
It’s fitting that just before publication, Sciolino had time to update the book after an April 2019 fire set Notre Dame ablaze. As the world watched firefighters battling the flames, how many knew that half the water was being pumped from the Seine? If not for the river, the centuries-old cathedral could have been lost. Instead it was saved, as are many humans when they reach out to the Seine.

Canada in uproar over being described as ‘bone-chillingly cold’ and in need of ‘some razzle’

Texto completo: Canadians are taking issue with their country being described as "bone-chillingly cold" after the New York Times suggested Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's potential move to Canada could bring some "razzle dazzle" to the nation.
Following an announcement from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex about their intention to step back from the roles as senior members of the British royal family and to split their time between the United Kingdom and North America, the New York Times claimed on Saturday, "Many Canadians are giddy at the prospect that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could be moving to Canada, injecting some razzle dazzle to the sprawling, bone-chillingly cold country."
Tweet
The paper's tweet was met with pushback from Canadians who said it shows Americans' lack of understanding about our neighbors to the north.
"Ummmm, we do have summer. Also no @realDonaldTrump, a huge plus," one Twitter user wrote.
"Plenty of parts of the US are colder than where I live in Canada. As for “dazzle dazzle”, Americans are so used to it from scandal after scandal in their own country, they seem to think life without constitutional crisis is boring," another wrote, "Get out."
A third user fired back, "« Bone-chillingly country »? Seriously? This is what gives Americans a bad rap for being clueless about anything but themselves."
Others pointed out the timing of the tweet, which came a day after Iran admitted to accidentally shooting down a passenger plane carrying 63 Canadians as it fired off rounds of ballistic missiles at military bases house American troops in Iraq. All 176 people on board died in the incident.
"We lost 63 Canadians this week in the fog of war caused by a reckless President. No one is giddy," someone replied.
"Most Canadians aren't at all giddy," another piped up. "We don't get excited about Royalty, we just accept that we're connected to them via our Westminster system. Quite frankly, we're more concerned about a flight being shot down.
Some Canadians, however, found some humor in the tweet and were able to laugh at themselves and their homeland.
Prince Harry, 35, and Markle, 38, reportedly left the rest of the royal family "in shock" with their announcement by failing to inform Queen Elizabeth II or Prince Charles of their decision ahead of time. Senior members of the family are set to meet on Monday to discuss the details of the unique arrangement.

Texto completo: For the overwhelming number of Americans who have little interest in adding a war with Iran to the list of ill-advised, modern U.S. military conflicts, last week brought only confusion about what lies ahead.
On the one hand, leaders from both countries veered from full-throated antagonism to wary rapprochement, like a pair of guys who'd traded punches outside a bar, but then decided they wanted to head home before things got really ugly.
Yet the international brinkmanship that arguably began when President Donald Trump ordered a Jan. 3 airstrike that killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani seems unlikely to have reached its end with Iran's casualty-free missile attack on U.S. bases in Iraq. Bullets and bombs, after all, are just one way of waging war - inelegant, violent, primitive.
Intelligence analysts, cyber security experts, and former U.S. officials worry that Iran's next retaliatory move will be quieter and more sinister: a devastating cyberattack on U.S. infrastructure, or against private companies whose operations are intertwined with so many people's daily lives.
It's not difficult to conjure visions of blackouts, dead phone lines, or the chaos that could spring from a crippling strike on banking systems. Iran has flirted with such activity before; in 2016, the United States indicted seven Iranians who allegedly knocked off-line the computer networks of nearly four dozen financial institutions, and tried to gain control of a dam's operational system in Westchester County, N.Y.
"Most people are much more concerned about an attack they can see and feel, and can't relate to this idea of a clandestine war," said Tom Ridge, the Republican former governor of Pennsylvania, who served as the first U.S. secretary of Homeland Security in the early 2000s.
"But there's a digital war going on that's basically undeclared, the potential consequences of which - if it gets out of control - are far greater than a physical attack."
'Now everyone has
that capability'
Ridge knows better than most the challenge of trying to predict a foreign adversary's next moves. He had to get the newly created Department of Homeland Security off the ground in the first years that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a period marked by deep paranoia about additional terrorist plots.
His mornings often started in the White House, where he waited with then-FBI Director Robert Mueller and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to be ushered into the Oval Office. The three men reviewed, with President George W. Bush, the dozens of daily threats that had been gleaned from intelligence-gathering operations.
"Were we anxious? Yeah. Some of the threats seemed more credible than others," Ridge said.
"This was 15 years ago. There wasn't the same concern about terrorists having cyber capabilities. Fast forward, and now everyone has that capability: nation states, hackers, terrorists."
In 2009, a U.S. intelligence assessment concluded that Iran had the motivation to carry out a cyberattack of some kind, but lacked the necessary know-how, according to the New York Times. Three years later, Iran was accused of launching a cyberattack against Saudi Aramco, one of the world's largest oil companies, that wiped out 75% of the data on Aramco's computers.
"We really gained an understanding of how their activities evolved from their activity in the Gulf region," said Luke McNamara, a principal analyst with FireEye, a California-based cybersecurity firm. "We've seen them grow in their capability over the years."
Between 2011 and 2013, Iran directed denial-of-service attacks at 46 companies, including American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and AT&T. Customers were unable to access their accounts, sometimes for hours at a time.
"I just take it as a foregone conclusion that our enemies know the most vulnerable sectors of our economy," Ridge said, "where they can do enormous damage."
Global Guardian, an international security and intelligence firm, produced a report for some of its clients in the wake of Soleimani's death, summarizing some of Iran's cyber capabilities and methods. The three-page document was filled with sobering information, according to a copy obtained by The Inquirer.
Previous cyberattacks have left Iran with access to millions of computers around the world, Global Guardian found, and the country relies on at least four distinct espionage groups - with names like CopyKittens and APT33 - that each have areas of specific focus, from telecommunication and travel industries to countries that include the United States, Turkey, Germany. and Jordan. One group, Charming Kitten, tries to access email and Facebook accounts of people who work in academia, human rights, and the media.
Last weekend, a government website - the Federal Depository Library Program - was hacked, its home page replaced with an image of a fist clobbering Trump in the face, with blood trickling down to his chin. "Hacked by Iran Cyber Security Group!" read part of a message posted on the site.
Global Guardian wrote in its report that it would take seven to 10 days "before we begin seeing more sophisticated cyber activity."
But Dale Buckner, the company's president and CEO, noted that Iran might not want to take credit for a more serious strike that could invite a heavy military response from the United States. "They can utilize their proxies throughout the world, which could make it really difficult to attribute an attack to Iran," he said.
Buckner wasn't swayed by the more cautious tone that both U.S. and Iranian officials seemed to adopt after Iran's missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq.
"I don't think that changes the calculus on a cyberattack," he said. "I don't think they'll miss a beat on that."
'The next dimension
of warfare'
While the odds seem heavily weighted in favor of Iran pursuing something more serious than digital graffiti on one government website, none of the experts who spoke to The Inquirer seemed ready to stuff their savings under their mattresses or begin hoarding firewood and water bottles.
This is simply the new normal - governments and corporations can always expect that someone will be digitally casing their operations, poking and prodding for hidden vulnerabilities that can be exploited at just the right moment.
Buckner said the United States had, for a time, lagged behind in its defense of critical infrastructure, like electrical grids, but has "surged in the amount of time, money, and effort dedicated to locking those things down during the last seven or eight years."
Ridge noted that Homeland Security had only a handful of cyber defense experts during his time leading the agency. "Now they have hundreds."
According to retired U.S. Gen. David Petraeus, the chief question is whether the United States will be moved to "respond with direct attacks on Iranian forces and infrastructure, at a time when the Iranian economy is already seriously damaged by sanctions, and when the Iranian people have already been demonstrating against the regime in very considerable numbers."
The United States will undoubtedly continue its own covert activity, which has found varying degrees of success in recent years. In 2010, a malware attack led by the United States and Israel reportedly caused nearly 1,000 centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility to self-destruct. Iran responded by beefing up its cyber capabilities even more.
"This," Ridge said, "is the next dimension of warfare."

Texto completo: Winter was making a cameo appearance, and the snow cannons at Blue Mountain were blasting away in an all-out assault on snow deprivation. Like white water gushing from fire hoses, squalls of snow ejected from the yellow guns, lavishing a thick frosting on the trails for the skiers, boarders, and tubers.
After yet another warm spell, Blue Mountain, just north of Allentown and barely in the vestibule of the Poconos, was able to produce snow again on Thursday, as temperatures finally were cold enough for snowmaking.
"Yeah. For two whole days," said Bob Taylor, who has been in charge of the resort's snowmaking operations since 2006.
Yet, thanks to a technology that traces its origins to human ingenuity, desperation, and the 1930s, and conquered hails of skepticism, Taylor promised that trails would be open during the weekend - when temperatures across the region reached record highs - come hell or global meltdown. By Friday morning, after he had put in a 14-hour day, the slopes had a 24- to 42-inch base of machine-made powder.
Through long experience with nature's cold shoulders, ski operators have become evermore proficient at making their own snow. Snowmaking is the lifeblood of Pennsylvania's ski industry, among the oldest in the nation, and is vital even in the snow countries of Upstate New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire.
So far this winter, the machines are far outperforming nature.
It's bad enough that the slopes are snow-starved, but even mood flakes and sugary roadsides have been sparse in the areas where the customers live, and ski operators will tell you that for drumming up business, snow beats billboards and bumper stickers.
"It's frustrating," Taylor said on a blessedly frigid Thursday as customers poured into the resort. The cold spell was over by Friday, along with near- or below-freezing temperatures needed for snowmaking.
This weekend? A nightmare. Temperatures reaching record highs, a development about as welcome as a winter-storm warning in August would be for the Jersey Shore.
So when did humans start doing nature's dirty work?
Increasing temperatures across the country in recent years likely has meant brisker business for the snow-gun runners, but the concept of creating a man-made skiable surface dates at least to 1934, according to Jeff Leich, who runs the New England Ski Museum.
That year the Toronto Ski Club confronted a crisis. It had planned a major ski-jumping competition, but not only was it lacking in snow, none was in the foreseeable future.
At the request of club officials, the University of Toronto agreed to have its ice planer shave off layers of ice from its skating rink. Trucks delivered - 75 tons' worth - to the jump site, which was about 4 miles away. Enough ice was available to cover the hill, with several inches available for the landing area. The run was even faster than it would have been with natural snow.
Around the same time, a similar project was undertaken on Bear Mountain in New York.
The concept snowballed. In November 1935, Boston Gardens hosted its first winter-sports show, which became an annual event, spreading 500 tons of ice across a 17,000-square-foot course. New York hosted its own show in Madison Square Garden the following year.
Walter Schoenknecht, the man who built Vermont's Mount Snow, borrowed the icing strategy during the snowless winter of 1949-50, when he imported 700 tons of ice for his modest ski resort in the Berkshires, Mohawk Mountain, recounted ski historian Nils Ericksen in an article published in Ski Area Management. The ice didn't last long, but he sold 1,800 tickets in one weekend and resolved to find an easier and cheaper way to do this.
It so happened that among his Mohawk Mountain customers was one Wayne Pierce. With two partners, he developed an apparatus consisting of hoses, compressed air, and specially designed nozzles and delivered it to Mohawk. It made a horrific "shriek," but it also made snow. Pierce filed for a patent in 1950.
The 1950s, stingy with snow in the East, constituted a watershed decade for the snowmaking industry, and among the pioneering resorts was Pennsylvania's Big Boulder the winter of 1956-57.
Among the holdouts was Bromley Mountain's Fred Pabst. "No one thought you could cover a whole damn mount with snow," he was quoted in the New York Times in 1975 as saying. "But I've found that it's more expensive to have to close our ticket windows because we're out of snow." He caved, and installed a $750 million system.
Is it fake snow?
It's just like the stuff that falls from the skies, assures Taylor: hexagonal crystals attached to tiny nucleated particles.
Water is pumped through nozzles from a nearby source - a reservoir, lake, or in Blue Mountain's case, a nearby creek - and theoretically returns to the water bodies with the thaw, although some moisture evaporates in the snowmaking process. It takes 4.1 gallons to make a cubic foot of snow, Taylor said, and last season, Blue Mountain pumped more than 240 million gallons.
Some guns use compressed air; others, high-powered fans.
But from primitive nozzles, the technology has advanced to levels that the early developers could never have envisioned. The machine at Blue Mountain looks more as if it belongs in the belly of a nuclear submarine. The system, most of which is supplied by TechnoAlpin, is fully automated but requires significant human maintenance.
"Years ago, you went out and hooked up hoses and turned on the valves," said Taylor, opening a circuit board resembling a computer's central nervous system. "Now we have to be able to fix all this ... [unpleasant descriptive noun]."
Asked how much all this costs, he says: "I can't count that high." But the resort's Ashley Seier says snowmaking consumes about 30% of the annual budget.
Does the environment mind?
About 85% of the National Ski Areas Association resorts make snow, said the group's Adrienne Saia Isaac, which means they are using massive amounts of energy-consuming machinery.
More resorts and longer seasons mean more stresses on water supplies, not to mention more carbon-spewing traffic on once-pristine mountain roads.
Some resorts in the West have even resorted to using wastewater, which has been a source of controversy and litigation.
So who needs natural snow?
Ski resorts, badly. Along with being fantastic for marketing, for ski areas it's an immense money-saver.
With snow, the cliche is true: There's nothing like the real thing.

Texto completo: BRAD PITT'S journey to sobriety happened in part thanks to Jenkintown's own Bradley Cooper, the actor has said.
Pitt this week attended the National Board of Review Annual Awards Gala in New York City, where Cooper presented the star with a best supporting actor award for his role in Once Upon A Time . . . in Hollywood, People reports. During his acceptance speech, Pitt credited Cooper as a factor in his own journey to sobriety.
"Bradley just put his daughter to bed and rushed over here to do this," Pitt said, referencing Cooper's young daughter Lea De Seine. "He's a sweetheart. I got sober because of this guy and every day has been happier ever since."
Pitt initially discussed his decision to quit using drugs and alcohol in a 2017 interview with GQ. At the time, Pitt had split from his ex-wife Angelina Jolie, and told the publication that his clean living left him thinking that there is "still much beauty in the world and a lot of love."
"I had to step away for a minute," Pitt said. "And truthfully I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional. I was good."
The Ad Astra star has openly discussed his sobriety since then, most recently telling the New York Times in September that he got clean and started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after having "taken things as far as I could take" them.
"I removed my drinking privilege," he said.
Cooper himself has been sober for well over a decade. He gave up drugs and alcohol at age 29, according to a 2012 interview with the Hollywood Reporter. The decision to give up his substance use, Cooper said, came after he realized that he "wasn't going to live up to my potential" otherwise.
"That scared the hell out of me," Cooper said. "I thought, 'Wow, I'm actually gonna ruin my life; I'm really gonna ruin it.'"
Pitt's best supporting actor award from the National Board of Review for Once Upon A Time . . . in Hollywood is his second this week following a win at the Golden Globes on Sunday.
Cooper, meanwhile, is working on co-parenting daughter Lea with ex Irina Shayk. The pair, TMZ reports, have a joint-custody agreement that has them both living in New York City.

Travelogue charts post-Soviet landscape and web of nationalist lies

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
Travel writing is a wild genre and Rory MacLean's "Pravda Ha Ha" is perhaps the wildest travel book I've come across. It begins in Moscow, where MacLean persuades a dodgy Russian oligarch to share a sliver of pipiska putina, a rare, psychedelic truffle (named for Vladimir Putin's private parts) that launches the author, and the reader, on an Alice in Wonderland-like journey through a post-Soviet landscape of fiction-fueled nationalist narratives.
Back in 1989, MacLean wrote "Stalin's Nose," a travelogue about the fall of the Cold War as it was experienced on the ground. Thirty years later, in "Pravda Ha Ha," he retraces his original journey, but backward, traveling from Russia to Britain in order "to try to understand what had gone wrong." He asks, "Why -- after liberating themselves from Soviet tyranny -- had Russians surrendered their freedom for Dictatorship 2.0?" and also, "How could so many in the West have fallen for the lies and spin, dragging democracy to this precarious moment?"
And so he travels from Moscow to the Crimea, back up to St. Petersburg and Solovki, across to Estonia, Kaliningrad and Transnistria -- a U.S.S.R. holdout where unscrupulous men run an unofficial state; it's the epitome of moral and geographic ambiguity. Then on to Ukraine, Hungary, Poland and Germany, where MacLean gives voice to the refugees whom nationalists fear. He meets locals everywhere he goes, dining, dancing and staying with them. But he moves so quickly that we never get to really know anyone or anyplace, and this makes for easy but ephemeral reading.
It's formulaic travel journalism: Go somewhere for a couple of days, meet some people, ask them questions, report the interesting things they say. And like most contemporary travel writers, MacLean gives himself a starring role in his narrative. He helps a Nigerian refugee leave Russia, shouts at drunken bigots in Hungary, and argues with right-wing propagandists in Poland. In his story, MacLean is a defender of journalistic integrity, an exposer of hypocrisy and a proponent of truth.
But in shaping his characters into caricatures of sinister nationalists and brave liberals, MacLean dodges the tougher, more nuanced questions. For instance, isn't what we're seeing in the political landscape an inevitable result of capitalism? As MacLean's Russian oligarch says, "Capitalism is free wolves living among free sheep, for sure." So why wouldn't wily politicians kneecap opposition by systematically taking over the media, the police and the courts?
The "real end of Europe" is not geographical, but political. As MacLean writes, Europe is "fragile, fragmented and lost in a maze" because of "skillful and ambitious charlatans," the populists who exploit prejudices, distort the past and steal the future. "Their promise to save the nation from a corrupt elite is a fiction," MacLean asserts. True, but here's the thing: People like fiction. Many people even prefer stories to truth.
And so while reading "Pravda Ha Ha," it occurred to me that the problem -- with the East as well as West -- is not liars but the people who believe the lies. The unbelievable human capacity for credulity.
Randy Rosenthal teaches writing at Harvard. His work has appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post and many other publications.

Texto completo: Barring an early impeachment trial in the Senate, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota could have a vital shot Tuesday at making tangible gains in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
In the final debate before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3, Klobuchar will share the stage at Drake University in Des Moines with only five other rivals who made the final cut. The slimmer field offers a chance for more airtime and a longer look from voters still making up their minds about the senator, deemed by some pundits to have the most to gain from the encounter.
Here's what the handicappers and political analysts will be looking for:
Klobuchar's penchant for folksy mom jokes has become a hallmark of her debate style -- for better or for worse. But she's shown a more pugnacious side in recent debates, notably when she mocked Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's health and education proposals as unrealistic and dismissed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg as not ready for prime time.
Klobuchar would benefit most from any stumble by Buttigieg, another Midwestern rival presenting himself as a moderate alternative to Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the socialist-Democrat from Vermont.
Ultimately, when the smoke clears in Iowa, Klobuchar needs to crack the top four of Sanders, Buttigieg, Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden. Despite a shaky start, Biden has kept the top spot in many state and national polls. And in the search for an electable centrist, the primary race still feels like it's Biden's to lose. (Friday's results of the Des Moines Register Poll, taken Jan. 2-8, showed Biden with 15%, which put him in the fourth spot among potential Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa. Klobuchar had stalled at 6% for fifth place.)
Biden also seems to show the best when it comes to the ongoing conflict with Iran, a new topic in the debate sweepstakes. Klobuchar needs to strike big here: Biden has started running ads based on his tried-and-true foreign policy chops developed in eight years as vice president, not to mention decades in the Senate. Foreign policy has not been one of Klobuchar's specialties in the Senate. Earlier this month, she was dinged for making a "significant false claim" in an interview with CNN about whether Iran was announcing plans to develop a nuclear weapon.
While still firmly an underdog, Klobuchar has begun to score high marks from the national political punditry.
The New York Times' David Leonhardt described her as the answer to the question of where Democrats could find a "comfortably electable, qualified candidate who won't turn 80 while in office."
The Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin assessed that Klobuchar is boosting her polling and fundraising numbers at just the right time, with Warren -- now the only other woman in real contention -- appearing to slow down.
Will the positive ink be matched by real results?

Texto completo: Column

It promises to be a very busy time when the Florida Legislature convenes its 2020 session this week. So many bills to pass. So many pockets to be stuffed. So many backs to stab. So many happy hours to be, well, happy. And yet so little time.

Eventually, various pieces of legislation will make their way to the desk of Gov. Ron DeSantis to sign into law.

This might prove to be problematic. For if the governor goes ahead in his quest to execute Death Row inmate James Dailey, all of that blood on DeSantis hands could make those bill-signing ceremonies a bit messy.

Dailey, now 73, has been on Death Row following his conviction in the gruesome 1985 murder of 14-year-old Shelly Boggio, who lived in Kenneth City. DeSantis may soon sign another death warrant after a brief stay saved the Vietnam veteran from meeting his fate last month.

Dailey has been imprisoned for more than 30 years even though prosecutors could not produce a single piece of physical evidence. Jack Pearcy, a friend of Daileys, has admitted to killing the girl alone and is serving a life sentence. Dailey awaits his last meal.

What landed Dailey in this legal pickle? Dailey was convicted largely based on the courtroom testimony of a professional informant, Paul Skalnik, a career criminal with a long history of con games, embezzlement, fraud and misappropriating identities.

After other inmates locked up near Dailey could offer no incriminating evidence against him, Pinellas County law enforcement officials settled on Skalnik to bolster their case.

Skalnik testified Dailey had confessed to Boggios murder, and with that a jury quickly found him guilty.

But to believe Dailey murdered Boggio, for DeSantis to believe he is putting a guilty man to death, you have to also buy into a few inconvenient facts.

You have to believe a man who was unwavering in claiming his innocence decided to chat up Skalnik, with whom he had never had any prior interaction with in the jail, and confess to brutally stabbing a 14-year-old girl to death.

You have to believe Skalnik, who was being kept in a segregated section in the jail because of his well-known reputation as a professional snitch, somehow made it into the general jail population to cozy up to Daileys cell to receive his confession.

What part of this passes the smell test?

In lifting the stay of execution, U.S. District Judge William Jung noted: A thorough review shows the states trial against James Dailey was not strong, but it was sufficient.

Sufficient should not be enough for the state to take a mans life, especially when the judge himself noted the case against Dailey was not especially strong.

DeSantis has at least three years left in his term. Dailey isnt going anywhere. What the governor can do is order an exhaustive review of the case.

The governor might want to start with how it was that five days after he testified against Dailey, Skalnik walked out of the Pinellas County Jail, despite the fact Skalniks probation officer wrote the informant  has been, is and always a danger to society, according The New York Times Magazine.

It certainly is true Skalnik was a clear and present danger to James Dailey.

Tallahassee takes a dim view of inmates, even if they might be innocent. This is a Florida Legislature that has burned the midnight oil to scuttle the will of a majority of voters to automatically restore the voting rights of most felons. And this is a Florida Legislature that seems unmoved to deal with the plight of 935 inmates serving 15 to 25-year drug sentences when current law calls for shorter sentences.

Indeed, Florida voters in 2018 approved a measure to reduce the drug sentences of current inmates, which the Legislature has again ignored.

It is a simple proposition. If the state of Florida is going to exercise its ultimate criminal justice sanction  the taking of a life  shouldnt the governor make sure he has done his full due diligence?

Too much to ask? Too much to expect? Or is Lady Justice about to be jilted by fatal indifference?

Unlocking buried secrets

Texto completo: When Dani Shapiro discovered a family secret, she wrote a book about it. The response to that book taught her, she says, There is no secrecy anymore  and that, about some things, there shouldnt be.

Shapiros 2019 book, Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love, became a New York Times bestseller that has kept her on the road for more than 100 appearances in the last year to talk about it.

She will be the keynote speaker Saturday for Eckerd Colleges esteemed Writers in Paradise conference. Shapiro will kick off a weeklong series of free readings by conference faculty and guests; the roster also includes Billy Collins, Ann Hood, Michael Koryta, Dennis Lehane, Laura Lippman and Stewart ONan. (See accompanying schedule.)

Inheritance is the gripping account of Shapiros totally unexpected discovery, through a DNA test taken on a whim, that Paul Shapiro, the man who raised her, was not her biological father. The story of how she uncovered her origins and found the man whose donated sperm was used to conceive her is filled with amazing twists, and some unanswerable questions  both of Shapiros parents had died years before she took the DNA test.

Shapiro, 57, is the author of 10 books whose work has appeared in the New Yorker, Granta, the New York Times Book Review and other publications. She talked to the Tampa Bay Times by phone from Connecticut, where she lives. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What kind of reader reaction have you seen to Inheritance?

Really, from day one, reader response at events, from the very first night in New York City through the very large amount of traveling for this book, which Im still doing, readers have been very, very connected to the story. Everyone has some kind of secret in their own family, some discovery. For a lot of people, DNA testing changed everything.

When I reviewed the book, one reader called and protested that you shouldnt have written it because you were revealing things that were meant to be a secret. How do you feel about that kind of response?

What were contending with now is that science, with its discoveries and advancements, which is what science does, brings all sorts of unintended consequences. Saying that it was meant to be a secret 40, 50, 60 years ago sort of astounds me. Its actually not possible to keep these things secret anymore.

For someone to say, You shouldnt have contacted your biological father  well, I didnt sign that contract. I spent 54 years of my life feeling that something didnt add up, didnt feel right. I always felt like the other.

Now, some people will misunderstand, will think that Im saying nature trumps nurture. But ironically, I had a mother whom I did not feel very connected to and a father to whom I felt profoundly connected but in point of fact was not.

I didnt know what I didnt know. Some adoptees, for example, are told all their lives that theyre adopted, and they know that theres something they dont know. But if youre never told, you grow up with your identity being wrapped around something empty. I feel like an absolute expert on the interior of this experience.

Do you resent the people who kept the secret from you?

Doctors preached anonymity and nondisclosure back then, and I understand it. Theres this beautiful term in ethics, retrospective moral judgment. We cant judge people by our standards for their beliefs in another time, and that helps us come to terms with the parents and the doctors who did this. But for someone today to stick to their guns about secrecy is not right. Sleeping dogs dont just lie in corners.

Many doctors and many donors now contend with being contacted by offspring they didnt know about. I did a big talk in Sun Valley, Idaho, and I met a man in his 80s who had been a donor at the same institute in Philadelphia where I was conceived. He told me after the talk, I am going to do a DNA test so any children I have out there can find me.

After the book was published, you hosted a podcast, Family Secrets, that has been downloaded more than 11 million times. What was that experience like?

I loved doing the podcast. I love any kind of storytelling. Ive written 10 books; thats my craft, my art. This was a whole new opportunity to tell stories. I love the intimate way people listen to podcasts, in their cars, alone. In my case, I discovered that I was the family secret. But the stories are not remotely all about DNA discoveries; there are all kinds of secrets. It was also a great pleasure for me to get out of my own head. Its like when I teach.

When you found out about your DNA results, did you hesitate to share your story or were you eager to write about it?

I felt utterly, utterly compelled to write it. In my book Hourglass, I wanted to write about the passage of time, and I used my own now 23-, then 18-year marriage to do that. I use my life as a laboratory to explore ideas in my books.

With Inheritance I felt that this was the book I was born to write. It was what I had been writing around and never quite been able to put my finger on. My fiction was often about families and secrets. Theres this phrase, the unthought known. Its what we know but cannot allow ourselves to touch or think. I knew it was a hell of a story; the fact that it was mine was incidental.

How has the huge response to the book expanded it beyond your personal story?

This has turned out to be the thing I feel most politicized about. A year ago, Im just going out and telling my story. But what I have seen is that thousands of people every year are now finding out that they were donor conceived, and theres very little support or infrastructure to help them. Theyre coming to my events, and thats it!

Today, for sperm banks and egg donors to be promoting secrecy is, I think, malpractice. Anyone absolutely will be able to find their biological mother or father, so how can agencies continue to promise secrecy?

Its stunning that the United States has no registry for donors, no regulations on how many times someone can be a donor. With no regulations, some donors dont report fully on their physical and psychological history. Thats not so in the rest of the world. The only countries who dont regulate it are the United States and Canada.

(Donor-conceived people) are going to find out. Someone will find out they have 47 half-siblings. Biological half-siblings will meet and not know it. You hear these stories about people who fall in love and say, Youre so familiar to me! Well ...

Do you see attitudes about the subject changing?

Oh, yes. In many cases those leading the charge on this are same-sex couples. If they have kids, theres going to be someone else involved, so its not a secret, and theyre raising healthy, well-adjusted kids. The thing that makes it toxic is secrecy.

How has the book changed your own relationships and feelings toward your parents?

Im here to tell you that I love my father more. And by that I mean the man who raised me. I dedicated the book to him. Ben Walden (the pseudonym she uses for her biological father) is not my father. Hes very familiar to me, and Im very grateful he was willing to meet me and have a special relationship with me. But hes not my father.

Theres no playbook for it. I was fortunate. People have had doors slammed in their faces. When you say, You dont know me, but were kin, many people feel threatened. They say, What do you want from me? Dont say were kin; you are a stranger.

I think what makes my story a good story is that everyone was trying to do the right thing.

Texto completo: The passing of Gertrude Himmelfarb, who died on December 30th at the age of 97, is a loss felt keenly by all who had the good fortune to know her.
She was among the most important American historians of the last century. Her path-breaking work illuminating the intellectual life of 19th-century Britain not only helped transform our understanding of what the Victorians were up to but also provided a rich vocabulary for describing the place of the moral in the social and political lives of liberal societies. In the process, she helped several generations of politically minded intellectuals in her own day understand themselves, their roles, and their goals more profoundly.
Ms. Himmelfarb's approach to the contemporary relevance of historical inquiry was more or less a mirror image of the attitude that came increasingly to prevail in her profession over her decades of scholarship. As she put it in the introduction to the final collection of her essays, in 2017, many academic historians now fall into "interpreting the past in terms of the present, imposing the values of an enlightened progressive present upon a benighted, retrograde past." Her own temptation, she wrote, was almost the opposite: to learn from the past what the present has forgotten.
In this, as in much else, Ms. Himmelfarb echoed her first subject, the 19th-century British historian and statesman Lord Acton. Acton's life and thought formed the topic of her doctoral dissertation in history at the University of Chicago, completed in 1950. And that work then became her first published book - Lord Acton: A Study in Conscience and Politics, published in 1952 when she was just 30 years old.
These concepts also amount to at least a partial answer to the question that would have to strike anyone looking over the span of her interests and ideas: Just what was it that drew this young, Jewish woman born and bred in Brooklyn in the 1920s and 30s to the world of the Victorian intellectuals? Her interest in them never waned, and the reasons for it (beyond the inexplicable curiosity that is always part of what motivates any great scholar) are plain in her writings on Acton.
She found the Victorians particularly instructive regarding two sets of questions she thought were essential to her own time and place. The first was what she would later (in a biography of John Stuart Mill) call "the paradox of liberalism" - namely that in prioritizing individual liberty above all other political goods, modern liberalism threatened to undermine the moral foundations of individual liberty, and therefore of its own strength. The second involved the significance of intellectuals in the public lives of free societies. Ms. Himmelfarb was fascinated by the role that writers, scholars, journalists, critics, and academics played in politics and culture, and nearly all of her work takes up that subject in one way or another.
Acton offered her much fodder on both fronts. He was a keen student of the paradox of liberalism, and he understood it to be rooted in an ideal of the individual that had its merits but was frequently taken too far. Acton, whose Catholicism shaped every facet of his thought and work, identified this excess with a certain kind of Protestant intemperance.
Victorian minds
Ms. Himmelfarb's work on the Victorians was actually best framed by the three long, deep, intellectual biographies she wrote in these decades. It began with her biography of Acton in 1952; it hit its stride with a biography of Charles Darwin in 1959; and (after a decade and a half devoted to essays and to teaching) truly reached its peak with a biography of John Stuart Mill in 1974.
Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution was a study of the distance between the sources of transformational ideas and the transformations they then engender. A lot of the book was a history of Darwin's own thinking, which Ms. Himmelfarb traced with an exquisite sensitivity for how the life of an intellectual really works and for the power of insight.
She rejected as implausible (and in some respects chronologically impossible) the familiar view that Darwin's voyage on the HMS Beagle was where his ideas about evolution first took shape. After piling up mountains of evidence, she concluded bluntly that, despite Darwin's own claims on this front, "there is, in fact, no real continuity between the Beagle and the 'Origin of Species'." Instead, she traced Darwin's core idea to a vague but powerful insight that he developed into a coherent concept over a very long span of time, and which only really became the idea everyone identifies with Darwinism after extended exposure to critics and converts.
But it was through an engagement with the thought of John Stuart Mill that Ms. Himmelfarb brought her study of the Victorians to its greatest heights. Mill was a challenge for her from the start. She noted in the introduction to "On Liberty and Liberalism: The Case of John Stuart Mill" that dissatisfaction with her understanding of his motivations had led her in the early 1960s "to scrap hundreds of pages of what had been intended as an intellectual biography of Mill." She returned to the work a decade later, this time successfully.
Mill, she argued, was "the most eminent of the eminent Victorians," yet also the one who laid the foundations for the demise of the moral consensus that made Victorianism sustainable. She noted that the most peculiar thing about reading Mill as a historian of his era, rather than as a student of political philosophy, was that he seemed to be answering a question no one asked. And this was a common critique of Mill in his day. His most effective critics, Ms. Himmelfarb argued, said not that his prescription was wrong but that the problem he diagnosed did not exist: The liberty of thought he claimed to seek already prevailed in Britain, and his grievances about conformity were completely unfounded.
Ms. Himmelfarb explained this by suggesting that Mill was actually most concerned with one particular kind of liberation that had not been achieved (or really attempted) by the spirit of his age: the liberation of women. "On Liberty", she argued, is fundamentally and above all a radically feminist book, and its radicalism revealed the dangerous, corrosive underbelly of 19th-century liberationist liberalism. Those tendencies sought to liberate women not so much from social inequality as from the human condition. Mill could not come out and say that his purpose was the complete deliverance of women (and by extension of men) from traditional social and familial roles, and so instead he worked to show that such roles were, in any context, unjust, constricting, and deleterious to human flourishing. He unleashed an individualism so extreme as to endanger every form of social order.
This led Ms. Himmelfarb to the most powerful formulation of the worry that hangs like an ominous shadow over her seven decades of scholarship:
Having made an absolute of liberty and having established the individual as sovereign, the liberal has no integrated view of the individual in society, which can moderate either his passion for liberty or his desire for regulation and control. When liberty proves inadequate, government rushes in. And since the only function assigned to government by the principle of liberty is the negative one of protection against injury, when government is obliged to assume a positive role, neither its proper powers nor its proper limits have been defined. The paradox is inevitable: government tends to become unlimited when liberty itself is thought to be unlimited. The paradox brings others in its wake. While contemporary liberalism has enormously enhanced the roles of society, government, and the state, it has provided them with no principles of legitimacy.
In more recent years, Ms. Himmelfarb's scholarship sought to shed light again on the Victorians in their own terms. Books written over the past decade, in her 90s, included two profound reflections on Judaism in British intellectual life and a collection of essays (old and new) about the historian's task. Clear-headed and perceptive to the last, she continued to emphasize the ways in which we now might learn from those who have succeeded in the task that is also ours: to see that the moral precedes the political and to keep a free society in balance, so that it might remain free but also worthy of its freedom.

Texto completo: The NFL learned years ago from its partnership with the U.S. military that alcohol needed to be declared off limits so young GI's could heal fully from a battlefield traumatic brain injury.
If you have a child or a grandchild playing a contact sport in America – 1.3million are playing football – you'll want to pay close attention. Alcohol and concussions have been quietly on a collision course for years.
Alcohol interferes with adolescent brain development, particularly with the growth of brain "white matter" known as myelin. Myelin forms an insulating sheath around the brain's synapse network, insulating the circuitry and enabling the conduction speed of each motor prompt or cognitive thought to accelerate by a factor of up to 10 times. Some believe it also performs a spacing and cushioning role, protecting the fragile axonal circuitry from any inadvertent jolting or cranial impacts.
It could be argued that myelin is nature's own performance enhancer. When reaction time counts – when fast twitch muscles need to be engaged – alcohol should not be in the mix.
Underage binge drinking is not a good idea for any number of reasons. In this context, alcohol is literally a drag; it not only slows down the brain, it can impede the growth of myelin. Whether a quarterback or a linebacker with a split second decision to make, or a batter trying to track a fastball, being able to speed up their "action potential," cognition and motor prompts is a competitive edge they'll want to acquire and protect, not impede.
Best to advise kids and grandkids to postpone their relationship with alcohol, to effectively "wait" (to welcome alcohol in time, just not now).
Alcohol can change the energetics of the brain and interfere with the brain's ability to recover from the axonal injury associated with a concussion, even a sub-concussive hit. Continued consumption of alcohol after practice and after games runs the risk of disrupting the removal of any impact-caused tau protein debris. The resulting tau clumps can migrate over time and kill neighboring brain cells, thus contributing to the growth of CTE, now associated with a range of debilitating brain maladies including personality change, rage, memory loss, dementia, suicide, ALS, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
The NFL learned years ago from its partnership with the U.S. military that alcohol needed to be declared off limits so young GI's could heal fully from a battlefield TBI. The league has consistently declined to even issue a preliminary warning about the negative interaction of alcohol consumption with concussion recovery, indicating it preferred to wait until all the progressive longitudinal data was tabulated before commenting on the matter.
All the while, 1.3million young footballers in America continue to contemplate alcohol after practice and after games without being warned their brain health down the road could be in jeopardy.
At the same time, the league continues to bank its $1.4billion multi-year endorsement deal with Bud Light to be the official beer of 28 of the league's 32 teams. Once again, the bottom line continues to win out, but the moms of America have not been fully heard from yet, and the "parental authorization form" looms large on the horizon. In selected states, the youth football enrollment loss is already up to 28% and growing.
The New York Times reported last month that the league participated in a senior level "pow-wow" in Dec of 2017 along with the NCAA and other stakeholders to try and change the narrative in an effort to "protect the game."
It's not likely that coming clean on alcohol would further that goal, but 1.3million parents might feel protecting the players is far more important, and see it as an inspired PR opportunity of seismic proportion. What say you all?

Texto completo: Williamsburg Regional Library is in the middle of its One Book One Community program, with residents sharing the experience of reading a single title: Tommy Orange's "There, There." Soon he'll visit, on Jan. 24, for a discussion of his work. In the novel, he tells the story of 12 American Indians in the time leading up to the great powwow in Oakland, California, and how they will converge there, in their promised land, an event that changes lives.
Colm Toibin, reviewing "There, There" in The New York Times, called it "an ambitious meditation on identity and its broken alternatives, on myth filtered through the lens of time and poverty and urban life, on tradition all the more pressing because of its fragility."
Other events planned by the library and The College of William & Mary: group discussions on Monday at 2, and Jan. 21 and 27 at 7 p.m.; a talk about the history of the American Indian Movement at 7 p.m. Tuesday, and about the lives of urban Indians, at 7 p.m. Jan. 23; and a discussion with Native students at William & Mary, 7 p.m. Jan. 29. Details: www.WRL.org, 757-259-4040.
Reminders: Sci-fi/fantasy writers with a strong military link are invited to a discussion with writer David Weber. 2 to 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, Muse Writers Center, 2200 Colonial Ave., Norfolk. Details: The-Muse.org. ... Brad Taylor will sign his latest Pike Logan novel, "Hunter Killer," starting at 7 p.m. Friday. Barnes & Noble Town Center, 4485 Virginia Beach Blvd., Virginia Beach. 757-901-6905.
Romance Writers of America has found itself mired in controversy. For years the romance genre has been criticized as inadequately diverse; writers and their characters are mostly white, though publishers have called for more books by writers of color. In that context, last summer an ethics committee member, Courtney Milan, criticized Kathryn Lynn Davis' novel "Somewhere Lies the Moon" as "a racist mess," citing its descriptions of Chinese women's appearances and behavior. Davis complained to RWA.
RWA largely booted out Milan, who posted its letters online, which resulted in protests from Nora Roberts, Cynthia Eden and others, which led RWA to change its mind, which didn't prevent eight board members and a former president from quitting, and a petition from circulating online.
Now, in the past few days, RWA canceled its awards - the Ritas - after contestants and judges dropped out; several publishers decided not to attend or sponsor this year's conference; and the president and executive director resigned. (NYT)

New and recent
"Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin's Most Dangerous Hackers" by Andy Greenberg, a Wired correspondent (Doubleday, 348 pp.). An "immensely readable" book, "a hair-raising, cautionary tale about the burgeoning, post-Stuxnet world of state-sponsored hackers," said a Washington Post reviewer. It "goes beyond influence campaigns and ransomware. Greenberg lays out in chilling detail how future wars will be waged in cyberspace and makes the case that we have done little, as of yet, to prevent it."
"In Hoffa's Shadow: A Stepfather, a Disappearance in Detroit, and My Search for the Truth" by Jack Goldsmith (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 368 pp.). Not the usual speculation; this is a "gripping hybrid of personal memoir and forensic procedural." (NYT)

Women ruled decade in books

Autor: Bancroft, Colette.

Texto completo: There are many lenses through which to look at books in the decade just past. But one thing is certain: Women writers were a powerful force.
Early in the decade, best-seller lists were dominated (sorry) by E.L. James' "Fifty Shades of Grey" trilogy, which sold 35 million copies in the United States - making the novels the three best-selling books of the decade in any genre.
As the decade ended, the book-selling champ was Michelle Obama with her memoir, "Becoming." With more than 10 million copies sold worldwide (fueled by an unprecedented rock-star book tour), it was the best-selling book of 2018 and was on track to take the 2019 title. Another contender is Delia Owens, a 70-year-old wildlife biologist whose first novel, "Where the Crawdads Sing," is an unlikely phenomenon, selling more than 4.5 million copies and spending 30 weeks at No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list.
What these books have in common, and what they share with many other notable books of the decade, is that they were written by women. According to the NPD Group, a market research company that analyzes fields including book-selling data, women wrote eight of the 10 best-selling books between 2010 and 2019. (The only men on the list are John Green with "The Fault in Our Stars" and Stieg Larsson with "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" - both, by the way, books about female characters.)
It's not just a matter of copies sold, either. Many of the decade's major book prizes were won by women. Take fiction awards: Five of the 10 National Book Awards went to women - Jesmyn Ward won two, for "Salvage the Bones" and "Sing, Unburied, Sing" - as well as seven of nine National Book Critics Circle awards (but only two of nine Pulitzer Prizes).
The decade has seen an extraordinary run of literary fiction by women, starting in 2010 with Jennifer Egan's amazing "A Visit From the Goon Squad." It was followed by such standout books as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's "Americanah," Donna Tartt's "The Goldfinch," Lauren Groff's "Fates and Furies," Elizabeth Strout's "My Name Is Lucy Barton" and many, many more.
And, of course, there is the comeback novel of the decade, Margaret Atwood's darkly stellar "The Handmaid's Tale," published in 1985 but suddenly relevant. Atwood followed it up this year with a timely sequel, "The Testaments."
Popular fiction by women included juggernauts like Gillian Flynn's "Gone Girl," Paula Hawkins' "The Girl on the Train" and Veronica Roth's "Divergent" series.
Suzanne Collins' "The Hunger Games" was published in 2008, but it ranks as the No. 4 best-seller of this decade with 8.7 million copies.
Women wrote major works of nonfiction as well.
The decade had barely begun when Rebecca Skloot published "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"; the same year saw publication of Isabel Wilkerson's "The Warmth of Other Suns." Other nonfiction standouts include Elizabeth Kolbert's "The Sixth Extinction," Katherine Boo's "Behind the Beautiful Forevers" and Jane Mayer's "Dark Money."
There have been a number of stunning memoirs by women since 2010, including Patti Smith's "Just Kids," Helen Macdonald's "H Is for Hawk," Margo Jefferson's "Negroland," Cheryl Strayed's "Wild," Roxane Gay's "Hunger," Valeria Luiselli's "Tell Me How It Ends" and Tara Westover's "Educated." The true crime genre is exploding in popularity, and much of it is written by women, such as "I'll Be Gone in the Dark" by Michelle McNamara, "Furious Hours" by Casey Cep and "American Fire" by Monica Hesse.
Women aren't just writing more; they read more. According to the Pew Research Center, 78% of women report having read one or more books in the past year, while only 68% of men have.
The surge of women's writing shows no sign of slowing. Among the most anticipated books of 2020: Zora Neale Hurston's "Hitting a Straight Lick With a Crooked Stick," Hilary Mantel's "The Mirror and the Light," Louise Erdrich's "The Night Watchman" and Emily St. John Mandel's "The Glass Hotel." And that's just between January and March. Looks like a promising decade.

Texto completo: Can any past presidential campaign help us understand the election year now beginning? There never was a sitting president like Donald Trump. But if we widen our lens, we find timely echoes in an era when America was rapidly changing, the old political order was coming apart, and it seemed like the country was about to split at the seams.
An early version of modern-day America was already visible in June 1856. At a music hall in Philadelphia, delegates of the recently founded Republican Party gathered for their convention and chose their first-ever presidential nominee. Supporters unfurled an American flag onstage that bore his name: John C. Frémont.
The crowd in that music hall was cheering a historic moment: the commencement of the first presidential campaign by a major party that was meaningfully opposed to the spread of slavery. Southern states held close to four million people in bondage, and the national electoral reality had always required presidential candidates to accommodate the South. Republicans, based in the free states of the North, sought a different path to power under their slogan “Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Men and Frémont.”
Their candidate was a bearded explorer of the American West and among the most admired men of his time. Friendly newspapers called him “the Rocky Mountain candidate,” a rugged and heroic agent of progress.
Opponents soon remade his image through a cascade of lies. They accused him of radical beliefs that he did not hold. They also revealed he was the out-of-wedlock son of an immigrant (true) and then claimed that he was an immigrant himself (false), born outside the United States and thus ineligible for the presidency. The birthers of 1856 added an even more devastating false claim that Frémont was an adherent of a dangerous and alien religion, Catholicism.
These attacks played out across a deeply divided nation. Beyond the clash over slavery, a movement against immigration was reshaping politics. Native-born citizens voted out lawmakers sympathetic to foreigners and promoted conspiracy theories that the pope would use Irish Catholics to control the country. They led marches into immigrant neighborhoods, deliberately provoking violence. Some politicians saw anti-immigrant fervor as a perfect distraction, which they could use to unite proslavery and antislavery voters against a common foreign enemy. But slavery was too much for the hatred of outsiders to obscure.
In theory, new technology could have brought the country together. The recent invention of the telegraph miraculously sped communications, making it possible for newspapers across the country to print the same news almost simultaneously. In reality, voters were horrified by what they learned about one another.
In May 1856, Preston Brooks, a proslavery representative from South Carolina, walked into the United States Capitol and used a cane to beat Senator Charles Sumner, a critic of slavery from Massachusetts. The telegraph sped the news both north and south — but it was filtered through partisan editors, who described it differently to their tribes. Northern voters were outraged by the attack, and even more outraged when the telegraph informed them that Southern voters were celebrating it.
“The question of slavery, at the present day, should not only be the greatest question, but very nearly the sole question,” said the Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln in an 1856 campaign speech for Frémont. He was correct — yet from our distant vantage point, we can see that the disagreement in the 1856 election was relatively narrow. Republicans did not actually favor abolition, which was considered an extreme position; they merely wanted to block slavery from spreading into newly opened territories of the West. Their main rivals from the Democratic Party did not technically favor slavery’s expansion; they wanted to avoid prohibition and leave the matter to the voters in new territories.
This policy difference became explosive for a reason that feels very modern: It touched on the country’s demographic change. Northern states had grown far more rapidly than the South in population, which gave them increasing political power. The admission of California as a free state in 1850 gave them even more leverage over the South. In 1856, Republican leaders saw an opportunity to win the presidency with Northern votes alone.
White Southern leaders perceived a plot to shut them out of power and believed they would be permanently outnumbered if they were blocked from creating new slave states in the West. They threatened to secede from the Union if Republicans won. Pamphlets made this threat explicit. “The fearful issue,” one said, was whether the Union would “stand or fall” — and its destruction would be Frémont’s fault if he won, even though white Southerners were making the threat.
Anyone who has witnessed the past decade of American politics cannot be surprised by how destabilizing this demographic change was in the 1850s. Progressives — and Republicans then were the more progressive party — confidently expected that population changes would help them win without having to compromise with conservatives. Conservatives — who then were proslavery Democrats — vowed to wreck the system if they could not reinforce it against the change they dreaded.
Fear prevailed over demographics in 1856. A Democrat won the election: James Buchanan, a Northerner strongly tied to Southern interests. Buchanan then manipulated the courts to entrench his proslavery views. He lobbied the Supreme Court to make its Dred Scott decision in 1857, which proclaimed that black people were not citizens and that the phrase “all men are created equal” in the Declaration of Independence did not mean what it said.
The true meaning of this story is in its aftermath. Republicans persisted through another election, trying again in 1860 to win the presidency with Northern votes alone. This time their demographic gamble succeeded as their nominee, Abraham Lincoln, prevailed against divided opposition. Southerners followed through on their threat to destroy the system, firing the first shot of the Civil War in 1861. Yet their efforts backfired. The war led to a leap in human progress that few political leaders contemplated at the start: Congress abolished slavery by passing a constitutional amendment soon after the war.
What are lessons for 2020? Expect a terrifying year. What drives Americans to extremes is not losing an election but the fear of losing for all time. As Democrats and progressives count on an evermore diverse population to ensure victory, some of President Trump’s supporters foresee permanent defeat. Fox News stokes dread of demographic change with repeated images of migrants climbing fences. The president told supporters as a candidate in 2016 that he was their “last chance” to save the country.
Some of Mr. Trump’s critics fear permanent defeat for their side as he appoints judges who could remake the courts for a generation and dismisses limits on his power by asserting “the right to do whatever I want as president.” He has tweaked his critics’ anxieties, once sharing a social media meme that showed him unconstitutionally returned to office after 2020 — in 2024, 2028, 2032 and far beyond.
When politicians exploit such fears, voters can find an antidote by recalling the aftermath of 1856. Whatever the result in 2020 — and it’s a safe bet that close to half of us will consider it a disaster — another election will follow. We hope.

Texto completo: Sen. Pat Roberts, had a stirring, if somewhat rhetorical statement. After listing some of the accusations against Clinton, he asked:
“Do these actions rise to the level envisioned by our founding fathers in the Constitution as ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ so warranting removal from office? Our Constitution requires that the threshold for that judgment must be set by each senator sitting as a juror.
“Again, I believe an open-minded individual applying Kansas common sense would reach the conclusion that I reached.” (Source: The New York Times.)
Roberts voted to convict Clinton on both impeachment counts.
Sen. Jerry Moran, then a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, had his own stirring words:
“The untruthful actions of the president are not mere technical violations of federal law; rather, the president’s lies, obfuscation and overt acts to obstruct justice are serious and felonious, and they tear at the essential foundation of our judicial system.” (Source: The Guardian.)
The U.S. Senate will soon hold another presidential impeachment trial (exactly when depends on wrangling between Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell), and we would ask Roberts and Moran to cast their minds back to their statements of more than two decades ago.
Do they truly believe that the accusations against President Trump — all but admitted to by the chief executive and those around him — fail to reach the level of the charges against Clinton? Do they truly believe that pressuring allies to investigate political rivals in exchange for sorely needed foreign aid is a best practice?
If Roberts and Moran are dedicated to upholding the honor and integrity of the highest office in the land, then what do they make of a president who consistently and publicly insults others in the crudest ways, all while pushing against the limits of his power?
We believe that the current senators were correct, more than two decades ago, to treat the charges against Clinton seriously and soberly. They understood the situation and spoke about it clearly and in moral terms.
We’re not saying whether they should vote to remove President Trump from office, but we are urging the senators to treat the charges with the utmost degree of import. That would include lobbying to hear from witnesses. Former national security adviser John Bolton has signaled his willingness to testify after months of silence. Senators should want to hear him.
We trust that Roberts and Moran will use the same moral compasses and sober outlooks they employed in 1999.
And if they don’t? That tells us something, too.

Texto completo: Crash may cause Iran to implode
A bad week for Iran keeps on getting worse.
In some respects, the downing of the Ukrainian jet, possibly by Iranian missiles, may be worse than the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
Gen. Soleimani will be sorely missed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Quds Force. But many people in the United States and around the world knew little or nothing of Soleimani and what he did and stood for. On the other hand, most people understand what it means when a passenger airliner goes down. The first thought is: "What happened and why?"
When an airplane crashes, the "why" is answered by an investigation and recovery of the black boxes. It's not clear how much Iran is cooperating with the investigation, and whether the black boxes will be shared with other investigators.
Iran continues to deny shooting down the plane, saying it plane went down because of mechanical problems.
Iran's denial is demonstrating its institutional lack of transparency and accountability. If Iran continues to deny responsibility, it will lose even more credibility and will look foolish and feckless. Coupled with its horrible economy, Iran may well implode from within.
Thomas Miller, Madison
White House must release documents
I know that making an assumption is dangerous.
But after reading the Jan. 4 New York Times article on the White House's refusal to release 20 emails about the Ukrainian aid freeze, I believe I can make this assumption: President Donald Trump is attempting to hide evidence that would show his guilt in the "perfect phone call" with the newly elected president of Ukraine.
In response to a court ruling on a Freedom of Information lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the White House delivered a "terse letter" giving a blanket refusal to turn over any of the 40 pages of emails - not even with redactions.
Who would it harm to turn over emails between a top aide to the president's acting chief of staff and Michael Duffy, an official in the White House Office of Management and Budget?
I'm assuming I know who the guilty party is. What about you?
Mary Johnson, Middleton
This election, vote your pocketbook
Early in my working career, I had a boss who was a real jerk. He was loud, pushy, arrogant, foul-mouthed and quite full of himself. He was easy to dislike. My coworkers and I used to bad mouth him. We talked about his appearance and his bald head. We picked at his every move.
He told us his purpose in life was not to make friends with us, but to make money for us. He said that his job was not to make the sales team love him, but to make the sales team rich. He used to say it was our family's financial future that we should focus on.
Guess what. He was right. I learned to keep my eye on what was important.
When election time comes around, don't lose sight of your goals. Do you want to vote for a candidate that you like, or do you want to choose someone whose actions and policies will allow you to provide a good life for you and your family?
I worked for a jerk whose policies gave me a good paying job. The choice was simple. Vote your pocketbook. Love doesn't equal food.
Bruce Longfield, Middleton
Magazine was right to question Trump
The magazine Christianity Today recently took heavy flack from some evangelical supporters of President Donald Trump. They claimed the magazine's decision to support impeachment was merely a political matter, rather than a theological issue.
The retiring editor of the magazine observed that many defenders of the president would not even publicly recognize the underlying and clearly established facts.
Doesn't that failure impose a fundamental theological problem? If one is not willing to address the facts, how can one then claim to be a witness to truth - and more theologically speaking, then claim the authority to interpret or to be a witness to God's will?
Has President Trump sawed off the "head of the cross" to make large "T"?
John Krueger, Middleton
Christians can't back Democrats
The author of the Jan. 6 letter to the editor "Backing Trump is hypocritical" asserted that backing President Donald Trump is hypocritical to Christianity.
Both major political parties in the United States support things that go against true Christian values and doctrine, so it is blatantly unfair to suggest that the Republican Party has that market cornered.
For example, the Democratic Party supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, while the Bible makes absolutely clear that sexual relations between anything other than one man and one woman is "detestable," "unnatural," "shameful" and a "perversion." Admittedly, some so-called "Christian" church bodies look the other way on this issue today, but that's another discussion. Read Leviticus 20:13 and Romans 1:26-27, and it's very clear what God thinks of it.
Another clear example is abortion, the murder of unborn infants, which Democrats support under the guise of "women's health." Nowhere does God say that abortion is OK. Some Democrats even support the murder of babies who somehow survive this horrific procedure. Where does that slope lead? Murdering kids with physical deformities, or the elderly? Where does the line get drawn, and by who?
So let's be fair. True Christians should have huge issues supporting Democrats.

Krugman: Australia shows us the road to hell

Texto completo: In a rational world, the burning of Australia would be a historic turning point. After all, it’s exactly the kind of catastrophe climate scientists long warned us to expect if we didn’t take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, a 2008 report commissioned by the Australian government predicted that global warming would cause the country’s fire seasons to begin earlier, end later and be more intense — starting around 2020.
Furthermore, although it may seem callous to say it, this disaster is unusually photogenic. You don’t need to pore over charts and statistical tables; this is a horror story told by walls of fire and terrified refugees huddled on beaches.
So this should be the moment when governments finally began urgent efforts to stave off climate catastrophe.
But the world isn’t rational. In fact, Australia’s anti-environmentalist government seems utterly unmoved as the nightmares of environmentalists become reality. And the anti-environmentalist media, the Murdoch empire in particular, has gone all-out on disinformation, trying to place the blame on arsonists and “greenies” who won’t let fire services get rid of enough trees.
These political reactions are more terrifying than the fires themselves.
Climate optimists have always hoped for a broad consensus in favor of measures to save the planet. The trouble with getting action on climate, the story went, was that it was hard to get people’s attention: The issue was complex, while the damage was too gradual and too invisible. In addition, the big dangers lay too far in the future. But surely once enough people had been informed about the dangers, once the evidence for global warming became sufficiently overwhelming, climate action would cease to be a partisan issue.
The climate crisis, in other words, would eventually become the moral equivalent of war — an emergency transcending the usual political divides.
But if a country in flames isn’t enough to produce a consensus for action — if it isn’t even enough to produce some moderation in the anti-environmentalist position — what is? The Australia experience suggests that climate denial will persist come hell or high water — that is, through devastating heat waves and catastrophic storm surges alike.
You might be tempted to dismiss Australia as a special case, but the same deepening partisan division has long been underway in the United States. As late as the 1990s, Democrats and Republicans were almost equally likely to say that the effects of global warming had already begun. Since then, however, partisan views have diverged, with Democrats increasingly likely to see climate change happening (as indeed it is), while Republicans increasingly see and hear no climate evil.
Does this divergence reflect changing party composition? After all, highly educated voters have been moving toward the Democrats, less-educated voters toward the Republicans. So is it a matter of how well-informed each party’s base is?
Probably not. There’s substantial evidence that conservatives who are highly educated and well informed about politics are more likely than other conservatives to say things that aren’t true, probably because they are more likely to know what the conservative political elite wants them to believe. In particular, conservatives with high scientific literacy and numeracy are especially likely to be climate deniers.
But if climate denial and opposition to action are immovable even in the face of obvious catastrophe, what hope is there for avoiding the apocalypse? Let’s be honest with ourselves: Things are looking pretty grim. However, giving up is not an option. What’s the path forward?
The answer, pretty clearly, is that scientific persuasion is running into sharply diminishing returns. Very few of the people still denying the reality of climate change or at least opposing doing anything about it will be moved by further accumulation of evidence, or even by a proliferation of new disasters. Any action that does take place will have to do so in the face of intractable right-wing opposition.
This means, in turn, that climate action will have to offer immediate benefits to large numbers of voters, because policies that seem to require widespread sacrifice — such as policies that rely mainly on carbon taxes — would be viable only with the kind of political consensus we clearly aren’t going to get.
What might an effective political strategy look like? I’ve been rereading a 2014 speech by eminent political scientist Robert Keohane, who suggested that one way to get past the political impasse on climate might be via “an emphasis on huge infrastructural projects that created jobs” — in other words, a Green New Deal. Such a strategy could give birth to a “large climate-industrial complex,” which would actually be a good thing in terms of political sustainability.
Can such a strategy succeed? I don’t know. But it looks like our only chance given the political reality in Australia, the United States and elsewhere — namely, that powerful forces on the right are determined to keep us barreling down the road to hell.

Harold Burson, considered a giant in public relations, dies at 98

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Like many young veterans, Harold Burson came home from World War II full of ambitious dreams. He was 25, had worked in public relations before the war and decided to try it again in New York. It was 1946, and there were 540 local phone listings for “public relations" and “publicity" — a scrimmage of press agents who took reporters to lunch, hoping to plant items for clients.
Over the next five decades, Mr. Burson became one of the nation's most celebrated PR men, a founder of the giant Burson-Marsteller agency who broke ground not only by enhancing corporate images but also by helping clients soften the blows of potentially ruinous crises. These included a Tylenol-tampering case that panicked Americans in 1982 and the 1984 toxic gas leak that killed thousands in Bhopal, India, considered the world's worst industrial disaster.
Mr. Burson, who was hailed by the industry publication PRWeek in 1999 as the most influential PR person of the 20th century, and whose standards gave a luster of respectability to a business often seen as a confraternity of spin doctors, died Friday in Memphis, the city of his birth. He was 98.
A spokeswoman for his company, now known as Burson Cohn & Wolfe, said the cause was complications of a fall in November. He had donated archives of his work to Boston University, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1988.
Public relations has long been an easy target of critics, who liken its faceless practitioners to Machiavelli's Prince or Orwell's Big Brother, manipulating public opinion to hide truths and maximize profits. But to Mr. Burson, it was a profession that used the arts of persuasion for corporations and governments to publicize facts, not lies, for worthy social, political, and commercial goals — and, by the way, to make the clients look better.
“We are advocates," he told The New York Times in 1984. “We are being paid to tell our clients' side of the story. We are in the business of changing and molding attitudes, and we aren't successful unless we move the needle, get people to do something. But we are also a client's conscience, and we have to do what is in the public interest."
In 1995, Boston University established a faculty chair in Mr. Burson's name. Early in his career, a mentor had brought him to BU to speak to students.
“And I found myself learning as much from them as they learned from me," he said in a BU video interview that is posted online, in which he praised the creation of a public relations college curriculum.
“Today one of the big faults that we run into time after time is we get exquisite answers to the wrong problems," he said. “I think that the educational process has gone a long way toward defining the steps to be taken."
In 1953, after seven years at his own agency, Mr. Burson and William Marsteller agreed over a breakfast at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan to team up and call the new agency Burson-Marsteller, with offices in New York and Chicago. Over the next 35 years it became one of the world's largest and most successful public relations firms, rivaling Hill & Knowlton, as the industry evolved into mass marketing and global communications.
Burson-Marsteller's clients included Philip Morris, Merrill Lynch, Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil, General Motors, Dow Chemical, IBM, and American Express. The firm also served Nigeria, Argentina, and Romania — countries that had dictatorships and image problems.
Mr. Burson often was called in crises. When cyanide-laced capsules of Tylenol, the pain medication, killed seven people in the Chicago area in 1982, its manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, made the best of a bad situation. After consulting Mr. Burson, the company's chief, James Burke, announced a recall, ordered new tamper-resistant caplets and packaging seals, and mounted a campaign that acknowledged the facts, stressed safety measures, and eventually restored his company's credibility.
After the 1984 gas leak at a Union Carbide plant in India that killed as many as 3,800 people overnight and thousands more later, Burson-Marsteller helped get out the story of the disaster and company efforts to alleviate the suffering. Mr. Burson defended the work, insisting that Union Carbide, which paid $470 million in 1989 to settle lawsuits, had been forthright and ethical.
Burson-Marsteller promoted trade and tourism in Romania and Argentina. Human rights advocates said the work supported brutal regimes in the 1960s and '70s, but the company insisted it did not answer for the conduct of dictators.
Mr. Burson advised corporate CEOs to get bad news out quickly and fully, making it a one-day story rather than letting it drag out. He urged them to be candid and refused to take clients who could not be.
He married Bette Ann Foster in 1947. She died in 2010 at 85. Mr. Burson leaves their sons, Scott and Mark, and five grandchildren.
In 1979, Burson-Marsteller was acquired by Young & Rubicam, the advertising agency, which was absorbed by communications giant WPP Group in 2000. Mr. Burson remained as chief executive of Burson-Marsteller until 1989, when he became founder-chairman.
Harold Burson was born in Memphis on Feb. 15, 1921, a son of English immigrants, Maurice and Esther (Bach) Burson. He graduated from high school at 15 and worked his way through the University of Mississippi writing articles, at 14 cents per column inch, for The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. One article, in 1937, was an interview with William Faulkner; it made the front page.
He joined the Army in 1943 and removed land mines from Normandy beaches after the 1944 Allied invasion. He was later a radio reporter for the American Forces Network, covering early trials of Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg. On the eve of the trial of Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess, and others who had been close to Hitler, he caught the mood of an empty courtroom when, in a script, he wrote, “Tomorrow morning, the conscience of the world will be present."
He added: “These trials have a meaning even greater than the immediate importance of doing justice in reference to those men charged in the indictment with plunging the world into war. The real long-range importance of these trials would subsequently mean that we have, in our time, established an agency to which we could hold accountable the rulers of all nations of the world in years to come."

Texto completo: When I was a rookie at ABC News decades ago, our coverage of big stories—from war to impeachment to the World Series—always included plenty of "man on the street," or MOS. As soon as important news broke, a pack of reporters from TV, radio and print dashed to New York's iconic crossroads, Times Square or Grand Central Terminal, to learn what "average" folks were thinking.
MOS was never scientific. It consisted of quick sound bites from people given little time to think before blurting opinions. And it was almost always edited to create balance: If there were two sides to a story, we sought to represent them equally. The process was quaint and sometimes misleading, but it did serve as a reminder that not all issues are black or white.
The man on the street as we knew him is dead. He may reappear occasionally after natural disasters or in political battleground states. Most MOS coverage, however, has been replaced by a plethora of faceless polls—and even polling averages—along with tallies of likes, tweets and Google searches.
Following the Democrats' debate in Miami last June, USA Today reported: "Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard emerged as the clear winner by one objective standard: She got the most Google searches after the debate." There was nothing "clear" or "objective" about the story. Did people search for information about Ms. Gabbard because they liked her positions? Or were they simply curious about that outspoken woman in the red blazer?
Who are these googling masses? Where do they live? How old are they? Do they look you in the eye when they speak? These metrics have a scientific sheen, but they're no replacement for MOS. Neither are the other digital facsimiles.
Today when news breaks, reporters don't have to trek to Times Square. They can open Twitter and have the world's opinions at their fingertips. But they really don't have to bother with the general public. Politicians, entertainers and denizens of the B List also dish their digital opinions.
Following the Dec. 20 Democratic debate the New York Times ran a story titled "Who Won the Democratic Debate? Experts Weigh In." The report consisted almost entirely of tweets, more than a dozen of them, from "experts" such as former Obama adviser David Axelrod, and Meredith Kelly, a former spokeswoman for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's presidential campaign.
In some ways reprinting tweets is more journalistically careless than MOS ever was. The statements aren't spontaneous, they're crafted as mini news releases. There's no follow-up, no back and forth with the reporter.
Yet the power of Twitter shouldn't be underestimated. From #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter to scores of other influential hashtags, it has a profound effect on what journalists and politicians think about and report. But only 22% of American adults use Twitter , and it has a tendency toward groupthink.
One place where MOS remains a staple is in local news coverage. At the scene of a fire or horrific car crash, reporters still go after quotes such as, "It looked like a war zone" (the line we heard most over the years at ABC News), usually spoken by people who had never been to an actual war.
In the media lexicon, MOS has another meaning in addition to "man on the street": "mit out sound." Mit is German for "with" and this use of MOS refers to footage that is silent. You might say what remains of MOS in the digital age is now mostly MOS. The more tools we develop to give individuals a voice, the less we care about what they have to say.

Texto completo: The patient, a man in his 70s, had abdominal pain serious enough to send him to a VA Pittsburgh Healthcare hospital. Doctors there found the culprit: A gallstone had inflamed his pancreas.
Dr. Daniel Hall, a surgeon who met with the patient, explained that pancreatitis can be fairly mild, as in this case, or severe enough to cause death. Recovery usually requires five to seven days, some of them in a hospital, during which the stone passes or a doctor uses a flexible scope to remove the blockage.
But “because it can be life-threatening, after patients recover, we usually take out the gallbladder to prevent its happening again,” Hall said.
A cholecystectomy, as that operation is known, isn’t high-risk surgery. When done with a laparoscope to avoid large incisions, it’s usually an outpatient procedure.
But Hall advocates screening all older patients for frailty, and this patient met the criteria. He had coronary artery disease and liver disease, had lost weight and took multiple medications.
“He was sunken behind the eyes, skinny, unsteady on his feet,” Hall recalled.
Hall’s research, recently published in JAMA Surgery, has found that frail, older adults are more likely than other patients to die after even supposedly minor procedures - and even when the surgery goes well, without complications.
Frail, older patients frequently undergo such operations, which surgeons tend to see as routine, simple fixes - but may not be. “Our data indicate that there are no low-risk procedures among patients who are frail,” Hall and his co-authors concluded in their study.
So he had a lot to talk over with this patient and his son, who joined the discussion by phone.
What’s frailty? “It’s an accumulation of problems that leave the patient vulnerable to stressors,” said Dr. Ronnie Rosenthal, a surgeon at the Yale School of Medicine. “And surgery is a big stress.”
Even in healthy patients, surgery “demands a lot of reserve from your body,” she added. But when they become frail, “people already use whatever reserve they have just to maintain their daily lives.”
After operations, frail patients find it harder than others to regain strength and mobility, and to return to independent lives.
Doctors and researchers assess frailty in a variety of ways. Geriatricians often measure things like gait and grip strength, and look for unintended weight loss and exhaustion.
That face-to-face approach doesn’t work well for researchers examining large populations, so Hall and his colleagues developed a tool they called the risk analysis index. It allows them to calculate frailty based on illnesses, cognitive decline, ability to perform activities of daily living and other factors derived from medical records.
They applied that index to about 433,000 patients (average age 61) undergoing common surgeries - categorized as low-, moderate- or high-stress procedures - at VA hospitals from 2010 to 2014. Then the team looked at the patients’ subsequent mortality rates.
In this mostly male sample, 8.5% of patients were deemed frail and another 2% very frail. (At older ages, the proportion would almost certainly be higher; a 2012 review found that depending on definitions, frailty affects 14% to 24% of the over-65 population.)
Previous studies have shown that surgery poses higher risks for such patients, but “does frailty only matter for the big operations?” Hall wondered.
Results from the new study, limited to noncardiac procedures, appear to answer that question.
Surgeons consider operations high-risk if their 30-day mortality rate exceeds 1%. But for frail patients, even the lowest-risk procedures - including removing a cyst from the hand or wrist, repairing a hernia or removing an appendix - had a 1.5% mortality rate within 30 days. For the very frail, the figure was more than 10%, Hall and his colleagues found.
A moderate-risk procedure like gallbladder removal or joint replacement involved a risk of death that was higher than 5% within a month for frail patients and a nearly 19% risk for the very frail.
Those numbers rose over time. By 90 days, mortality after supposedly low-risk surgery climbed to 5% in the frail and about 23% in the very frail; for moderate-risk operations, the rates were about 11% and 34%.
After six months, roughly 9% of frail patients who’d had the lowest-risk procedures and 16% of those undergoing moderate-risk surgeries had died. So had 35% to 43% of the very frail.
It might not be the hernia repair or cyst removal, or complications thereof, that caused their deaths, of course. Those patients have shortened life expectancies, with or without surgery.
“Frailty means you’ve probably entered the last season of your life,” said Hall (who is also an Episcopal priest).
Moreover, living longer is not older people’s only concern or even their primary one, Rosenthal pointed out. “We don’t ask patients often enough, ‘What’s important to you?’ ”
A frail patient, she noted in an editorial published in JAMA Surgery, may opt for an operation that increases comfort or mobility, even if it also raises the odds of dying.
Screening patients for frailty may allow those facing greater risk to begin several weeks of so-called prehabilitation, to improve their nutrition and endurance.
But frailty also brings greater urgency to the discussions surgeons have with patients and families, who need to understand not only surgical risks but also what their lives may be like after surgery.
“It might not dominate the decision, but it could engender a few more questions,” Hall said.
When Hall discussed such matters with his frail patient, whose pancreatitis might never return, the man decided against gallbladder surgery. Time spent in the hospital, possibly in intensive care, and the potential need for recovery in a nursing home sounded unappealing.
From the patient’s perspective, “the risks of doing the surgery were greater than the risk of recurring pancreatitis,” Hall said. “We chose not to do the operation.”

Texto completo: A woman who bought her wedding dress at Stone Fox Bride was probably going to wear a flower crown along with it. She most likely idolized the Olsen twins and had an active Instagram presence. Her wedding was not going to be religious, but it was going to be spiritual, and her vows might even include curse words. She was going to buck tradition, and she was going to do it in a sunset-pink robe dress with silk chiffon bell sleeves that cost $6,800.
"Cool wedding culture -- I'm proud to say, I think I was the pioneer of that space," said Molly Rosen Guy, the writer and designer who founded Stone Fox Bride in 2012. The high-priced bohemian wedding brand was born out of Guy's frustration when she planned her own wedding and didn't see retailers and media brands that reflected her vision for her special day.
"I couldn't find anything that looked or felt like how I looked or how I felt," Guy said. "I felt like I was entering this radical union with this really radical person, and I wanted to celebrate it and explore it. But all I could find was like, articles on bouffants and Bergdorf Goodman, where my sister got her wedding dress."
Once she got into the business, Guy started posting "cool wedding" content on Pinterest and Instagram, which were beginning to take off. Sharing photos of her clients, herself, her family and glamorous weddings past, she amassed over 100,000 followers on Instagram. She also started a website and an email newsletter, landed a book deal and became the executive weddings editor at Domino magazine.
From the outside, it all looked picture-perfect. But like so many online personas, Guy's masked the more complicated aspects of her personal life. In 2017, she separated from her husband, but she did not tell her followers or clients for fear of losing authority as an expert on weddings and all things happily ever after.
"I did start to feel like, I have to be the perfectly imperfect bohemian mom, because that was the brand," she said. "You know, because I was selling $10,000 dresses or $5,000 dresses."
Even as her own marriage was falling apart, Guy continued to post about flower crowns and heirloom emeralds. That is, until 2018, when she came clean to her followers and renamed her brand. What happens to a weddings influencer when the honeymoon is over?

Building a brand
"First of all, the plan was never to be the public face of weddings," Guy said. "The plan was just to be a writer. To be the next Great American Novelist. I'm just kidding."
Sort of kidding. From the time she was young, Guy was obsessed with writers, celebrities and writers who became celebrities. She grew up in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. She attended college at Brown and spent a summer in Los Angeles trying to become an actress and a model, and going to clubs with Leonardo DiCaprio.
When Hollywood didn't pan out, she graduated and moved to New York to pursue a career in fashion media, landing writing jobs at Nylon and the now-shuttered teen bible YM.
In 2005, she took a break from the workforce to get an MFA in creative writing. She ended up selling a novel to Grove Atlantic, but "it sort of turned into a disaster," she said. She returned the advance and the book was never published. Then the recession hit, and Guy found herself boxed out of media, working instead as a copywriter for a large beauty conglomerate. After her wedding in 2011, she landed on the idea for Stone Fox Bride.
Guy secured $250,000 in investment from her brother-in-law, Peter Shapiro, the owner of Brooklyn Bowl. She rented a retail and studio space and started cold-calling designers to make samples for the store. Many of them, including Ohne Titel and Ryan Roche, said yes.
When she introduced her own collection in 2013, her friends Pamela Love, a jewelry designer, and Jemima Kirke, an actress, modeled the dresses for the photographer Cass Bird. One of the photos, featuring Kirke and Love kissing, made headlines. "That's when we started to blow up," Guy said.
Instagram became her journalistic outlet. It also became a place where Guy would share photos of her daughters and her husband.
"In hindsight, I wouldn't have done any of that," she said.

'Wild at heart'
By 2016, her marriage was coming to an end, and selling wedding dresses, in person and online, stopped being so fun. Guy closed her studio "the day Trump got elected," she said, and started selling her inventory out of her apartment, while her estranged husband lived in an Airstream around the corner.
"I was doing some wedding-dress fittings at my apartment with some very high-profile clients, and I would, like, pray to the gods that they wouldn't see him as they were walking in," she said. "I didn't want anyone to know that we were split."
"There was a lot of mental and emotional gymnastics that I was doing to sort of keep the brand afloat," she added.
At the end of 2017, Guy published her first book: a wedding planning guide "for the wild at heart." She was advised, she said, to keep her separation and eventual divorce a secret until the book was released. But shortly after, her father died, and she decided she did not want to keep up the "patina that I had things under control."
On Mother's Day in 2018, she announced her divorce to her followers on Instagram. To her surprise, they were supportive. In fact, the post got more "likes" than any wedding photos she'd shared before.
With her wedding-dress business all but shuttered, Guy wondered how she might connect with these clients again. She still had her Instagram following, which included a new set of women drawn to her long, confessional captions. And so last year, she asked them if they would be interested in taking a writing class about "love and loss."
Twenty-seven of her followers signed up for her first class. Now, teaching writing is Guy's main profession; she calls her new business the Brooklyn Writers Collective. Some of her former bridal clients are her students.
In a syllabus from this past summer, she described the course as a "crash course writing workshop" for "foxes in flux." She shares some of her students' best work on, yes, Instagram.
Guy said she created the class as a way for women to tell stories that are not easily represented with a diamond ring or a white dress. But she may find a way to do that in the future too: Women have started to approach her to make rings and dresses fit for a stylish and spiritual divorce.

Texto completo: When senior administration officials gathered in the Situation Room last Tuesday for a meeting to discuss the repercussions of the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Vice President Mike Pence had a seat at the table. So did Robert O'Brien, the national security adviser, and Mark Esper, the defense secretary.
But the White House aide whose portfolio is the Middle East was notably absent from the meeting.
Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, was sitting for a photo shoot for a planned Time magazine cover story. He was also absent from the Situation Room later in the day when it was clear Iran was launching an attack on American forces and the same officials rushed back, joined by Trump and West Wing aides like Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, and Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary.
Over the past few weeks, Kushner has had little visible part in what has been Trump's most high-stakes moment as commander in chief, the starkest example of how much his role in the White House is changing as the Trump presidency enters its fourth year.
Kushner has also served as the peacemaker in trade negotiations with Mexico and China, smoothing over disputes and serving as a mediator between foreign officials and Trump. But with the North American trade deal expected to become law within weeks, and the president poised to sign a first-phase China trade deal Wednesday, that role will be less of a focus.
Instead, Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, the president's older daughter, is positioning himself to be the overseer of something of even greater personal interest to his father-in-law: Trump's 2020 reelection campaign.
Unlike the behind-the-scenes role he played in the 2016 campaign -- where he was seen as a key figure but, campaign aides said, never took a title and avoided blame -- Kushner is positioning himself now as the person officially overseeing the entire campaign from his office in the West Wing, organizing campaign meetings and making decisions about staffing and spending. His more prominent role comes after much of 2019 was spent bogged down by the Russia-related investigations that dogged the president since he took office.
The portfolio marks a sharp departure from Kushner's focus in the early days of the administration, when he sought to be a central driver of administration Middle East policy, acting at times as a shadow secretary of state who circumvented official channels of power within the State Department.
"Since Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has come in, you've seen Jared's role narrow to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, who worked under former Secretary of State John Kerry on Middle East issues. "It's been a gradual move, and it's very striking right now."
Kushner declined to comment on his change in focus, but his allies in the White House say he sees no reason to involve himself as extensively in international issues now that the State Department is run by Pompeo, whom he sees as far more competent than his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. They also pointed to the fact that Trump's national security team now includes many Kushner allies, like O'Brien and Brian Hook, the special representative for Iran who has also worked with Kushner on the peace process.
Kushner's status as a member of the president's family has also made it possible for him to choose the moments and issues where his role is visible.
He played a critical role in persuading Trump to support a criminal justice overhaul, which he has also promoted as a way to help Trump win over African American voters.
But he has never unveiled a peace plan whose delivery date has been delayed indefinitely. And with Israel in its own political limbo, the expectations that Kushner's plan would form the basis of a deal are low.
In recent months, Kushner has been directing the construction of the president's wall along the southern border, telling associates he has a timetable for getting a portion completed by the election and holding regular meetings with status updates on how much mileage has been built. Kushner's wresting of control over the issue has generated criticism from some administration officials, who said he dives into other people's policy areas with abandon and little foresight.
Among Trump critics, Kushner's many roles have not instilled confidence.
"It seems like he just bounces around based on whatever issue intrigues him at any given moment, without regard for his past track record, or inexperience on any given issue," said Brian Fallon, Hillary Clinton's spokesman during her 2016 campaign against Trump.

Advice to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: Don't let the haters get you down

Texto completo: Yes, like numerous other people across the civilized world, I was oddly surprised but not really shocked to hear that Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his American-born wife, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, have decided to pretty much call it quits on the royalty thing.
Many other observers were far more upset. Suddenly Brexit, the American presidential race and the lethal tensions between the United States and Iran had to compete for our attention against the breaking news posted by the royal couple on an elegant new website: Harry and Meg will "step back as 'senior' members" of the royal family and work to "carve out a progressive new role" in the family and work to become "financially independent."
The British tabloid press, seldom a friend to the couple's privacy or dignity, pounced on the news like wolves on a lamb chop, erupting with such colorful and even overwrought descriptions as "selfish," "rogue royals," "a seismic shock" and "an atrocious lapse of judgment."
I saw that coming. Although Queen Elizabeth and the rest of the royal family showed as much enthusiasm in public as Britain's reserved culture and traditions would allow, the tabloids didn't hold back.
"Harry's girl is (almost) straight outta Compton," the Daily Mail blared in 2016, citing the Los Angeles neighborhood of Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland. In 2017, Rupert Murdoch's Sun apologized for a 2016 story with the misleading headline, "Harry's girl on Pornhub." Even worse was the BBC host who compared the couple's newborn baby to "a chimp." Not nice.
But not every Brit was in a snit.
"If the media paid more attention to Britain's communities of color," wrote black British journalist Afua Hirsch in a New York Times op-ed, "perhaps it would find the announcement far less surprising."
Indeed Hirsch, author of the award-winning book, "Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging," and currently teaching journalism at the University of Southern California, describes a Britain of rising interracial and interethnic tensions amid debates over Brexit, immigration, native nationalism and the nature of the glue that holds a society together.
I've seen this before. I worked temporarily in the Chicago Tribune's London bureau in the mid-1970s, at a time when "Paki-bashing," street violence by skinhead thugs against immigrants of color, mostly from South Asia, was making the sort of headlines that the crack epidemic made here in the 1980s.
It's not a headline for Great Britain alone. Today we see xenophobia toward immigrants rising across Europe, partly in response to mass migration by refugees from the Middle East. Tolerance for diversity is like the weather. It rises or retreats depending on atmospheric conditions, particularly the political atmosphere.
It was against that backdrop that the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex seemed like a much-needed breath of fresh air, much like President Barack Obama's election added new energy to hopes for peace on earth and opportunities for all, regardless of race, religion or ethnicity. Remember those days?
Alas, politics got in the way. For everyone who saw new possibilities in Obama's themes of "hope" and "change," there were other people who saw the dangerous possibilities of their opportunities closing. A lot of us who cheered Obama's victory as a new day for peace and brotherhood got a wake-up call when Donald Trump, whose campaign leaned on those same fears of immigrants and job-threatening automation and trade policies, pulled off a surprising victory in the Electoral College.
It was a surprising victory even for journos like me who had been writing about those job and displacement issues for years. That only underscores the value of paying attention, even in times of great victories, to those who are not cheering.

Language, power and why dolphins have accents

Texto completo: 'Don't Believe a Word'
By David Shariatmadari, 324 pages, Norton, $27.95.

It's astonishing that humans are expected to make our way in the world with language alone. "To speak is an incomparable act / of faith," the poet Craig Morgan Teicher has written. "What proof do we have / that when I say mouse, you do not think / of a stop sign?"
"Don't Believe a Word," a new book by Guardian writer and editor David Shariatmadari, delves into the riddles of language: the opacities, ambushes, dead ends, sudden ecstasies. It's a brisk and friendly introduction to linguistics, and a synthesis of the field's recent discoveries. So much more is now known about how language evolves, how animals communicate and how children learn to speak. Such findings remain mostly immured in the academy, however. Our "insatiable appetite for linguistic debate," Shariatmadari writes, is born out of confusion. "Why do millennials speak their own language? Do the words they choose reflect the fact that they are superficial, lazy, addicted to technology? How can you protect a language against outside influence? Does the language we use to talk about climate change, or Brexit, change the way we think about them?"
Shariatmadari organizes his book around a few core misapprehensions, taking decisive aim at some well-chosen foes. Enemy Number One: The pedant or self-styled grammar snob, who has been with us for at least 400 years judging by the examples presented here. "Even though the idea that language is going to the dogs is widespread, nothing much has been done to mitigate it," Shariatmadari writes. "It's a powerful intuition, but the evidence of its effects has simply never materialized."
The expressive power of language is undiminished, but human communication is in constant flux and ought to be understood, this book argues, as "a snapshot" of a time, place and particular community of speakers. Even the simplest words alter with time. Bird used to be "brid," and "horse," "hros," transpositions of letters that later became the norm. "Empty" used to be "emty" -- a transformation that reveals physics at work, according to Shariatmadari. "The simple mechanics of moving from a nasal sound ('m' or 'n') to a non-nasal one can make a consonant pop up in between" -- in this case, the "p" sound we hear.
Our bodies drive these changes, as do our yearnings for status and belonging. A study of Martha's Vineyard in the 1960s found that longtime residents were unconsciously adopting an accent to separate themselves from summer visitors.
Of all the factors that transform how we communicate, none are so powerful as young people, who have always steered language. They remake it as they learn it, inducing in older people a powerful sense of "linguistic disorientation."
To speak about language is always to speak about power. There is the power of linguistic innovation, which is often met by the powers of stigma and contempt, of racism and class prejudice. Perhaps no dialect has come under more hysterical attack than African American Vernacular English (AAVE). In the book's strongest section, Shariatmadari reveals how little the so-called guardians of the English language understand about English, let alone the particular innovations of AAVE, which linguists have described as a rule-bound language that has given us at least one new verb tense.
The scope of "Don't Believe a Word" is impressive. It pauses to consider what modes of communication can tell us about the working of the brain, its role in communal violence in India and whether some languages are genuinely richer, more expressive or efficient. Shariatmadari is an earnest writer -- clarity, not style, is his priority -- but the quirks of human and animal speech are strange and alluring enough to leaven the narrative. Who knew that dolphins had accents?
It's curious, however, that a writer so word- besotted should have such a blind spot for literature. Of course young people break and remake language. But so do poets. John Berryman was much on my mind as I read this book: "Nouns, verbs do not exist for what I feel," he wrote in "Epilogue."
Nor does this book explore some of the knottier questions it so tantalizingly dangles. How does language shape our understanding of Brexit and climate change?
In providing the reader a foundation in rudimentary linguistics and its history, Shariatmadari is perhaps prompting -- even inducting -- us into thinking through such issues ourselves.

Gang violence rocks Miss. prisons

Texto completo: Betty Turner dreaded what her son would face in the state penitentiary in Parchman, the Mississippi Delta prison that has, over the course of more than a century, earned a dark and near-mythic reputation for cruelty and institutional racism. Her fears were realized when he described meals of just a slice of bologna with a packet of mustard, sightings of rats and mold, and nights spent on a mat on a cold, damp floor.
But over the last week, such worries have come to feel almost trifling, as Mississippi's state prisons have exploded with gang warfare, riots, disorder and killing. Five inmates have died, three of them slain at Parchman. Two inmates escaped. Videos and photos of fires and blood-smeared walls, shot by inmates on smuggled cellphones, have spread across social media.
Now Turner's son, 27 and serving a 15-year sentence related to an armed robbery, is wondering whether he will survive.
"When my child tells me he's afraid -- and he's not the type to be afraid," said Turner, her voice trailing off. "... That's a problem."
Department of Corrections officials responded to last week's crisis with a systemwide lockdown affecting all of Mississippi's roughly 19,000 inmates. The lockdown was lifted for some regional facilities Tuesday, and the two escaped inmates have been apprehended.
But there remains a sense that Mississippi must now reckon with a disaster that has been a long time coming.
"You've heard the saying: 'Pressure busts pipes,' " said Benny Ivey, who spent more than a decade as an inmate in Mississippi prisons and now advocates on behalf of prisoners.
"This was gang violence -- it's the fact of the matter," he added. "But also the fact of the matter, if you ain't treated like animals, you won't act like an animal. They're people, man. They're our loved ones. They are our brothers, our uncles, our daddies, our grandfathers."
Last week, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., and a roster of state civil rights groups asked the Justice Department to open a civil rights investigation into the state's prison system. In a 23-page letter, they described "extreme" staff vacancies despite the third-highest incarceration rate in the country.
The letter also described a long record of violence, escapes, uprisings, inadequate health care and institutions where criminal gangs are tolerated. At one prison, the letter noted, gang members who dominate the kitchen withhold food to punish disfavored prisoners and control who gets a mattress or blanket.
"The Mississippi prison system is in a state of acute and undeniable crisis," the letter states.
Gangs are a fact of life in Mississippi prisons, with many members belonging to one of two rival groups with roots in the streets of Chicago, the Vice Lords and the Gangster Disciples, said Jimmy Anthony, a retired criminal investigator and instructor at the state police academy who serves as a spokesman for the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators.
Anthony said that sources inside the system have told him that some of the current trouble was sparked by tensions between these two groups, which maintain ties to Chicago leaders and Mississippi street gangs and are heavily involved in the distribution of illegal drugs in the state.
The recent burst of violence almost ensures that the long-standing problems in the state's prison system will take center stage as the Republican-dominated legislature begins a new session this month and as the state's governor-elect, Tate Reeves, prepares for his Tuesday inauguration.
Among the first tasks facing Reeves, who is white, will be finding a new commissioner of the corrections department; the current department head, Pelicia Hall, announced last month that she would be leaving her job for a role in the private sector.
Civil rights advocates say Mississippi's current penal system has been stressed by tough-on-crime measures, including "three strikes" laws that sentenced repeat offenders to life without parole and were popular during the "war on drugs" era of the 1980s and 1990s.
More recently, Republican lawmakers in Mississippi, as in other conservative states, have come to see these policies as straining families and burdening state budgets. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, the prison population in Mississippi grew by 300% between 1983 and 2013, to more than 22,000 inmates.
In 2014, the legislature passed ambitious, bipartisan and widely lauded changes to sentencing and corrections laws. Just over a year ago, President Donald Trump, who is seeking to reduce the federal prison population, cited Mississippi as a model and praised the "fantastic job" state officials had done.
The 2014 changes and others that followed have helped bring Mississippi's inmate population down to its current level of about 19,000 inmates, said Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law. But Johnson, a former federal prosecutor and a signer of this week's letter to the Justice Department, said that much more needed to be done.
Sen. Brice Wiggins, a Republican, agreed that there would likely be broad support within the Legislature to expand the push to find alternatives to incarceration, as well as boost pay and training for corrections officers.
But he also said lawmakers should tackle gang violence as a threat inside and outside of prisons. "It is an area that is not Republican or Democrat," Wiggins said of the recent unrest. "Everyone, from what I can tell, believes that we need to look at this issue and address it so that it doesn't continue to happen."
Last week, the Mississippi Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank in Jackson, published an analysis suggesting that the state could fund cheaper alternatives to incarceration like intervention courts, community diversions and drug treatment.
"We need to continue to reform our criminal justice system, and reprioritize and refocus its purpose," Brett Kittredge, an executive with the policy center, wrote in its analysis. "Simply giving a raise of a few thousand dollars to prison guards won't do that."
According to the letter to the Justice Department, the entry-level salary for a Mississippi corrections officer is $24,900, the lowest of any state. Critics say that job seekers in a good economy are, predictably, gravitating toward safer and less-taxing jobs.
In urging lawmakers to boost funding for her agency, Hall, the outgoing corrections commissioner, told them last year that there were more than 670 vacancies for staff security positions.
"We are operating in a pressure cooker-type situation right now," she said.

Texto completo: First anniversaries are marked with gifts of paper, second anniversaries with gifts of cotton, third anniversaries with gifts of leather, and so on. By that protocol, shouldn’t the Schaefer International Gallery be observing the Maui Arts & Cultural Center’s 25th with silver?
Yes, but instead, the Schaefer’s director and curator, Neida Bangerter, has opted for wood, which by conventional protocol ought to have had its turn two decades ago. And who will fault her? Start to finish, “The Woodworker’s Journey: Concept to Creation” strikes a chord of celebration.
An announcement of the exhibit speaks to the timeless, potentially universal attraction of the practices on view here: “The evolution of woodworking has been driven by a love of trees and their essential role in nature, providing shade, food, oxygen, shelter, warmth and beauty.”
In consultation with Peter Naramore of Maui and Tai Lake of Hawaii island, both of whom are also are represented in the exhibition, Bangerter has assembled new pieces by 25 invited woodworkers from the Aloha State and the mainland, all masters of their varied crafts. The guidelines for participants were deliberately kept simple. The work might be functional, conceptual or purely decorative, but the primary material had to be wood.
The wood, as it turns out, proves as arresting as the work, and vice versa. The checklist of entries (all offered for sale, at prices from $ 1,428 to $ 48,000, many already taken) runs from grandly scaled pieces of furniture only teams of professional movers could manage to carvings that fit into the palm of a hand.
>> Ted Lott’s “Dwell #4,” which recycles a found suitcase, seems part rebus, part social critique. Targeting the 46th U.S. president, Craig Nutt’s motorized “Instructable Object” translates take-no-prisoners political cartooning into the third (and fourth) dimensions.
>> “Manzanita Sphere,” by Roger Asay and Rebecca Davis, takes the razzle-dazzle of traditional Chinese openwork balls within balls of jade or ivory and turns it inside out, constructing a dense globe of broken branches from the inside out.
>> A single artist has opted, as it were, for camouflage. That would be Michael Patrick Smith, whose clawlike abstraction “Industrial Revolution” is covered in copper leaf, mimicking solid metal.
Every work in the show has stories to tell: stories of metamorphosis, beginning in the forest, the domain of nature, and ending in the workshop, the human domain of responsive minds and hands. Illustrated wall labels give clues about individual process and philosophy, providing glimpses of artists’ workspaces and technological know-how.
It’s striking how many masters and assistants are shown breathing through safety respirators. (Sawdust. Fumes. Of course.)
Apart from a subliminal scent of cut timber, a first impression upon entering the gallery may well be the luster of polished koa, glowing from within like the mineral known as tiger’s-eye. Joined together in sections like the iris of a camera, it shows to hypnotic effect on the top of the table Mats Fogelvik calls “Vortex Series #3: A Star Is Born.”
Precious yet durable koa dominates in a whole assortment of cabinets, none more hypnotic than “Tiki Torch,” by Robert Butts, which is remarkable, too, for its virtuoso stalk-and-leaf decoration in an assortment of tropical woods. The interior, redolent of camphor, conjures up a magic forest. (For a whiff, request assistance at the front desk. “Tiki Torch” is just one of many pieces of which you might wish to see the insides, and so you may, but please, only with the help of staff.)
Serendipitous correspondences pop up throughout the show. Where there are trees, there are birds — and thus it is here. In a fine instance of the ancient art of marquetry, Shaun Fleming’s imposing display case “Plight of the Nukupu‘u” depicts a perched honeycreeper “painted” in precision-cut shapes of paper-thin veneer shaved from a mix of arboreal sources.
Across the gallery a complementary flight of frigate birds adorns a side panel of Peter Naramore’s cabinet “Kula’s View.”
And where there are birds, surely there must be feathers. Miriam Carpenter’s contribution consists of a pair of them, carved from white oak and burnished with graphite powder, more or less life-size and real enough to qualify as “trompe l’oeil.” Nearby hangs Michael Cullen’s monumental “Fossilized Feather,” nothing lifelike about it, spread over six adjacent mahogany panels, each approximately 1 square foot.
A minimalist sensibility surfaces in Dean Pulver’s “Black Waterfall,” consisting of some 20 Douglas fir balls increasing in diameter from smaller-than-ping-pong to larger-than-tennis in frozen free fall along a shallow arc.
Minimalism in the repetitive rather than the reductive sense is on view in Paul Schurch’s “Waldo’s Coffee,” a smooth, slightly convex panel covered in a coffee-bean pattern of koa, mango and mahogany. Stripping function to form at its purest, Yuri Kobayashi’s “Breathe — I Hear You (Rocking Chair),” airy in geisha-pale bent ash, raises the minimalist aesthetic of Shaker furniture to who knows what higher power.
San Francisco is 2,300 miles from here, Tokyo nearly 4,000, New York nearly 5,000. You could travel a long way to find a show as immediate in its visual appeal and yet as sophisticated in its ideas and craftsmanship as “The Woodworker’s Journey.”
Don’t hope to do it justice during an intermission at the MACC. It’s been a quarter-century in the making. Give it time.

Texto completo: Trump follows through on red-line warnings
I am writing in response to the Viewpoint by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, in in which he stated that "Trump just ordered the assassination of possibly the dumbest man in Iran and the most overrated strategist in the middle East: Maj. General Qassem Soleimani."
Well, retired General David Petraeus opined that "it's impossible to overstate the importance the significance of the attack that takes out Qassem Soleimani...", calling it "bigger" than the death of ObLaden".
Who do you think is more knowledgeable about this matter? Thomas Friedman, who has a long history of being dead wrong about his foreign predictions. Or Petraeus ,who has firsthand intelligence of both combatant's capabilities.
Soleimani was handpicked by Ayatollah Khamenei to lead the Quds Force responsible for the creation of Hezbollah and the Iraqi Shiite PMU that slaughtered Iraqi Sunnis and attacked the U.S. embassy in Baghdad this past December.
Soleimani was behind most terrorist operations carried out these past 20 years. The UN Security Council went so far as to ban him from leaving Iran.
Yet he did and Trump got him in Iraq proving that Trump follows through on his red line, unlike former President Obama.
Howard Zipper, Boca Raton
Pull out of Iraq
I don't know exactly what is going on with Iraq and their relationship with Iran, but it seems to me that Iraq, who we have helped with our brave servicemen and women losing lives and being maimed, and our taxpayer's money, wants us out and wants terrorism in.
We should accommodate them and get the hell out of dodge. We should not lose any additional American lives or spend another American dollar.
Why should we ask the government of Iraq if we can stay? Their prime minister was marching in solidarity with the thousands mourning the death of that Iranian terrorist we took out. What does that tell us?
Harold Brown, Delray Beach
Pompous and self-righteous
The pompous, self-righteous op-ed by Bernadette Tasy "Christians see a promising future under President Trump" exemplifies that even school educated religious cult members (i.e., "people of faith") can lack comprehension and respect for others, for our constitution, and our corporate, real estate and tax laws.
Sadly, it also reinforces the delusion that male(!?) gods somehow respond and communicate to religious cults and their dozens of contrary and conflicting sub-cults leaders.
In the United States, when it comes to dictatorial power to impose a given cult's believes and practices on others, including through demanded governance (such as controlling women, their bodies and their health), money and size do matter.

Unveiling the truth behind the 'great experiment'

Texto completo: New York Times bestselling author Susannah Cahalan shines a light on a turning point in the field of psychology with her second book, "The Great Pretender."
The award-winning author of "Brain on Fire," Cahalan presents in her new book a thoroughly researched and thoughtful assessment of Stanford psychologist David Rosenhan, whose 1973 undercover investigation into the country's mental illness facilities would bring about major – and more compassionate – approaches to treatment.
The twist that Cahalan reveals is that Rosenhan was not forthcoming in many of the "facts" of that study – leaving readers with plenty of clues to make their own conclusions about his intentions.
As a writer who shared her shocking struggles with a rare autoimmune disease of the brain in her first book, Cahalan has become an influential voice on the approach to mental health in America.
She lives in Brooklyn with her family.
After your experience of having a rare autoimmune disease of the brain that was misdiagnosed as a mental illness (and led to your first book, "Brain on Fire,") what caught your interest to write a book about Stanford psychiatrist David Rosenhan's well-known study and subsequent article "On Being Sane in Insane Places"?
My interest was piqued during a conversation with two Harvard researchers who study the brain. I told them a bit about a woman who I call my "mirror image," a young woman around my age who went misdiagnosed for two years and would never fully recover. It prompted one of the researchers to say that we both essentially were modern-day pseudo-patients – testing the nature of psychiatric diagnoses and finding it lacking, much like a famous pseudo-patient experiment in the 1970s.
I read the study that night in my hotel room and immediately was transfixed, not only by the focus on misdiagnosis but the beautiful, spot-on descriptions about how you are treated when there is a psychiatric label attached to you. I immediately knew that I wanted to learn more about the study and the man behind it.
In what ways has Rosenhan's 1973 study been groundbreaking in changing the field of psychiatry?
You can't really underplay the role that this one study had on psychiatry and public perception of the field. The study occurred right at the center of a lot of controversy hitting psychiatry – rampant public distrust, a movement away from Freud, issues with diagnosis, lack of clarity about its role within the rest of medicine. This study hit into the heart of all of its insecurities.
It was an embarrassment to the field, and as I found out, even played a role in reshaping the field towards a more biological approach, encapsulated by the creation of the DSM-III. It also gave fodder to the antipsychiatry movement and to the growing push to close institutions, something called deinstitutionalization.
"The Great Pretender" is a journalistic investigation of Rosenhan's study, as you searched diligently for the truth of what happened during his "experiment" that led to healthy people spending time in psychiatric facilities. As a result of your research, you discovered false statements and misinformation he included as "facts" in his report. What did you come to suspect was his motive was for this behavior?
I can only speculate about motives. I think that he truly believed that he was doing positive work – at the time institutions were often terrible, shameful places and I believe that he felt he was accurately pinpointing a real problem. I also think that he wanted to make a splash with this piece, and I think that he allowed himself to take many liberties with the truth to get that splash.
Why did you believe it was important to write this book and expose not only the good that became of Rosenhan's work, but also the untruths he intended to pass off for true statements?
This study had such a tremendous effect and is still taught in many classrooms around the country. It's still trotted out as evidence that psychiatry lacks validity and its institutions are harmful places.
Though I do think there are serious limitations within psychiatry and its institutions, it's important to accurately pinpoint those problems so we can make progress. What this study does is allow us to look back, take a more nuanced and careful look at the mistakes and the misconceptions of the past, allowing us to clear the way for a real, open and honest discussion about the issues in mental health care for the future. At least I hope so.
Do you have suggestions for how your readers may be able to help those who experience mental health issues, in ways that could help make a difference?
On an individual level I think it's important to understand that someone who struggles with serious mental illness is not always "ill." We all at various points cross in and out of what we know as sanity and insanity. It's so easy to discount people based solely on their diagnosis and I hope that this provides some more insight into the complexity of that experience. I hope it shines some light into the complexity of all of our experiences with mental/physical/emotional health.
I also hope that it calls into question why so many of us sympathize with people when they have a "physical" illness, but we are far more likely to ascribe blame or be frightened or suspicious of someone with a mental illness. Why do we do this? I think part of it is the fear of the unknown – the brain is one of the final frontiers and the idea that someone could lose themselves without a known reason is deeply unsettling.
That said, I hope you look at people actively struggling with serious mental illness with more compassion – much like you would someone with any kind of chronic physical illness – after reading my book. That's my dream.

Texto completo: WEST LAFAYETTE – Former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Congressman Jeff Flake will be keynote speakers for Purdue's Martin Luther King Day of Celebration, the university announced this week.
Lynch and Flake are scheduled to discuss King's legacy during a talk at 7 p.m. Jan. 22 at Loeb Playhouse in Purdue's Stewart Center. Cheryl Cooky, chair of the University Senate, will moderate the discussion that night.
The event is free but will require tickets. Tickets will be available starting Monday, Jan. 13, at Purdue box offices in the Stewart Center and Pao Hall or online at www.purdue.edu /hallofmusic /BuyTickets/LoebBoxOffice .html.
Lynch served as attorney general under President Barack Obama from 2015 to 2017. She was the first female African American to hold that position.
Flake, an Arizona Republican, was a U.S. representative from 2001 to 2013 and a U.S. senator from 2013 to 2019. His book, "Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle," was a New York Times best-seller.
The event also kicks off a university series called "Democracy, Civility and Freedom of Expression," sponsored by Purdue's Division of Diversity and Inclusion.

Texto completo: The student shuffled into my office, looking forlorn. He had been in a few of my journalism classes and was a good student, a very nice kid. When he asked to close my office door, I suspected he had something personal going on.
He needed a letter of reference, a character reference. This was odd. Writing recommendations for graduate school or jobs was matter of fact for professors. But the letter he wanted – about his character – was for the police!
Seems he had been at a party where he drank beer and smoked pot. Then he got in his car, drove a block, and realized he was too stoned to continue. He pulled over and fell asleep. When the police knocked at his window a few hours later, he mumbled that he had smoked and drank and decided he couldn't drive. Honesty, not the best policy!
When the police arrested him, the story made the local newspapers. He was trying to get it off his record with an expensive lawyer. Eventually he succeeded, but, still, the story remained – forever – on the internationally connected network of computers where nothing ever goes away.
He could not scrub his WWW history.
If you want a right to be forgotten, you don't have it. When my student applied for a job or went home for a holiday, the story of his mistaken night haunted him. And he is stuck with it.
The internet, as the press before it has often done, thrives on the misfortunes of others. To wit: The Ten Most Embarrassing Moments to Ever Hit the Internet. Nipple Slips for Athletes. The Most Embarrassing Moments on the Internet. Embarrassing Moments on Live TV.
It's the stuff of tabloid web life. Not as bad as child pornography or deep web lurkers luring underage children or Russian bots. But bad enough that it is more and more being looked at as another internet foible we might try to fix.
The difference, of course, is that once the newspaper is buried in a landfill, the story is largely gone. Not now. It's the wonder, delight, benefit – and horror – of the internet. I can find everyone whoever messed up from days gone by.
Possibly, however, the tides are changing, although that little 45-word addendum that is in our Constitution, the First Amendment, might prevent – for good and bad – any relief to those besmirched forever by online content.
The right to be forgotten, sometimes known as the right to vanish, is commonplace and legal in Europe. And it is a great idea but in the end it just makes no sense, is wholly impractical, and violates the First Amendment. That 9 of 10 Americans support it, doesn't make it constitutional.
Here's how it would work: Google publishes something someone does not like. My student, for example, argues that his arrest was expunged from the public record; Why should it still be public in a Google search? So he asks the speaker, Google, to take it back, remove it. No apology, no money. Just get it out of sight ... it's forgotten.
But the question is, can you force a private speaker, a private company, whether it is the New York Times or Instagram, to take back their speech? The First Amendment is pretty clear and the answer is no. If I have invaded your privacy, sue me, prove it, make me pay. And make me take down the invading material. If I have defamed you, falsely hurt your reputation, you also can sue and be compensated.
But once the private material or defamatory words are published, not much can be done under existing law. Unless we want new "right to be forgotten" laws, as in Europe where there are fewer freedom of speech protections – and no First Amendment.
So many problems arise with such a law that it's hard to know where to begin. "Online service providers (primarily Google) may sometimes voluntarily remove links if presented with a court order, but U.S. courts generally have resisted efforts to compel them," concludes lawyer Kevin Vick, who has studied the issue and represents Hollywood clients. When Europe approved the right-to-be-forgotten law, Google almost immediately received 120,000 requests for action; clearly a burden even to a wealthy corporate behemoth.
Two years ago, two New York legislators introduced a bill allowing individuals to require search engines and online speakers to remove information that is "inaccurate," "irrelevant," "inadequate" or "excessive," or is "no longer material to current public debate or discourse."
The law will go nowhere because, after all, who decides what is excessive? If we had that in law, we could delete most of the President's daily inane tweets. If the content is inaccurate, sue for defamation. The public and press decide what is relevant, not the government.
In a world of compressed tweets and short news stories, nothing is ever adequate to cover a complex topic. Even newsrooms can't agree on this, let alone a judge who doesn't know journalism. Plus, more importantly, speakers decide their own content, not some government bureaucrat. The Constitution is clear: "Congress shall make no law." It's called freedom of speech.
And this doesn't address the more complex problem of what should never be deleted, like governing matters, public policy or facts on public officials. What else might be protected from adverse or embarrassing revelation is the stuff newsrooms have dealt with for years.
That raises the most important point:
Google likes to insist it's just a card catalogue: open the drawer, choose your book. They don't control the books, they claim.
But that's a dubious claim. Google needs to grow up, make choices and listen carefully and aggressively to people's requests to be "forgotten."
Google does have a process, but one hardly anyone knows and it's laborious; people who want to vanish have to find hired guns like ReputationDefender which says it will help bad stuff disappear or make it go to the back pages of searches.
We shouldn't need a lawyer to protect us from the mega-search vehicles that control 90% of how the world now finds facts. But our only option is to apply pressure because the First Amendment won't allow a law to force any speaker to take back speech (although I need to point out that we do have some laws to protect against "revenge porn").
Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, who some call the father of this emerging concept, writes: "Since the beginning of time, forgetting has been the norm and remembering the exception. Today, with the help of technology, forgetting has become the exception, and remembering the default."
What that means for us is a big question. We need Google's help, not the government, to wiggle us over this big bump in the information universe

Texto completo: New York Times bestselling author Susannah Cahalan shines a light on a turning point in the field of psychology with her second book, "The Great Pretender."
The award-winning author of "Brain on Fire," Cahalan presents in her new book a thoroughly researched and thoughtful assessment of Stanford psychologist David Rosenhan, whose 1973 undercover investigation into the country's mental illness facilities would bring about major – and more compassionate – approaches to treatment.
The twist that Cahalan reveals is that Rosenhan was not forthcoming in many of the "facts" of that study – leaving readers with plenty of clues to make their own conclusions about his intentions.
As a writer who shared her shocking struggles with a rare autoimmune disease of the brain in her first book, Cahalan has become an influential voice on the approach to mental health in America.
She lives in Brooklyn with her family.
After your experience of having a rare autoimmune disease of the brain that was misdiagnosed as a mental illness (and led to your first book, "Brain on Fire,") what caught your interest to write a book about Stanford psychiatrist David Rosenhan's well-known study and subsequent article "On Being Sane in Insane Places"?
My interest was piqued during a conversation with two Harvard researchers who study the brain. I told them a bit about a woman who I call my "mirror image," a young woman around my age who went misdiagnosed for two years and would never fully recover. It prompted one of the researchers to say that we both essentially were modern-day pseudo-patients – testing the nature of psychiatric diagnoses and finding it lacking, much like a famous pseudo-patient experiment in the 1970s.
I read the study that night in my hotel room and immediately was transfixed, not only by the focus on misdiagnosis but the beautiful, spot-on descriptions about how you are treated when there is a psychiatric label attached to you. I immediately knew that I wanted to learn more about the study and the man behind it.
In what ways has Rosenhan's 1973 study been groundbreaking in changing the field of psychiatry?
You can't really underplay the role that this one study had on psychiatry and public perception of the field. The study occurred right at the center of a lot of controversy hitting psychiatry – rampant public distrust, a movement away from Freud, issues with diagnosis, lack of clarity about its role within the rest of medicine. This study hit into the heart of all of its insecurities.
It was an embarrassment to the field, and as I found out, even played a role in reshaping the field towards a more biological approach, encapsulated by the creation of the DSM-III. It also gave fodder to the antipsychiatry movement and to the growing push to close institutions, something called deinstitutionalization.
"The Great Pretender" is a journalistic investigation of Rosenhan's study, as you searched diligently for the truth of what happened during his "experiment" that led to healthy people spending time in psychiatric facilities. As a result of your research, you discovered false statements and misinformation he included as "facts" in his report. What did you come to suspect was his motive was for this behavior?
I can only speculate about motives. I think that he truly believed that he was doing positive work – at the time institutions were often terrible, shameful places and I believe that he felt he was accurately pinpointing a real problem. I also think that he wanted to make a splash with this piece, and I think that he allowed himself to take many liberties with the truth to get that splash.
Why did you believe it was important to write this book and expose not only the good that became of Rosenhan's work, but also the untruths he intended to pass off for true statements?
This study had such a tremendous effect and is still taught in many classrooms around the country. It's still trotted out as evidence that psychiatry lacks validity and its institutions are harmful places.
Though I do think there are serious limitations within psychiatry and its institutions, it's important to accurately pinpoint those problems so we can make progress. What this study does is allow us to look back, take a more nuanced and careful look at the mistakes and the misconceptions of the past, allowing us to clear the way for a real, open and honest discussion about the issues in mental health care for the future. At least I hope so.
Do you have suggestions for how your readers may be able to help those who experience mental health issues, in ways that could help make a difference?
On an individual level I think it's important to understand that someone who struggles with serious mental illness is not always "ill." We all at various points cross in and out of what we know as sanity and insanity. It's so easy to discount people based solely on their diagnosis and I hope that this provides some more insight into the complexity of that experience. I hope it shines some light into the complexity of all of our experiences with mental/physical/emotional health.
I also hope that it calls into question why so many of us sympathize with people when they have a "physical" illness, but we are far more likely to ascribe blame or be frightened or suspicious of someone with a mental illness. Why do we do this? I think part of it is the fear of the unknown – the brain is one of the final frontiers and the idea that someone could lose themselves without a known reason is deeply unsettling.
That said, I hope you look at people actively struggling with serious mental illness with more compassion – much like you would someone with any kind of chronic physical illness – after reading my book. That's my dream.

Texto completo: History is just that. Cincinnati Councilman Chris Seelbach wants The Capitoline Wolf statue in Eden Park removed. Then there are those that want Charles McMicken's name done way with on streets and buildings. If we go back and see what everyone did a long time ago, we will lose our history. What former prime minister of Italy, Benito Mussolini, did was horrible. I lived though it. McMicken having slaves was almost as bad. But that is what was going on in this country. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson had slaves also; do we do away with their statues and signatures on the U.S. Constitution? I certainly don't like what they did, but it is history, and, hopefully, we learn from history.

Democracy is strong despite political polarization Marc Sennett's recent guest column in The Enquirer, "This is not my America anymore," was interesting but unconvincing as he warns us of an ill-informed American electorate caused by biased cable TV news outlets. It is true that one TV network may most often present news that aligns with conservative political views and policies, while another presents views that align with liberal political views and policies. This divergence in TV reporting is no different than print media, as The Wall Street Journal represents conservative views and philosophy, while The New York Times is left leaning in its reporting. Some voters are more informed than others but all eligible voters have the right to vote, and it's patronizing and wrong to suggest that voters can be easily manipulated and led by some news organizations. This is still my America. And though we live in a time of political polarization, our democracy is strong, and voters will continue as in our past to vote and determine the direction of the country.

Protests more about Trump than dead Iranian general President Trump recently ordered an air strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, an individual who few will dispute was responsible for the killing of hundreds of Americans and the wounding of thousands more. It was reported that the air strike was intended to head off an imminent attack on more Americans. Predictably, protesters rushed to the streets almost immediately after the air strike. Does anyone believe for a minute that these protests were sincerely about the air strike and not about the politics of the anti-Trump crowd? Where were these protesters when former President Obama ordered hundreds of similar air strikes on our adversaries? Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was quick to put out her expected politically biased statement, which included the words "disproportionate actions." For once, I agree with Mrs. Pelosi. The elimination of one terrorist leader responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans could be considered "disproportionate actions." Mrs. Pelosi should forgo her daily political statements and concentrate her efforts on something more positive for her constituents like cleaning up the filthy streets of San Francisco.

$150 million commercial center breaks ground at TRIC

Texto completo: If you build a huge commercial center in the largest industrial park in the United States, will the services come?
A group of investors is betting that the answer is "yes," as The Horse Oasis breaks ground this week for the first of several buildings at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center.
The $150 million project aims to fill a glaring need in the industrial park located just east of Reno-Sparks, said Batuhan Zadeh, head of land acquisition for real estate company Marmot Properties. Thanks to the arrival of companies such as Walmart, Tesla, Panasonic and Switch, the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center is now home to thousands of workers. The number of businesses that cater to those workers within the park, however, is extremely lacking, Zadeh said.
"The goal is to bring new services to USA Parkway," Zadeh said. "Right now, there are very few options compared to the number of people out there."
Restaurant options, for example, are limited to just a few dining spots such as Burger King, Philly's NV and Shanghai Express. There's also a drought of other services that cater to the park's workforce, including retail stores and health clinics. It's a sweet spot that The Horse Oasis hopes to take advantage of, especially given how only 12% of the land at the park is zoned for commercial use.
The Horse Oasis can have "an urgent care (facility), a charter school, a gym, doctor's office — anything that's not residential or industrial," Zadeh said. "The project is really bringing in the feasibility of providing space for companies."
Another chance for opportunity zone investors Construction of the full Horse Oasis project on 500 Italy Drive is expected to take several years, with KRI Architecture's Dave Madsen overseeing its design.
The first three buildings are slated for completion this year, followed by three more by the end of 2021.
Once the project is completed, there will be 16 buildings on the 871,200-square-foot site.
There is no timeline for when all of the buildings will be completed. Zadeh pointed to the challenging construction market as a key factor, with strong competition causing a shortage of available workers.
"I wish we could do all the buildings at the same time but the labor is not here," Zadeh said. "It takes about six to seven months per building (to finish)."
The Horse Oasis is also the latest opportunity zone project to hit the area with backing from outside investors. Opportunity zones fueled a flurry of activity before the end of the year as developers tried to meet an end-of-year deadline to qualify for higher tax breaks. The opportunity zone program rewards developers with significant tax incentives for building in economically depressed areas.
Downtown Reno alone has seen a slew of proposed projects tied to opportunity zones:
Las Vegas-based CAI Investments recently spoke to the Reno Gazette Journal about its planned 20-story boutique hotel on Court Street.
P3 Partners pitched a proposal to redevelop the former CitiCenter bus station site and also remodel the National Bowling Stadium and Reno Events Center.
San Francisco-based SVE Development has plans for a large multi-tower project called T3 North as well as a remodel of the old Woolworth's building called 101 North Virginia.
Opportunity zone projects, however, have also come with their share of controversy. These include the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, where The Horse Oasis is being built. The industrial park made national news after critics questioned whether Storey County received special treatment after the location was chosen as an opportunity zone.
The site was also tied to allegations involving former 1980s "junk bond king" Michael Milken, following a New York Times article that reported that he was invested in property at the industrial park. In a five-page statement sent to the RGJ in October, Milken denied any involvement in getting the site an opportunity zone designation. A representative of Milken also sent another statement on Tuesday that Milken "owns no such investment" in TRIC.
'We're not concerned about a downturn whatsoever' Funding for The Horse Oasis is coming from overseas via investment partners in Saudi Arabia.
Although the opportunity zone incentives were attractive, Zadeh insisted that they were not the driving force for the investment.
The Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center was already appealing to investors due to the presence of facilities such as Tesla' Gigafactory and Switch's Citadel Campus. Then Google came in as well. Given the names entering the park, the investors decided to buy 20 acres right away, according to Zadeh.
"It was about USA Parkway," Zadeh said. "The rest is just gravy."
Also, while funding is coming from overseas, the driving force behind the project involves local people. One of the brains behind The Horse Oasis is Fady Mehanna, who owns 1up, Brauhaus 701 and the Whisky Lounge.
With ongoing murmurs about a potential recession after the U.S. economy posted a record 10 straight years of growth in 2019, Zadeh responded that people behind the project are "not concerned about a downturn whatsoever."
"We're very methodical in the projects that we take," Zadeh said.
This includes The Horse Oasis, which is definitely a long-term play.
At the moment, there is a large untapped market in USA Parkway, with some projecting the number of workers in the area to grow to 30,000 in the next few years, Zadeh said.
In most communities, the target market for businesses like a gym, for example, is about 30% of the total population. At a place like the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, however, the share increases exponentially due to the large number of working individuals, according to Zadeh.
Zadeh is banking on interest in that large worker population to drive businesses to set shop in The Horse Oasis.
"You're directly targeting people with similar actions from the start of the day to the end of the day ... so you know who you're dealing with," Zadeh said. "Every single person is a target market."

Texto completo: The show title itself is enough to bring great hope: "The W. Kamau Bell Curve: Ending Racism in About an Hour."
Then again, Bell is a comedian. And his show is scheduled to last two hours not one, so it looks like the task might be a little harder than he thought.
Still, when it comes to insightful commentary on race, politics and social issues in America, Bell will bring A-list credentials to town when he performs his standup show at Nazareth College Arts Center at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 17.
Bell is the host of the five-time Emmy-winning CNN series "United Shades of America." He has done several podcasts and in 2018 got his obligatory Netflix comedy special, "Private School Negro." His writing has appeared in several national publications, including The New York Times, Vanity Fair and The Hollywood Reporter, and he has been nominated for multiple NAACP Image Awards and a GLAAD award.
His penchant for forthright commentary even earned him a place on Conde Nast's "Daring 25" list in 2016. (In case you're wondering if any of the edge has dulled in the intervening years, the Nazareth show carries this helpful reminder: "May contain strong language and content not suitable for all audiences.")
But audience members who like their language strong and their content not always suitable can also look forward to a lively experience. Bell has been through the club circuit, and he's not shy about interacting with the audience and getting a dialogue going.
"I don't want people just sitting in their seat observing," he said in a phone interview. "If it feels like a lecture, it hasn't worked out. It should feel like the audience is getting something they haven't gotten before."
So what are they getting? The title of his 2017 book gives a clue: "The Awkward Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell: Tales of a 6' 4", African American, Heterosexual, Cisgender, Left-Leaning, Asthmatic, Black and Proud Blerd, Mama's Boy, Dad, and Stand-Up Comedian."
He backs up that Blerd claim — aka "black nerd" — with the use of some Powerpoint (yes, Powerpoint can be funny) in his show along with video and audio clips and his own research to back up his edgy commentary on the state of things in the United States circa 2020.
For Nazareth College, it was a chance to bring in an educational entertainer — one who has been a frequent performer on campuses.
"Bell coming to Rochester continues the much-needed constructive dialogue around uncomfortable topics in our local, regional, national and global world," said Olajiwon McCadney, director for diversity and inclusive excellence education at Nazareth College. "By incorporating humor in this dialogue, Bell addresses the importance of threading humanity into these often-painful conversations."
The title of his show may be tongue-in-cheek, but Bell does hear from people who say he has had an effect on their lives, through his words on stage or his explorations of the many facets of race on "United Shades of America." One episode focused on the Sikh community in this country, and later he learned that a national Sikh group had adopted it as a way to educate people on the many misconceptions people have.
Another viewer said the episode caused her to seek out members of the Sikh community in her neighborhood and get to know them. She told him she even traveled to India to learn more. "You did this!" she told Bell. "I didn't do this," he said. "I didn't go to India."
So what it would take to truly end racism? The problem is too large for that, of course. Or as Bell put it:
"It's an all-hands-on-deck situation at this point. If you have a good idea, we'll try it."
Which pretty much sums up his work in general. He may not end racism in an hour, but he'll at least end the too-frequent silences around the topic — for two hours, even.
If you go
When: 7:30 p.m. Jan. 17.
Where: Callahan Theater at Nazareth College Arts Center, 4245 East Ave., Pittsford.

Texto completo: World War II history buffs, get ready for a chance to bid on a unique piece of history when the table used by five-star Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and other high commanders to plan the Normandy Invasion goes up for auction this week.
Bloomfield's Nye & Company Auctioneers will hold the auction on Wednesday.
The table figured prominently in the planning of D-Day as Eisenhower, who would eventually be elected as the 34th U.S. president, and Gen. George Marshall and other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff met at Stanwell House outside London in the months leading up to June 6, 1944.
Charley Potters, Nye's research historian affiliate, recalls his excitement when he received word of the table that was arriving from the estate of Ralph and Roberta Carpenter.
"Then, when I saw the table, my head went 'poof!' " Potters said.
The auction house is counting on similar reactions from collectors when the table goes on the block as part of Nye's Collectors' Passion Auction, which features many other objects of the Carpenter estate, including a 1775 mezzotint of Samuel Adams.
"I think objects have karma," Potters said.
He compared the Eisenhower table's significance to the furniture collection at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.
"People tend to gravitate to the table where the signing occurred," he said.
"Me? I think the inkwell is most important," he said. "All the people who were willing to sign and be hanged if the revolution failed had to dip their pens first."
"This table is like that," Potters said.
Authenticity One challenge in trying to authentic the table's history was the lack of photos from inside Stanwell House, Nye officials said.
Potters said if you think about it, the lack of photos does make good sense.
He said Stanwell happened to contain the biggest secret of the war. It was generally known that the Allies were going to invade Europe, but Hitler's Atlantic Wall ranged from the Spanish border to Norway.
Speculation ranged all along those coasts, and generally, the Germans believed the invasion would come at the English Channel's narrowest point, near Calais.
"No one, not even the Signal Corps, took pictures inside the house. Even the slightest bit of map could tip its location," he said.
That may seem hard to imagine these days.
"We take pictures of everything, even our lunch," Potters said.
Even without solid photographic evidence, however, Potters and Nye's Director of Business Development Andrew Holter are comfortable the table is the real deal based on several factors.
For one, there's the receipt for its purchase. There are a bill of sale and other documents from 1972, when Ralph Carpenter bought the table from antique dealer Carson and Booth in London.
Carpenter, as a Christie's Auction House employee, was apparently well versed in antique furniture.
In Carpenter's February 2009 New York Times obituary, Morrison H. Heckscher, the chairman of the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, called him "one of the greats in the field of American furniture and in American preservation."
His book, "The Arts and Crafts of Newport, Rhode Island, 1640-1820," is still also widely respected.
"He knew what he was doing," Holter said, adding that the table figured prominently in Carpenter's personal collection.
There's also the table's silver inset plaque, which reads: "This table was in constant use October 1943 to May 1944 for the deliberations of General Eisenhower, Allied Commander-in-Chief and his staff, who were then planning the victorious Allied advance in Germany. It was also used by General Marshall and Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army when plans for "D" Day were put into direction whilst staying at Stanwell House, England. May to June 1944."
Potters said his expertise is silver, and the table's well-worn engraving is written in script, a seriously difficult thing to accomplish. He said the details add credibility to the claim that Eisenhower and others sat around the table to hash out the invasion plans.
"They pass the smell test," he said.
There's also the fact that before the invasion, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces commanders held two top-level meetings at Stanwell House during the buildup to the Normandy Invasion.
For these meetings, top U.S. commanders War Secretary Henry L. Stimson, Navy Admiral Ernest J. King, General of the Air Force Henry H. Arnold, Eisenhower and Marshall stayed there.
Holter noted that the table itself is not especially noteworthy. It is a replica of a George III-style extension dining table. Just over 9 feet long and about 4 feet wide, it is a solid piece of furniture made sometime early in the 20th century.
It is, however, the table's "provenance," or the record tracing the ownership history of certain items that helps confirm their authenticity and value, that may attract serious World War II collectors, Holter said.
Then again, it is also these intangibles that make putting a price on the table difficult. Bidding starts at $5,000.
"This is about as close as you can get to D-Day in North Jersey," Potters said.

Texto completo: Most of us would think it strange if a teacher charged with sexually molesting his students or a surgeon accused of maiming his patients were allowed unrestricted access to other potential victims while awaiting a jury trial.
So why is a president who stands formally accused of abusing his constitutional authority for personal political gain permitted to exercise that authority with no restrictions whatsoever, even as he faces his own trial before the U. S. Senate?
It's a question that has acquired new urgency in the week since President Donald Trump rang in the new year by authorizing a drone strike that killed Iran's top general, an act of war that Iran answered Tuesday by firing ballistic missiles at two U. S. bases in Iraq. .
Because the attack came from Iran rather than from some Iraqi militia group in thrall to Tehran, alarmists are calling it a game-changing escalation that demands an even-harsher U. S. response. Even before the missiles were launched, Trump threatened to answer any Iranian retaliation in kind, "perhaps in a disproportionate manner. "
But Iran provided Iraq with advance warning of Tuesday's missile attack, allowing both Iraqi and U. S. forces time to move their personnel out of harm's way, and there is evidence Iranian missiles may have been deliberately targeted to minimize human casualties.
Whether an attack that may have been more bark than bite restores a fragile equilibrium, or triggers an increasingly destructive cycle of escalations, depends largely on Trump's next moves.
Diversionary ploy or US best interests?
Did Trump deliberately court the prospect of all-out war merely to distract his constituents from the impeachment articles he faces at home?
Perhaps not. The president has indignantly rejected any insinuation that the assassination of Qasem Soleimani was a diversionary ploy, insisting he ordered the hit only after reviewing "exquisite" intelligence suggesting that Soleimani was poised to launch new terrorist attacks on U. S. assets in the Middle East.
In an Oval Office meeting Tuesday with reporters, Trump said Soleimani “was planning a very big attack and a very bad attack for us and other people, and we stopped him. ”
But lawmakers who received no advance notice of the assassination continue to complain that the White House has disclosed no evidence of such an imminent threat, even in classified briefings, and Trump has spent most of his three-year-tenure disparaging the reliability of the intelligence analysts he now credits for spurring his initiative.
Backstory from Nicole Carroll: There is never a more critical time for truth than when lives are at stake
“Between no weapons of mass destruction, no clear and present danger, the Afghanistan papers — there’s plenty to be skeptical about,” Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, told the New York Times.
Which brings us back to Trump's unique credibility burden, and the dearth of resources available to congressional and military leaders worried about the president's motives.
What you lose when you're accused
We're fortunate to live in a country where even those accused of the most heinous crimes are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Even so, the government routinely restricts the liberties of criminal defendants awaiting the judgment of their peers.
Those accused of serious crimes are typically required to surrender their passports, and many must seek the court's permission to travel outside their home county. Defendants charged with financial crimes may see their assets frozen, and those whose professional conduct is at issue may find themselves barred from teaching, selling securities, or practicing medicine while they await trial.
Employers and financial institutions take their own precautions. Police officers, corporate executives and elected officials indicted on felony charges are often suspended, sometimes without pay, until those charges have been resolved. Banks routinely close the accounts of clients who've been indicted.
Impeachment is not a criminal process, and Trump has not been charged with any crime (although he may be more susceptible to indictment after he leaves office). Yet Trump's current circumstances are strikingly similar to those of a defendant who has been accused but not yet tried in court. You needn't believe the president deserves to be removed from office to understand that the prospect of such a verdict, however remote, has dramatically altered his risks and incentives.
Check power of impeached presidents
But though he stands accused of abusing the highest office in the land, Trump faces fewer restrictions than a storefront accountant suspected of cheating his clients. He can still issue executive orders, veto bills adopted by Congress, order the assassination of a foreign leader or put American lives and assets at risk as effortlessly as any president not encumbered by impeachment.
This makes no sense. The 25th Amendment, adopted after the assassination of President John Kennedy, establishes a process by which a president disabled by illness or injury can be temporarily relieved of his duties until those impediments are resolved. Surely the threat of imminent removal could pose as serious an impairment of sound executive judgment.
Stay vigilant: Iran may stand down, as Trump says, but cyber and terror attacks are the real threat
It's standard operating procedure for corporations to require that CEOs indicted for serious crimes step aside while charges are pending. But allowing the House of Representatives to sideline a president merely by adopting articles of impeachment would radically alter the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.
Even so, wouldn't it make sense to require that any impeached president face conditions on the exercise of his most powerful executive prerogatives? Shouldn't some other executive authority — the president's cabinet, say, or the Joint Chiefs of Staff — be required to sign off on presidential orders that threaten to embroil the nation in war or destabilize financial markets?
I'm not enough of a constitutional authority to guess which mechanism would be most practicable and least disruptive to the legitimate exercise of presidential authority. But surely the meager restraints currently in place are unequal to the dangerous circumstances our country confronts today.

Follow this new 70/30 rule for inventive thinking

Texto completo: The infamous 80/20 rule seems to permeate business literature: 80% of your profits come from the best 20% of your customers; 20% of your top people drive 80% of your revenue; 20% of your most productive time drives 80% of your productivity.
While this magic ratio applies in many cases, there's an important new kid on the block when it comes to outpunching the competition, meeting the challenges of the day and enjoying sustainable success: the 70/30 rule.
In today's complex and competitive climate, relying on established processes, previous knowledge and existing systems will only get you 70% of the way toward your potential. The plans you set at the beginning of the year, for example, will likely only yield 70% of your goal. Simply playing the music that's already written on the page may have worked in the past, but in our fast moving and fluid environment, previous approaches will only get you 70% of the way there.
Since most of us strive for better than a C-minus performance, how can we snag the remaining 30%? It comes from our ability to adapt in real time. Our willingness to defy traditions, seek fresh approaches, bounce back from missteps with imagination and reinvent as we go.
Creative problem solving.
Innovative approaches.
Inventive thinking.
These are the ingredients to fill the wildly coveted 30% gap. But unfortunately, many leaders have a blind spot and can't see the shortfall until it's too late.
Historically, we didn't need to fully develop our creative skills because existing models lasted longer. With business cycles flowing over decades, the need to improvise wasn't important. Which may lead us to discount the 70/30 rule, ignoring the urgent calling to cultivate inventive thinking. But in the new era of tech, disruption and change, we can no longer rely on the approaches of the past and expect the same results.
In the same way that interest compounds, the creativity gap will grow over time if not addressed. This has led to the downfall of many great organizations and will increasingly take a toll on both companies and careers. On the other hand, developing creative skills and mindsets will not only fill today's gap, but will compound in your favor for years to come.
We must act with urgency to inject inventive thinking into our daily work or we run the risk of restricting our full potential. Your past training, experiences, systems, and approaches may get you a minimally passing grade, but those alone will keep you far away from what's truly possible.
Your 70% may already be there. It's time to discover your missing 30.

Writers festival would benefit from diversity

Texto completo: The Rancho Mirage Writers Festival, which kicks off this month, touts itself as "America's best writers festival," an "intellectual village," and "Coachella for the brain," and, indeed, since 2014, the Festival has attracted a cast of profoundly successful writers to the Coachella Valley for three days of panels and talks.
The Festival is funded primarily from a coterie of local philanthropists and tickets, which go for $500, sell out almost immediately. By all accounts, the Festival is a gem, a worthy companion to the Palm Springs International Film Festival & ShortFest and Coachella ... save for a problem that has only become more glaring with each passing year: a shocking lack of diversity.
Since the Festival's inaugural outing it has featured nearly 300 guest authors and, in that time, has managed to bring in as participants just 19 Latinx, black, indigenous and Asian-American writers.
For a festival rooted in the Coachella Valley, whose permanent population is nearly 50% Hispanic or Latinx, that the Festival only managed to host three Latinx authors in its history is particularly maddening.
When you consider the Festival will now be streaming select events to the California State University-San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus student body, over 80% of whom are people of color with the vast majority Latinx, you'd think that the Festival's leadership might show some desire to expand the Latinx roster.
If the greatest power of literature is its ability to evince empathy, wouldn't it benefit the Rancho Mirage Writers Festival to have programming that more closely mirrors the community it represents, at least for a few hours, for a few days, so student writers might see a literary world that looks vaguely like their own?
It would be painfully easy to accomplish.
The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, the largest annual book festival in the country, manages to find nearly 200 authors of color every single year. Not one is paid to appear. The Sun Valley Writers' Conference in Idaho — which Rancho Mirage is clearly modeled after and which is roughly the same size — regularly has a wildly diverse line-up, in a city and state whose demographics couldn't be more different than our own.
Because choosing fewer than 20 writers of color in seven years isn't an oversight. It's a statement.
Particularly in 2020, when the Festival's focus is on the upcoming election cycle, one might think there'd be some desire to examine the immigrant experience in America, or, at a minimum, to hear from writers whose last four years have been spent waiting for the next boot to land on their neck. Hate crimes in the 10 largest American cities rose by 10% in 2019, an empathy gap that is incalculable and one that no panel discussion at a writers' festival will fix, but which needs to be talked about, chiefly by those able to give voice to those too afraid to speak.
And yet.
So what is an intellectual village minus the voices of those most at risk? It is an indictment of the very essence of literature.
We read to understand those people we might never meet. We read to better understand compassion, and also to learn how to fear its demise. Because to experience another human's logic is to experience the universe, writ tiny, one letter at a time.
We come to view festivals such as this one — which is supported by the city via use of its library and the time city staffers dedicate to it — almost as a public trust.
In truth, they are private affairs, as exclusive as they choose to be.
And yet, if the Rancho Mirage Writers Festival truly aims to be "Coachella for the brain" its organizers will take a page from Goldenvoice (which faced similar issues early on) and begin recruiting artists who reflect the culture, throwing open the doors to diversity and welcoming voices that challenge the status quo.
Only then will it find its place as one the best writers' festivals in the country, not merely in name, but in action.

Texto completo: As the first week of Harvey Weinstein's sex crimes trial comes to a close, many people are talking about sexual assault and the #MeToo movement.
The #MeToo movement is a very important one that is long overdue for far too many people who have suffered from sexual assault and sexual harassment. No reasonable person would dispute that those who have committed such acts must be held accountable.
But what is also becoming increasingly concerning to many is the ease with which some activists seem to dismiss the due process rights of those accused of wrongdoing. There are those who appear to believe (wrongly) that affording people accused of wrongdoing our bedrock constitutional due process rights must somehow be mutually exclusive of the #MeToo movement itself.
Take, for example, the opinion of Teen Vogue writer and #MeToo movement supporter Emily Linden. Linden wrote the following on Twitter in November 2017, just as the #MeToo movement was beginning to popularize:
"I'm actually not at all concerned about innocent men losing their jobs over false sexual assault/harassment allegations. ... Sorry. If some innocent men's reputations have to take a hit in the process of undoing the patriarchy, that is a price I am absolutely willing to pay."
It appears that more than 2,600 people "liked" Linden's Tweet by clicking the heart button in response.
In 2019, Harvard student activists demonstrated against Harvard law professor Ronald Sullivan, not because Sullivan himself was accused of sexual assault (he wasn't), but rather, because Sullivan was then one of the defense attorneys for Harvey Weinstein. Student activists carried signs that read things like, "Remove Sullivan," "#MeToo" and "Down W Sullivan!" all because Sullivan dared to represent Weinstein as an attorney.
According to the New York Times, a student named Danu Mudannayake, who supported the removal of Sullivan, wrote, "Do you really want to one day accept your diploma from someone who for whatever reason, professional or personal, believes it is O.K. to defend such a prominent figure at the center of the #MeToo movement?"
It is hard to believe that any person in this country would embrace or accept destroying the life of a falsely accused man or deny constitutional rights to accused people before they have ever had their day in court.
We know that sometimes, even if it is a small minority of the time, people falsely accuse others of crimes — including sexual assault and harassment.
Based on the few studies that have been conducted on the issue, the national Innocence Project estimates that between 2.3% and 5% of all prisoners in the United States are innocent. In other words, up to 120,000 people are estimated to be sitting behind bars for crimes they did not commit. In the United States, a country that imprisons far more people than any other nation on Earth, this should cause grave concerns.
Even some of the so-called "forensic science" used to convict many people for decades has been deemed unreliable by a report commissioned by Congress in 2009 of the National Academy of Sciences.
Linden's infamous Tweet even acknowledged that some innocent men will suffer from false accusations as part of the #MeToo movement — but Linden does not care about destroying the lives of those innocent men because, as she wrote, they have to "take a hit in the process of undoing the patriarchy."
John Adams, one of the founders of our country, once famously said: "It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever."
We have much to be proud of in terms of our criminal justice system. Unlike in the United States, many totalitarian regimes reject the presumption of innocence and due process. Our jury system is a proud tradition that demonstrates the Founders' innate trust in a jury of one's peers to render judgment.
So while people like Linden say they do not care if innocent men suffer in the wake of the #MeToo movement, those who truly support the worthy ideals of the movement and who are concerned about true justice should care. People are rightfully horrified and enraged at the thought of an innocent person — man or woman — whose life is unjustly destroyed over a false accusation.

New York builder's unprecedented present to Palm Springs was Canyon Country Club

Texto completo: The New York Times in September 1951 reported, "After more than thirty years as a custom builder, Boris Gertzen is turning to the lower-priced home to sell for $29,750 to $48,500. The builder, who has been erecting dwellings in the $100,000- price range, said he was induced to change his policy of building because technological advances made possible the inclusion of custom standards in production-built homes. Mr. Gertzen has started work on a community of forty ranch residences in Old Hewlett, Long Island and plans to make deliveries between six to ten weeks from the date of signing the contract. Two finished dwellings are being opened for inspection today. The new homes will contain six, seven and nine rooms, two and three tiled baths, full cellars and expansion space."
Russian-born New York master builder Boris Gertzen had extensive experience in the 1950s developing tony neighborhoods on Long Island including the Whispering Woods tract, some 700 acres of the previous Griffing Estate on Gardiner Bay. He had building down to an efficient science, delivering houses within "six to ten weeks from the date of signing the contract."
Intending to retire, he relocated to Palm Springs making a splash when he completed the Canyon Country Club in December 1961.
The centerpiece clubhouse was described as one of the finest in the country, it's 40,000 square feet costing $1 million and having been completed in an astonishing 73 days. Designed by the local architectural firm of Wexler & Harrison, the clubhouse quickly became a local favorite.
After building the clubhouse, Gertzen embarked on the construction of Canyon Country Club Villas, marketing them with newspaper ads that screamed,
"WANT The Best? See Canyon Club Villas, Designed & Built by Nationally famed Boris Gertzen. Situated on the beautiful Fairways of Canyon Country Club, the Prestige Location. Offering a choice of Elegant Custom Built Villas —Decorator Furnished or unfurnished — featuring 3 bedrooms, 3 bath, complete with cabana, pool and landscaping, From $55,000.00. Model Open Daily."
By desert and second-home standards, these were large, luxury, custom homes sited along the club's golf course fairways. Described in advertisements as "Palm Springs' most elegant homes," the residences afforded striking views of the surrounding mountains and conjured up the swanky midcentury space-age lifestyle. (The homes along South Alhambra Drive, where the model home for Canyon Club Villas was located, were built in the early 1960s during the heyday of concrete screen block and featured unusually beautiful patterns.)
Gertzen's development was certainly ambitious and not seemingly consistent with retirement. Aerial images of the grading reveal just how expansive his plans were. Partnering with Charles Dwight Construction Corp., and First National Realty and Construction, Gertzen hired Jack Quigley as vice president in charge of operations for the joint venture.
In addition to the large subdivision of homes, he envisioned a very fancy hotel. Described in marketing brochures as "Palm Springs' only hotel with its own 18-hole championship golf course. In addition to the excellent golfing facilities, Canyon Club Inn offers luxurious accommodations, of with oversize beds, outstanding cuisine, swimming and therapeutic pools, complete health spa and solarium, tennis and horseback riding. The answer to a complete and perfect vacation."
Designed by K.M. Burgess of Los Angeles, the Canyon Club Inn was under construction in late 1964 and cost some $4 million. Situated on 71/2 acres between the South and North golf courses, at the corner of Murray Canyon Road and Palm Canyon Drive, it also commanded unrivaled views. With his characteristically ultra-speedy construction schedule, Gertzen slated it to open in early 1965.
The architecture was described at the time as "three-story, hi-style, Mediterranean modern," whatever that meant. The footprint was U-shaped surrounding a pool and patio, and the Cabana Club. Rooms featured private sun decks. "Dotting the periphery of the lobby will be smart shops, such as hi-fashion sport togs, complete golf pro shop, barber and beauty salons, gift-sundries, plus a coffee shop."
The hotel did indeed open in 1965 and offered 201 lavish rooms connected to the golf course. But it hadn't been easy. The 440-acre development required a contract between the First National Realty and Construction Corporation and no less than 20 individual Indian lessors. All parts of the very complicated 70-year leases, the largest of their kind in the nation to date, had to be approved by the Riverside County Superior Court, the Bureau of Indian Affairs California Office in Sacramento and in Washington D.C. by the Secretary of the Interior.
The expansive breadth and unprecedented complexity of his project may have contributed to Gertzen's untimely death in 1966.
The Canyon Club Inn, later renamed The Canyon Hotel, was very glamorous, attracting movie stars and socialites. The golf courses became the site of The Frank Sinatra and Chuck Connors Golf Tournaments.
Charity functions were regular occurrences and businessmen flocked to conventions where they could play on the golf courses.
Throughout the 1970s it defined desert chic. Changing ownership in the following decades and the economic downturn of the desert in the 1980s and '90s led to its demise, and the termination of its lease.
Eventually the building was razed.
The Gertzen-built homes are prized today for their style and surrounding open space.
The clubhouse of the Canyon Country Club persists despite numerous threats to its existence through the last few decades.
This aerial view of Canyon Country Club shows the extent of the huge project.

2020 likely to see lots of hindsight

Texto completo: They say "hindsight is 2020." We're likely to see a lot of "hindsight" in 2020. John Durham, U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, has been investigating the origin of the Russian collusion claim executed by former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey, and former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok along with other high ranking officials inside the Obama administration.
In late July 2016, Brennan sent an "electronic communication" to Comey that essentially began "Operation Crossfire Hurricane," in which Brennan named four Trump campaign members as targets: George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and Michael Flynn. Afterward Strzok officially opened the investigation with his signature on July 31.
News stories began popping up in respected organizations. The New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN routinely cited anonymous sources sometimes labeled "current and former American Officials" to buttress their stories about Trump and campaign aids having repeated contact with Russian intelligence officers. These stories were not true.
Even after Trump was inaugurated, the Associated Press reported March 21, 2017, "Before signing up with Donald Trump, former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly worked for a Russian billionaire with a plan to 'greatly benefit the Putin Government.'" This story was not true. Unfortunately, many news organizations reported stories like these.
For more than two years, Americans were subjected to daily attacks on President Trump with "proof" at last of collusion and corruption. Finally, Special Counsel Robert Mueller completed his investigation and sent it to Attorney General William Barr. All the president's enemies waited breathlessly for a couple of weeks before Barr released the lightly redacted final report to Congress and the public.
Contrary to all the predictions, proofs and prognostications of the best minds on the Left in the media, politics and government, Mueller's team had found no collusion between Trump and the Russians. Finding no evidence of collusion raised two glaring questions: What evidence did Brennan, Comey, and Strzok have to begin the investigation? Why did they begin the investigation with no credible evidence?
After Mueller's report came out, ABC, CBS, and NBC increased news coverage on all things impeachment. Media Research Center senior editor, Rich Noyes wrote, "Despite the Mueller report's lack of an anti-Trump smoking gun, the broadcast networks actually became more invested in the Russia story. TV news viewers heard three times as many references to 'impeachment' compared to before Mueller concluded there was no campaign conspiracy with Russia...."
Impeachment has been a foregone conclusion of the Left since November 9, 2016. When Mueller's investigation fizzled, Democrats, some in the media and the political establishment began searching frantically for anything impeachable. Why this irrational obsession with impeaching President Trump? Plausibly, the Left believes they cannot defeat him in this year's election. Maybe there are other reasons than believing the electorate will re-elect President Trump.
U.S. Attorney John Durham may deliver evidence of criminal activity in the highest echelons of the Obama administration to the Department of Justice some time this year. Have forces inside the government been colluding to remove Trump from office? Could this collusion be treason? What is the penalty for treason? Is it true what the Democrats and some in the media have self-righteously pronounced that no one is above the law?

The Iran hostage crisis and the great escape

Texto completo: Robert Anders was used to hearing protesters chant "Death to America" when he showed up for work each morning, but this morning seemed different, the din louder, the mood darker, the tension a precursor to an escape so valiant it is now immortalized in both history and Hollywood
It was Nov. 4, 1979, when a group of Iranian militants scaled a wall at the U.S. embassy in Tehran, setting off a hostage crisis that would define a presidency and disillusion a country. Anders, however, was one of 12 Americans working in the compound who managed to slip out the back door during the chaos and evade apprehension, if not something worse.
Once they reached the rainy street the 12 Americans split into groups of six. One group went north and was captured at gunpoint. Anders' group headed west, and eventually made it undetected to the home of a Canadian diplomat, where they ate well, played bridge and worried for weeks they would be found and executed.
Meanwhile, as their whereabouts were known only to a few U.S. officials, the Iranians had taken 52 U.S. diplomats and citizens hostage, a crisis that lasted 444 days.
A CIA agent named Tony Mendez devised a plan for the six Americans to escape Iran and it was as risky as ingenious. He invented a fake movie company called Studio Six — named for the six escapees — that claimed it was looking for a place to shoot a sci-fi film, something like "Star Wars," and Iran was among the contenders. The six Americans would be passed off as
Canadians working in the company, according to the plan.
No detail was overlooked. They were given fake names and titles — Anders, for one, became Robert L. Baker, location manager — and Canadian passports were forged for them. They had phony business cards. Anders remembers being given a dry cleaning receipt from Ottawa for his pocket in case anyone frisked him.
The phony movie was called "Argo" — named after the vessel Jason used on his journey across the world to retrieve the Golden Fleece — and the CIA rented an office in Hollywood as a front.
They even had people answering the phone if anyone ever called the phony numbers that were printed on the phony business cards.
The fake passports were sent to the Canadian embassy in Iran, and Mendez soon arrived to coach them up and bring them home. They even dressed the part. Anders, 54 at the time, wore a shirt two sizes too small, buttoned it only halfway up to expose a silver medallion and combed his hair down to look like a Hollywood director in the '70s.
They were to fly to Switzerland aboard Swissair, but there was a measure of fear in the airport when it was announced the plane had encountered mechanical problems. When the flight was cleared to take off, Anders remembers walking up the ramp and looking at the name on the plane's nose. It was the name of an area in Switzerland called Aargau.
Anders nudged Mendez's shoulder and said, "You guys think of everything, don't you?" If anything it was an omen, and after three months on the run they boarded flight 363 to Switzerland on Jan. 28, 1980. There was an open bar on the plane, of course.
Only a few people in America knew of the escapees, and the original plan was for them to come to a military base in Florida to hide, Anders said. No one wanted to take the chance of the escapees being discovered with the hostages still in Iran. The plan was aborted because the Canadian press was catching on to the story, and because the escapees did not want to worry their families any longer. Anders' 90-year-old mother still thought he was a hostage.
After visiting president Carter in the White House, Anders returned to Port Charlotte, where he lived at the time. His in-laws were residents of Punta Gorda. Anders, in an interview with the New York Times from Port Charlotte, gave one of the original first-hand accounts of the ordeal, but left many details out, including the CIA's involvement, and soon the story faded away.
It wasn't until 2007 — the 50th anniversary of the CIA — when the full extent of the agency's involvement was revealed and the story was of interest again. Eventually, it became a movie called "Argo," winner of the Academy Award for best picture in 2013. Mendez — who died in 2019 — was played by Ben Affleck; Anders by Tate Donovan.
Anders is 94 years old now, and lives in a retirement community in Maryland. He said he is a "hard-core Republican" who is not enamored with President Trump because he "hijacked the party."
He said the assassination of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani was a grave error. "I think it was a big mistake to wipe this guy out."
He occasionally speaks at a retired diplomats club and to retired CIA agents, whom he came to respect a great deal for the role they played in his escape.
And every so often, when the ordeal comes up, Anders tells the story of how he was among a group of Americans who fled Tehran beneath the nose of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. For proof he will open his wallet and pull out the business card he has kept for 40 years.

Texto completo: Gabriel Matzneff is not a good man, but it's taken France a long time to realize it.
The New York Times' Norimitsu Onishi reported an astonishing story last week. It begins:

The French writer Gabriel Matzneff never hid the fact that he engaged in sex with girls and boys in their early teens or even younger. He wrote countless books detailing his insatiable pursuits and appeared on television boasting about them. 'Under 16 Years Old' was the title of an early book that left no ambiguity.

Matzneff, now 83, spent decades as a French literary darling. His work was supported by leading newspapers and literary publications. He'd appear on highbrow TV shows where he'd regale interviewers and audiences about the sublime pleasures of having sex with children in France and on sex tours of southeast Asia.
His overdue comeuppance is the result of a memoir by Vanessa Springora, who was victimized by a Matzneff, then in his fifties, when she was 14.
"He was not a good man," Springora writes. "He was in fact what we're taught to dread since childhood: an ogre."
In "Under 16 Years Old," Matzneff writes, "To sleep with a child, it's a holy experience, a baptismal event, a sacred adventure." The book was first published in 1974 but was republished, apparently with no controversy in 2005. In 2013, Matzneff received a major French literary prize.
How could a country that prides itself on being enlightened celebrate an ogre? After all, we're not talking about a Jeffrey Epstein, as horrible as he was. The well-connected billionaire spent vast sums to keep his sexual abuses at least somewhat secret. Matzneff not only confessed to his crimes, his confessions were celebrated as literary contributions.
The answer stems in part from the fact that Matzneff was a "Child of '68" - i.e., a product of the left-wing "May 68" movement that shook France in the 1960s. These radicals subscribed to the idea that anything smacking of traditionalism or bourgeois morality was backward. Conventional sexual morality was part of the same rotten edifice as imperialism and racism. True liberation meant not just freedom from, say, capitalism, but also from the old-fashioned view that sex with kids was wrong.
Some argued, Onishi writes, "for abolishing age-of-consent laws, saying that doing so would liberate children from the domination of their parents and allow them to be full, sexual beings."
A few years ago, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the famous former radical and leader of the European Green movement, got in hot water for his earlier writings and statements about "erotic" encounters with 5-year-olds. He dodged major consequences by disavowing his own words, saying they were merely intended to provoke.
Matzneff can't make such claims. His whole identity was invested in the seduction of children and teenagers.
Sociologist Pierre Verdrager, the author of "L'Enfant Interdit," or "Forbidden Child," which chronicled the politics of pedophilia in 1970s France, told Onishi: "There was an aristocracy of sexuality, an elite that was united in putting forth new attitudes and behavior toward sex. And they were also grounded in an extreme prejudice toward ordinary people, whom they regarded as idiots and fools."
America, so backwardly bourgeois in the eyes of these aristocrats, doesn't have France's problems, but it is hardly immune to such dynamics. Director Roman Polanski, who fled America rather than face sentencing for statutory rape, is defended by Hollywood royalty because of a similar aristocratic attitude.
There's a reason Ricky Gervais struck a chord at the Golden Globes last Sunday when he told the assembled Hollywood royalty to get over themselves.
"If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech," Gervais said. "You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg."
This should be a cautionary tale for all cultural aristocrats. Not all radical fads hold up well over time. Perhaps in 50 years, a memoir from someone who as a child was subjected to hormone blockers to change his or her gender will provoke similar retroactive outrage.

Supporting innocence and the #MeToo movement are not mutually exclusive

Texto completo: As the first week of Harvey Weinstein's sex crimes trial comes to a close, many people are talking about sexual assault and the #MeToo movement.
The #MeToo movement is a very important one that is long overdue for far too many people who have suffered from sexual assault and sexual harassment. No reasonable person would dispute that those who have committed such acts must be held accountable.
But what is also becoming increasingly concerning to many is the ease with which some activists seem to dismiss the due process rights of those accused of wrongdoing. There are those who appear to believe (wrongly) that affording people accused of wrongdoing our bedrock constitutional due process rights must somehow be mutually exclusive of the #MeToo movement itself.
Take, for example, the opinion of Teen Vogue writer and #MeToo movement supporter Emily Linden. Linden wrote the following on Twitter in November 2017, just as the #MeToo movement was beginning to popularize:
"I'm actually not at all concerned about innocent men losing their jobs over false sexual assault/harassment allegations. ... Sorry. If some innocent men's reputations have to take a hit in the process of undoing the patriarchy, that is a price I am absolutely willing to pay."
It appears that more than 2,600 people "liked" Linden's Tweet by clicking the heart button in response.
In 2019, Harvard student activists demonstrated against Harvard law professor Ronald Sullivan, not because Sullivan himself was accused of sexual assault (he wasn't), but rather, because Sullivan was then one of the defense attorneys for Harvey Weinstein. Student activists carried signs that read things like, "Remove Sullivan," "#MeToo" and "Down W Sullivan!" all because Sullivan dared to represent Weinstein as an attorney.
According to the New York Times, a student named Danu Mudannayake, who supported the removal of Sullivan, wrote, "Do you really want to one day accept your diploma from someone who for whatever reason, professional or personal, believes it is O.K. to defend such a prominent figure at the center of the #MeToo movement?"
It is hard to believe that any person in this country would embrace or accept destroying the life of a falsely accused man or deny constitutional rights to accused people before they have ever had their day in court.
We know that sometimes, even if it is a small minority of the time, people falsely accuse others of crimes — including sexual assault and harassment.
Based on the few studies that have been conducted on the issue, the national Innocence Project estimates that between 2.3% and 5% of all prisoners in the United States are innocent. In other words, up to 120,000 people are estimated to be sitting behind bars for crimes they did not commit. In the United States, a country that imprisons far more people than any other nation on Earth, this should cause grave concerns.
Even some of the so-called "forensic science" used to convict many people for decades has been deemed unreliable by a report commissioned by Congress in 2009 of the National Academy of Sciences.
Linden's infamous Tweet even acknowledged that some innocent men will suffer from false accusations as part of the #MeToo movement — but Linden does not care about destroying the lives of those innocent men because, as she wrote, they have to "take a hit in the process of undoing the patriarchy."
John Adams, one of the founders of our country, once famously said: "It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever."
We have much to be proud of in terms of our criminal justice system. Unlike in the United States, many totalitarian regimes reject the presumption of innocence and due process. Our jury system is a proud tradition that demonstrates the Founders' innate trust in a jury of one's peers to render judgment.
So while people like Linden say they do not care if innocent men suffer in the wake of the #MeToo movement, those who truly support the worthy ideals of the movement and who are concerned about true justice should care. People are rightfully horrified and enraged at the thought of an innocent person — man or woman — whose life is unjustly destroyed over a false accusation.

Why Golden State 'booms' are a bust for so many

Texto completo: Californians, being tougher than we look, have found ways to survive our economic busts.
It's the booms that really break us.
This essential truth is now being missed. Today, politicians and media alike juxtapose the hallmarks of California's current boom with our deep problems — as if they represented a paradox. How can a place be so wealthy and progressive, they ask, and yet so poor and ungenerous at the same time?
"California Is Booming," the New York Times asked recently, "Why Are So Many Californians Unhappy?"
The answer to that question lies in the question itself: So many of us are unhappy precisely because California is booming.
This is no paradox, because our successes and our problems are intertwined. California's tendency to turn everything — from housing to health — into an investment, full of speculation — has made everything, even our booms, volatile and risky.
The signature effect of the now-concluding decade of boom is, of course, homelessness. When the economy grows here, so does homelessness.
Why? In this decade, our boom in jobs and income among the wealthy and middle class created more housing demand. But we couldn't produce enough housing to keep up with demands. Housing prices soared. And as people moved into cheaper neighborhoods and paid higher rents, they effectively forced out poorer longtime residents, some of whom ended up on the streets.
Booms exacerbate California's already significant income gap. Rising wages have been good for our most successful, high-income workers, but they also fuel cost of living increases for middle class and poor families, whose gains have not kept up. These higher costs are why California ranks at or near the top on national poverty measures, and why the state has seen an exodus of middle- and low-income people.
When this state really soars, it feels like it's flying away.
California booms are dangerous in other ways, too.
Our state has made its costliest policy mistakes during good times, often to help people deal with skyrocketing growth. Most famously, as housing prices surged in the late 1970s, voters eager to cut soaring property taxes approved Proposition 13, without considering how the ballot initiative might make it harder to govern California.
That is hardly the only example.
Our local governments now face fiscal peril because of the unsustainably high boosts of public employee pensions approved during the late 1990s tech boom. And today's investor-owned utility crisis, which is literally sparking fires across the state, is rooted in poorly conceived deregulation during that same '90s boom.
When the booms are this tough, it's not hard to find Californians who remember our busts fondly. Downturns create moments when things are cheap enough to take a risk, start a business and snap up a piece of the California dream.
I'm here writing this column because of a bust: The Great Recession. The 2008 collapse, which led to a decline in housing prices, made it possible for me to take a chance on a lower-paying nonprofit media job. Then, in 2011, when prices were still depressed, I bought a small San Gabriel Valley home that would have been unaffordable before that economic collapse — and that I couldn't dream of affording today.
Governments also tend to treat citizens better during busts.
The state was far more generous with subsidies and tax breaks for businesses during the Great Recession; today it is busy imposing more regulations and costs.
That recession also saw the federal government take big steps that assisted Californians, via the economic stimulus legislation and Obamacare. But, today, during the boom, our state and its people find themselves under attack from the same federal government — precisely because our boom and its successes are seen as a threatening counter-example to the president's reactionary policies.
The other bad news about California good times is that future booms are likely to be even tougher.
Over the years, all of our booms have changed our character as a state. Once, we were a place of arrival, a destination for new immigrants and the young and ambitious. Back in those days, our busts allowed for surges of new residents. But now, the cost of entry for newcomers has become prohibitively high. That means we are less a state of immigrants and more a state of longtime Californians struggling to hold on.
Perhaps our state and its governments should stop encouraging booms — our de facto policy for decades — and instead pursue more policies that reduce our natural volatility. But that will require us to think of California as a place where we want to spend our lives, rather than a stock exchange of bungalows and beaches.
So happy new year, and good luck finding shelter from the boom.

Pot's illnesses, deaths get too little press

Texto completo: Former New York Times business reporter Alex Berenson says that the human cost of cannabis is too high — and that the press is too pro-pot. When his latest book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence," came out early last year, Berenson knew marijuana proponents wouldn't like it. He just didn't think there would be what he calls a "media brownout." No major publications reviewed it.
I've covered things that injure, sicken and kill kids and adults for more than 30 years. From auto safety to medical errors, I've competed to break stories on the latest deadly defect or health policy change, most recently on electronic cigarettes.
In late August, I added vaping-related lung illnesses to the beat. Last month, I added marijuana, psychosis and other mental illness.
It's a pretty solitary place to be.
We reporters covered the heck out of vaping lung illnesses starting in August. Once it became clear the culprit was THC and not nicotine, however, the news media seemed to lose interest, said former Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb at a breakfast event I attended in early November.
Indeed, a search on the news archive Nexis shows that the number of stories mentioning "vaping" and "lung illness" went from 953 in September to 584 in the first 30 days of October, a nearly 40% drop.
The deaths and injuries from lung illnesses are declining, but they've hardly abated and are clearly a sign of a much larger problem with excessive marijuana use among young people. Yet families from the D'Ambrosios in California to the Donats in Connecticut were caught unaware.
Families caught by the consequences Ricky D'Ambrosio, 21, was in a medically induced coma for four of the 10 days he was hospitalized in late August after vaping THC he bought from a dispensary. He had a medical marijuana card.
D'Ambrosio's recovering well now, but my Connecticut high school friend Billy Donat's family wasn't so lucky.
On Dec. 29, Donat emailed me for the first time ever. It read:
"Sometimes we reach out to old friends at the worst of times, this is one of those times. On Christmas Day, my son of 22 years put an electric cord around his neck and hung himself one day after his release from Yale Psychiatric Hospital. On the table in the living room was a copy (of) USA Today dated 12/16/2019. I told my son that you had written an article about his condition linking pot to psychosis. SCHIZOPHRENIA. I had read the front page at the news stand. I wish I had turned to page 6 and finished the article."
If he had, he would have seen that the federal "mental health czar" and psychiatrist, Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, lamenting how little attention the "settled science" on pot and psychosis gets and the huge increase in suicides among young people with marijuana in their systems in Colorado.
On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 2,561 people have been hospitalized with vaping-related lung illness and 55 have died. That's one more death and over 50 more hospitalizations from two weeks earlier.
CDC says 80% of hospitalized patients who had complete information about their products reported vaping THC; 13% said they vaped just nicotine.
Most everyone I talk to — even some doctors — say nicotine vaping and Juul, especially, is what's clogging kids' lungs. If it is, it hasn't been identified by any of the many state or federal scientists who have reported on their findings. They have only been able to find vitamin E acetate from THC oil in patients' lungs.
There has been an outcry to ban flavored electronic cigarettes — or all of them, as in San Francisco — and Congress voted to raise the age for all e-cigarette tobacco products to 21 last month. The Trump administration announced plans Thursday to restrict most flavors of the one-time-use pods in e-cigarettes.
But what about when the industry isn't an easily identified and demonized monolith like Big Tobacco or ... Juul? What if the purported problem is something advocates have been trying to get mandated or legalized for years?
That sounds a lot like air bags to me — and the kind of resistance my former colleague Jim Healey and I faced in 1996 when we wrote that air bags had killed about two dozen kids and that regulators weren't telling the public. Our stories led to warning labels and smart air bags now in every new car.
Air bags were saving adults' lives! There's always a trade-off, isn't there?
Press lets pot's bad news slip by Former New York Times business reporter Alex Berenson says that the human cost of cannabis is too high — and that the press is too pro-pot. When his latest book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence," came out early last year, Berenson knew marijuana proponents wouldn't like it. He just didn't think there would be what he calls a "media brownout." No major publications reviewed it.
Reporters from major U.S. newspaper companies never contacted him for stories, although those in eight other countries — including Japan, Italy and Australia — did. (USA TODAY interviewed him for a March article.) Public radio and a suburban New York school system canceled appearances.
Berenson, a registered independent who didn't have strong feelings about marijuana legalization until he researched his book, has become an unlikely favorite of the conservative media and think tanks. He blames what he says is "a genuine misunderstanding of the strength of the science supporting the cannabis-psychosis link," which is worsened by "the endless industry/advocacy yelling about 'Reefer Madness.' "
"Reefer Madness" was a 1936 movie that used crazed marijuana users to show the purported risks of the drug.
"The cannabis lobby ... will personally attack anyone who tries to raise the issue," Berenson says.
His "not so secret weapon," however, is that "I no longer care what anyone says about me," he says. "I know what the facts are, and I'm going to repeat them until someone pays attention."
Last month, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported new data showing marijuana use by students from eighth to 12th grade was way up — with 1 in 5 high school seniors vaping it in the past year.
The recent story I wrote with colleagues on marijuana's link to mental health ran on the front page of USA TODAY and was one of the top stories on our website for days. More than 250 people with children or personal experience with mental illness linked to marijuana joined our Facebook support group — I Survived It.
I don't know about you, but that makes me pay attention.

Texto completo: More than once, this space has said Mitch McConnell would face a day of reckoning in his relationship with Donald Trump – a moment when the Senate majority leader would have to decide to maintain fealty to the president of his party or would say, at least to himself, that "enough is enough" when it comes to Trump's use of the presidency to serve his personal interests.
We thought the day might come with the Mueller Report about Russian interference in the 2016 election, but Trump and Attorney General William Barr turned that into a media muddle. Then, Trump was revealed to have held Congress-passed military aid hostage for a public statement by Ukraine that it was investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son and a Russia-created tale that the election interference came from Ukraine.
The day of reckoning came Sept. 25, when the White House released a rough transcript of Trump's July 25 "favor, though" call with Ukraine's president. McConnell, who reportedly urged Trump to make the release, said it was "laughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense" because there was no quid pro quo in the text.
Testimony before the House Intelligence Committee (and recent reporting by The New York Times) showed that such a "drug deal" with Ukraine, as Trump national security adviser John Bolton reportedly called it, was clearly Trump's intent until Sept. 11, when he released the aid – two days after the committee announced it was investigating the matter, and the day after Bolton resigned or was fired.
However, the investigation that produced two articles of impeachment was incomplete and short of first-hand evidence because Trump and most of his lieutenants refused to cooperate with it, and the Democrats who control the House decided not to go to court to force testimony and production of records – which would have taken months, putting impeachment into a presidential election year. (They did pass an article accusing Trump of obstructing Congress, in addition to the one alleging abuse of power with Ukraine.)
Democrats want the Senate to call witnesses with more direct knowledge, and Bolton now says he would testify under subpoena. Even if four Republican senators bolted and voted with Democrats to make a majority for hearing from Bolton and others, Trump could claim executive privilege and tie things up in court.
Bolton probably knows McConnell and other Republican senators don't want to hear from him or anyone else. McConnell says he has the votes to impose the impeachment trial procedure he wants: presentations by each side, written questions from senators, and then votes on witnesses, subpoenas, dismissal or whatever.
Senate Republicans say they shouldn't have to do the work that the House should have done, but that argument is a facile one, simply fulfilling Trump's stonewalling strategy. Stonewalling shouldn't be rewarded. The public deserves to hear testimony under oath from Bolton, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney (who first acknowledged a quid pro quo, then tried to walk it back) and others, including Trump himself.
Fat chance. Trump tweeted about wanting witnesses, but McConnell's counter-counsel apparently prevailed. As for his judgment of the outcome, the senator said, "I'm not an impartial juror."
McConnell says impeachment is a political process, not a judicial one, but that is not entirely true. The Constitution treats the Senate proceeding as a trial, gives the chief justice the gavel, and requires senators to take a separate oath, which a Senate rule requires them to swear "I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws, so help me God."
Nevertheless, politics will rule. Trump's impeachment is the first of a president running for re-election, and he is highly popular among Republicans (especially in Kentucky, where McConnell is on the ballot), so those in Congress fear him. McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are both running political campaigns – he to discredit her process and she to discredit his, by delaying delivery of the impeachment articles.
All this is bigger than McConnell, Pelosi, Trump or this year's elections. It's about who we are as a country, the rule of law, the health of our democracy and our sovereignty. In the end, it comes back to Russia – our foe and Ukraine's.
Last July, Gen. John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff, spoke at the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce's Business Summit and Annual Meeting. During the question-and-answer session, without being asked about the Muller Report, Kelly said that he was one of the few Americans who had read it "cover to cover," and that it showed how Russians "attacked our way of governing ourselves, the most precious thing we have," next to God.
Then came the point to remember: "They made a decision about who they wanted to be president, and they were very good at what they did." Later, Kelly urged the audience to read the report to see how Russians "got into our social media network" to hurt Hillary Clinton or help Trump.
McConnell has said Russia interfered in the election and should be punished for it. But Trump is super-sensitive to charges Russia got him elected, so McConnell has avoided saying anything like Kelly did. Doing that would forever change the McConnell-Trump relationship, which is keeping the Republican Party together. Additional witnesses and documents at a Senate trial could hurt Trump, and thus the narrow GOP Senate majority that makes McConnell the second most powerful person in Washington. Sometimes he seems to be the most powerful, given Trump's desultory approach to governing.
McConnell's day of reckoning has come and gone, and he's sticking with Trump. The senator likes to say that he never wanted to be president, but he has become part and parcel of a presidency like none other.

Texto completo: COCODRIE, La. - A marine laboratory 85 miles southwest of New Orleans was designed to be a fortress against extreme weather. But it might be defeated by climate change.
Sitting at the end of Louisiana State Highway 56, where dirt dissolves into wetlands and then the Gulf of Mexico, the laboratory, the W.J. DeFelice Marine Center, has successfully weathered many hurricanes since it opened its doors in 1986. It stands 18 feet above the ground on pillars with pilings that extend more than 100 feet underground. Its walls can withstand winds of up to 250 mph.
But the water is coming. Around the country, from New Jersey to Massachusetts, Virginia to Oregon, education centers and marine laboratories like this one are bracing against rising seas and a changing climate. The assault from climate change is slower but more relentless than any storm, and will ultimately do more damage. It threatens researchers' ability to study marine environments up close at a time when it's more vital than ever to understand them.
Bob Cowen, head of the National Association of Marine Laboratories, sees climate change as a challenge, but also a scientific opportunity. "We're feeling it, and we're also studying it at the same time as best we can," he said. If labs like this one have to shut down, decades of on-site measurements could be disrupted - and, researchers say, academic budgets might not allow replacements to be built, or built on a comparable scale.
The parking lot at the DeFelice Marine Center, the heart of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium of some two dozen institutions, was once high and dry. It now floods several dozen times a year, occasionally causing the facility to close because of the difficulty of getting across the lot and into the building. Officials predict that, without action, the lab might need to shut down several dozen days each year within the next 10 to 15 years. The corrosive saltwater attacks the structure and has risen up through the soil into buried electrical cables, at one point causing a blackout. Some floods are accompanied by droves of fiddler crabs that sometimes find their way into the elevators.
"They smell," said Murt Conover, the associate director of education and outreach. "I've heard it described as carnage. Rotting carnage."
"It was built to be on the edge of the world," said Ursula Emery McClure, senior project designer with the architecture firm Perkins & Will and a longtime architectural researcher at the marine center, but "it wasn't meant to be in open water."
Alex Kolker, an associate professor at the marine consortium who is currently studying sea level rise in Morocco, said that because south Louisiana's land is subsiding while the oceans are rising, the region has what may be the highest relative sea level rise in the country. "We're just 10 to 30 years in front of the curve of everybody else," he said.
Fox Island Environmental Education Center, a Virginia institution that has opened up the wonders of the natural world to young people for more than 40 years, shut down in November. Between erosion and sea level rise, so much of the island's salt marsh had disappeared that "it made it unsafe to run the program," said Tom Ackerman, vice president for education at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which owns the island center.
And what is lost is not just a building and its bunks, but inspiration: A number of the young people who stayed on Fox Island and gained a love of nature and the environment have gone on to be scientists. One, Kenneth M. Halanych, a professor of biological sciences at Auburn University in Alabama, now researches topics including climate change and shifts in the ranges of marine organisms. "If I hadn't had those formative experiences in the Bay, I might have ended up doing something totally different," he said.
Many marine labs are preparing to meet similar challenges, though they are in locations that are not yet facing the level of threat that Louisiana is.
At the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, Robert S.C. Munier, the vice president for marine facilities and operations, said that the facility was feeling the effects of climate change already in a battering of the existing dock. The institution is planning an $80 million-renovation of its waterfront with higher docks and an adjacent buildings complex. "It's part of our DNA, getting access to the sea," he said. But the planning is tricky, he said: Projections of sea level rise suggest that it could be 2.5 feet in the next 50 years, or as much as 4 feet. "Which one do you pick? Those are pretty fundamental questions."
In New Jersey, the Rutgers University Marine Field Station has put climate change into its 30-year plan as "a long-term experiment to learn how infrastructure and people will react to the rising sea, and how the rising sea will interact with human development," said Oscar Schofield, acting director of the field station and chairman of the Rutgers Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences. Already, he said, sea level rise and subsidence leave the road to the station frequently flooded at high tides.
At the Louisiana center, Conover sees educational value in their problems. Along with its mission as a scientific research facility, it is also a center for environmental education with visits from some 5,000 students each year. "If our parking lot is flooding when a group is here, we definitely talk about why we're flooding on that given day, when five years ago we wouldn't, given the same conditions." That example, she said, "gives the perspective of what our coastal communities are dealing with."
In an office packed with toys and a sign reading "Mischief Managed" - a reference to the Marauder's Map in Harry Potter - she said "nature gives us the content we need to teach." Yes, the fiddler crabs are gross, she acknowledged, "but awesome in their grossness."
Officials at the Louisiana facility are making plans to stick around, despite some perceptibly sloping floors and a parking lot so often flooded that managers have discussed the purchase of a swamp buggy that could transport people to the site from lots on the dry side of a levee a few miles inland. Other ideas include extending a boardwalk from the center to high-ground parking lots closer to the slightly higher road.
"We very much feel like we have to be in Cocodrie," Kolker said. "We're marine scientists. We study the ocean."
Brian Roberts, associate director of science at the consortium, said, "there are so many opportunities you lose if you just pack up and leave." Longtime measurements from the site would be disrupted by a move, he noted.
The facility has already raised the height of docks for its two research ships and renovated the facility to move equipment to higher floors. In a recent article about the challenges to conducting marine research in an age of coastal inundation for theirs and similar facilities, Roberts and colleagues concluded: "Global sea-level rise is one of the greatest challenges facing society in the 21st century, and understanding how this phenomenon impacts coastal systems, infrastructure and the people who use them requires a regular coastal presence."

Weary veterans reluctant for war in Iran Skepticism about employing military force is greater

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - In 2002, as the George W. Bush administration marched toward its invasion of Iraq, Vice President Dick Cheney chose the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to make his case for invasion and was greeted with thunderous applause.
This week, the VFW, like other major veterans organizations that once took positions on foreign affairs as seriously as health care and other veteran issues, was silent on President Donald Trump's order to kill a top Iranian general with a drone strike last week. "Any questions pertaining to the killing of the Iranian commander or retaliation from Iran should be forwarded to the Defense and State departments," said Terrence Hayes, a spokesman for the organization.
Trump - and the Iranians - now have taken cautious steps back from escalating toward war. The president's actions appear at least partly driven by a nation, and its veterans, frustrated by nearly two decades of conflicts and no longer rallying reflexively around a commander in chief.
"After 9/11, the country was unified behind our president and it was clear we had an enemy who wanted to harm us," said Brian Stone, who served in the Navy as a petty officer third class.
"Even after the invasion of Iraq turned out to be a clear betrayal of the nation's trust, I still felt I had a duty to serve and to repay my debt of gratitude to the nation, which has given us so much," said Stone, who lives in Dearborn, Michigan, a state where veterans helped put Trump over the line in some districts. "Today, with the situation in Iran, I can't help but feel that this is the dark echo of Iraq."
American skepticism about employing military force, once derided by some as unpatriotic, is much more on display, even among veterans who may have directly faced the lethal danger that Iran presents in the Middle East. While certainly as mixed in their views and influenced by partisan politics as other Americans, the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are a much larger proportion of critics of interventions in the regions they once fought in.
And veteran services organizations, which have struggled to adapt to the younger and more diverse group of those who served in the military over nearly two decades of grinding wars, seem to be returning to their historical focus on veterans health care and housing have new concerns to address and seem less interested in overtly supporting conflicts.
"We can already anticipate that those who deployed this week will likely suffer toxic environmental exposure, grievous injury in some cases, mental health conditions, barriers to gainful employment, traumatic brain injuries and a host of other issues related to their military service," said Sherman Gillums Jr., chief advocacy officer of the group American Veterans.
That rejection is driving bipartisan resistance to another military conflict, opposition that a decade ago would have been for most lawmakers political suicide. House Democrats, who for years joined Republicans in granting the executive branch broad war powers for fear of political reprisals, are pressing for a measure to limit Trump's ability to wage war on Iran, one of several pieces of legislation Congress has passed over the last two years to increase its power over making war.
Even some Senate Republicans emerged from a briefing on the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who led the Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, to declare they, too, might demand the president seek congressional approval for war.
"Veteran attitudes in the general public will likewise split along partisan lines more than along generational or cohort lines," said Peter D. Feaver, a former National Security Council official under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, who now teaches political science at Duke University. "Vet experience, especially in Iraq, will make the individual sympathetic to the idea that Soleimani was a legitimate target and the world is better off without him. But it is a big leap from that to supporting sustained armed confrontation with Iran."
Naveed Shah had no idea that Congress had any role in military affairs when he enlisted in the Army when he was 18, inspired by the attacks on the Pentagon near his childhood middle school. He served in Iraq for a year in 2009, leaving the Army in 2015.
Trump's campaign message of ending "forever wars" was "appealing to some veterans and civilians who have seen what the tolls has been," said Shah, now a real estate agent in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. He described feeling despondent hearing Defense Secretary Mark Esper say in a recent interview that the Trump administration is "not looking to start a war with Iran but we are prepared to finish one."
"With all due respect, we haven't finished the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan yet," Shah said. "We need to bring our troops home before we engage in Iran. I fully understand the commander in chief needs to be able to rapidly respond, but starting and engaging in a conflict that is going to be sustained needs to be authorized by Congress."
The run up to the strikes on Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks attracted few protesters. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 sparked protests, but few of them centered around veterans.
Now there are several veterans groups that are dedicated to ending future wars, including Common Defense and VoteVets on the left; VoteVets has teamed up with Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative group aligned with Trump on many policy issues, to oppose overseas interventions - including in Iran.
"I have dedicated my life to ending these wars as someone who fought in them," said Jon Soltz, co-founder of VoteVets. "And I wake up every day disappointed in myself."
In 2016, resistance to ongoing wars was a key factor in attracting many young veterans to Trump, who promised a policy of limited interventions. Now, the president's inconsistencies on overseas military commitments are buoying Democrats, and rallying more veterans to their sides.
"Veterans have been extremely important to this entire effort," said Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., the only member of Congress to vote against authorizing the president to use force to respond to the Sept. 11 attacks.
"We owe them a debt of gratitude," added Lee, who has remained a leading force in reasserting the role of Congress ever since.
"There is just a different American mind set now," said Sen. Tim Kaine, who represents a state where hundreds of veteran families spent the holidays worried about redeployments.
Kaine has spent years trying to push for Congress to reassert its role in war powers, fruitlessly pressing to sunset the authorizations of military force passed in 2001 and just before the invasion of Iraq, and require presidents to seek new resolutions for new conflicts.
"I think the public is going to be very very engaged in this debate," he said, noting the recent crashing of the Selective Service System website amid false rumors that the draft would be reinstated. "We are squandering money on wars that have not proven to do anything good for us."

Texto completo: Growing up in Mineola in the 1970s, I was horse crazy. I don't remember when it happened, but I begged my parents for riding lessons. I would look through the summer camp ads in the back of The New York Times Sunday magazine, always attracted to one for Camp Bobbin-Hollow proclaiming "If your daughter loves horses she'll love camp Bobbin-Hollow!" I begged to be sent to this camp, which I pictured as horse nirvana. Sadly, I never made it there.
One day I was excited to be taken to the Jericho School of Horsemanship by my parents to observe a group lesson in an indoor arena. I recall kids riding in a circle with an instructor standing in the middle yelling "heads up, heels down!" I was in awe of this wonderful spectacle and hoped my parents would sign me up that very day. I was told the school was being torn down shortly for a new state roadway that would go right through it. This time, eminent domain created an unwelcome detour in my riding dreams.
My next memory is of Gray's Saddlery, on Post Avenue in Westbury, a store with a life-size dappled-gray horse in the display window. The saleslady there helped us select tan riding jodhpurs with nice brown suede patches on each inside leg, a velvet riding helmet and tall black rubber riding boots that were a tad too big on my feet. I was then given group riding lessons at a Glen Head stable where once a week I was thrilled to learn to walk, trot, canter and jump a horse over cavaletti (small, low jumps). After two sets of group lessons, I participated in the horse show where I was completely astonished to win second place out of almost 10 riders in the walk-trot group. I thought maybe, just maybe, I had some talent for what I loved more than anything. After winning that second-place ribbon - one of the proudest moments in my life - my horse world came to a screeching "whoa!"
I tried on my own to resuscitate my connection to horses, writing a letter to Mr. George Morton Levy, founder and president of Roosevelt Raceway (the former harness-racing track) to ask if I could help with the horses in Westbury. I received a reply and was assigned to a barn to help groom horses. A few men working at the barn the day I arrived chuckled because I was so short I could barely reach the horse's withers. The same horse also stepped on my foot; but hey, I was excited to be there. After my first day, my mother informed me she would not drive me back and forth to the track. My horse connection was again severed.
As a high school senior I had an unexpected palm-reading session from an Indian gentleman wearing a turban who on Saturdays manned the front door at the Manhattan School of Music, where I was a Classical piano student in the pre-college music program. I had heard rumors from other students that the man read palms, so I asked him to read mine. Observing my open palm, he told me among other things, that in past lives I had been a man in China, a man in Russia and a horse! This is still perfect validation of my soul's connection to horses. (I am still trying to figure out the Russia and China thing, though I do like borscht and Chinese food!)
Fast forward to 2019. After getting married, raising two children through high school and college, then sitting on my bum watching television every night after work for far too long, I decided to explore riding lessons again. I found a barn in Manorville that was exactly what I was looking for. Though I'm no longer a child, I am aiming to compete again, enjoy the competition experience and try for more ribbons. I have found several inspiring role models, including the horsewomen (older than me!) who are still competing professionally. Even more so, I am inspired by the woman who owns the barn because she is so willing to share her knowledge with me and others who love these beautiful animals and the art of riding. And though he doesn't ride, my husband is my hero for graciously giving me free rein to trot ahead however I choose.

Texto completo: Two literary adaptations debut: Stephen King's "The Outsider" gets a dark take on HBO, while Jane Austen's "Sanditon" inspires a PBS "Masterpiece" series.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's on TV
THE OUTSIDER 9 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. This new dark drama series reinvents the 2018 Stephen King novel of the same name, to thrilling effect. The show starts out with an investigation into a boy's murder in small-town Georgia. The cop on the case, Ralph (Ben Mendelsohn), and a private investigator, Holly (Cynthia Erivo), find clear-cut evidence against a local Little League coach named Terry (Jason Bateman, who also directed the first two episodes). Then they discover evidence that shows Terry was in two places at once the night of the murder. Frustrated with the contradiction, Ralph isn't willing to look into the unexplainable. Yet Holly urges him to keep an open mind if they want to get to the bottom of the murder. The one factor that may convince Ralph to see beyond cold hard facts is that he just lost his son and is looking for answers of his own.
THE 25TH ANNUAL CRITICS' CHOICE AWARDS 7 p.m. on CW. Taye Diggs hosts this annual awards show, broadcast live from Santa Monica. Among the strong contenders chosen by the Critics Choice Association are "The Irishman," with 14 nominations, "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," with 12, and "Little Women," which racked up 9.
SANDITON 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The screenwriter Andrew Davies took many liberties with Jane Austen's final, incomplete novel. The result is this eight-part "Masterpiece" series, starring Rose Williams as our protagonist Charlotte Heywood. At the outset, Charlotte leaves her home for Sanditon, a fishing village that the entrepreneurial Parker family wants to transform into a resort town. When Charlotte meets her host's brother, the handsome and slightly misbehaved Sidney (Theo James), the two initially clash but slowly find common ground. One thing to know before diving into this remake: While it contains familiar nuggets of Austen's writing, it's wildly scandalous compared to her completed novels. "There is a lot of implied sexual energy and humor in Austen," Williams said in an interview in The New York Times. Davies, she added, "kind of pulls it out and makes it visual."
What's Streaming
LITTLE MEN (2016) Stream on Hulu or Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Not to be confused or associated with Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women," this touching drama directed by Ira Sachs follows the budding friendship of two middle schoolers, Jake (Theo Taplitz) and Tony (Michael Barbieri). When Jake's grandfather dies, his family moves into his home in Brooklyn. Tony's single mother runs a shop in the same building, and the boys meet and bond instantly. But when Jake's father, Brian (Greg Kinnear), a struggling actor, learns his father had been charging Tony's mother low rent for the store, he demands more money and sets off a feud that pits Tony and Jake against their parents.

Texto completo: Al Pacino's portrayal of the union leader in "The Irishman" differs markedly from Jack Nicholson's take in a 1992 movie.
It's not hard to see what drew two of the finest actors of their generation to play James R. Hoffa. Sure, the man spent decades in the public eye, led what was then the nation's largest labor union, sparred with the Kennedys and disappeared in one of the quintessential unsolved mysteries in recent history. But he's also a great character, a sizzle reel of big, boisterous speeches, roaring dressing-downs and showy theatricality. It's the kind of role an actor can really sink his teeth into, especially if he's known for chewing a bit of scenery -- a delicacy frequently enjoyed by both Jack Nicholson, who played the title role in the 1992 "Hoffa," and Al Pacino, currently garnering awards buzz for his work as Hoffa in "The Irishman."
It's frankly surprising it took so long for Hoffa to get the big-screen treatment. "The Enemy Within," Robert F. Kennedy's 1960 book on his congressional mob investigations and dust-ups with Hoffa, was optioned by 20th Century Fox shortly after its publication, with the "On the Waterfront" screenwriter Budd Schulberg penning the adaptation. But Ronald Goldfarb, one of Kennedy's colleagues, claimed that it was abandoned because of Teamster intimidation.
So "Hoffa" didn't arrive in theaters until more than three decades later. Though early casting discussions centered, ironically enough, on "The Irishman's" Pacino and Robert De Niro, the director Danny DeVito had only one choice: Nicholson, a fellow Jersey boy with whom he'd first worked on "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." (Both men were also particularly bankable in 1992, thanks to their consecutive turns as Batman villains.) Fox had high hopes for the production, with Joe Roth telling The Los Angeles Times, "Want to hear the early-morning line? Nicholson's 4-to-5 to win the Oscar on this one."
Nicholson did not win the Oscar -- he wasn't even nominated, though he was up for supporting actor that year for "A Few Good Men," released two weeks earlier. "Hoffa" needed enthusiastic reviews and solid box office to gather awards momentum, and it found neither; notices were mixed and it barely earned back half of its nearly $ 50 million budget (about $ 90 million in today's dollars), which may have been a factor in all those "no"s from the major studios that led Martin Scorsese to take "The Irishman" to Netflix.
There are, to be sure, some similarities between the films. Both start at the end of the story, near Hoffa's death, and flash back to the events that brought him there; both portray Hoffa as stubborn, combustible, casually anti-Italian, vehemently anti-Kennedy and utterly intolerant of lateness. (Alas, Nicholson's Hoffa indulges in no ice cream sundaes.) But Hoffa, while only a supporting character in "The Irishman," is the focus of "Hoffa," which covers a much larger span of his life, particularly his early, dirty work of making the Teamsters (and himself) a force to be reckoned with.
The two actors diverge markedly in their portrayals. Nicholson immersed himself in the character, taking pains to physically transform himself into the union chief, via nose putty, eyebrow lifts and other makeup tricks: "Lips clamped, jaws screwed down, forehead willed into an unlikely cube, the kisser on Jack Nicholson's Jimmy Hoffa seems sculpted with a wrench," J. Hoberman wrote in The Village Voice. Nicholson further altered his most distinctive feature, his voice, twisting its devilish purr into Hoffa's stridently nasal Midwestern twang ("Dere's a lot more dere for us").
Though Pacino replicates the labor leader's unmistakable haircut, and his raspy voice occasionally finds its way around a Detroit-Chicago dialect, the actor doesn't particularly look or sound like Hoffa in "The Irishman." This is by design. Though he's played several real historical figures in recent years (Roy Cohn, Jack Kevorkian, Phil Spector, Joe Paterno), he's steered clear of outright impersonation. "You have to find the fictionalization of it in some way," he explained to The New York Times. "You have to find the drama and the character. Because otherwise, do a documentary on someone."
Which is not to say he doesn't do the work. "When you research Hoffa," he told Variety, "there's so much footage on everybody, so you watch it, you study it. You think about it, you engage in it, and you really devote your time to that, who this guy is, and try to absorb him." That last idea is key; Pacino "absorbs" Hoffa, but what comes out onscreen is a combination of both their qualities.
This was not always the case. Pacino and his 1970s contemporaries De Niro and Dustin Hoffman were seen, perhaps oversimplistically, as Method-mad chameleons, unrecognizable from role to role. Nicholson, who achieved stardom around the same time, was more in the mold of the classic movie stars, who honed and refined a persona over the course of a career and filtered characters through it; in the decades that followed, he mostly played variations on the madman or the charming rogue (or, sometimes, both simultaneously).
Thus, because his face and (especially) his voice are so familiar, and so rarely vary from character to character, the contrast in "Hoffa" is jarring -- this feels less like a performance than an imitation. We're always keenly aware that we're looking at Jack, playing someone else. ("He winds up doing Nicholson shtick in Hoffa makeup," Terrence Rafferty wrote in The New Yorker.) It's somehow easier to accept Pacino as Hoffa, even though his interpretation is rife with his own vocal tics and physical mannerisms, which have become more consistently omnipresent in his performances since ... well, since 1992, when he won the Oscar for "Scent of a Woman," the Oscar that Joe Roth predicted was Nicholson's to lose.
Pacino is, no doubt, aided by the fact that "The Irishman" is a far superior picture to "Hoffa." The latter is handsome and ambitious, but ultimately muddled; the film, and Nicholson's performance, is so focused on externals that it never gives us a sense of the man, or his inner life. Pacino's work may not boast the painstaking authenticity of Nicholson's, but it has something more valuable: the richness and humanity of an old pro, unafraid to see this flawed man's qualities in himself.

Texto completo: Five years ago, Darius Jones had trouble coming up with subway fare. Today, he is an I.T. analyst for one of the world's most exclusive luxury brands.
In late 2014, Darius Jones arrived at a computer training class in the Bronx soaking wet. He could not afford a MetroCard and had to walk in the rain.
Five years later, he is thriving as an information technology analyst at Christian Louboutin, one of the world's most exclusive luxury brands.
"It's been a huge learning experience," said Mr. Jones, 26. "I've had a lot of opportunities presented to me, and I'm essentially learning how I.T. fully operates for a job."
Readers of The New York Times first learned in 2015 about Mr. Jones and his passion for computers. He has since carved out a career in technology with the support of his family, but he has had to navigate some setbacks along the way, including the difficult decision to leave a degree program and the deaths of his maternal grandparents.
Mr. Jones dreamed of attending college when he was a student at the Richard R. Green High School of Teaching in Manhattan, but he did not have the money for a private college or university, and he did not want to take out student loans. In 2011, he enrolled in the New York City College of Technology in Brooklyn to study computer science but had difficulty with the subject matter.
"A part of me wishes that I did my homework," he said. "The work didn't come as easily to me as I thought it would."
Around this time, his grandmother died. She was instrumental in raising Mr. Jones and his three brothers, and he took the loss hard.
After switching his major to computer information systems, Mr. Jones needed to take several prerequisite courses. As a part-time student, he was ineligible for much financial aid and could not afford tuition on his own. He left college a few credits shy of his associate degree, pondering what his future would look like.
His mother, with whom he lived after his grandmother's death, brought home a flier for Per Scholas, a nonprofit organization that offers free technology job training to people with low incomes. Per Scholas referred Mr. Jones to the Community Service Society of New York, one of the seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The society provided him with an unlimited MetroCard for two months.
Mr. Jones excelled at Per Scholas, graduating in 2015 and earning a pair of certifications for various operating systems that allowed him to apply for I.T. positions.
However, the next steps were not easy. Mr. Jones's grandfather died later that year, and he had to sign up for food stamps until he could earn a steady paycheck.
In fall 2015, he landed a paid position integrating the computer systems of two New York real estate companies. He then worked as an intern at Praxis Housing Initiatives, a Manhattan-based organization that provides transitional housing to homeless people who are mentally ill or have H.I.V. or AIDS.
Mr. Jones then accepted contract positions with the School Construction Authority, which is responsible for the building and maintenance of New York City's public schools, and Standard & Poor's, the global credit ratings agency.
Then, in May 2016, Open Systems Technologies, a staffing firm that provides recruiting services to financial and technology companies, screened Mr. Jones and selected him to interview for a temporary position with Christian Louboutin, best known for its tall, expensive, red-soled high heels.
Mr. Jones was told he was being hired as a system analyst on a three-month contract. Christian Louboutin was not sure whether the job would turn into a full-time position, so it extended his contract until November 2016.
In January 2017, a decision was made to hire a new operations manager and a new analyst, and Mr. Jones expressed his interest in the analyst position.
"The new manager told me that I was very knowledgeable of the systems and well-liked in the office," he said. "He spoke to the director, and they came back to me in March, approving me as a full-time hire."
As an I.T. analyst, Mr. Jones sets up and repairs computers while making sure everything is running smoothly in Christian Louboutin's New York office and its boutiques in the Americas.
The company generally sends an I.T. employee to set up new stores. Mr. Jones has been dispatched to Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles, and he is going to Toronto in the spring.
"One of the reasons I like working at Christian Louboutin is that everyone knows everyone, and the people are approachable," Mr. Jones said. "It's a friendly, calm environment."
After years of living with his mother and brothers in Harlem, Mr. Jones moved to Brooklyn in 2016. He lives with his girlfriend and their dog in the "very quiet" Homecrest neighborhood.
Despite his accomplishments, Mr. Jones has not forgotten what his struggles have taught him.
"It might seem like there's nothing over the horizon, and it's very easy to basically fall into despair," he said. "If you're able to put your best foot forward, you will get to the top of the hill."

Texto completo: A senior aide said the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, had "good personal feelings" about President Trump, but that did not affect policy.
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said on Saturday that President Trump had sent birthday greetings to its leader, Kim Jong-un, but added that the rapport between the two leaders would not help resolve their countries' nuclear standoff.
Ever since his first summit meeting with Mr. Kim, in June 2018, Mr. Trump has repeatedly flaunted his "good relationship" with the North's leader, calling Mr. Kim "smart" and even going so far as to say that he and Mr. Kim "fell in love."
The two leaders have also exchanged personal letters and dispatched special envoys to each other's capitals, but talks on how to denuclearize the North remains deadlocked.
On Saturday, Kim Kye-gwan, a senior aide to Mr. Kim, confirmed that Mr. Trump had sent a personal letter to Mr. Kim for his birthday. (Mr. Kim is believed to have turned 36 on Wednesday. ) He also acknowledged that the "personal relations" between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump were "not bad," but said Mr. Kim "would not discuss the state affairs on the basis of such personal feelings. "
"Although Chairman Kim Jong-un has good personal feelings about President Trump, they are, in the true sense of the word, 'personal,"' the official said in a statement carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency.
Chung Eui-yong, the national security adviser for President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, told reporters on Friday that Mr. Trump asked Seoul this past week to relay his birthday greetings to Mr. Kim. But Kim Kye-gwan said that a letter from Mr. Trump had already been delivered to Pyongyang directly from the Americans, calling South Korea "presumptuous" for seeking to act as an intermediary between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump.
North Korea also hardened its position toward Washington on Saturday, calling the past one and a half years of on-and-off negotiations a "lost time."
The denuclearization talks collapsed when Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump met in Vietnam in February 2018 for a second summit meeting and Mr. Trump rejected Mr. Kim's offer to dismantle one of the North's nuclear fuel-production facilities if Washington lifted international sanctions. Mr. Trump insisted on a more comprehensive rollback of North Korea's nuclear program.
Mr. Kim said recently that he no longer expected the United States to ease sanctions. Instead, he vowed to expand his country's nuclear force, warning that North Korea no longer felt bound by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range ballistic missile tests.
"There will never be such negotiations as that in Vietnam, in which we proposed exchanging a core nuclear facility of the country for the lift of some U.N. sanctions," Kim Kye-gwan said on Saturday. "We know well about the way we should go and will go on our way."

Texto completo: Readers say there are humane and legal ways to reduce needless suffering, even for somebody with dementia.
To the Editor:
I am the neurologist with early-stage Alzheimer's disease mentioned in "A Test for Alzheimer's Poses a Tough Choice" (Science Times, Dec. 24). Testing for Alzheimer's, especially in the earliest stages, is controversial, even among dementia experts. For me, though, the early diagnosis was empowering. It removed the uncertainty about the cause of my mild cognitive impairment and allowed me to concentrate on doing everything that I could to slow the progression of the disease.
The first pathological changes in the brain, the amyloid plaques, appear up to 20 years before there is any cognitive impairment. My first symptoms of Alzheimer's occurred 14 years ago when I started to lose my sense of smell and began to experience illusory odors. My cognitive impairment began six or seven years ago and has slowly worsened. Still, most people would have no idea that there is anything wrong with me.
It is becoming apparent that the first effective, disease-modifying medications will likely work in the early stages, before there has been too much damage to the brain. And there is already overwhelming evidence that lifestyle modifications like aerobic exercise and a heart-healthy diet slow the accumulation of amyloid and postpone cognitive impairment if they are started in the earliest stages.
Early testing for Alzheimer's disease will not be for everyone, but I don't think that it should be rejected out of hand.

To the Editor:
"Would I really want to know?" is a question your article highlights, but when Alzheimer's enters a family's life, another question is almost always asked: "What do I do now?" At the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, we hear it every day.
Support services are available for affected families, but greater federal investment is needed. Washington deserves praise for delivering over $ 2.8 billion in Alzheimer's research funding in fiscal year 2020, but funding for the Administration for Community Living's Alzheimer's programs, including specialized dementia caregiver training and support, is only $ 26.5 million. While it's an increase from fiscal year 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the number of Americans with Alzheimer's will nearly triple by 2060, from over five million now to 14 million. Given these projections, greater resources are needed.
Diagnosing a problem is critical. Addressing it once it's identified is equally important. The development of new diagnostic tools makes it essential that we prioritize care and support until a cure is found.

To the Editor:
As an individual with a family history of Alzheimer's, I understand the conflicts involved in assessing whether we want to know our risks of getting the disease. I took part in Dr. Jason Karlawish's study of patients' responses to the news of amyloid levels because I wanted to be able to plan for my future.
Receiving the news that there was no amyloid in my brain provided relief beyond expression. If the results had been different, however, I would have accepted them with the knowledge that I could plan for my ultimate demise in a way that would work for me and be helpful to my loved ones.
Alan N. Frankel

To the Editor:
"Happily Married for 60 Years. Then Alzheimer's. And a Gun." (front page, Dec. 29) was devastating. It reinforced the reality that too few people realize there are humane and legal ways to reduce needless suffering, even for somebody with dementia.
All mentally competent adults have the right to document that they want to forgo medical treatments if they get dementia. Their designated health care proxy can then carry out their wishes, significantly shortening the time they endure the most debilitating stages of dementia.
If you are a mentally competent adult, you can create a dementia directive and attach it to your advance directive.
Kim Callinan

The writer is president and chief executive of Compassion & Choices.
To the Editor:
I read with sadness and more than a bit of dismay the disturbing portrait of a loving husband caring for his wife afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. The burdens on caregivers of people living with dementia are well documented: depression, social isolation, worsening physical health and, in some cases, resistance to accepting help.
There is much we can do to relieve this burden for such families. I wish the article had referred to the exceptional work that well-informed physicians, nurses, social workers and mental health specialists do each and every day to identify and support families that are having an especially difficult time coping with the demands of dementia caregiving.
It is tragic that this family did not benefit from more effective professional dementia support interventions, which must be made available in every community, for every family in need.

To the Editor:
Few Americans are lucky enough to have long-term care insurance. We expect spouses to provide care at home and assume that will be enough. Then we act surprised when someone, in complete desperation, resorts to murder-suicide.
I cared for my wife, who had multiple sclerosis, for 50 years until her death. Many of those years were wonderful and productive. But when her M.S. became progressive, our health care system provided almost no long-term care at all. Care was provided by me, by home health aides who were paid privately and by some family members who were kind enough to provide relief.
The aides earned a median income of about $ 22,000 a year. The lowest paid people in the medical field are the ones who provide care for the chronically ill and the dying.
A support group can help. I belonged to the Well Spouse Association, a national nonprofit support group for the spouses/partners of the chronically ill or disabled. They provided meetings, respite and other services, which helped me to keep going and prevented me from becoming desperate.
Bob Mastro
Cherry Hill, N.J.
To the Editor:
Your article doesn't point out the troubling fact that domestic violence homicides and familicides (including murder-suicides) are on the rise in the United States, despite overall declines in homicide rates.
The article portrays Richard Shaver as a doting husband driven to desperation, but familicide is the ultimate desperate expression of partners (usually male) trying to maintain power and control over their family members.
It is troubling to me that your article does not draw more attention to this epidemic of an extreme form of domestic violence.

Texto completo: A geriatrician describes an "Aging and End of Life" curriculum at Harvard Medical School.
To the Editor:
The need for geriatricians and geriatrics training (Science Times, Jan. 7) is becoming increasingly urgent. Yet most medical schools still lack a required geriatrics rotation, despite national guidelines calling for more rigorous training of future physicians.
To address this gap, at Harvard Medical School, we have launched an "Aging and End of Life" curricular theme that integrates these important aspects of caring for older adults throughout the medical school experience.
The updated curriculum includes a home visit to an elder individual living in the community, and mock clinical exams in which the patient-actor ages between visits.
Ongoing federal and philanthropic support of such efforts is critical to ensure that doctors-in-training graduate prepared to deliver the evidence-based, compassionate and individualized care that older patients deserve.

Elizabeth Wurtzel Finally Grew Up

Texto completo: Angry and disaffected, the "Prozac Nation" author, who died this week at 52, found new peace and purpose in her later years.
With Kurt Cobain, Tupac Shakur, Elliott Smith and Jeff Buckley gone, that undersized, underwhelming demographic known as Generation X was already short on idols. And after the death this past Tuesday of Elizabeth Wurtzel, the "Prozac Nation" author and 1990s-angst poster child, our confused, self-contradictory cohort may have lost the most Gen X member of us all.
Ms. Wurtzel, who died of metastatic breast cancer at 52, was well cast to serve as a face for a generation that the news media perpetually cast as nihilistic and irony-suffused -- latchkey kids whose prospects were dimmed by recession and an America in decline.
She certainly had the look: A cover-worthy grunge-pixie image consisting of bare-midriff tops, streaked hair, Goth black eyeliner and a perpetual rock star pout. Not for nothing was she called "the Courtney Love of letters."
For proof, look no further than the original cover of her 1998 book, "Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women," where she posed topless and smirking, proudly displaying a middle finger to the world.
A jaded distrust of institutions apparently came naturally. As a pioneer of the '90s memoir boom, Ms. Wurtzel was either burdened or blessed with the tangled upbringing that launched a thousand Gen X clichés.
She was not only a child of a divorce, like so many in her generation, but, in some sense, the confused product of the loose social mores of the '60s.
As she recounted in the Cut in 2018, the man she grew up thinking was her father "was not so much wrong for me as wrong for anyone. He relied on pills to get by." Her real father, as she found out late in life, was the celebrated '60s civil rights photographer Bob Adelman, with whom her mother had had an affair. It somehow seems very Gen X that she was born in July 1967, the hippie pinnacle in the Summer of Love.
As for those famously gloomy career prospects which supposedly doomed her generation -- at least until the dot-com frenzy took off in the late '90s -- it was hard to call hers dire. Ms. Wurtzel grew up in Manhattan (albeit the gritty Manhattan of the '70s, where Zsa Zsa Gabor, she once wrote, was mugged in the Waldorf Astoria ), attended the elite Ramaz School, and later received a bachelor's degree in comparative literature from Harvard.
Nevertheless, she entered adulthood haunted by a very Generation X sense of meaninglessness and despair, largely due to the crippling depression that she recounted in excruciating detail over the course of 317 pages in "Prozac Nation," the 1994 memoir that made her a star at 27.
"I feel like a defective model, like I came off the assembly line flat-out," she wrote, using an obscenity, "and my parents should have taken me back for repairs before the warranty ran out." The book not only helped kickstart a memoir boom in literary circles, but foreshadowed the squirm-inducing oversharing of the coming social media age.
Ms. Wurtzel's psychic suffering, which, like Mr. Cobain, she turned into a form of performance art, dovetailed neatly with the disaffection and lack of direction that bedeviled her generation, at least in a pop culture sense, according to seminal '90s movies like "Slacker" and "Reality Bites."
During her '90s youth, she was a self-defined "20-nothing," having survived messy sex episodes and a suicide attempt to embark on a career that seemed to crest and collapse simultaneously. After losing a gig interning at the Dallas Morning News after accusations of plagiarism, she briefly became a rock critic -- how Gen X! -- for an eye-blink at New York Magazine and later, The New Yorker, where she was let go as soon as Tina Brown took over.
Of course there were drugs. And not just Prozac. Ms. Wurtzel was soon doing cocaine and heroin, and found herself addicted to Ritalin, which she did not "take" so much as snort, as she recounted in her 2003 addiction memoir, "More, Now, Again."
And, like any worthy X-er, she tended to fall back on irony to weather the storm, as exemplified by the Prozac locket she flashed in her '90s heyday.
No wonder that Ms. Wurtzel, at her depths, got to the point where she could not even sign off on the basic tenets of reality. "Good and bad are not opposites, they are both just different forms of intensity," she wrote in "Bitch," channeling either enlightenment or Charles Manson.
Her role as a generational spokeswoman did not end with the era of flannel shirts and Zima. In a 2012 New York Times article about the first member of the generation -- Representative Paul D. Ryan -- to appear on a presidential ticket, I interviewed Ms. Wurtzel, along with Johnny Knoxville of "Jackass" and Krist Novoselic of Nirvana, about that theoretically historic moment. Ms. Wurtzel served up a typically '90s shrug of a response: "Vice president: it's the perfect Gen X job, isn't it? To have no responsibility, to have only the perks of what was left behind by the responsible people."
As a generational symbol, however, Ms. Wurtzel did fail in one regard: She did not die young-- at least not exceptionally so. Indeed, her life in her final years might be seen as a violation of everything she once symbolized.
The woman who described herself in "Prozac Nation" as "the girl you see in the photograph from some party someplace or some picnic in the park, the one who looks so very vibrant and shimmery, but who is in fact soon going to be gone," lived to earn a law degree from Yale and work for a time at the prestigious law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner. The woman who wrote in that same book that "no one will ever love me; I will live and die alone" did eventually get married, to a writer named James Freed Jr., in 2015.
That same year, she underwent a double mastectomy. After a diagnosis of breast cancer, caused by the BRCA genetic mutation, she became an advocate for BRCA testing -- something she had not had -- and encouraged Ashkenazi Jewish women, in particular, to push for the test in an op-ed for The New York Times. "It seems I am the designated driver at my Seder table," she wrote.
Some die-hard fans from the '90s might consider her newfound advocacy and domestic turn a surrender.
But to the rest of us, it suggests that "Generation X," a term that has largely vanished from the cultural landscape, was less a demographic group than a phase, a youthful illusion that, like Kurt and Biggie, was never destined to make it to 30.
Ms. Wurtzel surely felt no shame in settling down.
"Shame," she wrote in an afterword to a 2017 reissue of her seminal memoir, "is a terrible thing. You are only as sick as your secrets."

52 Places to Go in 2020 is here. Read the full list now.
"Where would you go if you could go anywhere?"
That was the question I posed to the members of The Times Travel desk back at the beginning of September, at our kickoff lunch for the 2020 edition of our annual 52 Places to Go list. Between that day and the list's publication, there have been almost four months of research, discussion, debate and as many synonyms for "argument" as you can imagine. In the end, we came down to these 52 destinations that we hope will inspire, delight and motivate you to explore the world.
How did we choose them? After that initial poll, we asked our regular contributors, as well as The Times's foreign and domestic correspondents, to suggest places that seemed newly fresh and compelling. We pestered in-the-know travelers for their 2020 musts. We grilled travel pros about what had them excited. To make the cut, it is not enough for a place to be beautiful, amazing and culturally significant. It also has to answer the question, why now? Why this place, this year?
Tokyo, a great city in any year, is hosting the Summer Olympics in 2020. It's on our list.
The Bahamas, always a pleasure, needs support from tourists in the wake of 2019's Hurricane Dorian. On the list.
Greenland, with its magnificent glaciers threatened by global warming and new airports on the horizon, made it, too.
As we made our choices, themes emerged. This year the two most prominent were the importance of sustainability and the pull of history. Over the last year, the travel world woke up to the implications of climate change and its contributions to global warming, as well as questions about overtourism and who benefits from tourist dollars. A growing number of companies, destinations and individual travelers are committed to mitigating their impact on earth. Global brands like Hilton and Marriott pledged to get rid of single-use plastics; KLM, the Dutch airline, ran ads suggesting that travelers might want to take the train. On Times Travel, we committed to buying carbon offsets for our staff plane travel. (And no, we will not be sending out a 52 Places Traveler this year, though we will report from many of our chosen destinations.)
This list is, at least in part, a fantasy of escape (see Australia's Kimberley region or La Paz, Mexico), but we recognize that travel, like life, can be messy and contradictory. Getting on a plane or a cruise ship or behind the wheel of a car adds carbon to the atmosphere. But travel also brings people together, enlightens and amazes, and, properly managed, has economic benefits.
A number of places on our list are leading the way in making travel more sustainable (Western Sweden, we're looking at you) or are limiting visitor numbers to avoid the plague of overtourism (Haida Gwaii, in Canada, is a leader here, as well as in making sure locals benefit from tourism). Uganda limits the number of gorilla-trekking permits for its famed Bwindi forest, and makes sure the proceeds help protect the animals. Others, like Sabah, on the island of Borneo, could use help from tourists in establishing that preservation can be more profitable than the destruction of habitats.
Our concerns meant that some very tempting places did not make the list. We had a long debate, in particular, about Antarctica. Travel to the southernmost continent is booming: The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, which includes most of the companies doing business there, predicts that 78,520 people will visit Antarctica in 2019-2020, up from 56,168 in 2018-2019. Norwegian Airlines, the low-cost carrier, is now offering service to Ushuaia, the jumping-off point for many Antarctic itineraries. All that gave us pause: Can Antarctica handle that increase? Can it face difficulties similar to those that have developed in the Galápagos or on Mount Everest?
Against those worries, history offered a countervailing story of continuity. The German town of Oberammergau has been putting on its once-a-decade Passion Play since 1634; you can take in the 42nd staging this year. Egypt, a contender last year, is scheduled to complete its massive new Grand Egyptian Museum in 2020, making thousands of objects associated with the pharoahs newly visible. As every American learns, the Mayflower set sail from Plymouth, England, 400 years ago. In marking that moment, the town will acknowledge and explore the conflicting perspectives on the consequences of that voyage. So history changes, too.
Our #1 place, Washington, looks both forward and back. We thought it was important to mark the 100th anniversary of American women winning the right to vote. While Seneca Falls had its proponents, we decided there was no better place to do that than the capital of the United States, a majority-minority city filled with immigrants and with a vibrant life beyond its monuments and halls of government. And what better year than 2020, in the middle of what promises to be an extraordinarily contentious election, to visit and remember the ideals on which the United States was founded, and the fact that Washington belongs to everyone.

Texto completo: 'Open floor plan.' 'Granite countertops.' 'Vaulted ceilings.' Here are the words and phrases that most often lure us to property listings.
We've all seen the common words and phrases that real estate listings use to get our attention: "Natural light." "Stainless steel appliances." "Move-in ready." They're critical not just for maximizing the number of potential buyers, but for luring the right buyers to any particular listing.
So what are real estate's most popular keywords? To find out, Point2 Homes, a real estate listing website, analyzed the language in 1.2 million listings that were active in July 2019 across the United States.
"Large," "new," and "spacious" were among the most common adjectives used in listings, while "cul-de-sac," and "close to restaurants and shopping" were frequently used for locations. The study also looked at keywords describing a home's features and broke down the results by price range. The top 10 keywords in each of five price brackets make up this week's chart.
For homes priced under $ 250,000, keywords addressing concerns about post-purchase expenses made frequent appearances, with "new roof" and "move-in ready" among the most used terms. Between $ 250,000 and $ 499,999, the prevalence of "dual sinks" and "covered patio" suggested buyers expect more than the basics. Between $ 500,000 and $ 999,999, aspirational terms like "perfect location" and "gourmet kitchen" crept into the top 10.
Between $ 1,000,000 and $ 4,999,999, there was a pivot from "gourmet" to the superior "chef kitchen." Other cushy features, like "pool and spa" and "wet bar," also appeared in the top 10. At the high end of the market -- properties listed at $ 5,000,000 or more -- were promises of "ocean views," a "wine cellar" or a "media room."
There was one common thread across the prince ranges, a single phrase that appeared in the top 10 of all available homes. Perhaps you guessed it: "hardwood floors."

In Sports, Increasingly, There's No Place Like the Road

Texto completo: An unsettling new reality is creeping across the landscape of professional sports: Anyplace may be as good as home.
Ask the spectators in New Orleans, Philadelphia and Foxborough, Mass., following the first round of the N.F.L. playoffs. Or the baseball fans in Houston and Washington during the World Series last October.
The home-field advantage was once so airtight a principle in sports. Data supported it. Coaches trumpeted it. Stadium pyrotechnic crews fueled it. The credo was Las Vegas oddsmakers automatically cooked in a three-point cushion for N.F.L. home teams and adjusted their lines from there. But enough gamblers have been burned this season to question whether playing fields are leveling.
In the N.F.L., a variety of factors appear to be contributing to a steady shift in the competitive balance since the 1990s, when home teams won 59.8 percent of games, including nearly three-quarters of their postseason games. For instance, in 1999, the N.F.L. added a check on referee influence by instituting instant replay and coaches' challenges. The next season, the home winning percentage dropped from 59.6 percent to 55.6. It was 51.7 percent this season, the lowest mark since 1972.
Some point to how coaches have better simulated stadium environments during practices. Others credit the players' luxury travel arrangements. Still others note the rising popularity of meditation apps, sleep coaches to help guard against jet-lag and sports psychology. A few have an even stranger culprit: The rise of virtual-technology training to let athletes act out the scenarios they might encounter.
All of that can help teams manage the most hostile work environments, like the New Orleans Superdome, where the crowd noise reached 125 decibels last Sunday, comparable to a jet at takeoff.
"Loudest it's been in any stadium this year," Minnesota Vikings receiver Stefon Diggs said.
The Vikings won, 26-20, in overtime, sending Saints fans home, hoarse and heartbroken, for the second year in a row.
You'll still never get a football coach to admit he would rather play a big game on the road, said Bill Cowher, the CBS analyst and former coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. But he knows there are certain locker rooms with the right alchemical makeup to learn to love the road's disadvantages, as his team did in 2005, when the Steelers were 9-2 on the road and chose to wear road jerseys in the Super Bowl.
With so much more money available, road teams have the luxury of bringing many of the comforts of home along with them -- from massage therapists and chefs to condiments and toilet paper.
"It's so efficient," Geoff Schwartz, a former N.F.L. lineman and Sirius XM commentator, said of the travel routines. Little gets overlooked, including how players combat inflammation on long flights. "Guys wear compression tights or they eat better. They're just so much better trained and more in tune with their bodies."
The Seattle Seahawks are this year's favorite road warrior. After winning at Philadelphia last Sunday, the Seahawks improved to 8-1 on the road. At home at CenturyLink Field the Seahawks were 4-4, even though the stadium is designed to harness crowd noise so effectively that, at one point this season, an opposing lineman was flagged for unnecessary roughness because he couldn't hear the referees whistle the play dead.
"It's harder to play when you can't hear. That's a fact," Coach Kyle Shanahan of the San Francisco 49ers said this week. "But that definitely doesn't mean you can't win, as everyone proves each week."
To be sure, any attempts to find a surefire trend of a declining home field advantage can be a fraught endeavor that might depend on the size of the sample being studied. For instance, home teams have won 75 percent of divisional round games since 2010 -- and 74 percent since 1990 -- so maybe hold off on betting the farm on the Seahawks, the Vikings, the Titans or the Texans. Also, studies have shown even random outcomes can be streaky. Flip a coin 20 times and don't be surprised if it comes up tails seven times in a row.
Yale economist Tobias Moskowitz said the psychology of the referees may be the most likely factor contributing to the winnowing of the home-field advantage.
Crowds have only a modest effect on professional athletes' performance over time, Moskowitz said. N.B.A. free-throw shooting percentages are about the same at home and away, "down to the decimal point," he noted. But when fans were barred from attending games in Italy's top soccer league, Serie A, after an outbreak of violence in 2007, the home-field advantage fell by 80 percent.
"It wasn't that the players played any differently," said Moskowitz, co-author of the book "Scorecasting," which investigated various sporting clichés. But, without the pressure from 80,000 hostile fans, officials distributed fouls, yellow cards and red cards more evenly, stripping away what had been a traditional advantage for the home team.
"I don't think there's any conspiracy," he added. "I think refs are professionals, they're trying to get it right. But they're human."
Moskowitz notes there are caveats. The best basketball teams are tough to beat anywhere, but the top three teams in the N.B.A. this season are a combined 49-5 at home. Three of the four teams playing at home in this weekend's N.F.L. divisional round enter as considerable favorites.
But, across sports, securing home-field advantage for the biggest games might not be as meaningful as it once was. The last five games of the N.B.A. finals last summer were won on the road. It marked the third time in four years that the league's championship was decided without confetti falling from the rafters. (Small sample size warning: Kevin Durant was hurt in June; the Warriors could have won on Mars in 2018, and in 2016, well, LeBron.) The last Stanley Cup champion to clinch at home? Your 2015 Chicago Blackhawks.
Advanced analytics might help the trend gain further momentum.
Konstantinos Pelechrinis, a professor of computing and information at the University of Pittsburgh, scrutinized the N.B.A.'s Last Two Minute Reports, the league's assessment of officiating calls in the final two minutes of a close game, between 2015 and 2019. He found that incorrect calls or non-calls in the period occurred at a rate of 7.2 percent for away teams and 6.7 percent for home teams.
In other words, officials were more likely to make an incorrect call that benefits the home team in the most critical moments of a tight game. The majority of the mistakes, Pelechrinis said, were non-calls, when the referees swallowed their whistle. Exposing that data, as the league now does, is intended to help referees. Now that coaches can challenge calls in the N.B.A., Pelechrinis expects the league's home winning percentage, which was as high as 68.5 percent in 1977 but on a downward trend for a generation, to continue sliding as it has in the N.F.L.
Employing a regression-based model to weight all teams equally, Pelechrinis found that playing at home was worth an average of 2.4 points per game in the N.F.L. between 2005 and 2018. This season, the advantage dropped to less than half a point.
"It could be a statistical anomaly," Pelechrinis said. "It could just be the scheduling. But it was interesting."
Gambling oddsmakers have noticed. Their formulas got thrown for a loop this season after N.F.L. home teams went 102-131-10, when the point spread is included in the calculation.
"What we've had to learn, on our side of the counter, is that not all home fields are in fact created equal," said Vinny Magliulo, who ran the sports books at Caesars Palace and Wynn Las Vegas and is now the sports book director at Gaughan Gaming.
In recent years, stadiums have gotten better at adding distractions and manufacturing tension. Even the subtlest tricks can have an effect on a team's mind-set, Cowher said, like when the Denver Broncos put a sign in the opposing locker room warning visitors of the signs of altitude sickness. But coaches have countered with more practice strategies to keep players from getting rattled, by importing crowd noise, for example.
Cowher, who went 67-59 in his career on the road, said that the best way he knew how the nullify a noxious crowd was to score early. "You get past that initial energy," he said, "you find yourself in the second and third quarter and you know what? It's even."

White House In No Rush To Repeal Health Law

Texto completo: The Department of Justice told the Supreme Court that the case did not represent an "emergency" that would require a speedy ruling.
The Trump administration came into office with its top legislative priority clear: Repeal the Affordable Care Act. It failed. Then, when a group of Republican states tried to throw out Obamacare through a lawsuit, the administration agreed that a key part of the law was unconstitutional.
But now that defenders of the law have asked the Supreme Court to settle the case quickly, the president's lawyers say they are in no particular hurry. The case, which seeks to invalidate the entire health care law, can wait for the lower courts to consider certain questions more carefully, they said in a filing to the Supreme Court on Friday. There is no "present, real-world emergency," the brief says, that would require the court to rush the case's progress.
The case argues that changes made to the Affordable Care Act in 2017 make its requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance unconstitutional -- and that the provision is so essential to the health care law that the rest of it should be invalidated as well.
The case could have major political implications because the results sought by the Republican states and the Trump administration would cause substantial disruptions. According to estimates from the Urban Institute, around 20 million more Americans would become uninsured because of the elimination of the law's coverage expansions and protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions.
The erasure of other provisions of Obamacare would rattle the health system, eliminating consumer protections for health insurance customers; increasing the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries; weakening penalties for health care fraud; reshaping government payments to hospitals, doctors and insurance companies; and undermining an approval pathway for generic versions of biologic drugs, among many changes.
The Republican states on Friday agreed with the Department of Justice. "The lawfulness of the act is undoubtedly a matter of the utmost national importance, but the current petitions do not justify immediate, emergency review by the court," said their brief, brought by the attorney general of Texas and elected officials in 17 other states.
So far, the Trump administration and the Republican states have been winning in the courts. A Federal District Court judge in Texas agreed with the litigants that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and that the entire law should be overturned along with it.
Last month, a three-judge panel from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the so-called individual mandate was unconstitutional, but declined to rule on what should happen to the rest of the health law, asking the lower court to devote more analysis to the question. The Texas court's ruling has been delayed until the case is resolved, and the Trump administration has said it will continue to administer the Affordable Care Act in the meantime.
The litigants' chances in the Supreme Court are unclear. The five justices who ruled to uphold the Affordable Care Act after an earlier challenge to the individual mandate, in 2012, remain on the court.
A group of Democratic-led states and the House of Representatives, which entered the case to defend the law, have asked the Supreme Court to rule right away, rather than letting the case go back to the lower court and then back to the Fifth Circuit for another look. Their brief, filed last week, emphasized the major stakes of the case, and argued there were negative consequences from the uncertainty caused by the delays. There may also be political reasons for Democratic politicians to want the case on the front burner this year: The legislative assault on the Affordable Care Act in 2017 became a major theme of many successful Democratic congressional campaigns in 2018.
The Supreme Court typically waits to take cases until the lower courts have finished their work. But it could accept the case at this stage if four justices agree it is ripe for legal review. It would take a five-justice majority for the case to be considered on the "expedited basis" that would set up a ruling by the end of the court's current session in June -- before the 2020 election.

Texto completo: Jan. 11, 1839: Sculptor Franklin Simmons, whose public works of art include the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow statue and the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Portland and the Soldiers’ Monument in Lewiston, is born in a part of Lisbon that later becomes the town of Sabattus.
Simmons, who grows up in Bath and Lewiston, begins working on sculpture models by using coarse clay from the banks of the Androscoggin River. He opens a sculpture studio in Portland after graduation from Bates College. He proprproduces his first commercial statue, depicting Maj. Gen. Hiram Berry, for the city of Rockland.
His statue of William King, Maine’s first governor, and Vice President Hannibal Hamlin, another Maine luminary, are on display in Washington, D.C.
He also creates the statue of President Ulysses Grant, shown in a Union Army uniform, that stands in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. He plans to do one of President Abraham Lincoln as well, but the day after the two meet in April 1865 to schedule a sitting, John Wilkes Booth shoots the president fatally.
Simmons’ pieces eventually include more than 100 busts in marble and 15 public monuments.
Simmons moves to Rome in 1868, following in the footsteps of many American sculptors who want to gain exposure to and knowledge about the centuries-old Italian tradition of marble carving. After the king of Italy decorates him three times for his work, he dies on Dec. 8, 1913, in the Italian capital while taking a hot bath, according to The New York Times.
Jan. 11, 2012: For the second time in two years, Hostess Brands, which employs about 370 people at a bakery in Biddeford, appears in bankruptcy court because of insolvency.
A spokesman for the company, whose cake products include Twinkies and Ding Dongs, says the filing will not result in job losses in Biddeford.
However, embroiled in a strike that includes workers at the Biddeford plant, the national company closes all 33 of its bakeries in November that year, and a bankruptcy judge issues a ruling the following March that authorizes the company to sell everything it owns.
Flowers Foods Inc. buys most of Hostess’ assets in July 2013, including the Biddeford bakery, but it puts that property up for sale the following year. The site never reopens as a bakery.

Texto completo: A wealthy House member and a champion of liberal causes as a New York civic leader, he was forced to quit Congress in 1982 in a corruption scandal.
Frederick W. Richmond, a New York philanthropist and civic leader who helped save Carnegie Hall from demolition but whose tenure in Congress -- and public life -- ended abruptly in 1982 when he pleaded guilty to corruption charges, died on Dec. 28 at a nursing home in Manhattan. He was 96.
Gloria Spalding, a longtime friend, confirmed the death and said the cause was pneumonia.
Before his fall, Mr. Richmond had been a successful businessman and a prominent civic participant: a human rights commissioner of New York City, president of the Urban League of New York, a New York State cultural official and a protector of Carnegie Hall when it faced the wrecking ball in the 1960s.
A liberal Democrat, he was elected to the House of Representatives from Brooklyn in 1974 as part of a congressional class of post-Watergate reformers. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, he helped expand the food stamp program, promoted urban gardens and held hearings to investigate Latin American coffee cartels. Ahead of his time, he grew an organic vegetable garden on the roof outside his House office building.
And with a net worth of $ 34 million, he was one of the wealthiest members of Congress.
"He was one of the best we had," Meade Esposito, the powerful Brooklyn Democratic boss, told Pete Hamill and Denis Hamill, brother journalists who explored Mr. Richmond's life in New York Magazine in 1982. "Somewhere along the line he got lost."
In April 1978, Mr. Richmond was arrested in Washington for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old boy and an undercover cop. He apologized publicly, saying he had "made bad judgments involving my private life." He admitted to a misdemeanor morals charge, which was dropped after he agreed to 30 days of counseling. In his campaign for re-election that year, he made hefty donations to local charities and easily won a third term.
But he soon became enmeshed in a financial scandal involving self-dealing with Walco National, a holding company he founded. He had appeared to resign as its president to comply with House rules that barred members of Congress from earning outside income exceeding 15 percent of their House salary. But a federal judge found that he had feigned his retirement in order to collect a pension at the rate of $ 100,000 a year while still running the company. He also used Walco employees to do political work for him.
Mr. Richmond asserted his innocence to The New York Times. "I'm not ashamed of anything I've done," he said in 1981. "I've done nothing wrong."
A federal grand jury at the time was investigating him on an array of other charges. In one, he was said to have helped a career criminal from Massachusetts, who had escaped from prison, get a clerical job in the House of Representatives; the convict was arrested while sitting in Mr. Richmond's car and soliciting an undercover police officer for sexual favors.
As rumors swirled, Mr. Richmond blamed the Reagan administration's Justice Department and The Times for his woes.
"If I were a conservative Republican from the Middle West, I don't think I'd have as much trouble as I have right now," he told United Press International. He said The Times had a vendetta against him, noting that the columnist Sydney Schanberg had called him "a one-man crime wave."
But even as federal prosecutors closed in on him, Mr. Richmond continued to run for a fifth term in 1982.
That quest ended in August, when he accepted a plea deal under which he resigned his seat immediately, dropped his bid for re-election and pleaded guilty to three charges: tax evasion, for underreporting his 1980 federal income tax by $ 50,000; possession of marijuana, obtained from his Congressional staff; and making an illegal payment to a government employee.
"These acts to which I have pled guilty were irresponsible, unnecessary, foolish and wrong," he said in a statement.
He was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $ 20,000.
In a separate settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, he agreed to return $ 425,000 in improper pension payments that he had received from Walco for faking his retirement.
Mr. Richmond's personal life suffered another blow when a young man whom he had been planning to adopt committed suicide in Mr. Richmond's Sutton Place apartment in Manhattan. Mr. Richmond was in Washington at the time awaiting sentencing.
.
Frederick William Richmond was born in Boston on Nov. 15, 1923, to George and Frances (Rosen) Richmond. His father was a lawyer, his mother a homemaker who gave her son piano lessons.
Fred went to Boston University, enrolled briefly at Harvard and enlisted in the Navy during World War II. After the war he returned to Boston University and graduated in 1946. To pay for his education, he formed the Freddie Richmond Swing Band, with himself at the piano.
After college he moved to New York and started a lucrative import-export business. He married Monique Alice Pflieger, a socialite, in 1955. They were divorced two years later. They had one son, William McNeir Richmond, who died last year.
Mr. Richmond's business interests shifted to buying and selling machinery and acquiring companies. He amassed a fortune, and in 1962 he formed the Frederick W. Richmond Foundation, through which he supported liberal causes.
He also became active in Democratic politics. From 1958 to 1960 he was deputy finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Mr. Richmond, who supported programs for the poor, created what he called neighborhood study clubs. He rented out storefronts in Harlem to provide safe spaces for young people to study after school and provided reading tutorials on Saturdays. And as a promoter of the arts, in 1960 he joined the successful campaign, led by the violinist Isaac Stern, to save Carnegie Hall.
With a developer preparing to raze the hall to make way for an office building, Mr. Richmond enlisted the help of Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., who ordered a temporary halt to the project. The city and state then created the Carnegie Hall Corporation to assume ownership of the property, making Mr. Stern the president and Mr. Richmond chairman of the board. He held the position for 18 years.
Mr. Richmond was elected to the New York City Council in 1973 and served there briefly before he was elected to Congress.
Mr. Richmond was released from the Allenwood federal prison in Pennsylvania in 1983 after serving five months of his 12-month sentence and went to Paris. Returning to New York, he resumed work with his foundation. But his public life was over.
As his lawyer had said at his sentencing, Mr. Richmond was "tortured, humiliated, defeated."

Texto completo: Here are some of the stories of how couples, who submitted their announcement information to The New York Times in 2019, agreed to marry each other.
An engagement ring hidden in an elephant trunk in Southeast Asia. A golden eagle serving as a wingman for a prospective groom in Mongolia. A double dose of matchmaking magic in Mississippi.
There are many stories behind the question: Will you marry me? And over the years, countless wedding proposals from around the world have been submitted to The New York Times's Weddings section. Here are a few creative and romantic ones that we've recently seen.
A Trunk and a Box
In May 2018, Peter Nosal took Lisa Goldstein, who has loved elephants since she was a child, to an elephant camp on the border of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. Although Ms. Goldstein had a notion that Mr. Nosal would ask her to marry him on that trip -- their second visit to Thailand -- she didn't know that one of the elephants would get in on the act.
As Ms. Goldstein posed for a photo with Mr. Nosal and several of the elephants, he surreptitiously slipped a box over to Yuki, a middle-age female elephant. When one of the elephant guides called out a command, Mr. Nosal pointed to Yuki and told Ms. Goldstein that she had a present for her.
Yuki then turned her trunk, on which a box holding the engagement ring rested, toward Ms. Goldstein. She slowly reached out to take the box while Mr. Nosal dropped to one knee and did the rest.
"I rolled the dice by placing a lot of trust in that elephant to not eat the ring," Mr. Nosal said, laughing. "But in the end, I was really happy the way things turned out."
The couple were married April 20.
Perfectly Landed Proposal
Earlier this year, Alexander Fankuchen visited Dr. Alexa Monroy in Mongolia, where she was conducting a research project on childhood asthma management. While there, Mr. Fankuchen coordinated with trainers of a golden eagle which would eventually fly to Ms. Monroy's arm and deliver in its talons a surprise for the future bride -- an engagement ring.
"My family and friends were completely blown away when they saw our proposal video," Ms. Monroy said. "It was an incredible experience."
They were married Nov. 20.
Back-to-Back Matches
Match Day at the University of Mississippi Medical Center is always filled with pomp and tradition. It's the day medical students in their final year learn where they will be doing their residencies for the next three to five years. Medical institutions rank their preference of medical students, and the students do the same. An algorithm determines "a match," which the students are contractually obligated to abide by.
This year's Mississippi Match Day, which took place March 15, was doubly rewarding for Morgan Davis, 27, who was nervous when called onstage. "I felt like I wanted to throw up," she said. "I couldn't breathe."
She felt better when she opened her envelope saying she matched with the University of California San Diego, her first choice.
But then she was handed another envelope. Inside was a sheet of paper asking, "Will you marry me?" She turned around and saw her now-fiancé, Maurtice Mills, 25, a first lieutenant in the United States Marines, by her side with an engagement ring.
"I was speechless at first because everything we both ever wanted in life happened in about 30 seconds," Ms. Davis said. "It was wonderful, but at the same time, a bit overwhelming."
They have set a wedding date for March 20, 2021.
Selfies Over the Seine
In October 2018, Yuanyuan Tang, then a second-year law student at Boston University, traveled to Paris to visit her boyfriend, Hui Zhu, who was studying for a Ph.D. in fundamental mathematics at the Université Paris-Sud in Orsay, France.
They were strolling through Ms. Tang's favorite garden, Jardin des Tuileries at sunset when Mr. Zhu dropped to one knee and proposed.
She cried and said yes, and they proceeded to take selfies over the Seine River before heading to the Louvre Museum, where they took official engagement photos and more selfies. (Mr. Zhu posed with a promise ring Ms. Tang had previously given him.)
"Paris has been such an important city to us, so it was fitting that we were engaged there," said Ms. Tang, who had attended high school with Mr. Zhu in Shaoxing, China. "It was our best stroll ever." she said.
They were married May 3.
Shiny Holiday Ornament
Daniel Morgese proposed to Liane Terracciano the day before Thanksgiving in 2018. He put up a Christmas tree with simple white lights, and a single, porcelain jewelry-box ornament, in Ms. Terracciano's apartment in Stamford, Conn.
When Ms. Terracciano plugged in the lights and asked about the lone ornament, Mr. Morgese opened it to reveal an engagement ring inside. He then got down on one knee and proposed.
"It was simple and sweet and shared only by the two of us," Ms. Terracciano said. "That's exactly how I wanted it to be."
They were married Dec. 14.
A Reminder of Home
The engagement of Errol Barnett and Ariana Tolbert was a reflection of their multinational heritage.
Mr. Barnett, an anchor/correspondent for CBS News in New York who was born in England and is of Jamaican descent, proposed to Ms. Tolbert, whose mother is from France, in the Versailles Gardens and French Cloister in the Bahamas in December 2017. The two took their engagement photos above Great Falls Park on the Potomac River outside Washington.
"Our journey together is only just beginning," Mr. Barnett said. "So far it has all been so very exciting,"
They were married May 18.
Embassy Sweet
In October 2016, Danielle Daitch and Joshua DeLott took a weekend trip to Washington to visit their friend, Travis Gidado, who was interning at the White House. After a Saturday brunch, Mr. Gidado asked if the couple could drive him to the Chinese Embassy to retrieve a visa for his upcoming trip to Beijing. He asked Ms. Daitch to hold an envelope with what he said were important papers related to his trip.
Unbeknown to Ms. Daitch, the Israeli Embassy was directly across from the Chinese Embassy, and when she and Mr. DeLott, now on foot, were square in the middle of both, Mr. DeLott dropped to one knee, and facing both her and the Israeli Embassy, asked for her hand in marriage.
"The papers I was told to hold was actually a beautiful letter from Josh telling me all the reasons he wanted to marry me," Ms. Daitch said. "I was definitely caught off guard."
They were married March 30.

A Puzzling Proposal
Nearly two years ago, Amanda Yesnowitz, a crossword puzzle constructor, said to her longtime boyfriend, Brendan McGrady: "If you wish to get married you will need to be the one to ask and the proposal must be clever."
On Sept. 2, 2019, Mr. McGrady proposed to Ms. Yesnowitz in a New York Times crossword puzzle at a tournament in Pleasantville, N.Y., hosted by Will Shortz, the crossword editor.
Mr. McGrady, an actor, had been working on his proposal for months with the help of Mr. Shortz.
Ms. Yesnowitz was clueless.
"I was shocked and confused because going to that tournament was my idea," she said. "I guess Brendan was taking notes when I asked for a clever proposal."
They were married Dec. 16.
The Art of Proposing
After a couple of years together, Andrew Ogletree, an antiques dealer, decided to propose to William Long, who works for a financial services company. Under the guise of one of Mr. Ogletree's clients donating an important piece of art, Mr. Ogletree invited Mr. Long to a private unveiling on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. When the weather refused to cooperate, a quick relocation to the mezzanine of the Roman Galleries was arranged.
While distracting Mr. Long by pointing to a piece in the gallery that had sold at Sotheby's, Mr. Ogletree reached into his pocket, grabbed a monogrammed signet ring and asked Mr. Long to marry him.
"It was especially wonderful to be in the precinct of the Temple of Dendur by ourselves because it was there that we met at the 600th Anniversary celebration of St. Andrews University, our alma mater, in December 2014," Mr. Ogletree said. "We had a blast."
They were married June 1.
A Proposal and a Counterproposal
Katherine Rhodes picked up Claire Pires on Jan. 12, 2018 at the train station in Rhinebeck, N.Y., and they went out to dinner. Later, Ms. Rhodes nervously drove Ms. Pires to the same cabin in the Hudson Valley where the couple first said "I love you" to each other.
Ms. Pires entered the cabin to find dozens of photos of her and Ms. Rhodes hung on the walls, and roses everywhere.
"It was amazing," said Ms. Pires, who made a counterproposal on April 14, 2018 at their Brooklyn home. She surprised Ms. Rhodes with flowers, dinner and wine -- along with clues that led Ms. Rhodes to their roof, where Ms. Pires, on one knee and with the Manhattan Bridge in the distance behind her, asked, "Will you marry me, also?"
They were married April 6.

Recess benefits kids - don't cut it

Texto completo: My daughter is a second-grader at Harriet Beecher Stowe school in Brunswick. She is bright, funny, active and high energy.
When I learned that they are currently "prepping" second-graders to be ready for a single recess in third grade, I couldn't figure out what exactly I was hearing. Seven- and 7-1/2-year-olds only getting a single recess is absolutely shocking to me. I still remember being a kid and getting a 15-minute recess in the morning, a half hour after lunch and another 15 minutes in the afternoon.
As more and more research piles up demonstrating the importance of play and physical activity in children, the choice of school districts to cage them inside the building instead of helping them develop by allowing them to get that energy out is troubling. In fact, it was because of her being unable to sit still that I asked if she'd had indoor recess that day. She then informed me that she would be getting one recess to help prepare for third grade.
A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics in 2009 found that students with more recess time have far fewer behavioral issues than those with very little.
"Ironically, minimizing or eliminating recess may be counterproductive to academic achievement, as a growing body of evidence suggests that recess promotes not only physical health and social development but also cognitive performance," the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on School Health declared in 2013.
Don't blame the teachers. This is handed down to them from the school administration.

We don't need torture as shield from terrorism
I recently watched Amazon's "The Report." While Adam Driver's portrayal of Senate Select Intelligence Committee staffer Daniel Jones is nothing short of compelling, what really stuck with me from the movie was utter shame in my home country.
The film details the extensive FBI investigation of CIA torture methods forced on suspected terrorists within black sites, beginning in 2002. After personally researching the cruel treatment used, including waterboarding, sleep deprivation, sodomy, hypothermia and isolation, I found myself sobbing in front of my laptop. In other words, I cried for suspected terrorists.
What caused my response? Perhaps it's my differing outlook on and relationship with foreign threats than the preceding generation. As a 20-year-old American who was barely a toddler during the 9/11 attacks, I simply don't feel the same passion for national security that I'm sure my elder counterparts do.
Whether my visceral response can be chalked up to my youth or Amazon's production skills, this moral dilemma poses a delicate rift in public opinion on human rights. I now feel conflicted between pride in my nationality and commiseration with these prisoners (not to mention frustration in what little information is even available on the matter).
I hate terrorism. But I also hate torture. I'd like to think I needn't choose one or the other.

Illegal immigration's impact on blacks ignored
A recent New York Times story, "After ICE raids, a reckoning in Mississippi chicken country" (Dec. 28), reports that when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids removed hundreds of illegal immigrants last summer from the Koch Foods plant in Morton, Mississippi, blacks got the jobs.
No surprise. Whenever ICE raids have happened at chicken plants, slaughterhouses, etc., blacks got the jobs, the wages often increased and unions organized. Check out stories on Crider Poultry, Howard Industries, Smithfield, etc.
But mainstream media aren't reporting this history; instead, they focus on the immediate hardship for the illegal workers who lost their jobs.
The New York Times journalist framed the Mississippi story as presenting an "ethical" dilemma, expressing empathy for both blacks and Hispanics. Since well-educated journalists do not compete with illegal immigrants for their job, it's not surprising he could afford empathy for both sides. His job wasn't threatened!
But he missed the big issue: Why weren't blacks hired before the raids? A structural racism problem was staring him in the face, which usually provokes considerable coverage from The New York Times, but he missed it!

Vegan appreciates ideas for more meatless meals
I have been a vegetarian for 29 years and went vegan last July.
It is often a lonely trek but the right one for me.
I want to thank you for last Sunday's paper. We have a subscription and read meat-based recipes all the time and feel isolated.
Now MDH and I are excited to try the recipes in last week's edition ("Green Plate Special: Bean there, done that," Page F2; "Warm up your winter nights with this bean and barley chili," Page F3; "Jicama brings refreshing flavor to hearty bean soup, salad," Page F3).

Trump trial erodes ideals upheld by 'Mockingbird'
For most of the years since it was published in 1960, Harper Lee's "To Kill A Mockingbird" has been voted America's favorite novel, and its main character, Atticus Finch, has been the perennial leader in America's "greatest film hero" lists.
The novel's climax occurs when the 1930s all-white jury from Alabama convicts Atticus' innocent client, Tom Robinson, a Negro (as African Americans were then called), against all justifiable reason but in accordance with their prejudiced views.
Most telling was the utter pretense of the trial's fairness, regardless of the efforts of some courageous individuals. The outcome was predetermined by the jurors' petty-minded loyalty to an identity group.
Despite Lee's damning portrayal of a miscarriage of justice, the continued popularity of the novel and its hero leads me to think that we Americans recognize good literature, the need for justice and the value of people with integrity.
I can't help but think of this when I anticipate the impending impeachment trial of President Trump in the U.S. Senate. Of course, here we have a reversal of sorts, but still a jury looking very much like the one Atticus and Tom faced nearly 100 years ago. The difference, apart from a few gender and race additions, is that now most of the "jury" has pledged beforehand to find the defendant not guilty. Again, evidence be damned. And again, we have a travesty of what our Founders had considered among the crown jewels of their constitutional achievements - a fair and impartial trial by a jury of one's peers.

Texto completo: The political consultant Rick Wilson does not like President Donald Trump. Mr. Wilson, like many others, has turned this stance into something of a second career. His first book, "Everything Trump Touches Dies," was published in advance of the midterm elections in 2018, and it reached No. 1 on The New York Times nonfiction bestseller list.
Unsurprisingly, he has a new book out for the 2020 election. The book is "Running Against the Devil: A Plot to Save America From Trump - and Democrats From Themselves," and it fits tidily into the ever-expanding class of nonfiction written by commentators who spend the bulk of their intellectual life either on TV or Twitter (short chapters, unsourced claims, off-color jokes, name-calling, so on).
There is, I think, a deeper reading of why Mr. Wilson is writing these anti-Trump books, but on the surface, he is genuinely incensed by the presence of Donald Trump in the White House. A longtime Republican strategist, he now fashions himself as a man-without-a-party desperado who has flipped sides "because the party I worked for, fought for, and sweated over for thirty years didn't just abandon people like me who couldn't stomach Trump; they're putting the entire American experience at risk."
The book's audience is nominally liberal Democrats unwilling to confront the unsavory realities of electoral politics. Mr. Wilson advertises himself as both a tour guide for the harsh world of presidential campaigns and also as a former architect of the "organized system for creating . weaponized outrages." His perspective does produce stray moments of sound advice. When it comes to the 2020 presidential campaign, he advises Democrats to avoid using the word socialism, which plays right into the Republicans' hands and "has a horrible branding problem."
He also advises Democrats to completely abandon evangelicals. The "God squad," as Mr. Wilson calls them, now live and operate within "an intolerant society separate from the rest of the United States."
One of the dirtier tricks he brainstorms is funding a fake third-party candidate, a kind of mega-MAGA candidate that could potentially siphon off 2-3% of Mr. Trump's base. This struck me as both extremely dangerous and mathematically wise.
So, on the surface, there's some worthwhile advice in "Running Against the Devil." But I confess that, part way through, Mr. Wilson's style began to read shockingly, almost freakishly similar to President Trump's. Fear-mongering has been a key tool for Mr. Trump in matters like the border wall, and fear-mongering is essential to "Running Against the Devil." Mr. Wilson can barely go a paragraph without reminding readers that a second Trump term could be right around the corner. One paragraph ends thusly: "And the first term was just a preview." For emphasis, he ends the next paragraph with another reminder: "In the second [term], all the political restraints are off."
Like President Trump, Mr. Wilson is eager to cue up insults about appearance and intellect: "Trump isn't Hitler. Hitler had normal-sized hands and the ability to concentrate for more than thirty seconds."
Mr. Wilson even relies on crass mimicry in the same way that the president does. Mr. Wilson may claim to be aghast at the president's impersonation of a reporter with a disability, yet Mr. Wilson strings along an entire comedic bit between chapters called "White House Diaries: Melania Trump." In these fictionalized entries, he conveys the first lady's inner monologue via broken English (all sic):
"I am hatings him."
Later: "Please gods, don't lets him be reelect."
These fake dairies are "how-did-this-get-published" bad. The worst assessment I can assign them is that they're Trumpian in their mean spiritedness.
It's no wonder a figure such as Mr. Trump ascended within a political party constructed by strategists such as Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson regularly outlines how he once injected fear and bigotry into the subtext of political speeches and advertisements, yet amazingly, he's shocked that a pol would seize the needle themselves and shoot discord into every vein of American society.
A generous reading is that there's shame beneath all of Mr. Wilson's Trump-directed anger. I can't help but also read a touch of jealousy - Mr. Trump has essentially sent strategists such as Mr. Wilson into early retirement. He has turned their subtextual magic into a more explicit, in-your-face enterprise. The surface of Mr. Wilson's book certainly concerns how to defeat the man he calls a devil, but I found myself wondering: Does Mr. Wilson truly want to save democracy, or does he merely want to relocate the devil's horns back onto his own strategy-obsessed head?

THE POOR, THE PRIVILEGED AND THE PARADOX OF HIGHER EDUCATION

Texto completo: KiKi Gilbert is black woman, raised by a single mother, who lived in seven states and attended more than a dozen schools by the time she was 17 years old. As Ms. Gilbert began to write the personal essay for her college applications, she realized that her story of living with six people in a shabby motel room throughout her sophomore year in high school - a homeless teen who made good - might appeal to people who granted admission and awarded scholarships. A source of sadness and pride, Paul Tough tells us, "the worst year of her life had become a commodity."
When she got to Princeton, a place where students shared their achievements - not their pain - with one another, and most African American undergraduates were not poor, that commodity "felt like a liability, not an asset." That said, Ms. Gilbert got As on all her essays in freshman Humanities and decided to major in philosophy.
Ms. Gilbert's success, Mr. Tough reminds us, is by no means the norm. In "The Years That Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us," the author, a contributor to The New York Times Magazine, draws on interviews with dozens of students, faculty and administrators, visits to a wide range of campuses, and the latest studies of admissions and graduation rates to provide a fascinating analysis of the impact of higher education on young Americans, especially low-income and first generation students. "The Years That Matter Most" is a lively, lucid, often eye-opening deep-dive into the causes and consequences of the demographic disparities in our colleges and universities - and how they might best be addressed.
At a time in which about 40% of young adults believe that an undergraduate degree is not worth the cost, Mr. Tough demonstrates that the wage gap between college graduates and those without a degree is as high in the United States as it has ever been. Moreover, graduates of highly selective colleges earn on average more than $2 million more than graduates of nonselective colleges with similar academic profiles. The bonus is even greater for graduates of elite colleges.
But the number of students from economically disadvantaged families attending these colleges is small. Using data supplied by the IRS, a group of researchers found that every selective college has a disproportionate number of undergraduates from families with income at the top of the economic pyramid, with many enrolling more from the top 1% than the bottom 60%. In the Ivy Plus colleges, more than two-thirds of students grew up rich, while fewer than 4% were poor. Elite colleges remain willing to put a thumb - or two - on the scales for "legacy" applicants, i.e. the children of alumni.
Many institutions have increased offers of "merit aid," to induce wealthy students to enroll. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Mr. Tough points out, colleges in the United States collectively give more financial assistance to students with family incomes over $100,000 than to students with family incomes under $20,000.
Perhaps even more surprising is the compelling case the author makes that the pool of highly qualified high school graduates from poor families is quite large. One study found that each year about 30,000 individuals from this cohort had grade point averages of A minus or above and SAT or ACT scores in the top 10 percent of test-takers.
Many of them, alas, are not applying, let alone getting accepted, to selective schools. Mr. Tough blames the colleges for failing to recruit them. Although administrators claim they want a more racially and economically diverse student body, he suggests, they actually prefer the increased revenue that accompanies traditional enrollment management - and the positive impact on rankings from publications that put a lot of weight on standardized test scores (which correlate directly and dramatically with family income and do not measure aptitude).
After assessing the encouraging results at the University of Texas and several standardized test-optional schools, Mr. Tough proposes that admission be based on an applicant's high school curriculum and grades. Given the great and growing importance of a college degree, this approach, if accompanied by a commitment to promote a sense of belonging for all students on each campus, may be well worth trying.

CANDIDATES DREAM BIG IN NEW HAMPSHIRE LONG-SHOTS LIKE BILL WELD AND ANDREW YANG TRY TO LEAVE THEIR MARK

Texto completo: BRETTON WOODS, N.H.
New Hampshire is for dreamers.
Darby Field was a dreamer when he became the first white man to ascend to the top of Mount Washington, the highest peak in the White Mountains and the backdrop of this town that played host to the famous 1944 financial summit that established the International Monetary Fund. Nathaniel Hawthorne was a dreamer when he took the tragic story of a family destroyed in the Willey Slide of 1826 only miles from here and transformed it into one of his twice-told tales, the "Ambitious Guest," which he published nine years later.
Since then there have been many ambitious guests - Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado in 1984, former Sen. Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts in 1992, Patrick J. Buchanan in 1996 - who also were big dreamers, and these three dreamers actually won the primary here.
Now ambitious guests in these hills are dreaming again.
They are presidential candidates with small prospects but big hopes. One is a former Republican governor of Massachusetts who is taking on the quixotic task of challenging President Donald J. Trump in his own party. A second is a businessman who counters Mr. Trump's MAGA theme ("Make America Great Again") with his own MATH theme ("Make America Think Harder").
And a third is an Army National Guard veteran who served in Iraq and Kuwait and has plastered billboards all over the state - a highway presence greater than any other candidate - displaying her picture and bearing simply three enigmatic words: "A soldier's heart." Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who did not make the cut for the September or December Democratic debates, won the support of 1% in the CBS News Poll of likely voters in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary released last Sunday.
Former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts has little chance of defeating Mr. Trump - himself something of a dreamer when he began his White House quest - in the Feb. 11 Republican primary that is attracting little attention even here. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, competing in the Democratic primary, has yeasty hopes and imaginative proposals and maybe has a better chance of attracting attention, and perhaps voters, including the independents who can take a ballot in either party's contest. He's been in all six 2019 debates and raised eyebrows here by raising $16.5 million in the last three months.
I viewed these two quixotic candidates at campaign events 62 miles apart on snow-encrusted roads in a single day recently and found several similarities:
Strong opposition to Mr. Trump. Grave concerns about the direction of the new Republican Party. A reliance on commonsense arguments to win supporters. Articulate rationales for their candidacies. And the likelihood of making a point but not necessarily a difference in the 2020 campaign.
Listen to Mr. Weld on the president, from an interview last week: "Mr. Trump doesn't have any knowledge base." Here is Mr. Weld, who ran as the vice presidential nominee on the Libertarian ticket in 2016: "Each party needs the other to scare their base so they can get re-elected." And on the national mood he has sensed: "All around the country people are exhausted. They don't want to talk about Trump. They don't want me to stand up in front of them and tell them what a jerk Trump is."
Now listen to Yang, from his rally in the back banquet room of the vintage Governor's Inn in Rochester, N.H., on the new economy: "We have to rewrite the rules of the 21st century to work for you and your kids, because it's not doing that now." Here is his message to younger voters: "If you are a young person and feel like we've left you a mess, I apologize, because we have." And here, on the effect he thinks his plan to give every American $1,000 every month will have: "the trickle-up economy." (His idea is an echo from an unlikely source: the Nixon administration's Family Assistance Plan that passed in the House in both 1970 and 1971 but died in the Senate Finance Committee.)
Mr. Weld is an indefatigable campaigner who at 74 still can endure a campaign lunch stop at the senior lunch program in North Conway, where the other day he downed a plate of Salisbury steak, mashed potatoes, corn and Caesar salad. Not that his message is all that welcome in Republican circles. "I'm against him," local real-estate broker Steven Steiner, told me. "Everything he'd do would ruin the economy."
There remains little taste inside the Republican Party for a challenge to the president. "The Republicans who make a living hating Trump hated him before he was elected," Scott Jennings, a former aide to George W. Bush and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, wrote in the Los Angeles Times earlier this month. "The rest of the party remains solidly behind him."
Not so in the Democratic Party, where Mr. Yang hopes for a Granite State breakthrough. "I've never seen another guy who can get people who voted for Donald Trump to support him," said former Mayor Steve Marchand of Portsmouth, on the New Hampshire seacoast at the border with Maine.
Some 36 years ago, one of the New Hampshire primary's biggest dreamers, Gary Hart, operated below the radar both here and in Iowa, which holds its precinct caucuses eight days before voters go the polls in New Hampshire. He gave speeches in remote locations, mobilized a core of activists to build a political organization and surprised a political establishment that bought the notion, published in The New York Times just before balloting here, that no candidate in years had assembled a formidable campaign operation to match that of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who had won the Iowa caucuses.
Hours later Mr. Hart won the New Hampshire primary. But four days earlier, he dressed in a black-and-white lumberjack's shirt and joined a woodmens' competition in Milan, N.H., a faraway North Country hamlet with a population less than 1,200. He picked up a 2-pound, two-edged ax and hurled it at a wooden target. It was a bullseye - and a metaphor for what Mr. Weld and Mr. Yang are seeking: a direct hit on an established target from an unlikely source.
You may say that Mr. Hart was a dreamer, to paraphrase the great political scientist John Lennon. But he's not the only one.

Texto completo: Welcome to State Street, an iconic thoroughfare in the heart of America's walking city. Please enjoy the faded crosswalks, the three lanes seemingly always jammed with cars and trucks, and beaten down sidewalks that are so narrow in places that pedestrians dodge each other during rush hour.
It's not a great look for one of the most popular streets for tourists in Boston, bordering busy Faneuil Hall and linking the Old State House and Orange Line to the Rose Kennedy Greenway and the New England Aquarium.
Nor is it particularly pleasant for the thousands of commuters who work in the office buildings that line the street (including, it should be noted, those at the Globe). In November, an 86-year-old pedestrian suffered life-threatening injuries when she was struck by a vehicle at a State Street intersection.
So the Boston Public Works Department is considering a significant revamp of the road in the near future. Although the plans are still in the early stages, officials say there's one primary goal: to make State Street much better for walking. That's not just a matter of urban idealism: State Street is overwhelmingly used by pedestrians, with more than 29,000 each day compared with about 10,700 cars and trucks.
“We want to make sure the roadway has a better balance for the people who are actually using it," said Ashley Biggins, a city engineer. “We want to make sure pedestrians don't feel like second-class citizens when they're the majority of roadway users."
The city is circulating a survey online that shows some of the potential options for the road: wider sidewalks, bike lanes, better crosswalks, public art and landscaping, and more seating for dining or just leisure.
And then there is the most provocative suggestion the city put out: banning cars from the road altogether, which is used as a major access point for commercial traffic heading into downtown. It's unclear how serious that option is; for now, Biggins said, the city is only gathering feedback. But officials hope to finish a redesign of State Street this year and begin work in 2021.
If they're not shut out entirely, drivers could also benefit from the changes. State Street is the site of near-constant double parking by delivery trucks and ride-hail drivers. Biggins said there have been early discussions in City Hall about potentially using State Street as a testing ground for new parking rules as part of a national pilot program the city was selected for last year, meant to better manage curb space to cut down on congestion.
Going off-track
The MBTA returned one of two new Orange Line cars to service on Tuesday, saying it solved a structural issue that had taken it off the rails for two months. The second six-car train should join it before the end of January.
While officials insisted it was normal for new trains to encounter problems as they enter service, the removal of the Orange Line trains alarmed frustrated commuters who have long awaited them.
So imagine the feelings in New York, another city with a worn-out subway and palpable commuter frustration, after nearly 300 recently-delivered new cars were suddenly pulled from service last week.
The issue, according to The New York Times, was a concern that doors could open while trains were moving. Actually, that sounds familiar: the T's new Orange Line cars were briefly taken out of service last year to fix the doors.
Boston is, of course, a tiny hamlet compared with New York, and the 300 cars pulled off the subway there are a fraction of its 6,000-car fleet.
The Big Apple's trains were built by Canadian industrial giant Bombardier. This latest issue isn't the first for the new fleet: the delivery was delayed, several cars were pulled from service for software issues last year, and New York's comptroller issued a harsh report faulting the Metropolitan Transit Authority for not managing the contract well, according to the Times.
In Boston, the 404 new cars slated to join the Orange and Red lines over the next few years are being assembled by the Chinese company CRRC at a Springfield factory. The T has put a silver lining on its problems with the Orange Line cars, arguing that it's better to catch issues early in the delivery, so fixes can be incorporated as the rest of the fleet is being built.
More weekend shutdowns
Meanwhile, that new Orange Line train won't be around much on weekends this winter — nor will many other trains on the line, for that matter.
The T will shutter train service between Sullivan Square and Tufts Medical Center stations almost every weekend through Feb. 16, starting next week. (One exception: the line will continue to operate the weekend of Jan. 31-Feb. 2.)
Shuttle buses will run along the closed portion of the line during this period, though they won't stop at Downtown Crossing, State Street, or Chinatown. Instead, the T says riders trying to arrive at those stops should instead travel from Haymarket or North Station to nearby Green Line stations.
The shutdowns will start Friday nights at 8:45 p.m., with service resuming Monday mornings.
The T will use the weekends to quickly replace more than 1,000 feet of track, mostly around North Station, and complete other work elsewhere along the line.
With commuters desperate for improvement, the T has said it is better to take on the work in sprints, rather than spread it out over longer periods of time; the agency hasn't ruled out potential shutdowns during the week.
The Red Line is also scheduled for shutdowns between Harvard and Alewife most weekends through April to continue work on the line's track bed.
Both the Red and Orange lines had similar weekend track work in late 2019.
Once the trains return, officials are warning they will likely run slower for a short period because of speed restrictions in place to allow the new track to settle — an inconvenience commuters faced after the fall shutdowns, too.

CAMPAIGN 2020: IT'S ALL OVER SAVE FOR THE FACEBOOK POSTURING

Texto completo: These annoying calendars keep insisting it's 2020, the year I said I'd finally start paying attention to the race for the White House, but as usual, I'm already too late.
It's over and Trump won, according to Facebook, which as you know, is the only thing that matters in 21st century America, even if Facebook has to say so itself.
Maybe this escaped you early in the week, but an internal Facebook memo first published in The New York Times and generated by one Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook VP, concluded that Facebook was probably responsible for President Donald Trump getting elected in 2016 and that the Trump campaign's singularly effective use of Facebook's advertising platforms, "may very well lead to the same result" in 2020.
Mr. Bosworth apparently takes no joy in knowing this, much less saying it.
"As a committed liberal I find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result," Mr. Bosworth wrote in the memo, in which he cautioned against pulling any levers. "As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear."
Again, too late. You've become an entity that can change history with the bump of an algorithm. Fear it now.
But just for the hell of it, as if it still matters, let's in the space remaining try to situate ourselves in the election process, take a look back to see how we got to a place where Facebook is running the culture, the country, and much of the world, and look boldly forward to oblivion.
C'mon, it'll be fun.
It is 297 days until the election. It is three days until the final Democratic debate before the Iowa caucuses. It is always approximately eight minutes before Mr. Trump tweets something intemperate about one of those potential opponents. It is 23 days until those Iowa caucuses, 31 days until the New Hampshire primary, 52 days until Super Tuesday (when there are 16 primaries), 108 days until the always-too-late Pennsylvania primary, 184 days until the severely anticlimactic Democratic National Convention, and 226 days until the even less climactic Republican National Convention, unless you enjoy playing Finger the Future Felon from the lineup of Trump operatives. No fair picking the president because there's just no telling how many times he'll be totally exonerated again between here and there.
When all of that ends, the real dirt will start to come out.
Now let's look back to Feb. 4, 2004, just 15 years ago this winter, when, from his Harvard dorm room, Mark Zuckerberg and his cohorts at the school for really, really smart kids launched Facebook in its initial contrivance. As explained by one of his buddies, Arie Hasit, to an Israeli publication in 2009, Facebook started because "We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was 'hotter' and, according to the votes, there would be a ranking."
Really, really smart kids.
You might find it offensive that a comingling of sophomoric banalities would, in 15 years, turn into a force that could turn democracy on its head, but how do you think the producers of "Are You Hot?" feel?
Don't remember the TV show "Are You Hot?"
Maybe because it lasted only a year, but using the same hormone-heated paradigm, how did it fail? On "Are You Hot, the Search for America's Sexiest People" Americans willing to put their perceived hotness before a panel of judges including Lorenzo Lamas did so with relish. Even in a country growing dumber by the minute, America somehow wasn't having "Are You Hot?" but a year later, it was ready for Facebook.
By the way, if you remember that the lone "Are You Hot?" winner was New Orleans actress Chantille Boudousque, that probably doesn't mean you should try out for "Jeopardy!" The show's main contribution to the culture was that it inspired a "Saturday Night Live" spinoff on which the hotness of Betty Boop was assessed against that of Yosemite Sam. How could I make that up?
OK, back to the future. This week Facebook officially decided not to limit how political ads can be targeted (as Google has, and Twitter banned them altogether). Also, Facebook won't be fact-checking them.
This comes less than three months after Mr. Zuckerberg dined with Mr. Trump in Washington, after which Mr. Zuckerberg insisted that he was not lobbied by the president to stick to his policy. If you've forgotten Facebook's policy, it's that anybody can say anything on this platform and do anything on Facebook Live including live stream the slaughter of 51 people in two New Zealand mosques, and if Facebook isn't totally fine with it, some remedies will be discussed, but they probably won't be very effective.
To be fair, Facebook has made some modifications. First-time offenders of its stricter protocols on Facebook Live can now be suspended.
Oooh.
So as we wade into the 2020 campaign, remember, it's not about democracy, leadership, statesmanship, vision, courage, management, character, intelligence, empathy, resilience, discipline and self-control - this isn't even about politics anymore.
It's about who, inside or outside the USA, can best manipulate Facebook.
God Bless America.

Texto completo: Soup hits the spot when it's cold outside, and it's kind to the cook because you can throw it together with whatever you have in your fridge or pantry. This one features cannellini beans - a creamy, nutty variety often used in Italian dishes - along with crumbled Italian sausage and a big handful of healthful greens.
I used a mix of Tuscan and curly kale, but you could substitute spinach, collards or Swiss chard. Harissa, a hot chili pepper paste, adds a beautiful reddish orange hue, but it's spicy so you may want to taste as you go.
For an even heartier meal, top this soup with a fried egg.
1 large bunch kale, thick stems separated from the leaves
¼ cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 medium red or yellow onion, thinly sliced
Kosher salt and black pepper
1 pound Italian sausage, removed from casings
2-3 tablespoons harissa or tomato paste
Red pepper flakes (optional)
3 (15-ounce) cans large white beans such as cannellini, butter or great Northern, drained and rinsed
4 cups vegetable or chicken broth, or more to taste
1 preserved lemon, thinly sliced, or 1 lemon, halved, for squeezing
2 ounces feta or other salty cheese such as pecorino, crumbled
1 cup parsley or cilantro leaves and tender stems
Tear kale leaves into bite-size pieces and set aside. Chop stems into about ¼-inch pieces; set aside.
Heat ¼ cup olive oil in large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion, and season with salt and pepper.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and sizzled at the edges, 4-6 minutes. Add sausage and cook, breaking into pieces with a spoon. Continue cooking until sausage has browned, about 5 minutes.
Add harissa (or tomato paste and a pinch of red pepper flakes). Stir to coat in oil. Cook until harissa is brick red, sugars start to caramelize and oil turns a fiery orange color, about 2 minutes.
Add beans and season with salt and pepper. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, crush a few beans to reveal their creamy interior.
Add broth and reserved stems, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until it reaches desired consistency, 15-20 minutes.
Add kale leaves and preserved lemon or lemon juice. Stir to wilt the greens. Season with salt, pepper and more red pepper flakes if you want it spicier.
Serve with feta and parsley.
Serves 6-8.

Texto completo: The '80s figure prominently in several new books coming out this year. "Cool Town" by Grace Elizabeth Hale explores the Athens music scene from that era. Carter Sickels' novel takes us back to the height of the AIDS crisis. And Natasha Trethewey's memoir "Memorial Drive" returns to that fateful day in June 1985 when her mother was murdered. All three books landed on our list of 10 Southern books we look forward to reading this year.
'You Were There Too'
Most newlyweds can't begin to comprehend the enormity of "till death do us part." Mia is convinced she is happily married to Harrison, with whom she shares a new home in small-town Pennsylvania and a desire to start a family. So why does the same unknown man keep appearing in her dreams, and who is he? Things really get weird when she encounters the man in her waking life and discovers she's been appearing in his dreams too. These strange events prompt Mia to ponder what her life might be like if she had followed a different path. Atlanta author Colleen Oakley explores the mysterious world of dreams and the true meaning of happily ever after in her third novel. (Berkley Trade Paperback, out now)
'Race Man'
The San Francisco publishing
house that produced books by Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and Jack Kerouac gives us this complete collection of writings by the late Julian Bond. A compilation of speeches, interviews and articles for publications such as Ebony and The Washington Post, the book spans the Georgia congressman's career as a civil and human rights leader from his undergraduate days at Morehouse College, where he was a founding member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, until the end of his life, when he championed gay marriage. Topics include his opposition to Jimmy Carter and Clarence Thomas, the bitter end to his friendship with John Lewis, and homophobia among African Americans. (City Lights Publishers, out now)
'Hitting a Straight Lick with a Crooked Stick'
In addition to her novel "Their Eyes Were Watching God," Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston wrote 21 short stories, and they're all collected here for the first time in a single volume. Many of the stories are set in her hometown of Eatonville, Florida, but -- defying her reputation as a writer solely of rural stories -- several have urban settings and explore the Great Migration, when 6 million African Americans left the South between 1916 and 1970. Filled with her signature sense of humor, effervescent prose and phonetic dialogue, these stories explore all aspects of the human condition. The book includes a foreword by Tayari Jones and an introduction by the book's editor, Texas Woman's University English professor Genevieve West, that provides biographical details about the author's life, context for some of her stories, and insight into the significance of her work. (Amistad, Jan. 14)
'A Good Neighborhood'
Therese Anne Fowler, the New York Times bestselling author of the historical novels "Z:A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald" and "A Well-Behaved Woman," switches genres with this contemporary novel about the personal price of gentrification. The Alston-Holts are an African-American family living in a modest house on a wooded lot in a neighborhood in North Carolina. One day, a similarly modest home on the lot behind them is razed, and an ostentatious new house is constructed that dwarfs the yard. Upon completion, a white family, the Whit-mans, moves in. That's when tensions mount. What transpires between the neighbors has devastating consequences in this examination of what can happen when one person's improvement is another person's displacement. (St. Martin's Press, March 10)
'Race Against Time' Jerry Mitchell was an investigative reporter covering courts in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1988 when the movie "Mississippi Burning" premiered. About the 1964 murders of three civil rights workers, the movie prompted Mitchell to investigate the unsolved killings by members of the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, the case was reopened and prosecuted, as was the murder of NAACP leader Medgar Evers in Jackson and the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four black girls. Written like a crime thriller, "Race Against Time" is Mitchell's own account of uncovering some of the South's deepest, darkest secrets. (Simon & Schuster, Feb. 4)
'So We Can Glow' The girls and women at the center of this collection of 41 short stories by Kentucky author Leesa Cross-Smith come from all walks of life. They are wives, mothers, sisters and daughters. They are cello players, nannies, students and tourists. But they all share the same object of desire: men. Whether driven by love, lust, frustration, fantasy or obsession, the protagonists are fixated on members of the opposite sex. Some stories barely take up two pages, others stretch much longer.Some stories are told in text messages, emails or within the stage directions of a script. Together they paint a multifaceted picture of female desire. (Grand Central, March 23)
'Cool Town' On paper, a professor of American studies and history at the University of Virginia writing a book about the 1980s music scene in Athens and the birth of alternative music sounds more square than cool. But Grace Elizabeth Hale is not your average academic. The author of "Making Whiteness: The Culture of Segregation in the South" was a student at the University of Georgia during the early days of R.E.M., the B-52s and other bands of that era. As a member of the band Cordy Lon with her future husband, David Levitt, she was also part of the scene. Her personal experience as an insider, combined with a scholarly approach to research, results in a fascinating examination of a seminal era in rock history and what made Athens a hotbed of musical creativity. (University of North Carolina Press, March 23)
'The Book of Longings' Sue Monk Kidd, The New York
Times bestselling author of "The Secret Life of Bees," takes a daring leap into historical fiction with her ambitious tale of Ana, the wife of Jesus. With the help of her closest allies, including her friend Tabitha, who is sold into slavery, and Phasaelis, the wife of Herod Antipas, Ana is forced to flee Nazareth for Alexandria just as her husband begins his public ministry. Deeply researched and reverent, "The Book of Longings" explores the importance of women making their voices heard in a time when the powers that be strive to keep them silent. (Penguin Random House, April 28)
'The Prettiest Star' During the height of the AIDS
crisis in the mid-1980s, Brian is forced to leave New York City and return to his home in Appalachia when he's diagnosed with the virus that was a death sentence in those days. Told from multiple viewpoints, Carter Sickels' moving story chronicles a family coming to terms with the impending loss of a loved one and the shame and fear surrounding the disease. (Hub City, April 14)
'Memorial Drive' Pulitzer Prize-winning poet
Natasha Trethewey turns her gift for storytelling to a memoir in this slim, elegant account of her mother's murder and all that transpired after it, including how the author transformed the pain of her loss and a life steeped in racism into words that transcend hatred and violence to uplift others. (HarperCollins, July 28)

Texto completo: ON WEDNESDAY MORNING President Trump delivered a strange and disjointed speech on Iran from which one overarching, and oddly positive, conclusion can be drawn — the United States is stepping away from the brink.
Less than 24 hours earlier, Iran had rained missiles down on US bases in Iraq, in what the country's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, described as a “proportionate" response to the killing of Qassem Solemani, the head of the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Though he decried America's “cowardly armed attack," Zarif made clear “we do not seek escalation or war."
Whatever anger Iran may have felt over Soleimani's killing, the nation's leaders had little apparent appetite for war with a bigger and more powerful opponent.
Neither it seems did President Trump, who declared on Twitter hours after the strike, “all is well!" and “so far, so good," eschewing for the moment the martial and belittling rhetoric that he so often uses toward his enemies.
Indeed, for all his maddening instability when it comes to international affairs, Trump has been consistent about seeking to avoid another Mideast war.
That doesn't mean Iran's mullahs will soon be holding hands with Trump and his coterie of white male advisers singing “Kumbaya." But for now, at least, tensions have subsided.
Still, that a crisis which had so many warning of impending conflict appears for now, at least, to have been defused is not surprising.
What's surprising is that so many people are surprised.
This is how these types of crises virtually always end. Yes, there are exceptions. I'm thinking of Gavrilo Princip, whose murder of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 sparked World War I.
But the countries of Europe wanted war back then. More often than not, both sides in a conflict decide that they have more to gain by peacefully resolving matters than letting them spiral out of control.
Doomsday voices evoked the Iraq War in the 48 hours after US forces killed Soleimani. Others warned of impending, catastrophic cyber attacks. Former national security adviser Susan Rice took to the op-ed pages of the New York Times to suggest, without evidence, that Iranian sleeper cells in the United States could be activated.
But few commentators mentioned a more relevant historical analogy: the Cuban Missile Crisis. Then as now, both sides looked into the abyss, didn't like what they saw, and sought off-ramps (granted, the abyss was a bit deeper in 1962). If one prefers more recent examples, there are plenty to be had.
Four years ago, for example, a Turkish missile shot down a Russian fighter jet after it penetrated Turkish air space. There were fears, then, of a broader conflict. It didn't happen. The same doomsday scenarios are regularly floated when tensions rise between India and Pakistan, along the Straits of Taiwan, or in the DMZ on the Korean Peninsula. In 2018 when President Trump was calling Korean strongman Kim Jung Un “Rocketman," there was talk of nuclear war.
Yet, the outcome in these crises has always been the same. Neither side wants war and so war doesn't happen.
Part of the reason is the benefits of war-fighting have declined so dramatically. Territorial acquisition, which was often the motivation for conflicts in the past, isn't as appealing today, especially when balanced against the likelihood of international isolation. Moreover, with more democracies and higher standards of living around the globe, the domestic political constraints on wars have dramatically increased.
It's not a coincidence that inter-state war, as a phenomenon of international affairs, is an increasingly rare event. Yet, every time a new crisis unfolds, these facts are forgotten and ignored — and the same pundits who sounded the alarm bells the last time there was an international crisis jump on TV and social media to make the same arguments again.
Vigilance, of course, is still essential. Diplomacy might be the rule, but when the exception is war, it must be avoided at all costs.
The fact is, cooler heads usually do prevail, even when one of the leaders involved is Donald Trump. The political, strategic, and even psychological incentives to avoid war are incredibly powerful and all too often underestimated by a public primed to fall under the spell of worst-case scenarios. For all the warnings, over more than seven decades, of World War III, there's a reason it never happened.
Beware the fear-mongers and doomsayers. More often than not, they are wrong.

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein strolled the paparazzi-lined red carpet before the 2013 Academy Awards accompanied by his wife, designer Georgina Chapman.
His films "Silver Linings Playbook" and "Django Unchained" would go on to win Oscars that night, Feb. 24, 2013.
Prosecutors now allege that just a week before his Oscar victories, Weinstein sexually assaulted two women he met during work- related meetings.

That is the narrative Los Angeles County prosecutors will present to a jury -- that Weinstein used his power as a Hollywood titan to lure women to his hotel room, where he sexually assaulted them.
Weinstein has denied any wrongdoing.
Weinstein's trial in a similar case in New York in the coming weeks may give a preview of how he will respond to the charges against him in Los Angeles.
It took L.A. County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey's team two years to build the case against Weinstein, and much is riding on the details of the evidence her investigators collected. So far, prosecutors have released only relatively brief outlines of their case.
"Two years means the investigators and prosecutors have vetted every possible witness and lead. They explore every nook and cranny of these cases. They've thought through all the defense's potential tactics," said Dmitry Gorin, a former sex crimes prosecutor in the district attorney's office. "Time is a valuable asset in an investigation."
But Weinstein's attorneys have known since the fall of 2017, after exposes of his sexual misconduct in the New York Times and New Yorker magazine, that charges could be forthcoming in L.A.
"Weinstein's defense team has been able to scoop up every potential exculpatory shred of information," Gorin said.
Gorin and other legal experts said Lacey and her prosecutors must re-create events from seven years ago as best they can.
With little or no physical evidence, it will come down to the testimony of Weinstein's accusers and others who may have been involved in any incidents or were around the mogul at the time, Gorin said.
Former L.A. County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said corroboration in cases involving sex crimes can come in many different forms, not just from witnesses. Prosecutors are expected to have other accusers testify against Weinstein, relaying their own allegations against the former producer.
Prosecutors in other sexual assault cases in L.A. have used "supporting witnesses," such as at the trial of a Pasadena track coach accused of molesting students and in the case of celebrity fashion designer Anand Jon Alexander.
Alexander was convicted of sexually assaulting seven women in 2008. Among the witnesses who testified against the designer were six women whose cases did not result in criminal charges against him.
"In the Weinstein case, there's no question of the identity of the alleged perpetrator. Is there some corroboration of the elements of the offense as alleged by the victim?" Cooley said. "In a sex crimes case, there are provisions that allow one form of corroboration that can be provided by others who have been similarly victimized, allegedly to show intent, pattern, knowledge and to prove those elements."
Cooley said additional victims who testified in the trial of Bill Cosby were the reason the comedian and TV star was convicted.
"The Bill Cosby case bears remarkable similarities. That put that case over the top, other victim evidence. One woman alleged it, there wasn't a lot of corroboration, but there was substantial other victim testimony that showed his motive and intent," Cooley said.
Weinstein has been charged with four counts of sexual assault in L.A. County stemming from accusations by two women who say the mogul attacked them in hotels in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills in 2013.
Neither of the accusers has been identified publicly. One is a former model and actress who described being assaulted by Weinstein in an interview with The Times in 2017.
She said the incident took place at Mr. C Beverly Hills hotel in February 2013 after she spoke to Weinstein briefly at the Los Angeles Italia Film, Fashion and Art Fest. Weinstein "became very aggressive and demanding" in her hotel room while asking her to disrobe, the woman told The Times.
The woman said she showed Weinstein pictures of her children and begged him to stop.
"He grabbed me by the hair and forced me to do something I did not want to do," she said.
In a motion asking a judge to set Weinstein's bail at $5 million, L.A. County prosecutors said the woman did not immediately report the assault to police because Weinstein threatened to kill her. She did report the attack to three close confidants in 2013, however, including her priest, law enforcement sources previously told The Times.
Just days later, the second accuser said she had a business meeting with Weinstein and another woman at a hotel in West Los Angeles when he convinced them to visit his hotel suite, according to the bail motion. Once upstairs, the victim "unwittingly" followed Weinstein into a bathroom and the other woman closed the door, trapping her inside, court records show.
At that point, Weinstein disrobed and showered briefly before undressing her, according to the motion. Prosecutors accused Weinstein of groping the woman while masturbating, court records show.
Weinstein attorney Donna Rotunno has yet to address the L.A. charges amid jury selection in New York, where Weinstein faces four charges involving two women. But the lawyer has said recently that Weinstein has been made a scapegoat and that there is a celebrity status in accusing him.
"In this great country, you are innocent till proven guilty, and no evidence has yet been presented to a court or jury," she said. "The government doesn't want our side to have a voice. I think they believe their side of the story is the only one that matters and only one that counts."
Legal experts say the defense will seek to plant seeds of doubt about the victims' stories and use memory experts to question their accounts, noting their failure to report their experiences to anyone or otherwise document their allegations until the movie mogul was a publicly wounded man with a plethora of accusers.
"If he is such a monster, why did these alleged victims not report this when it happened, and if they told others, why did they sit on the information too?" said Louis Shapiro, a criminal defense attorney in L.A.
Shapiro said Weinstein's legal team is also likely to frame his accusers as chasing fame and fortune that has otherwise eluded them in Hollywood, "individuals looking for their 15 minutes and more."
One of the two has retained a well-respected civil lawyer known for obtaining large payouts for plaintiffs in sex cases. "If they have lawyers, the motive of an opportunity is going to be front and center in the defense, and jurors are going to hear evidence to suggest it is a shakedown," Shapiro said.
It's unclear whether prosecutors will introduce one other element of that 2013 Oscars season. While announcing the nominees for supporting actress, comedian Seth MacFarlane said: "Congratulations. You five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein."
The line won laughs. In 2017, MacFarlane said he made the joke because a friend had told him that Weinstein had made sexual advances on her.

Texto completo: The Trump administration's recent drone strike killing Iran's Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani raises old and new questions about the president's authority to use military force. The president's war powers derive from norms, laws and the Constitution, but there are many gray areas shrouded in misperceptions. Here are five.
Myth No. 1 Presidents can do whatever they want. In 1973, historian Arthur Schlesinger cautioned against the 'unprecedented centralization of decisions over war and peace' in what he called an 'imperial presidency.' My Lawfare colleague Jack Goldsmith similarly says that for better or worse, our system of war powers has evolved so that, in practice, 'one person decides': the president. Successive administrations have claimed broad prerogatives to protect Americans and advance national interests.
But this authority is not (yet) unbounded. Executive branch lawyers acknowledge that uses of force must be 'limited in their nature, scope, and duration' so as to fall below, and avoid escalating into, large-scale wars of the sort that Congress must authorize under the Constitution's 'declare War' clause. Moreover, this authority exists only 'insofar as Congress has not specifically restricted it,' as stated in the 2011 Justice Department memo outlining the Obama administration's view on use of force in Libya " implying that Congress can impose at least some limits, as it did with the 1973 War Powers Resolution. And while the executive branch has occasionally posited that the president may act beyond these limits, such assertions have generally been constrained to exceptional circumstances, like cases of national self-defense.
The president also has a responsibility to respect U.S. obligations under international law, and while not clearly binding on the president, courts have at times used those to inform their understanding of the president's war powers. And many principles under the law of armed conflict, such as necessity and proportionality requirements for the use of force, are incorporated into long-standing U.S. military doctrine.
Myth No. 2 The 1973 War Powers Resolution is unconstitutional. In 2008, former secretaries of state James Baker and Warren Christopher wrote a New York Times op-ed arguing that 'every president since Richard Nixon' had treated the War Powers Resolution 'as unconstitutional.' Debating potential responses to tensions with Iran last summer, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) asserted that 'no president, no administration has ever accepted that resolution as constitutional.'
In reality, the constitutionality of much of the War Powers Resolution is not in doubt. When he vetoed it in 1973, Nixon contended that two key provisions were illegitimate: a requirement that U.S. troops withdraw from 'hostilities' if they do not receive congressional authorization within 60 days, and a special procedure that allowed a simple majority in Congress to direct withdrawal sooner by avoiding a possible presidential veto. While the Supreme Court vindicated Nixon's view on the latter, Congress has since enacted alternate procedures that accomplish the same thing. And subsequent administrations have walked back objections to the former. When presidents have failed to comply with the 60-day requirement, they have generally adopted a narrow interpretation of 'hostilities' or claimed tacit congressional authorization, not taken a firm stance against its constitutionality.
Myth No. 3 AUMFs have been stretched beyond recognition. During a 2017 appearance at the Aspen Ideas Festival, a former CIA director, Gen. David Petraeus, said, 'Let's face it, we have stretched' the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) " which permitted military action against the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks " 'beyond all recognition.' In a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last year, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) similarly claimed that presidents had 'abuse[d] that authority for decades,' alongside the 2002 AUMF for the Iraq War, to an extent he found 'unconscionable.'
The executive branch has certainly interpreted both laws expansively. But this has been facilitated by, not in spite of, the legislative texts, which are ambiguous and imprecise. Both authorize the president to use all 'necessary and appropriate' force without geographic limits or a fixed expiration. The 2001 AUMF 's stated goal is to prevent future attacks by the 9/11 perpetrators and others who harbored or assisted them " language the executive branch has interpreted to apply to al-Qaeda and groups that evolved from or fight alongside it. The 2002 AUMF, which addresses 'the continuing threat posed by Iraq,' has been interpreted to authorize support for a stable, democratic Iraq, including by combating terrorism there. While there are reasonable grounds to object to several of these interpretations, none are clearly inconsistent with language passed by Congress, which also bears responsibility for how they have been used.
Myth No. 4 Courts can't restrain the president's war powers. In 2005, legal scholar Louis Fisher observed 'a growing impression that federal courts lack both the jurisdiction and the competence to decide war power disputes,' a view that has frustrated numerous litigants.-For instance, David Remes, who represented Army Capt. Nathan Smith in a suit challenging the legality of the campaign in Syria against the Islamic State, said the dismissal of his client's case 'makes the War Powers Resolution a dead letter by closing off challenges to violations.' And it's true that federal courts often resist involving themselves in war powers questions. As Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion in Smith's case, this often reflects the idea that 'judicial intervention into military affairs is particularly inappropriate when the two political branches to whom war-making powers are committed are not in dispute.'-
But this logic does not apply where there is a clear conflict between the branches, such as a president acting contrary to an express statutory mandate. If a law were enacted now expressly limiting the use of future military force against Iran, and the next president ignored it, courts might be more inclined to intercede. In general, the Supreme Court has held that courts have a 'duty' to weigh in, even if the subject matter is sensitive. This is probably why Justice Brett Kavanaugh " a frequent advocate of deference to the executive " has written that 'it is not likely a winning strategy . . . for a President to assume that he will be able to avoid judicial disapproval of wartime activities taken in contravention of a federal statute.'
Myth No. 5 To stop a war, Congress can just cut off funding. A 2011 NPR piece titled 'Why The War Powers Act Doesn't Work' argued that 'Congress can ultimately express its displeasure about a war by cutting off funds.' A 2018 entry on the website of the National Priorities Project concluded, 'One way to stop [Trump's] march toward war is to cut off the funds.' In theory, Congress can always decline to pay for military activities it doesn't support. This seems to have been the intent of the framers, who built a two-year limit on Army appropriations into the Constitution to ensure that Congress has a regular say in how the military is used.
In practice, however, this authority is difficult to wield. Congress typically appropriates money for the federal government through large omnibus bills on a roughly annual basis. This furnishes the cash to maintain various military units, usually making it unnecessary for the president to seek additional funding to initiate the use of force, and depriving Congress of the opportunity to withhold money for specific action in advance. While lawmakers could pass legislation limiting existing appropriations for specific military operations, doing so would probably trigger a presidential veto, which would in turn require support from two-thirds of Congress to override " a high threshold that's been met only six times since 2000.
Absent such strong support, Congress's moment of leverage will come only if hostilities last until the current appropriations expire. Even when this occurs, appropriations bills need to balance an array of interests and cannot always risk a veto. And lawmakers are likely to see a potential lapse in appropriations " especially for troops " as politically risky. For this reason, full funding cutoffs are rare and reserved for the most extreme situations, such as ending the Vietnam War.

Texto completo: Late in 2014, the city of Detroit emerged from a bankruptcy that had threatened to destroy what little was left of its social bonds. Municipal workers had been told they might lose their pensions, and the city-owned Detroit Institute of Arts faced the possible sale of its entire collection. A 'grand bargain' mediated by a U.S. District Court judge saved the city, including most of the promised pensions and all of the museum's art. Central to making that grand bargain work was Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation.
Walker, who became president of the $13-billion foundation in 2013, pledged $125-million to save the city, an extraordinary sum given the foundation's total grant budget that year of $565-million. Other major foundations stepped up, too, as did the museum, which agreed to raise $100 million to support the bargain. Its collection was converted from a city asset " subject to peril if the city again fell on hard times " to a nonprofit trust, safe from future claims.
Walker's explanation for why he contributed so much of his foundation's money to what many saw as a government problem, in a city with a reputation for in trac table problems, was simple: 'Detroit is a metaphor for America, for America's challenges and America's opportunities.'
In the five years since that crisis, Walker has emerged as one of the country's preeminent voices for the arts, and social justice, and for new strategies to ameliorate inequality. He has delivered the annual Nancy Hanks Lecture sponsored by Americans for the Arts and was the subject of a glossy profile in the New York Times titled 'The Man With the $13 Billion Checkbook.' And in September, the National Gallery of Art announced that Walker would be joining its board, one of the smallest and most exclusive governing bodies in the art world, with only nine members, four of them ex officio positions, including the chief justice of the United States and the secretaries of the Treasury and State departments.

Walker has served on the boards of other arts institutions, including those of the New York City Ballet and Carnegie Hall, but never on the board of an art museum. When asked why now, and why the National Gallery of Art, which has never had an African American trustee or one who, like Walker, is openly gay, the first thing he says is: Because it's free. Walker, 60, then recounts a memory, from his boyhood in rural Texas, when a teacher showed a movie reel of crowds gathering at the National Gallery to see the Mona Lisa, on loan from France as part of a cultural exchange in 1963.
'I remember seeing a black-and-white panorama of the lines waiting outside the original [John Russell] Pope building, wrapping around the block to see the Mona Lisa, and Mrs. [John F.] Kennedy at the opening,' Walker says. The museum, he adds, 'represents all that is great and noble and aspirational about America. The collection, the range of work, the diversity of work, its placement in Washington.'
Walker, who earned a law degree from the University of Texas and worked early in his career in the corporate world for the Union Bank of Switzerland, sometimes speaks about the arts in ways that echo the language of excellence and aspiration in the Kennedy years. But he also uses another art discourse that sounds more like the rhetoric of the Johnson administration " about access, opportunity, fairness, dignity and openness. He's lived his life deeply in the arts, with a sense of awe of its power and a personal gratitude for helping him transform 'the violence, the dysfunction, the deprivation' of his Texas childhood into a lifelong mission in philanthropy. But he also expresses an urgent concern for how the arts are distributed in America " who can afford to attend performances and exhibitions, where they are located and, most important, who are the gatekeepers who decide what is exhibited, performed and acknowledged as art.
If Walker wasn't fluent in both vocabularies " a language of passion and a language of policy " it's unlikely he would have committed money to save the Detroit Institute of Arts, which for much of its 20th-century history was perceived as an elite, 'white' institution in a city with a population that is now almost 80-percent African American. The Detroit decision was an early example of how Walker seeks to connect the arts to other issues, to work across institutional, disciplinary and public-private boundaries to make the arts central to a range of larger social concerns.
His appointment to the National Gallery board could be one of the most transformational appointments in the museum's history.
'A New Gospel of Wealth' Born in 1959, Walker, the son of a single mother, was one of the first students to participate in the Head Start program, a core element of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty agenda. Walker has also lived through enormous change in the arts in the United States, from the Cold War-era belief that they were an essential part of an international war of ideas to an extended period of post-Cold War disarray, with shrinking audiences and the deliberate politicization of the arts during the culture wars of the 1980s and '90s. Now, Walker may be helping to usher in a new moment, a new consensus, to replace the existential crisis of purpose the arts have experienced for a quarter-century or more.
'I truly believe that the arts allow us to see the humanity of other people, and only then can we imagine a more just world,' he says. 'If we want a more just society, we've got to have a more empathetic society.'
In his Americans for the Arts lecture in 2017, Walker connected the arts directly to the vitality of American democracy. And as he has sharpened and intensified the Ford Foundation's focus on inequality, he has kept the arts central to that mission. When Walker deaccessioned the foundation's old art collection " there was a significant map collection, he says, but also 'a lot of drawings, Picasso and Renoir and, you know, 'school of Titian' ' that didn't reflect the foundation's 21st-century priorities " he reinvested the money in art by living artists, including women and people of color.
And late last year, Walker released a book that borrowed its subtitle from an 1889 essay by Andrew Carnegie: 'From Generosity to Justice: A New Gospel of Wealth.' The book's 'new gospel of wealth' challenges contemporary philanthropists to move past ideas about charity and top-down noblesse oblige benevolence to address root causes of our social ills, especially injustice and economic inequity. But it also offers an important and holistic new argument, sometimes implicit, for the importance of the arts. They are not simply a social need, among others, competing for philanthropic dollars, but essential to the moral vision that animates genuine philanthropy.

How is this vision likely to play out when Walker begins regular participation on the NGA board with his first meeting at the end of the month? Slowly, say people who know him.
'Darren is far too intelligent and thoughtful to be going there with a specific agenda,' says Clive Gillinson, executive director of Carnegie Hall, where Walker is on the board. 'Anyone who is a deep thinker, which he definitely is, knows you get to know an organization and understand it and become part of conversations about where the future is going. He'll come in to learn, first and foremost.'
Henry Timms, president and chief executive of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, where Walker is a regular patron, puts it slightly differently: 'The thing I've enjoyed most about Darren is that he is clearly someone with an agenda, which is appropriate and necessary, but he is also trying to shift the narrative around the people he is working with.' Timms, who considers Walker an invaluable adviser, says Walker is interested in dialogue, willing to be challenged and willing to challenge in turn.
'I think he is an important figure because he is challenging the sector to think about how we are positioned at the heart of society,' Timms says, stressing Walker's insistence on the centrality rather than the peripheral nature of art, which has practical consequences.
'He is casting a broader umbrella, framing all of this around the justice agenda. What he is trying to do is not just multidisciplinary in the arts world, but multi-constituental.'
Redesigning the system Walker's National Gallery appointment may be the first time he has joined a museum board, but he hasn't been shy about sharing his views on museum culture. Last summer, when artists and activists were protesting the presence on the Whitney Museum's board of Warren Kanders " whose company, Safariland, produces tear gas used against migrants on the U.S.-Mexican border " Walker stepped into the fray with a New York Times editorial.
He argued that these conflicts were worsened by inequality, especially the perception that museums tend to serve only the elites. He called for more diverse museum boards, staff and leadership, and encouraged them to look to academic and training programs that prioritize inclusion of new blood when they hire.
Walker also became directly involved in one of the most dynamic exhibitions mounted in this country in years, 'Posing Modernity: The Black Model From Monet and Matisse to Today,' which opened in 2018 at Columbia University's Wallach Art Gallery. The exhibition was curated by Denise Murrell, an independent scholar and African American curator who had struggled to get support for exploring a basic but transformative idea " that the black figures in centuries of European art were not merely decorative and anonymous and that a new history of art could be written by acknowledging their full humanity.
'Denise sent me her dissertation in advance, which I skimmed, and I thought, 'This is amazing,' ' says Walker, who met with Murrell and introduced her to key players in the art world.
'The whole thing simply would not have happened if Darren had not personally stepped up and brought the Ford Foundation into this in 2014,' Murrell says. She went through the usual application process and was granted funds to travel and research the show, which was a critical success, both in New York (where top museums such as the Metropolitan and Museum of Modern Art weren't interested) and in Paris, where it was seen at the prestigious Musee d'Orsay. In November, the Met announced that it had hired Murrell as a curator.
Walker plays down his direct role in that exhibition, even as others credit him with making it happen. Instead, he stresses a larger moral from the tale: 'If Denise had been, you know, a gatekeeper, we would have developed a completely different narrative about modern art.'

And now Murrell is among the gatekeepers. Walker is aware of all the tensions and ironies in the system he is working to change, and he tends to speak in terms of reformation rather than revolution.
'We will always need a system, or it's chaos,' he says. 'The question is, who will organize that system? Who are the gatekeepers in that system? Who defines what is worthy and unworthy?' Walker isn't afraid to use such words as excellence and mediocrity. But he wants to enfranchise more people, from across the democratic spectrum, in making those distinctions.
Walker has a curious and characteristic cadence to his speech " he is given to occasional bursts of emphasis and stress. If you ask him an either/or question, he is likely to answer, emphatically, 'BOTH.'
So, what kind of art does America need now? A reflective art that looks dispassionately at our world, that brings us to reasoned awareness of how far we have fallen from our ideals? Or an art of jeremiads, that compels us to confront our failings without escape or excuses?
'BOTH.'
Then Walker elaborates: 'Both are essential to a healthy democracy. I believe that it is healthy to have art that reflects beauty and ideas that are romantic and aspirational. And at the same time, art that is filled with rage and anger and that doesn't let you out of the room.'
That's not equivocation. It's the only reasonable answer.

Texto completo: Once again, we're hearing
vague talk about an 'imminent threat,' notes journalist
As the United States stumbled toward conflict with Iran, one source of the queasy feeling many Americans felt was that we appeared to be taking a reckless road trip down memory lane " specifically, to 2002-2003. Some 17 years ago, right before the invasion of Iraq, America was caught up in a storm of mendacious pro-war rhetoric. In 2020, many of the rationales for escalating the conflict with Iran echoed those old arguments " in some cases they were even made by the same people.
On Jan. 3, the United States assassinated, with a drone strike, Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who had coordinated Iranian proxy militias in the region. It was an escalation of the U.S.-Iran conflict, to which Iran responded with missile attacks on Iraqi bases hosting U.S. soldiers; there were no casualties. Soon after the drone strike, Michael Doran, a Hudson Institute scholar, declared in an op-ed in the New York Times that the world was now 'a better place,' suggested that celebrations were occurring 'throughout the Middle East' " ignoring Iranian popular outrage over the attack " and argued that this show of American resolve could produce a seismic diplomatic shift in the region. Regional allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia would breathe easier, and the assassination would 'instill in the protesters in Iran, Lebanon and, especially, Iraq, the hope that they will one day wrest control of their governments from the talons of the Islamic Republic.' No talk of the risks of a protracted, bloody conflict.
In January 2003, the very same Doran, then an assistant professor at Princeton (he later served in the administration of President George W. Bush), made similarly rosy predictions in Foreign Affairs about the imminent attack on Iraq. The war, he said, would belatedly demonstrate 'strength and resolve': It would 'sober up onlookers with oppositionist ambitions of their own, making them recalculate the odds of defying a power that has demonstrated its intention to remain a permanent and dynamic regional player.' Of course, the Iraq invasion is not remembered as a show of might that quelled unrest in the region; it was a brutal engagement that has not truly ended. It certainly did not lead Iran " to pick one example " to rethink its opposition to American intervention.
Doran isn't the only one making claims that eerily echo those of 2002 and 2003. The presidential rhetoric about the two conflicts has been notably similar. In his 2003 State of the Union speech, Bush laid the groundwork for the invasion of Iraq: 'Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.' On Wednesday, in a news conference in which he signaled that the United States would not escalate the fight, President Trump said: 'Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. We will never let that happen.' Invoking the threat of nuclear weapons has a way of short-circuiting opposition to military strikes and assassinations.
In 2002-2003, the reasons for the invasion were ever-changing. Sometimes the war was framed as punishment for the Hussein government's past actions. A 2003 document from the State Department's Bureau of Public Affairs explained that the U.S. goal was to defeat 'a regime that developed and used weapons of mass destruction, that harbored and supported terrorists, committed outrageous human rights abuses, and defied the just demands of the United Nations and the world.' At other times, the war was described as a preemptive action to stop a future attack. As a National Security Strategy document published in September 2002 argued: 'Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination. . . . America will act against such-emerging threats before they are fully formed.' Many analysts, of course, claimed that the WMDs already existed, hidden from United Nations inspectors.
After we learned that there were no WMDs in Iraq, the administration moved its focus to an alternate justification " one it had also floated before the war. It was about rescuing the oppressed Iraqi people. In March 2003, Vice President Richard B. Cheney notoriously made that case on 'Meet the Press': 'My belief is, we will, in fact, be greeted as liberators.' (The Trump administration has also suggested that the Iranian people would welcome liberation through American military action " with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo even telling CNN that Iranians would view the Soleimani strike in that light:-'We have every expectation that people not only in Iraq, but in Iran, will view the American action last night as giving them freedom.')
The stated rationale for killing Soleimani also alternated uncertainly between preemption and retribution. At first, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said in a statement that Soleimani was 'actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.' Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) echoed that argument on Twitter: 'This was not an act of revenge for what he had done in the past. This was a preemptive, defensive strike planned to take out the organizer of attacks yet to come.' Pompeo referred to 'imminent threats to American lives.' By Jan. 5, Pompeo was arguing that exactly how imminent the threat was was 'not something that's relevant.' Two days later, Esper was fending off persistent questions about the threat claims by arguing that, as a terrorist, Soleimani's 'time was due.'
In what truly seemed like a throwback to circa-2003 arguments, Vice President Pence even wrote that Soleimani had 'assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.' Aside from Pence's mistake on the number of terrorists who executed 9/11 (there were 19), there was no empirical support for the claim. The 9/11 Commission, FactCheck.org noted, said that it 'found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah' " the Iranian-supported militia group " 'was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack.'
Perhaps inevitably, Trump supporters have attacked the patriotism of anyone who suggests that igniting a new war in the Middle East would be a bad idea. Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and former ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday that the only people 'mourning the loss of Soleimani are our Democrat leadership and our Democrat presidential candidates. No one else in the world.' Equating opposition to the Iraq War to support for Saddam Hussein " or dislike of the United States " was an all-too-common rhetorical tactic two decades ago.
Beyond the similarities in justification for the conflicts, there are similarities in strategies " by which I mean the absence of strategy. That the Bush administration had not thought through the implications of toppling the Hussein regime became clear as the occupation stretched on for months, then years, and it is painfully evident in retrospect.
The incoherence of the Trump administration's strategy regarding Iran, too, is manifest. In his news conference Wednesday, the president pulled back from war but also condemned the regime and embraced harsh sanctions, offering no path toward a diplomatic settlement.
In 2003, the machinery of pro-war rhetoric set the United States on a course that led to the deaths of thousands of Americans and countless Iraqis. In 2020, we ought to be deeply suspicious when we hear hawkish arguments that trace the same dubious patterns.-

What political commentators often get wrong about life in rural America

Texto completo: In political, media and academic circles, the Trump era has sparked renewed interest in rural America " the supposedly 'forgotten' areas of the country where white, non-college-educated voters gave the president the electoral edge he needed to prevail in 2016.
The near-singular focus on President Trump has yielded a body of discourse that views rural Americans primarily through a white, conservative Republican lens. This is somewhat understandable as a matter of raw numbers " its residents do tend to be whiter and more conservative than people living in more densely populated areas.
But that focus also has perpetuated a number of misconceptions, blurring out much of the messiness and complexity of rural life. As a Washington Post reporter who has resided in a northwest Minnesota farming community since 2016 " I wrote a book about it " I've had the opportunity to watch those perceptions solidify in real time, as well as compare them with the on-the-ground reality.
As the 2020 campaign season gets underway in earnest, here are some things I've noticed commentators getting wrong when making sweeping pronouncements about rural America.
First of all, 'rural' isn't really synonymous with 'Midwestern.' Last year, New York Times politics editor Jonathan Weisman provided a particularly clumsy example of this common conflation, suggesting that U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who represent densely populated urban districts in their states, weren't really 'Midwestern.' This is nonsense, of course " the Midwest is a region, not a population density " but it's emblematic of the way many influential people in politics and the media start fudging definitions when they talk about people who live outside New York or Washington.
In reality, any place outside an urban area or urban population cluster should be considered 'rural,' according to the U.S. census. Rural areas comprise well over 90-percent of the country's land area. They're everywhere. The American rural experience ranges far beyond the confines of the Rust Belt. You can, in fact, find rural areas just outside any major city, including in New York, California and Massachusetts " places often positioned in opposition to 'rural' America.
And 'rural' does not necessarily mean 'white.' One of the most regrettable Trump-era trends in political reporting is the diner safari, in which a big-city reporter is parachuted into a small town in the middle of the country in search of the secret wisdom of diner patrons in overalls and trucker caps (full disclosure: I've done one of these, too). Such patrons tend to be, almost without exception, white.
The unfortunate effect of such stories is that they don't reflect the fact that a fairly large and growing share of rural Americans are, in fact, nonwhite: about 22-percent as of 2018, or more than 10 million people. Such residents often have political beliefs that are considerably different from those of their white neighbors. In contested national elections with razor-thin margins, support of rural minorities could make all the difference in a battleground state such as Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.
Such statistics raise more specific questions: What are black voters in the rural Southeast looking for in 2020? What do Native American voters in Midwestern battlegrounds make of the impeachment process so far? What are rural Hispanics in Western states looking for in a Democratic candidate?
We don't have great answers to these questions, in part because we've spent so much time talking to rural whites.
Those media diner excursions also give the impression that the swath of country between New York City and Los Angeles is populated chiefly by staunch Republicans, leavened with a conservative Democrat here and there.
Here's the reality: 'Rural' does not equal 'conservative.' In 2016, nearly 1 in 3 voters living in nonmetropolitan counties voted for Hillary Clinton. 'Nonmetropolitan' doesn't mean exactly the same thing as 'rural' " some metros contain rural areas within their borders, for instance. But there's enough overlap that demographers often use the categories as proxies for one another.
In all, well over 6 million people voted for the Democratic presidential nominee outside of America's major metropolitan regions in 2016. I found out as much on my own diner excursion that year, when I ambled up to a table full of veterans and ex-farmers at my local gas station to find, to my surprise, that all of them had pulled the lever for Clinton.
Farming and progressive politics went hand in hand in parts of the country for much of the 20th century, to the extent that in Minnesota, the official name of the state Democratic Party remains the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to this day. Despite this history, and despite millions of rural Democratic votes in 2016, 'rural Democrat' and 'rural progressive' are categories that are largely absent from today's political debate. Indeed, in 2019, some media outlets are still convening all-Republican panels of small-town voters and presenting them as representative of attitudes 'outside the Beltway.'
Reporters and politicians have often characterized rural Americans as indifferent to political news or 'Beltway intrigue,' which they set up in opposition to more 'authentic' concerns such as grain prices, local tax burdens and small-town governance.
This reinforces a damaging stereotype that people in small towns are simple folks, living simple lives set apart from the rhythms of life in big cities. But actual data on rural news consumption paints a very different picture: Rural Americans do care about the news. In 2012, for instance, a Pew Research Center survey found very little difference in news consumption habits between people in rural areas and those living elsewhere. Crucially, the study showed rural Americans were no different from people in other communities when it came to their interest in such major news topics as politics, crime and breaking news.
My own experience in northwest Minnesota confirms this. The arcana of the 24-hour news cycle " Anonymous, Sharpiegate, the Steele dossier " are discussed just as obsessively in small-town bars as they are at D.C. cocktail parties. This shouldn't come as a surprise: People up here watch the same cable TV talk shows and read the same national news websites as people anywhere else.
All of this builds to what may be the most pernicious misconception " that life in rural America is more authentic, more American than life anywhere else. The intent of this narrative is to hold rural people up as exemplars of American life and ideals. But adhering to such simplistic avatars denies them much of their messy, complicated humanity. It reduces the rural experience to a crude caricature that advances the interests of a particular political viewpoint " a white, conservative one.
There's much to love about life in rural America. After three years here, I have a hard time imagining living anywhere else. The broad skies, open spaces and uncrowded vistas give me a peace I was never able to find living in more populated places. The relative scarcity of people means that those of us who do live here have to forge closer personal bonds to solve the sorts of problems that, in more populated places, are typically handled by anonymous professional bureaucracies.
But there's a lot to love about life just about anywhere in America. There are as many different modes of being an American as there are towns, or families, or individuals living in this country. The mantle of 'real American' " and all the scrutiny, assumptions and mythmaking that come with it " is a burden that none of us should have to bear alone but, rather, is one that we can all share.

Texto completo: If ever a treasure could be described as long lost, the 665 pages of handwritten papers that Barbara Testa discovered inside a trunk in the attic of her California home in 1990 was one. 'The minute I found it,' the Los Angeles Times quoted her as saying, 'I just had a feeling.'
She had stumbled upon the first half of the manuscript of Mark Twain's 1884 novel 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' the story of a runaway boy, Huck, and a runaway slave, Jim, whose trip together down the Mississippi River became one of the most enduring narratives in American literature.
The manuscript's journey to Mrs. Testa's attic " and its ultimate deposit in a New York library where, to the relief and thrill of Twain scholars and aficionados, it was reunited with its other half " made her a protagonist in a modern-day literary drama.
Mrs. Testa died Dec.-16 at her home in Boulder Creek, Calif. She was 91 and had congestive heart failure, said her daughter Laura Testa-Reyes.
A librarian whose father had been a mystery writer, Mrs. Testa spent her life ensconced in books. Her family's literary inclinations could be traced at least to her paternal grandfather, James Fraser Gluck, a lawyer who in the latter 1800s began soliciting original manuscripts from authors of the era to build the collections of the institution that today is the Buffalo and Erie County Public Library.
In the course of that work, Gluck entered into correspondence with Twain " the pen name of Samuel L. Clemens " who agreed to donate the manuscript of 'Huck Finn,' or at least what he then believed remained of it, to the library. In 1885, he sent the second half of the manuscript, comprising 695 pages, explaining that the first half had been lost.
Seventeen months later, according to extant correspondence, Twain found and sent the other half of the manuscript to the library. But for reasons that remain unknown, that portion was never entered into the collection. Gluck died in 1897, and the manuscript's whereabouts remained unknown until Mrs. Testa began rifling through her attic a century later.
The unearthing of the 'Huck Finn' manuscript was 'the most exciting discovery of Mark Twain material in my entire career " and probably in several careers if I had them,' Robert Hirst, head of the Mark Twain Papers archive at the University of California at Berkeley, said in an interview.
'It is something that scholars didn't expect to happen,' he said. 'We're talking about Mark Twain's masterpiece, his absolute best work, far and away above anything else that he wrote.'
In the famous final lines of the novel, Huck declares that 'I reckon I got to light out for the Territory,' lest his Aunt Sally try to 'sivilize' him. When news of the discovery became public, William H. Loos, curator of the rare-book room at the Buffalo library, remarked to the New York Times on the irony of the manuscript's arrival in California.
'Huck went to Hollywood,' he said. 'It's bizarre, but Huck's wish . . . to 'light out for the Territory,' to go West, came true.'
The manuscript continued on its journey " transported by armored car and jet " to the Sotheby's auction house in New York, where its authenticity was confirmed. At the time, its estimated value was $1.5-million.
A legal dispute ensued, pitting Mrs. Testa and her sister against the Buffalo library. USA Today described the battle as 'the biggest tug of war over a document's ownership since Richard Nixon claimed presidential papers as his personal property.'
Through a private sale of the manuscript, the sisters could have sold single pages to individual collectors, a course that would have maximized their profits, according to experts, but dispersed the manuscript perhaps beyond any possibility of reconstitution.
But the sisters said in a statement at the time that they were 'sympathetic to the possibility of reuniting the manuscript' and ultimately reached an undisclosed settlement in which, in 1992, their half of the manuscript was given to the library.
'Not everyone would have been quite so principled,' Hirst said.
Barbara Ellen Gluck was born in Los Angeles on Aug.-15, 1928. Her father wrote mystery stories, aspiring to adapt them for Hollywood, and her mother worked for Disney and later Warner Bros. painting animation cels.
Mrs. Testa received a bachelor's degree in Spanish from Los Angeles State College, now California State University at Los Angeles, in 1951 and a master's degree in library science from the now-defunct Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles in 1969, according to her daughter. She later worked as a reference and children's librarian.
Her husband of 45 years, Frank Testa, died in 2000. Survivors include four children, Jim Testa of Palo Alto, Calif.; Lou Testa of Beaverton, Ore.; Laura Testa-Reyes of Boulder Creek; and Kitty Schaller of Pasadena, Calif.; as well as a sister and six grandchildren.
Whatever its monetary value, the literary value of the long hidden Twain treasure far exceeded it in the eyes of literature professors and admirers of the writer's fiction.
Matthew Seybold, a Twain scholar and professor at Elmira College in New York, observed in an email that the newly discovered manuscript helped scholars in three ways. First, it allowed them to determine when various sections of the novel were written and which people and events may have influenced Twain's thinking at the time; second, it allowed scholars to identify changes, intentional or not, made before the book was published; and, finally, it helped reveal Twain's sense of purpose in his work and the extent to which Huck Finn was 'a realization of his artistic vision.'
In his revisions, Twain fine-tuned the language that became a calling card of his young unlettered protagonist " eliminating highfalutin alliterations, rendering the contraction 'wasn't' in the more vernacular 'warn't' and replacing the French-derived 'forest' with the Anglo-Saxon 'woods.'
'You realize that this is not some natural genius who just tosses it off. This is somebody who had to work to achieve the effect that everyone says is so wonderful,' Hirst said. ' 'Woods' " who would think of that? But he did. He very carefully removed all the 'forests.' '
In a celebrated passage in which Huck describes a sunrise, Twain amended the depiction to make it less sentimental, for even amid the beauty, the breeze might bring with it the stench of 'dead fish laying around, gars, and such, and they do get pretty rank.'
He excised a long passage in which Jim recounts to Huck a frightening encounter with a corpse and professes his belief in ghosts.
Twain eliminated those pages, Hirst contends, because he did not desire to traffic in a prevailing stereotype of black people as superstitious. Rather than the racist work that some critics allege it to be, 'Huck Finn' is a powerful argument against racism, Hirst said, 'if you know how to read it.'
As for Twain and how he might have felt about the resurrection of his manuscript, Hirst said that the author, in all probability, would have been pleased. He had a 'lifelong habit of denouncing the proofreaders and typesetters' who at times took it upon themselves to make what they regarded as improvements to his punctuation.
Twain did not see those changes as improvements. Once, upon learning of such a liberty taken by a proofreader, he wrote to a friend: 'I telegraphed orders to have him shot without giving him time to pray.'

Trump has made us all stupid

Texto completo: Donald Trump is impulse-driven, ignorant, narcissistic and intellectually dishonest. So you'd think that those of us in the anti-Trump camp would go out of our way to show we're not like him - that we are judicious, informed, mature and reasonable.
But the events of the past week have shown that the anti-Trump echo chamber is becoming a mirror image of Trump himself - overwrought, uncalibrated and incapable of having an intelligent conversation about any complex policy problem.
For example, there's a complex policy problem at the heart of this week's Iran episode. Iran is not powerful because it has a strong economy or military. It is powerful because it sponsors militias across the Middle East, destabilizing regimes and spreading genocide and sectarian cleansing. Over the past few years those militias, orchestrated by Qassem Soleimani, have felt free to operate more in the open with greater destructive effect.
We're not going to go in and destroy the militias. So how can we keep them in check so they don't destabilize the region? That's the hard problem - one that stymied past administrations.
In the Middle East, and wherever there are protracted conflicts, nations have a way to address this problem. They use violence as a form of communication. A nation trying to maintain order will assassinate a terrorism leader or destroy a terrorism facility. The attack says: "Hey, we know we're in a long-term conflict, but let's not let it get out of hand. That's not in either of our interests."
The attack is a way to seize control of the escalation process and set a boundary marker.
These sorts of operations have risks and rewards. A risk is that it won't cease the escalation, just accelerate it. The radicals on the other side will get enraged and take to the streets. Their leaders will have to appease that rage.
A reward is that maybe you do halt the escalation. The other side implicitly says: "Message received. We'll do some face-saving things to appease the streets, but we don't want this to get out of hand, either." Another reward is that you've managed to eliminate an effective terrorist like Soleimani. Talent doesn't grow on trees.
The decision to undertake this sort of operation is a matter of weighing risk and reward. And after the Soleimani killing, you saw American security professionals talk in the language of balancing risk and reward. Stanley McChrystal, a retired general, and Michael Mullen, a retired admiral, thought it was worth the risk. Susan Rice, a former national security adviser, thought it wasn't.
But in the anti-Trump echo chamber, that's not how most people were thinking. Led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, they avoided the hard, complex problem of how to set boundaries around militias. Instead, they pontificated on the easy question not actually on the table: Should we have a massive invasion of Iran?
A great cry went up from the echo chamber. We're on the brink of war! Trump is leading us to more endless wars in the Middle East! We're on the precipice of total chaos! This was not the calibrated language of risk and reward. It was fear-stoking apocalyptic language. By being so overwrought and exaggerated, the echo chamber drowned out any practical conversation about how to stabilize the Middle East so we could have another righteous chorus of "Donald Trump is a monster!"
This is Trump's ultimate victory. Every argument on every topic is now all about him. Hating Trump together has become the ultimate bonding, attention-grabbing and profit-maximization mechanism for those of us in anti-Trump world. So you get a series of exaggerated fervors - the Mueller report! Impeachment! The Steele dossier! - that lead ultimately nowhere.
Most of this week's argument about the Middle East wasn't really about the Middle East. It was all narcissistically about ourselves! Democrats defend terrorists! Republicans are warmongers! Actual Iranians are just bit players in our imperialistic soap opera, the passive recipients of our greatness or perfidy.
The world is more complicated than this cartoon. Love or hate him, Trump has used military force less than any other president since Jimmy Carter. When it comes to foreign policy, he is not like recent Republicans. He is, as my colleague Ross Douthat put it, a Jacksonian figure, wanting to get America out of foreign entanglements while lobbing a few long-distance attacks to ensure the crazy foreigners stick to killing one another and not us.
And this is the final paradox. For all the Sturm und Drang that surrounds Trump, populist Republicans and Democrats are gravitating toward the same foreign policy: We're in the middle of a clash of civilizations; the Middle East is so screwed up, we should just get out; we're too stupid/ineffective/racist/imperialistic to do any good there anyway.
We fight viciously about Trump, but underneath, a populist left-right curtain is descending around America, separating us from the Mideast, China, even Europe. The real high-risk move is the one both parties are making together: that if we ignore the world it will ignore us. (It won't.)
Maybe once the Inflammatory One is finally gone from the scene we can have an intelligent conversation about that.

Texto completo: A Philadelphia Museum of Art executive entered into relationships with female subordinate museum staffers while dangling possibilities for professional advancement, according to an account of his tenure published Friday in the New York Times.
Joshua R. Helmer, who worked as assistant director of interpretation starting in 2014, pursued several women during his time there, the report said.
Helmer, 31, and the museum separated in February 2018, and he is now executive director of the Erie Art Museum. That institution's board of directors is reviewing the Times story "and will respond in a timely manner," according to a Friday statement.
Helmer declined to discuss his relationships with the Times, saying only that he followed museum policy. Of his separation from the Philadelphia museum, he said, "It was just my time. I was looking for new opportunities."
He has been barred from the museum premises, according to an internal email sent in November 2019. "Beginning this evening, Josh Helmer will not be allowed in our buildings," wrote education department senior curator Marla Shoemaker.
Beyond acknowledging that it employed Helmer from 2013 to 2018, the Art Museum declined to comment on any aspect of his time there or the circumstances of his departure. The Times said that museum managers had been made aware of concerns about Helmer, but that it was unclear what happened to the complaints.
Several current and former Art Museum staffers told The Inquirer that Helmer was viewed as a "golden boy," and a favorite of museum director and CEO Timothy Rub. On Friday, a cone of silence seemed to descend over the museum, with several staff members saying they had been directed not to talk with reporters and others declining to do so "in this instance," as one put it.
Many Art Museum employees on Friday could be seen wearing red buttons that read "We Believe Women" in a show of support for "our colleagues and those affected by the harassment," said one museum staffer. Museum employees working with the public were first told by the administration to remove the buttons, but that directive that was reversed Friday afternoon, staffers said.
Rub, in a statement, said it was "vitally important to me as director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art to create and sustain an environment in which all of our employees feel valued and respected, and where they are comfortable sharing any concerns they may have about the workplace. This is not simply an obligation, but also a strongly held belief. For this reason, it is deeply upsetting that any staff members would feel that their voices are not heard. We will continue to work tirelessly to address any such issues.
"Our topmost priority is to ensure that the museum is a place we can all be proud of, free from harassment or inappropriate behavior of any kind," he continued. "If we learn of any complaints of this type or are notified of violations of the museum's policies, we will move to address them and to take appropriate action regardless of when the behavior is reported to have occurred."
A museum spokesperson declined to confirm or deny if a legally binding nondisclosure agreement constrained the Art Museum's comment on the matter.
Art Museum board chair Leslie Anne Miller also declined to comment about Helmer on Friday.
Museum policy encourages employees to report instances of perceived discrimination or harassment to supervisors or, if that is not feasible, to the human relations department. In place since February 2010, the policy explicitly cites "demands for sexual favors in exchange for favorable or preferential treatment" as prohibited behavior.
Rub, in an email to staff Friday afternoon, said the museum had "initiated plans to work with outside experts who will gather input from staff and conduct a review of our workplace environment, our policies and programs, including training activities, so we understand how we can be better in the future."
The women named in the Times story, contacted by The Inquirer in recent weeks - none of them still work for the Art Museum - either declined to comment or did not respond to messages. Four of the women the Times spoke with acknowledged that they entered consensual relationships with Helmer, the article said.
Helmer joined the staff of the museum in September 2013 as a Kress Interpretive Fellow in the European painting department.
The following year, he was named assistant director for interpretation, a new position in the education department that gave him wide latitude in crafting the museum's public face - from editing labels in galleries across all curatorial departments to creating digital presentations to entice the public.
"The goal of interpretation is finding where knowledge and curiosity meet," Helmer said in an announcement of his hiring published in the Art Museum's 2014 annual report.
Although his post as assistant director was mid-level, Helmer was given considerable leeway in his work, current and former Art Museum staffers told The Inquirer.
"While at the PMA, Josh was tasked with leading the museum in a complete rethinking of how it engaged its nearly 800,000 visitors a year," said the Erie Art Museum's former board president, Stephen Porter, in a May 2018 social media post announcing Helmer's appointment as the museum's executive director.
Porter didn't respond to calls seeking comment, nor did any current members of the Erie Art Museum board. Its governing body is currently made up of eight members, according to the museum website, and is led by Andona Zacks-Jordan, a lawyer.
The board is smaller than it used to be and has undergone significant turnover in the two years since Helmer's hire, according to John Vanco, who was director of the museum for nearly five decades and retired in 2017. Federal tax records show the board was twice its current size in 2016.
Both Vanco and his wife, Kelly Armor - who worked at the Erie museum as director of education until she left in late 2018 - said they told Porter of what they saw as troubling information about Helmer in the fall of 2018. Armor said she told Porter specifically of concerns regarding Helmer's treatment of Asla Alkhafaji, an employee on work-study named in the Times story, whom Armor worked closely with.
Alkhafaji told the Times that Helmer suggested by text messages that she come to his house for coffee and she declined, saying she would only meet in public. Helmer then began ignoring her at work and later said, "You're the most useless intern we have," the woman told the Times. Armor said she told Porter of her concerns after Alkhafaji showed her the text messages, and that Porter later relayed that the issue had been handled.
Vanco, who said he had never met Helmer despite efforts to reach out to him, said he was "ashamed" of how the board of directors has dealt with complaints about Helmer, saying the board seems "clueless." He said he was worried about the reputation of the Erie Art Museum.
"I can't say how disturbed I am by all of this," he said. "I literally put my life into the institution."
Helmer's former colleagues at the Philadelphia museum described him as diligent in reviewing the galleries, always with an eye toward making the art more accessible to the public. In the case of labels, that meant keeping them short and snappy, under 100 words.
He ran into some pushback from curators, particularly when it came to a few of the museum's signature works.
He wanted to cut the lengthy label on Thomas Eakins' The Gross Clinic but relented when curators balked, arguing for the significance of the painting as a great artwork and a pivotal part of 19th century science, medicine, and Philadelphia history. Helmer relented.
In October, he was singled out in an ARTnews story titled "Museum Directors Under 40: A Brief History of 20 Young Leaders Who Helped Shape Their Institutions."
The trade journal gave him the honor also achieved by legendary U.S. art museum leaders such as Thomas Hoving, Metropolitan Museum of Art director in the 1960s and '70s, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art's own Anne d'Harnoncourt.
"ARTnews is a very, very big deal in the national and international art world," Helmer told the Erie Times-News. "This one is kind of cool."

Texto completo: Brad Pitt's journey to sobriety happened in part thanks to Jenkintown's own Bradley Cooper, the actor has said.
Pitt this week attended the National Board of Review Annual Awards Gala in New York City, where Cooper presented the star with a best supporting actor award for his role in Once Upon A Time . . . in Hollywood, People reports. During his acceptance speech, Pitt credited Cooper as a factor in his own journey to sobriety.
"Bradley just put his daughter to bed and rushed over here to do this," Pitt said, referencing Cooper's young daughter Lea De Seine. "He's a sweetheart. I got sober because of this guy and every day has been happier ever since."
Pitt initially discussed his decision to quit using drugs and alcohol in a 2017 interview with GQ. At the time, Pitt had split from his ex-wife Angelina Jolie, and told the publication that his clean living left him thinking that there is "still much beauty in the world and a lot of love."
"I had to step away for a minute," Pitt said. "And truthfully I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional. I was good."
The Ad Astra star has openly discussed his sobriety since then, most recently telling the New York Times in September that he got clean and started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after having "taken things as far as I could take" them.
"I removed my drinking privilege," he said.
Cooper himself has been sober for well over a decade. He gave up drugs and alcohol at age 29, according to a 2012 interview with the Hollywood Reporter. The decision to give up his substance use, Cooper said, came after he realized that he "wasn't going to live up to my potential" otherwise.
"That scared the hell out of me," Cooper said. "I thought, 'Wow, I'm actually gonna ruin my life; I'm really gonna ruin it.'"
Pitt's best supporting actor award from the National Board of Review for Once Upon A Time . . . in Hollywood is his second this week following a win at the Golden Globes on Sunday.
Cooper, meanwhile, is working on co-parenting daughter Lea with ex Irina Shayk. The pair, TMZ reports, have a joint-custody agreement that has them both living in New York City.

Texto completo: Minnesota U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar remains stalled behind a clutch of top Democratic contenders for president in Iowa, gaining little traction in an influential Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Friday.
Three weeks ahead of the first-in-the-nation caucuses, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled ahead of the field with 20% of likely Democratic caucusgoers naming him as their first choice for president. Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren polled 17%, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg garnered 16%, and former Vice President Joe Biden got 15% -- putting them in a virtual statistical tie in the race for the Democratic nomination.
Klobuchar trails with 6% support, marking no change from the same poll two months ago despite what her campaign considered a wave of momentum in recent weeks.
The poll, released on CNN and DesMoinesRegister.com, asked likely Democratic caucusgoers their top choice for president among 14 candidates for their party's nomination. The poll serves as an early barometer of where the 2020 presidential candidates stand at a crucial juncture in the primary contest.
The results also came hours ahead of Friday's midnight deadline for candidates to meet the Democratic National Committee's polling requirement to participate in Tuesday's debate in Des Moines, the last before Iowans caucus on Feb. 3. Besides Klobuchar, five other candidates have qualified for what also will be the first debate of 2020: Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders, Warren and businessman Tom Steyer.
That debate may be a "make or break" moment for Klobuchar, said Steven Schier, retired Carleton College political professor. She'll have to be aggressive and go after some of the candidates just as she did with Buttigieg in the last debate, he said.
"She has to develop momentum coming out of it," Schier said. "The traditional wisdom is that there are three tickets out of Iowa. The top three … have a future in the nomination contest."
Some Iowa political leaders, however, widely believe that there are five tickets out of Iowa this year.
Cracking that top tier is especially important for Klobuchar because it would help her raise more money and get more media attention, which would translate into more momentum, Schier said. It will be a tough task, because the contenders ahead of her are formidable, but it's not impossible. There seems to be a bit of flux among the leaders, he said.
"That's good news for Amy, because nobody in the top four has broken into a clear lead and left the pack behind," he said.
She's "positioned very well," said Larry Jacobs, political science professor at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs. "If you told me a year ago that Amy Klobuchar was going to be right in the mix a few weeks before the Iowa caucus, I wouldn't have believed it."
The latest poll, along with an influx of donations in the last quarter, are good signs, he said. "It tells me there are a good number of Democratic voters and donors who aren't that comfortable with the top group."
The poll of 701 likely Democratic caucusgoers was conducted Jan. 2-8 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
In the last Des Moines Register poll in November, Buttigieg rocketed ahead of Warren, the previous leader in the poll, as well as Biden and Sanders, who were tied for third at the time. Klobuchar also finished fifth in that poll with 6% support.
"[Voters] are moving around among the top four candidates," Schier said. "If she can get a superior debate performance, perhaps she can get some of those wavering voters to move in her direction on caucus night."
Klobuchar, who recently completed a campaign milestone with stops in all 99 Iowa counties, has been riding a new wave of national attention after well-received debate performances in November and December. Her campaign reported that she collected $11.4 million in contributions in the last three months of 2019, nearly half of the more than $25 million she has raised since joining the presidential contest last Feb. 10.
Klobuchar is counting on Iowa to propel her into the top echelon of the Democratic primaries heading into the early voting states of New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
Doubling down on Iowa, where she has put much of her effort, Klobuchar has released a new ad to kick off her "Day of Action" in the Hawkeye State -- an organizing push on Saturday that will include canvassing and phone bank events to pump up support before the caucuses.

Texto completo: As wildfires continue to ravage their homeland, Australians living in Minnesota are feeling a kaleidoscope of emotions -- fear, grief and gratitude.
Many who are members of the Australian New Zealand American Association (ANZAA) have family members and friends in areas blackened by the wildfires.
Longtime member Anoushka Haas said the main problem for friends back in her home city of Sydney is smoke-fouled air. For those in rural areas, the situation is much more dire.
Haas' longtime friend Colin Burns, 72, a volunteer firefighter whom she called by his nickname "Rover," was one of at least 24 people who have died in the fires, according to the New York Times. He was found dead Jan. 3 in his burned-out car.
"It's difficult and lonely, and it wasn't [just] a loss of my friend, but the loss of a kind soul who was a generous and warmhearted person to all he met," Haas said. "He was a volunteer firefighter, he modified his truck to run on biodiesel to minimize his impact on the environment, and he never said a bad word about anybody.
"The hardest part is not going back for the funeral, and not being around people who knew him that I could talk to," she said.
The danger faced by Australian firefighters and citizens has prompted the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho to send U.S. fire experts to help fight the blaze.
Two Minnesota firefighters are assisting in Australia, and more could be on the way, said the center's Carrie Bilbao.
"They've requested another larger group, which will probably be more than a hundred firefighters," Bilbao said.
The United States has a partnership agreement with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Mexico when wildfires occur. For instance, Australia and New Zealand sent firefighters to the United States in 2018, Bilbao said.
Firefighter Mike Crook, a Grand Marais resident based in the Superior National Forest, arrived in Victoria, a state in southeastern Australia, in December. An expert on fire behavior, he is monitoring blazes near there until Jan. 25. Marty Cassellius, with the Bureau of Indian Affairs Midwest Regional Office in Bloomington, also is in Victoria. He is responsible for ground fire suppression efforts until he returns Jan. 28.
ANZAA member Jodi Cassidy has lived in Minneapolis for 14 years. Her parents still live high on the South Coast, where New Year's Eve wildfires approached their doorstep.
Fire moved around her father's house, taking out structures on the next street over, she said. It was an even closer call for her mother, who lives farther south.
The fire "came within about half a mile of her house," Cassidy said. "Very luckily for them was that they had an easterly breeze and it was very hot. The fires were raging toward the coast, and then a southerly [wind] came in, and that saved them. That pushed the fire back on itself and pushed it back the other way."
Many residents lost power, so it took three days for her to find out if her mother was safe.
"The fear of the unknown was the hardest part. You know, I kept telling myself that they were OK," Cassidy said. "Looking at maps and things like that, it didn't look like it had reached them, but when you don't have confirmation, you can't talk to them, you don't know."
Cassidy and Haas' Twin Cities acquaintances are closely following the bush fires, too. Haas' friends have donated money to help those affected by the fire, and Cassidy's are following her updates on Facebook, especially about her cousin, who lost his home to fire.
For those interested in donating to help fire victims, the two suggested the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, the Australian Red Cross and other Australia-based charities.
"When I finally got to talk to my mom, she was just in awe of the world and in particular the USA," Cassidy said. "She was like, 'Jodi, you won't believe the donations that people are giving, and they know about us.' You know, they're in a tiny little corner of the world, a long way away, but she was just in awe of what people were donating."

Texto completo: When Beth El Synagogue began scouting for candidates for its 2020 "Heroes Among Us" lecture, the focus was on individuals it believed were taking moral leadership on critical national issues.
The search ended with Daniel J. Jones, a former staff member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who investigated CIA interrogation methods of terrorist suspects following the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center.
The committee's years of work to uncover and document secret CIA torture practices formed the basis of the 2019 movie "The Report," in which Jones is portrayed by actor Adam Driver. It put the spotlight on the critical importance of ethics and integrity in government, said Rabbi Avi Olitzky of Beth El.
Jones addressed a crowd of several hundred people Thursday night at the St. Louis Park synagogue, explaining how the young man who started out as a Teach for America middle school teacher ended up as chief investigator of the largest probe into the CIA in generations.
Unearthing the truth about the illegal use of torture was a personal moral conviction and a civic duty to prevent it from happening again, he said.
"This was a seven-day-a-week job for us," Jones said, referring to himself and other committee investigators. "If we didn't do this job, who would?"
Jones, originally from Pennsylvania, never set out to have a career that would make him the center of a major motion picture. Raised Catholic, he attended Elizabethtown College in his home state, where he majored in sociology and religion, he said. He was particularly concerned about poverty, which led to his teaching stint in Baltimore.
But the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center shifted his priorities. After finishing a master's degree at Harvard University, he worked as an FBI counterterrorism analyst. He next took a staff position on the Senate Intelligence Committee at about the same time the New York Times reported that the CIA had destroyed videotapes of its interrogations on detainees.
For those who haven't seen the film, "The Report" traces how this group of committee staffers and their Senate leaders pored over a whopping 6 million pages of CIA correspondence and documents to uncover what happened in those videotapes and in other interrogation sessions.
'Torture is ineffective'
Their work led to three key conclusions, said Jones.
"One, torture is ineffective," he said. "People will say anything to get the torture to stop."
Two, the CIA repeatedly gave the White House and government officials false information about the utility of the information gained during the interrogations, he said. Third, the CIA "grossly mismanaged" the project.
Although investigators viewed torture not just as illegal but as morally wrong, the CIA argued that if torture prevented American deaths, it was for the greater good.
Jones said he doesn't consider himself a hero, but rather part of a team of staff and senators who relentlessly sought to shed light on illegal practices and to maintain integrity of the nations top intelligence agency. He said heroes include the government workers and others who took professional risks by providing the team with tips over the years.
What is he most proud of?
"No one has been able to identify a factual error," Jones told the audience. "There were no mistakes."
Film 'to reach so many'
Olitzky said honoring Jones is a continuation of the synagogue's support for efforts to put a spotlight on, and to end, torture practices. The rabbi also appreciated that the film's producer, Scott Z. Burns, is from Golden Valley. Burns offered a video introduction of Jones at the event.
Jones praised the thoroughness of the script, written by Burns, and the work of lead actors Driver and Annette Bening.
He said he left the Senate in 2016 and has since founded Advance Democracy Inc., a nonprofit that conducts international research related to accountability and transparency in government. For example, it is investigating foreign government interference in European elections, he said.
Jones also is founder of the Penn Quarter Group, a public policy research and investigative group based in Washington, D.C. He said he is thrilled that his seven-year investigation is getting a second wind.
"The film is going to reach so many more people than the Senate report did," said Jones, noting that it will help ensure "lessons are learned."

Texto completo: SHIPPING NEWS: Some Navy brass sailed into St. Louis this week to meet with high school students.
The top two officers and the highest-ranking enlisted man from the Navy's newest combat ship, the USS St. Louis, talked Wednesday at Soldiers Memorial with junior ROTC units from Cleveland Junior Naval Academy and Vashon High School.
Known as the ship's "triad," the sailors were Cmdr. Kevin Hagan, commanding officer; Cmdr. Eric D. Turner, executive officer; and Command Senior Chief Brandon Ellison.
Then on Thursday, the three also spoke to students at Fort Zumwalt East and Pattonville high schools.
Ellison said the triad hit town on Tuesday to meet with the ship's commissioning committee. He said that while no specific date has been set, the aim is to have the ship in active service by the end of the summer.
The ship, which Ellison said will carry a crew of about 70, is in Wisconsin undergoing final outfitting and should be delivered to active service later this year. It is designed to combat surface and submarine threats in coastal waters.
The ship's official sponsor is Barbara Broadhurst Taylor, wife of Enterprise Holdings executive chairman Andy Taylor. She presided over the keel-laying ceremony in 2017 and christened the ship in 2018.
This is the seventh ship in Navy history to carry the city's name. Other vessels were a sloop of war launched in 1828, a Civil War gunboat, a Spanish-American War troop ship, a World War I cruiser, a World War II light cruiser, and a cargo ship decommissioned in 1991.
TOURING PRO: Fans of Amanda Clark, former owner and top tour guide at Renegade STL, will delight to know she soon will create area explorations for the Missouri Historical Society.
Clark has been hired to a newly created position of community tours manager and has closed Renegade STL, society officials said.
Starting in 2012, Clark's company offered history and architecture tours around St. Louis, describing them as "fresh, original, off-beat tours of kick-ass history and grand architecture ..."
That approach drew the attention of The New York Times, which gave her a shoutout in a travel piece published in April that touted STL's attractions.
Society officials said Clark's new tours should be underway this spring.
FIT BIT: Personal finance website WalletHub took a look at the best cities for an active lifestyle, and St. Louis did well -- including a first-place finish in one of the ranking's two main categories.
Overall, out of the 100 largest U.S. cities, our fit burg clocked in at No. 24.
But in the category of "budget and participation," we were No. 1.
That category looked at things such as the cost of fitness club memberships, sports apparel, renting a bowling lane and reserving tennis courts. It also considered the number of sporting-goods stores, sports clubs, people who walk/bike to work, intramural leagues and pickup athletic games.
In the other category, "sports and outdoors," we were No. 45.
This section looked at the number of athletic fields and courts, swimming pools, tennis courts, public golf courses, ice skating rinks, skateboard parks, fitness centers, dance schools, playgrounds and hiking/running trails.
When it came to our major-city neighbors, only Chicago (2) and Cincinnati (23) finished higher than us, while we left Indianapolis (54), Nashville, Tennessee (65), Louisville, Kentucky (69), Kansas City (70) and Memphis, Tennessee (87), in our active wake.
The best city for an active lifestyle is (well, yeah) Honolulu. The worst, North Las Vegas, Nevada.

Texto completo: Megyn Kelly is finally speaking out about the movie "Bombshell," which explores sexual harassment at her former employer, Fox News.
"I wasn't sure if I wanted to say anything re 'Bombshell,' a film re sex harass. at Fox," the lawyer-turned-anchor tweeted Thursday ahead of posting the nearly 30-minute segment on her YouTube and IGTV channels. "But in the end I wanted the women who lived it to have the last word."
Kelly is portrayed in "Bombshell" by Charlize Theron, who said she didn't talk with the anchor before doing the film because she thought it would put too much pressure on both of them.
In the video, Kelly had a negative reaction to a scene in the film where Margot Robbie's character essentially blames Kelly's silence for the continuing harassment, and Theron's Kelly responds, "Look around, snowflake. How do you think a woman gets a prime-time Fox show?"
Kelly claims she still wouldn't cut the scene from the film because it represents a real regret for her in her career. "I've looked back on my own life, every moment from that moment forward and I do wish I had done more. Even though I was powerless, even though it would've been a suicidal move for me careerwise, what if I had just said, 'screw it?' " she said.
As for the infamous "spin" in Fox CEO Roger Ailes' office, Kelly, who left Fox News in 2017, admitted she did it: "I know people think it's like, 'Oh, you had to spin around,' but I remember feeling like ... I put myself through school. I was offered a partnership at Jones Day, one of the best law firms in the world. I argued before federal courts of appeal all over the nation. I came here, I'm covering the United States Supreme Court. I graduated with honors from all my programs - and now he wants me to twirl?
"And I did it," Kelly said. "If you don't get how demeaning that is, I can't help you."

Movie review: “Cats” - PG

Texto completo: The Story
“Jellicle cats, come out tonight; Jellicle cats, come one, come all,” sings Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench). “The Jellicle moon is shining bright; Jellicle cats, come to the Jellicle Ball!” At the Ball, Old Deuteronomy will choose one cat to rise to Heavyside Layer (i.e., heaven) for rebirth into another life. That’s the setup - and plot - of “Cats,” Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical based on T.S. Eliot’s witty poems from “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats.”
Which one of the 20-odd Jellicles will Old Deuteronomy choose? Must each cat have its own - long - solo performance? Is this, as critic Leah Greenblatt writes, “cinematic lunacy”? Or not? For answers, see “Cats.”
The Actors
Francesca Hayward, a principal ballerina at the Royal Ballet, is sweet as Victoria. She’s a naïve London house cat, abandoned in the night by her owners. She meets, one by one, two dozen street-smart cats who call themselves “Jellicles.” They perform a non-stop talent show for Victoria and Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench). We watch, too.
Among the performers are Taylor Swift (Bombalurina), Jennifer Hudson (Grizabella), Ian McKellen (Gus the Theatre Cat), Rebel Wilson (Jennyanydots), James Cordon (Bustopher Jones), Idris Elba (Macavity), Laurie Davidson (Mr. Mistoffelees), Jason Derulo (Rum Tum Tugger), Robbie Fairchild (Munkustrap), Mette Towley (Cassandra), Naoimh Morgan (Rumpleteazer), Ray Winston (Growltiger), Laurent Bourgeois (Socrates), and another baker’s dozen.
Other Comments
Directed by Tom Hooper, “Cats” transposes Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 1981 mega-hit stage musical (21 years in London, 18 years in New York City) to the big screen. Film critics, however, have not been impressed - “Cats,” the movie, gets a score of only 32, based on 50 separate reviews, at Megacritic.com. “Two hours of stray cats introducing themselves,” says Jake Cole (Slant Magazine); “warbling piffle,” writes Peter Bradshaw (The Guardian); “kitschapalooza,” from Manohla Dargis (The New York Times). I don’t think it’s that bad, but pleasures are often uneven. Eliot’s poems (adapted by Lloyd Webber) are clever, but not always understandable. Eve Stewart’s production design is eye-catching, if sometimes cluttered and gaudy. The plot - what there is of it - is thin and, at times, invisible. “Memory” - the show’s big hit - brings goosebumps, but do we need to hear it three times? Still, I like “Cats” for what it is, and Steven McRae’s tap-dancing as Skimbleshanks the Railroad Cat is astonishing.
Rated PG for rude and suggestive humor - a lot of “bobbing butts,” as one critic put it - “Cats” runs 110 minutes. It may seem longer.
Final Words
“Who will be the Jellicle cat?”
That’s the question, where it’s at:
Grizabella or Munkustrap?
Want an answer? Lloyd Webber’s “Cats.”

Rich Lowry: Trump is neither neocon nor isolationist

Texto completo: Donald Trump isn't George W. Bush.
That should be obvious to everyone by now, but his critics and even some of his supporters immediately acted as if it were 2003 on the cusp of the Iraq War when Trump took out Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani.
Suddenly, the neocons had cachet again (Vox warned that “the Iraq War hawks are back”), and we were about to launch yet another endless war. Trump’s decision to kill Soleimani, New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote, repeating a common refrain, “has brought the United States to the brink of a devastating new conflict in the Middle East.”
There's no doubt that the operation against Soleimani carried risks, but it didn't transform Trump into a conventional interventionist. In fact, taking out Soleimani was wholly consistent with the president's approach to the world that can't be plotted on a simple hawk/dove or neocon/isolationist axis. As a Jacksonian, Trump is none of the above, combining a willingness to whack our enemies with a distaste for ambitious foreign interventions.
The Jacksonian label is the famous construction of foreign-policy analyst Walter Russell Mead, who traces the tradition back to Andrew Jackson and the cultural influence of the American backwoods. Jacksonians are content to let the world sort itself out, except if they perceive a threat, in which case they react with great ferocity.
Trump's victory overturned the reigning Republican foreign-policy consensus, but it didn't herald a lurch to isolationism pure and simple.
Even when Trump sounded most hostile to U.S. commitments and alliances abroad in 2016, he promised, in one of his most Jacksonian sentiments, to "bomb the s---" out of ISIS. No matter how much Trump disdained being in the Middle East, it wouldn't be possible to follow through on this threat without military assets, an intelligence network and allies on the ground. Once elected, Trump did, sure enough, bomb the s--- out of ISIS.
Killing Soleimani is keeping with this general orientation rather than a departure from it. In fact, the whole thing is shot through with Jacksonian attitudes.
Trump's red line to Iran didn't have to do with our values or shipping lanes. It reflected the most basic imperative of a nation protecting its own: Don't harm Americans.
When a rocket attack by an Iranian-supported militia killed an American contractor and injured other Americans at a base in Iraq, Trump's response was also characteristically Jacksonian: a stunning, bolt-out-of-the-blue droning of an enemy commander who was thought to be safely out of bounds, designed to create the maximum deterrent bang for the buck.
All of this is why the complaint from Trump's populist backers that the president has been co-opted by deep-state warmongers, putting at risk his political base, is misplaced. Trump never promised anyone he'd refuse to respond to threats to Americans, or honor the unspoken rules protecting a bloodstained high official of a hostile foreign regime. In fact, if Trump had said any of these things, it would have been out of character.
Bellicosity of a certain kind — taunting and over the top, boasting of our awesome military capabilities and motivated by considerations of personal and national honor — is key to the Trump brand.
The killing of Soleimani is likelier to add to the legend of Donald Trump for his most loyal backers instead of give them pause. In their view, here is President Trump once again doing what no other president would do, taking an inordinate amount of criticism for it, often from a perpetually hysterical press corps, and having it work out (so far).
The Jacksonian impulse alone is not enough to solve the complex foreign-policy problem presented by Iran. But it can be useful in a contest of intimidation and escalation. The killing of Soleimani isn't a deep-state or neocon project, rather an unmistakable expression of Trump's distinctive worldview.

All three itineraries were part of a list, published in The New York Times on Thursday, of 52 destinations recommended to explore around the globe in 2020. Colorado Springs was one of the seven U.S. locations included in the list.
Colorado Springs, “a gateway to alpine vacationlands since trains first arrived in 1871” will “spring anew in 2020,” writes New York Times’ reporter Kathryn O’Shea-Evans.
The list cites April’s opening of the $90 million U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum and the debut this fall of the Pikes Peak Summit House as reasons to visit Colorado’s second-largest city.
To fuel one’s travels, the New York Times suggested Nightingale Bread, where they mill their own organic heirloom grain at the Lincoln Center. Or, Four by Brother Luck to try cornbread with wojapi (berry sauce) or another dish inspired by indigenous foods of the Four Corners region.
Fresh trout from Front Range streams can be found on the menu of The Broadmoor hotel: “a pink stucco Italian Renaissance-style resort that looms over the landscape like a fever dream of Gold Rush-era miners,” wrote O’Shea-Evans.
The New York Times compiled the list by polling its Travel Desk and asking for suggestions from its travel writers and frequent travelers.

Texto completo: Jan. 11, 1839: Sculptor Franklin Simmons, whose public artworks include the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow statue and the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Portland and the Soldiers’ Monument in Lewiston, is born in a part of Lisbon that later becomes the town of Sabattus.
<img class="size-full wp-image-13690530 alignleft" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/Me200-Verticle-SMALL-e1577809540930.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="161" />

Simmons, who is raised in Bath and Lewiston, starts out making sculpture models of coarse clay from the banks of the Androscoggin River and opens a studio in Portland after graduating from Bates College. His first commercial statue, for the city of Rockland, depicts Maj. Gen. Hiram Berry, a Union officer from Rockland who was killed by a sharpshooter at the Battle of Chancellorsville.
Simmons’ statues of William King, Maine’s first governor; and Hannibal Hamlin, vice president under Abraham Lincoln, are on display in Washington, D.C.
<img class="size-large wp-image-13946862" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/kings-1024x668.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="668" />
He also creates the statue of President Ulysses Grant, shown in a Union Army uniform, that stands in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. He plans to do one of Lincoln as well, but the day after the two meet in April 1865 to schedule a sitting, John Wilkes Booth assassinates the president.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-13948014" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/monument-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300" />
Simmons eventually sculpts more than 100 marble busts and 15 public monuments.
Simmons moves to Rome in 1868, following in the footsteps of many American sculptors who want to learn the centuries-old Italian tradition of marble carving. After the king of Italy decorates him three times for his work, he dies on Dec. 8, 1913, in the Italian capital while taking a hot bath, according to The New York Times.
Jan. 11, 2012: For the second time in two years, Hostess Brands, which employs about 370 people at a bakery in Biddeford, appears in bankruptcy court.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-13813826" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/portland-press-herald_36955491-300x244.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="244" />
A spokesman for the company, whose cake products include Twinkies and Ding Dongs, says the filing will not result in job losses in Biddeford.
But in November of that year, embroiled in a strike that includes workers at the Biddeford plant, the national company closes all 33 of its bakeries; four months later, a bankruptcy judge authorizes the company to sell everything it owns.
Flowers Foods Inc. buys most of Hostess’ assets in July 2013, including the Biddeford bakery, but it puts that property up for sale the following year, and it never reopens as a bakery.

Leonhardt: The most electable Democrat

Texto completo: If you’re like a lot of Democrats, you worry that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are too liberal — or at least that other voters think so. You’re also not buying the Pete Buttigieg hype. And you get nervous every time Joe Biden opens his mouth.
So where are you supposed to find a comfortably electable, qualified candidate who won’t turn 80 while in office?
Sen. Amy Klobuchar has become an answer to that question in the final month before voting begins. She has outlasted more than a dozen other candidates and has two big strengths: A savvy understanding of how to campaign against President Donald Trump and a track record of winning the sorts of swing voters Democrats will likely need this year.
Klobuchar, to be sure, is not a finished product as a presidential candidate. Too often, she sounds like a senator speaking in legislative to-do lists rather than a future president who can inspire voters. That tendency — along with too much needling of other candidates, instead of focusing on her own message — was evident in the most recent debate.
Yet she still emerged as one of the debate’s winners, and she is enjoying a burst of new attention. She raised more than twice as much money, $11.4 million, in the fourth quarter of 2019 than the third quarter. When I ask top Democrats which candidate has the best chance of beating Trump, Klobuchar is often their answer. If party leaders still chose nominees, she might now be the favorite.
In that way, she reminds me of another Midwestern senator who once seemed too ordinary to be president: Harry Truman. In the summer of 1944, an even more perilous time for global democracy than now, Democratic Party grandees chose Truman as vice president with the belief that he would soon be president, given Franklin Roosevelt’s declining health.
Truman was (as Klobuchar is) a loyal Democrat with populist leanings whom many Republicans, both senators and voters, nonetheless felt some affection for. He had a folksy manner and heartland accent. He was also a long shot for the nomination when the process began. The analogy extends to Klobuchar’s best-known weakness: Truman had a temper, too.
Of course, Klobuchar needs to win over millions of primary voters, not just hundreds of convention delegates, which is why she remains an underdog. But the path is the same one that her campaign had always seen: Do well enough in Iowa, which is next door to her home state of Minnesota, and then in New Hampshire to be one of the final two or three candidates standing.
Her greatest strength is her understanding of how to beat Republicans. They like to portray Democrats as self-serious elites who look down on ordinary Americans. (Think about the caricatures of John Kerry, Al Gore and Michael Dukakis.) Klobuchar has built her political career on an image that combines working class and middle class.
She grew up in a family that struggled with alcoholism and divorce, and she talks about it. When her husband, John Bessler, was a child, he lived with his five brothers and parents in a trailer home. Klobuchar’s memoir is called, “The Senator Next Door.” She tells too many self-deprecating jokes to seem earnest. Some of them are even funny.
She is still a relative city slicker, having lived most of her life around the Twin Cities and attended Yale and the University of Chicago’s law school. But she knows how to persuade voters who are different from her that she respects them. She has learned the minutia of farm policy and rural development. She visits all of Minnesota’s 87 counties every year.
Klobuchar combines this persona with tough, clear explanations of how Republican policies will hurt the middle class: They will make prescription drugs more expensive, health insurance harder to get and climate destruction worse. If she’s elected, she promises to raise taxes on the rich, lift take-home pay for everyone else, take on big-business abuses and combat climate change.
In the 2018 midterms, as Klobuchar points out, Democrats focused on bread-and-butter issues while largely avoiding divisive ideas like “Medicare for All.” “If you don’t think that worked, I have four words for you: Former Gov. Scott Walker,” she said on Pod Save America, referring to the Wisconsin conservative hero who lost. Democrats also won the statewide congressional vote in Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida, on their way to retaking the House.
Yet 2020 will probably be harder, because incumbent presidents usually win reelection. But Klobuchar’s own electoral history is deeply impressive. She has won all three of her Senate elections by more than 20 percentage points. In 2018, she carried 51 of Minnesota’s 87 counties; two years earlier, Hillary Clinton had carried only nine.
I am also struck by Klobuchar’s views about how to run against Trump this time — to talk about how he has let down the country (which gives his old supporters permission to switch sides), to use humor against his demagoguery and to appeal to voters’ emotions and patriotism.
On that last point, her primary campaign could benefit from her own advice: Klobuchar would improve her chances if she could find the grace notes that lift the best campaigns by telling a story about America.
I’m not saying that Democrats should necessarily vote for Klobuchar. Other candidates have strengths she doesn’t. Buttigieg, for example, summons those grace notes naturally. And Warren has an unmatched grasp of the economy’s problems, which could make her a transformational president.
I’m merely saying this: Many Democratic voters care more about beating Trump than anything else. For them, Klobuchar deserves a look.

State Street's dreary pedestrian conditions could get a big upgrade

Texto completo: Welcome to State Street, an iconic thoroughfare in the heart of America's walking city. Please enjoy the faded crosswalks, the three lanes seemingly always jammed with cars and trucks, and beaten down sidewalks that are so narrow in places that pedestrians dodge each other during rush hour.
It's not a great look for one of the most popular streets for tourists in Boston, bordering busy Faneuil Hall and linking the Old State House and Orange Line to the Rose Kennedy Greenway and the New England Aquarium.
Nor is it particularly pleasant for the thousands of commuters who work in the office buildings that line the street (including, it should be noted, those at the Globe). In November, an 86-year-old pedestrian suffered life-threatening injuries when she was struck by a vehicle at a State Street intersection.
So the Boston Public Works Department is considering a significant revamp of the road in the near future. Although the plans are still in the early stages, officials say there's one primary goal: to make State Street much better for walking. That's not just a matter of urban idealism: State Street is overwhelmingly used by pedestrians, with more than 29,000 each day compared with about 10,700 cars and trucks.
“We want to make sure the roadway has a better balance for the people who are actually using it," said Ashley Biggins, a city engineer. “We want to make sure pedestrians don't feel like second-class citizens when they're the majority of roadway users."
The city is circulating a survey online that shows some of the potential options for the road: wider sidewalks, bike lanes, better crosswalks, public art and landscaping, and more seating for dining or just leisure.
And then there is the most provocative suggestion the city put out: banning cars from the road altogether, which is used as a major access point for commercial traffic heading into downtown. It's unclear how serious that option is; for now, Biggins said, the city is only gathering feedback. But officials hope to finish a redesign of State Street this year and begin work in 2021.
If they're not shut out entirely, drivers could also benefit from the changes. State Street is the site of near-constant double parking by delivery trucks and ride-hail drivers. Biggins said there have been early discussions in City Hall about potentially using State Street as a testing ground for new parking rules as part of a national pilot program the city was selected for last year, meant to better manage curb space to cut down on congestion.
Going off-track
The MBTA returned one of two new Orange Line cars to service on Tuesday, saying it solved a structural issue that had taken it off the rails for two months. The second six-car train should join it before the end of January.
While officials insisted it was normal for new trains to encounter problems as they enter service, the removal of the Orange Line trains alarmed frustrated commuters who have long awaited them.
So imagine the feelings in New York, another city with a worn-out subway and palpable commuter frustration, after nearly 300 recently-delivered new cars were suddenly pulled from service last week.
The issue, according to The New York Times, was a concern that doors could open while trains were moving. Actually, that sounds familiar: the T's new Orange Line cars were briefly taken out of service last year to fix the doors.
Boston is, of course, a tiny hamlet compared with New York, and the 300 cars pulled off the subway there are a fraction of its 6,000-car fleet.
The Big Apple's trains were built by Canadian industrial giant Bombardier. This latest issue isn't the first for the new fleet: the delivery was delayed, several cars were pulled from service for software issues last year, and New York's comptroller issued a harsh report faulting the Metropolitan Transit Authority for not managing the contract well, according to the Times.
In Boston, the 404 new cars slated to join the Orange and Red lines over the next few years are being assembled by the Chinese company CRRC at a Springfield factory. The T has put a silver lining on its problems with the Orange Line cars, arguing that it's better to catch issues early in the delivery, so fixes can be incorporated as the rest of the fleet is being built.
More weekend shutdowns
Meanwhile, that new Orange Line train won't be around much on weekends this winter — nor will many other trains on the line, for that matter.
The T will shutter train service between Sullivan Square and Tufts Medical Center stations almost every weekend through Feb. 16, starting next week. (One exception: the line will continue to operate the weekend of Jan. 31-Feb. 2.)
Shuttle buses will run along the closed portion of the line during this period, though they won't stop at Downtown Crossing, State Street, or Chinatown. Instead, the T says riders trying to arrive at those stops should instead travel from Haymarket or North Station to nearby Green Line stations.
The shutdowns will start Friday nights at 8:45 p.m., with service resuming Monday mornings.
The T will use the weekends to quickly replace more than 1,000 feet of track, mostly around North Station, and complete other work elsewhere along the line.
With commuters desperate for improvement, the T has said it is better to take on the work in sprints, rather than spread it out over longer periods of time; the agency hasn't ruled out potential shutdowns during the week.
The Red Line is also scheduled for shutdowns between Harvard and Alewife most weekends through April to continue work on the line's track bed.
Both the Red and Orange lines had similar weekend track work in late 2019.
Once the trains return, officials are warning they will likely run slower for a short period because of speed restrictions in place to allow the new track to settle — an inconvenience commuters faced after the fall shutdowns, too.

Texto completo: Jennifer Garner announced on Instagram on Friday that she would be keeping her day job.
The actress and mother of three shared a photo of a check written to her by her son, Samuel, for a whopping $168. 42. The 7-year-old wrote that the reason for the check for his mother was for "being my mama. "
And the lime green check comes right from the official "Piggy Bank" and is complete with a date written out: Dec. 25, 2019.
Garner, 47, shared a photo of the check on her Instagram account: "Apparently, birthing and raising someone is valued at $168. 42. I guess I should keep my day job," she wrote in the caption with two hashtags, "#iwouldbehismamaforfree" and "ohwaitIalreadyam. "
Celebs were quick to respond to Garner's post on Instagram, including Mindy Kaling, who laughed, and New York Times Columnist Nicholas Kristof, who wrote, "I suspect there are other non-monetary compensations!!!"
Garner who also has two daughters with former husband Ben Affleck, Seraphina Rose Elizabeth, 11, and Violet , 14.
She has posted about motherhood frequently on her Instagram, at one point even sharing a hilarious "back to school" meme that she created herself.
In an interview with People, she said that motherhood has changed her in a lot of ways. Part of the beauty of motherhood, she told People, is that seeing one's children at varying stages and different moments, especially the thoughtful ones.
"You don't see your kids being your idealized version of them all the time," Garner said. "But if you can just have faith in your own in who you are and who they are as people, it's so beautiful when you see it starting to come out. "

Texto completo: For now we seem to have averted an all-out shooting war between the United States and Iran.
Yet it's not over. The world is more dangerous than it was a week ago, and President Donald Trump's exuberance suggests that he may have learned precisely the wrong lesson from his clash with Iran.
Trump and some of his supporters are crowing at the lack of American casualties - Iran may have carefully aimed so as to miss people - in ways that remind me of the hubris preceding the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As there were then, there are today concerns about whether intelligence has been overstated, leaders are thumping their chests and there's too much confidence in the ability of the military toolbox to solve complex problems.
Trump, who in 2012 repeatedly claimed that President Barack Obama would start a war with Iran to help win reelection, is already running election ads on Facebook trumpeting his killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani and saying that this is "keeping America safe." Hmm. Look at the results so far:
- Iran has cast off nuclear curbs so that it is now potentially within five months of having enough fuel for a nuclear warhead, down from almost 15 years when Trump took office.
- United States forces may be pushed out of Iraq, allowing Soleimani to achieve in death one of his foremost goals in life.
- American forces in Syria may be difficult to support without the military presence in Iraq, so some or all of them might pull out as well, another strategic victory for Iran.
- The military campaign against the Islamic State is on hold, giving terrorists a chance to regroup.
- Iran's regime, which had been threatened by enormous protests at home and in Iraq, has been rescued by Trump's actions. Iranians have rallied around the flag, and the Iraqi narrative has changed overnight from the bullying of Iranians to the bullying of Americans.
- Instead of bringing troops home, Trump has had to deploy more to the Middle East at huge cost. We may think we can't afford universal pre-K, but we don't blink at lavishing billions of dollars on these military deployments.
- North Korea has gained leverage, because it knows that Trump has little appetite for two international security crises at the same time. Kim Jong Un has also surely absorbed the lesson that he must never give up his nuclear warheads, as Trump will strike countries that lack nuclear weapons while schmoozing with leaders who have them.
So much winning! And there will be more.
It's true that Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said that Iran's response had "concluded," but Zarif is a moderate often outmaneuvered by hard-liners. I know this partly because back in 2004, after Zarif approved a visa for me, I was detained in Iran by security forces looking for information that could embarrass Zarif and get him fired.
My best guess is that Iran will strike back hard in a way that leaves it some plausible deniability. Perhaps it'll be a truck bomb at a diplomatic mission or Trump property, or perhaps rocket attacks on a military site by a proxy, or a cyberattack on an oil refinery or the power grid, or perhaps mines that damage oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has options, and let's not celebrate prematurely.
One reason to worry is that both sides have shown such a capacity for bellicosity and miscalculation.
Trump miscalculated by initially failing to respond adequately to a series of Iranian provocations beginning in May, leading to underdeterrence. Then he overreacted on Dec. 29, with strikes that killed two dozen people, and then again with the killing of Soleimani, in each case failing to appreciate the risks to Americans in Iraq.
As for Iran, the best evidence of Soleimani's miscalculation is simple: He's dead.
Perhaps the most consistent foreign policy mistake that the United States has made in my lifetime is a failure to appreciate nationalism, from Vietnam to Afghanistan, Iraq to Latin America. It's an odd mistake for a country that was born because King George III failed to accommodate our own nationalism. Yet today as well we often overstate Iran's religiosity but underappreciate its nationalist sensitivities.
I've found on my visits to Iran that when we don't muck things up, ordinary Iranians are among the most pro-American people in the region. That time I was detained in Iran, my bags were carefully examined and X-rayed by a security goon, who snarled at me: "American reporters - bad!" Another X-ray operator nearby apparently didn't quite realize what was going on, because he beamed at me and said in the friendliest of tones: "Americans - very good!"
Some day, people like the second X-ray operator will inherit his country, if we can avoid wars and manage the nuclear crisis. But the basic rule in international security, as in medicine, is "first, do no harm," and Trump has violated that.

What happened to ‘Better Call Saul?'

Texto completo: TV Q&A

What happened to "Better Call Saul"?

It took a break. It may have felt like a long one but, as I have mentioned before, many shows take longer hiatuses (and make fewer episodes) than in TV's olden days. "Better Call Saul" will begin a 10-episode fifth season Feb. 23 on AMC.

According to the network, "Jimmy McGill's decision to practice law as ‘Saul Goodman' creates unexpected and profound waves of change for those in his orbit." And AMC will set the stage with a big showcase of "Breaking Bad," the series that led to "Better Call Saul." A five-week "Breaking Bad" marathon will present all the episodes of that series on each Sunday from Jan. 19 to Feb. 16. Also on Feb. 16, AMC will air "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie," which picks up after the end of "Breaking Bad" and debuted on Netflix.

For years I've DVR'd CNBC's "Nightly Business Report" on PBS to watch the next morning as I'm getting ready for work. Co-host Bill Griffeth made an announcement on Dec. 27 that the program was ending, and that was its last broadcast. Why? Cost? Competition? Low ratings? It was fair, succinct, politically neutral and remarkably helpful in understanding how current happenings affect the markets. I will definitely miss it.

The increased availability of business programming was a major reason for the end of the series after more than 40 years on the air. When it began, news service Current reported, "It was the only television show to offer a full evaluation of daily events on Wall Street." But since then, entire cable channels and online services devoted to business have come along, including CNBC, which bought the show in 2013 and has produced it for public television since then. But cuts in staff and funding had begun even before then and more changes followed under CNBC, eventually leading to this biggest change of all.

I just finished watching all seven seasons of "The West Wing" on Netflix. It ended with Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen) ending his time as president and Matt Santos taking over. Was anything ever done to continue the series or start a spinoff? I really wanted to see what was going to happen next.

The drama about the folks working in the White House certainly left the door open for a continuation with a new administration with its 2006 series finale, but sagging ratings prompted NBC to end things then. Now the show seems loved even more now than when it ended in 2006 -- "an idealistic alternative reality" to current politics, as the New York Times put it late last year. While it has some serious flaws, it remains engrossing. I watched the whole thing again last year. And if you Google "West Wing sequel" you will find nearly annual reports of this or that possible new "West Wing." But so far none appears to have gotten past chatter.

Ransom Riggs comes to BookPeople

Texto completo: Something peculiar happened to children’s books in 2011.
Ransom Riggs introduced readers to a world of young people with special powers, time loops and soul-hunting spirits in “Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children.”
Illustrated with eerie vintage photographs, the novel spent two years on the New York Times bestseller list, launched a multivolume literary universe and inspired the 2016 Tim Burton film of the same name.
The fifth novel in the series, “The Conference of the Birds,” hits shelves Jan. 14, and Riggs will showcase it in Austin on Jan. 20.
Peculiars are children with unusual powers, like levitation or invisibility. Series hero Jacob Portman, hunting for the answers behind his grandfather’s death, initially discovers the peculiars on an island off the coast of Wales, watched over in an infinite time loop by Miss Peregrine, who can shape-shift into her namesake bird. Their world is threatened by hollowgasts, who feed off the souls of peculiars, and wights, who have consumed enough of those souls to assume human form (albeit with spooky all-white eyes).
Throughout the books, Jacob and his friends have traveled to London, peculiar capital of the world, and to America, where some of the same characters started a new adventure in “A Map of Days.”
“Birds” starts where “Days” left off, with Jacob and newly recruited peculiar Noor on the run from those who want to capture her. A forbidding prophecy commands Noor’s safety, and Jacob knows that means he must get her to the mysterious V, a former associate of his grandfather’s.
Easier said than done, of course. With each of the books in the series, Riggs uncovers more of the peculiar world underpinning our own. As Jacob explains what he’s gleaned over the course of his adventures, we learn along with Noor.
“Do you ever get used to it?” Noor asks Jacob after they slip through another time loop from modern-day Chinatown in New York to Industrial Age 19th-century London.
“I still have moments where I look around and my head swims,” he says. “Like I’m in the grip of some … ”
“‘Nightmare?’
“‘I was going to say dream.’
“She nodded, a small assent, and I felt a shared recognition flicker between us: of a darkness mutually understood, and of a thin, golden thread of wonder and hope that ran through the fabric of the new world. There is more, it said. There is more to the universe than you ever imagined.”
Riggs’ appearance is just one of many worthy authors for young people on the lineup this month at BookPeople, starting Saturday. Austin brothers Jarrett and Jerome Pumphrey launch their stellar picture book “The Old Truck” (Norton, $17.95) at 2 p.m. “Truck” celebrates the power of persistence through the title vehicle, with a sweetly profound story about a young girl and her African American farming family. (Ages 4-8.) Then at 5 p.m., Austin’s Carolyn Cohagan unveils “Time’s Up” (Girls With Pens, $14.95), the finale to her female-focused dystopian trilogy that draws its world-building in part from restrictive religious mores around the globe. Cohagan, who also helms creative writing workshops for teens, wraps up her story with Mina and Juda returning to Manhattan with orders to assassinate the Divine Leader. (Ages 12 and older.)
Later in January, Houston’s Saadia Faruqi highlights a quartet of her newest Yasmin adventures, with the irrepressible second-grader exploring her roles as friend, gardener, soccer star and writer (All, Picture Window Books, $5.95 each). First introduced in 2018’s “Meet Yasmin,” Faruqi’s young hero enjoys experiences both universal (challenging class projects) and distinctive (her multigenerational Pakistani family). Illustrated by Hatem Aly, these books are a wonderfully diverse window into Yasmin’s world. Faruqi will be at BookPeople at 2 p.m. Jan. 18. (Ages 5-9.)
A trio of young adult authors round out the month with a panel steeped in magic and fantasy. Isabel Ibanez draws on Bolivian history for her debut novel, “Woven in Moonlight” (Page Street, $18.99), a richly entertaining political romp set at a royal court. Adrienne Young returns to the Viking-esque world of “Sky in the Deep” with “The Girl the Sea Gave Back” (Wednesday, $18.99), a tale of a tattooed warrior with special powers. And Shea Ernshaw maps the linked stories of witch Nora and once-missing boy Oliver in the alluringly scary “Winterwood” (Simon Pulse, $18.99). The three writers will appear at 7 p.m Jan. 31. (All, ages 14 and older.)

Texto completo: New York
Exhibitions based on the collection of a fashionista don't always thrill. Recalling the 2006 Met show "Nan Kempner: American Chic," I still see a floating rack bunched with way too many lunching-lady blazers. And the 2015 show on Jacqueline de Ribes, a countess who was a couturier for a time and deeply cultured, nevertheless smacked of society first, design second, which is why her own work went only so far. When you're too inside, you can't see how narrow your vision has become. "Rara Avis," a 2005 exhibition fashioned from the wardrobe of woman-about-world Iris Apfel, was inspiring because Ms. Apfel has kept herself outside, honing a textile-driven bohemian style that is wide-eyed (look at her signature eyeglasses—two big round O's), enlarged by historical and cultural references. The Met exhibition "In Pursuit of Fashion: The Sandy Schreier Collection" introduces us to another outsider.
In Pursuit of Fashion: The Sandy Schreier Collection
The Met Fifth Avenue Through May 17
Truth be told, the name Sandy Schreier—and the Ali Baba's treasure connected with it—has been reverently mentioned in fashion circles for decades, not least by museum curators. But Ms. Schreier lives way outside those circles, in a suburb of the city in which she was born, Detroit. Her parents moved there in the 1930s so that her father, who worked for the Manhattan specialty store Russeks, could manage the fur salon of the fledgling Detroit branch. All that auto-industry money! All those couture-wearing wives! When a new sister demanded her mother's attention, Sandy accompanied her father to work—she was only 3 or 4 years old—and pored over Vogue and Harper's Bazaar while experiencing hands-on the enchantment of French and American high design. No igniting moment, no epiphany. The little girl instinctively knew that fashion could be art and she would collect it. (New York's Museum of Modern Art still hasn't figured this out.)
Ms. Schreier was not curating her own wardrobe—as another prescient girl, Marjorie Merriweather Post, decided to do back in the early 1900s—but preserving "beauty." The power of her passion led Detroit wives to give her their once-worn, still-perfect pieces. As she told the New York Times in July, "One Halloween my mother insisted I wear one of the dresses as my costume and I had a huge temper tantrum and refused. Even then, I didn't want anyone wearing them. I always said, 'If I owned a Picasso, it would not be on my back.'"
Piece by piece, her pristine "Picassos"—eventually numbering in the thousands—added up to one of the finest private collections in the country. Planning for the future, Ms. Schreier recently invited the Met's Costume Institute to choose "promised gifts" for its collection. The current exhibition displays 80 of the 165 pieces the Institute picked—all from the 20th and 21st centuries, many filling gaps in its archive—and they are choice.
The garment that greets viewers as they enter the downstairs gallery sets the tone. It's a magnificent evening sheath circa 1923, a lace of pink silk gauze with Egyptian motifs in gold-metal thread; across the hips is the stylized image of a flying ibis rendered in pink and aqua stones. The dress was owned by Matilda Dodge Wilson, widow of the founder of Dodge Motor Co., and it speaks to the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, an archaeological find that had everyone buzzing. The ibis symbolizes fertility, so its spread-winged placement upon the pelvis is dramatically pointed, but it also symbolizes communication. One of Ms. Schreier's important early acquisitions, the dress is emblematic of her collecting criteria: expression on many levels at once—historical, poetic, social—with imaginative flight sewn in. Created by Madeleine & Madeleine, a short-lived Parisian house that most of us have never heard of, it's a first for the Met collection.
Organized by Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute, associate curator Jessica Regan and assistant curator Mellissa Huber, this focused show, elegantly paced, is divided into four main areas of interest—Ms. Schreier's interests. The first section, "In Pursuit of Beauty: Origins of a Collection"—exquisite and allusive postwar pieces—holds the fewest surprises, though the late-Dior "Du Barry" dress (autumn/winter 1957-58) is scrumptious, and the juxtaposition of Charles James's floating black "Swan" dress (1952-54) and Jacques Griffe's pyramidal black taffeta (c. 1955) is fascinating for what they say about below-the-waist storytelling.
"The Past Recaptured," in a word sublime, offers an array of Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo's jackets, tunics and pleated "Delphos" dresses alongside the work of the Italian designer, another name new to me, Maria Monaci Gallenga, who took inspiration from Fortuny and appears every bit his match. Upon velvet, both designers printed antiquity's brocade patterns in gold and silver, using secret processes that left the fabric supple and comfortable to wear. Gallenga's two evening capes, circa 1925, are mesmerizingly operatic—held notes scaled to history. "L'Esprit Nouveau: The Interwar Era" captures the swift cycling of silhouettes from the 1920s to the '30s—from the Lanvin and Boué Soeurs "robe de style" silhouette of flat chest and wide hips, to electrically beaded flapper shifts, to body-skimming gowns by Chanel and Vionnet.
Perhaps the fourth section, "The Message Is the Medium: Fashion That Speaks," best captures Ms. Schreier's desire for articulate invention. Rudi Gernreich's trompe l'oeil, Christian Francis Roth's sunny-side-up surrealism, Patrick Kelly's silvery sleight of hand, Moschino's metaphor (a glove is a hand) and Philip Treacy's metamorphosis (a brainstorm of multicolored Monarch butterflies)—the room is alive with wit. The little Bes-Ben "doll" hat, circa 1946, with six small red-leather lobsters grouped on top, nods literally to the lobsters of Elsa Schiaparelli and Charles James—designers who consciously fused fashion and art. I'm guessing Ms. Schreier had to have it.

Texto completo: This time last year, the political future of Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, was in ruins.
She had resigned as chairwoman of her party after it suffered a humiliating defeat in regional elections. Party elders urged her not to seek reelection. The premier she appointed quit to challenge her in the party's primary last summer.
Now, with the Saturday election nearing, Tsai has made a comeback that seemed impossible only a few months ago. She mostly has China to thank.
China's undisguised belligerence toward Taiwan has given Tsai's campaign a new vigor. So have the protests in Hong Kong over China's steady encroachment on that territory's autonomy.
Tsai and her supporters regularly cite the tumult in Hong Kong as evidence of why Taiwan, an island democracy that has been functionally independent since 1949, cannot simply surrender to China's demands to unite.
"We know the responsibility we bear," Tsai, 63, said at a rally in New Taipei City, where she pledged to a stadium full of cheering, flag-waving supporters to preserve Taiwan as "a beacon of democracy" in the face of efforts by China to undercut it.
"Taiwan is on the front line," she said.
For Beijing, a second four-year term for Tsai would amount to a repudiation of the pressure tactics that it has wielded against Taiwan ever since she took power in 2016. As a policy failure, it would echo the overwhelming victory scored by the democratic opposition in Hong Kong's district elections in November.
The vision of a China Dream extolled by the country's leader, Xi Jinping, it seems, has little appeal to people when they are given the chance to vote on it.
A former deputy director of the office overseeing Taiwan affairs publicly acknowledged the failure at a policy forum in December, saying that China needed to rethink "our own working methods and approach."
Instead of enticing people in Taiwan to draw closer, Xi's policies have pushed them further away, and a recognition of that reality is already raising unusually public concerns in Beijing. An annual government survey in Taiwan found that barely 1% of Taiwanese favored unification "as soon as possible."
Since Tsai took office in May 2016, China has largely refused to engage with her government. Instead, Beijing has issued threats against Tsai's aims to "split" China, and flexed its military muscle. It has also restricted economic and cultural ties, including the flow of tourists -- all in the hopes of undermining her political support.
At the same time, it offered incentives to Taiwanese businesses and support for her political opponents, including the Kuomintang. China's tactics have involved what officials and analysts have described as covert efforts to spread disinformation and otherwise undercut Tsai's administration.
Those efforts spilled into the public after a man claiming to be a disillusioned operative for Chinese military intelligence detailed for the Australian authorities an extraordinary -- if still largely unverified -- litany of secret operations aimed at advancing China's interests in Taiwan, as well as Hong Kong.
Those operations, he claimed, included providing support for Tsai's opponent, Han Kuo-yu. A former legislator with a populist agenda, Han was elected mayor of Kaohsiung, the southern port city, the same race in which Tsai's party was routed.
Han, 62, has denied receiving support from China, even suggesting that the accusations of Chinese skulduggery were part of a plot by Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party. The public furor, though, has put Han -- with his comparatively conciliatory views toward China -- on the defensive.
As mayor and now as a presidential candidate, Han has called for a greater effort to smooth relations with China. In March, only months after being elected, he crossed the Taiwan Strait to visit four Chinese cities.
Han claimed the goal of his visit was to drum up sales for Kaohsiung farmers and fishermen, and Chinese state media touted an agreement for $30 million in new trade. He also met officials from the Communist government who oversee relations with Hong Kong and Macao under the formula called "one country, two systems."
When the protests erupted in Hong Kong three months later, Han was forced to declare that he would never accept such an arrangement for Taiwan. Now, in his stump speeches on the campaign trail, he barely mentions China at all, reflecting how toxic the issue has become for voters across the political spectrum.
Han has focused his attacks instead on Tsai's handling of the economy and other bread-and-butter issues that are often on voters' minds as much as China. "Only I can make Taiwan strong," Han said at one rally, standing in front of a sign that reflected his populist message: "Safety for Taiwan, money for the people."
Tsai and her surrogates never miss a chance to tar him for his association with China.
When the two squared off for the first time at a sort of televised debate Dec. 18, Han railed at her for losing Taiwan's dwindling diplomatic allies, most recently two tiny Pacific nations. The world, he said, had forgotten about Taiwan during her tenure.
She retorted: "Just now Han said the world has forgotten Taiwan. That's probably because he's going to China a bit too much."
Last January, Xi set the tone in a speech declaring that unification between China and Taiwan was "the great trend in history" and promising a similar "one country, two systems" model for Chinese rule over the island.
Tsai's latest campaign video warned that Xi's formula had failed Hong Kong, especially its youth.
"Only a few hundred kilometers away, countless young people are being arrested, being locked up, being mistreated, being disappeared," the narrator says, then adds. "From the beginning, 'one country, two systems' has been a dictatorship."
Hong Kong was "a wake-up call" that validated Tsai's efforts to forge deeper economic and political ties beyond China, said Lai I-Chung, an adviser to Tsai's party and president of the Prospect Foundation, a think tank in Taipei.
"What's happening to these youngsters is resonating with the youth in Taiwan," he said of the protest movement, which has received support from Taiwanese activists and church leaders, if not the government. "This is not something abstract."

Buckingham Palace scurries to resolve Harry, Meghan crisis

Texto completo: Prince Harry and Meghan's shocking announcement that they plan to become part-time royals caused a painful rupture in his family. But it has also forced Buckingham Palace to confront the changing nature of British royal life as the era of Queen Elizabeth II draws to a close. \ On Friday, the palace convened an emergency meeting to address the couple's proposal that they "step back" from their royal duties, seek financial independence and live part of the year in North America. The goal, according to people with ties to the palace, was to find a quick accommodation with the couple, who have become dangerously isolated in the House of Windsor.
Meghan, also known as the Duchess of Sussex, flew to Canada alone after the announcement to care for the couple's 8-month-old son, Archie, who was staying there with a friend. Her hasty departure suggested that, however the palace chooses to respond, things are not going to return to normal.
While Friday's meeting was aimed at easing the crisis and finding a new arrangement for Harry and Meghan, people with ties to the palace said it would have broader implications. Whatever concessions or stipulations Buckingham Palace agrees to could potentially be applied to other members of the family, since the royal family has always been guided by precedent.
Private secretaries for the queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry all took part in the session. William had a particular interest, one person close to the palace said, because his younger children, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, will face the same predicament as his brother -- unlikely ever to sit on the throne, but still highly visible members of the family.
Charles, the longtime heir and Harry's father, has taken charge of the response to the crisis, much as he did in November after his brother, Prince Andrew, gave a calamitous interview to the BBC about his dealings with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Under pressure from Charles, the queen essentially stripped Andrew of his official duties.
Charles has long spoken of his desire to streamline the family during his reign, raising questions about how many members would continue to carry out official duties or receive funding from the state.
The queen, 93, has already reduced her public schedule. With the banishment of Andrew and the self-exile of Harry, the number of royals who shoulder the family's heavy schedule of charity events, diplomatic ceremonies and hospital visits would dwindle to a small, possibly overburdened, circle.
For all the bruised feelings, experts on the royal family said they did not expect the queen to lash out against the duke and duchess. Harry and Meghan, along with Archie, have come to symbolize the family's future -- global stars, with a multiracial family that has appeal throughout the Commonwealth.
"The queen is the first one to admit that she wants an amicable solution," said Dickie Arbiter, who served as a press secretary for the queen from 1988 to 2000. "It's important not just for Harry and Meghan; it's important to prevent the fracturing of the monarchy as an institution."
Still, the hurdles posed by the couple's plans are formidable, ranging from how they will earn a living to who will pay for their security. Many of those have implications for the public funding of the monarchy, which is based on the idea that the royal family is devoted full time to public service.
They have not ruled out spending part of the year in Southern California, where the duchess was raised and where her mother lives. Even in Canada, a member of the Commonwealth, their immigration status would be an issue.
The duke and duchess explained their thinking in a website they had designed by a Toronto firm over the past several months without any input from Buckingham Palace. They excluded their own palace staff from the announcement, leaving them uncertain of even keeping their jobs.

A new prejudice emerges on the left

Texto completo: A voter may dislike a black, homosexual or female candidate, but it's not likely that he would openly admit it. However, diversity-crazed leftist/progressive Democrats have openly condemned the physical characteristics of some of their 2020 presidential candidates.
Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are leading the polls despite the fact that they have been condemned as old white men. While Pete Buttigieg is homosexual, something that pleases diversity crazies, he is also a white man, young and religious. With Kamala Harris' departure from the race, the Democratic field has lost one of its persons of color. Another, Senator Cory Booker, stands at 2% in the polls; his days are numbered.
That means the only Democratic candidates polling high are those condemned as old white people - two men and one woman, Elizabeth Warren.
LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said she was initially eager for Joe Biden to enter the race but now has second thoughts. Brown said: "I'm over white men running the country. I don't know if him (sic) getting in changes the field. He has name recognition, but his strength is also his weakness." Former presidential candidate Howard Dean lamented, "If we have two old white guys at the top of this ticket, we will lose."
Michael Bloomberg had to apologize for what some see as his diversity insensitiveness namely that of calling fellow presidential candidate Cory Booker "well-spoken" in a TV interview. The New Jersey senator said he was "taken aback" by what he saw as Bloomberg's racist "trope."
Michael Moore gave us his racist warning: "Two-thirds of all white guys voted for Trump. That means anytime you see three white guys walking at you, down the street toward you, two of them voted for Trump. You need to move over to the other sidewalk because these are not good people that are walking toward you. You should be afraid of them."
This is the new racism, much of it learned and taught at our nation's colleges. George Orwell said, "Some ideas are so stupid that only intellectuals believe them." The stupid ideas about inclusion and diversity originate with academics on college campuses. If their ideas didn't infect the rest of society, they might be a source of entertainment. But these cancerous ideas have infected society. Statements such as "I'm over white men running the country," or "If we have two old white guys at the top of this ticket, we will lose" are examples of that cancer.
Last year, Philip Carl Salzman wrote "The War Against White People" in Minding the Campus. He declared: "Anti-white hate is now mainstream American culture. Not just by racial extremists such as Black Lives Matter, for whom statements such as "all lives matter" or "blue lives matter" are racist. Our highest leaders sing the same song."
When Barack Obama was campaigning for the presidency in 2008, he said of working-class white voters, "They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations."
During the 2016 presidential campaign, candidate Hillary Clinton claimed that half of Donald Trump's supporters were "a basket of deplorables" who were "racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic - you name it." Do you think Clinton was talking about Trump's black, Asian and Hispanic supporters? No, she was talking about millions of Trump's white supporters.
Then there's Sarah Jeong, a member of The New York Times editorial board and graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard Law School. She expressed publicly many anti-white opinions. Among them are: "The world could get by just fine with zero white people." "[expletive] white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs [expletive] on fire hydrants." It's "kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men." I guarantee you that The New York Times would have fired any employee making similar statements about black, Hispanic or homosexual people.
The bottom line is that the new racism, born in academia, is just as ugly as the old racism.

Texto completo: Kelly breaks silence on 'Bombshell'
Megyn Kelly is finally speaking out about the movie "Bombshell," which explores sexual harassment at her former employer, Fox News.
"I wasn't sure if I wanted to say anything re 'Bombshell,' a film re sex harass. at Fox," the lawyer-turned-anchor tweeted Thursday ahead of posting the nearly 30-minute segment on her YouTube and IGTV channels. "But in the end I wanted the women who lived it to have the last word."
Kelly is portrayed in "Bombshell" by Charlize Theron, who said she didn't talk with the anchor before doing the film because she thought it would put too much pressure on both of them.
In the video, Kelly had a negative reaction to a scene in the film where Margot Robbie's character essentially blames Kelly's silence for the continuing harassment, and Theron's Kelly responds, "Look around, snowflake. How do you think a woman gets a prime-time Fox show?"
Kelly claims she still wouldn't cut the scene from the film because it represents a real regret for her in her career. "I've looked back on my own life, every moment from that moment forward and I do wish I had done more. Even though I was powerless, even though it would've been a suicidal move for me careerwise, what if I had just said, 'screw it?' " she said.
As for the infamous "spin" in Fox CEO Roger Ailes' office, Kelly, who left Fox News in 2017, admitted she did it: "I know people think it's like, 'Oh, you had to spin around,' but I remember feeling like ... I put myself through school. I was offered a partnership at Jones Day, one of the best law firms in the world. I argued before federal courts of appeal all over the nation. I came here, I'm covering the United States Supreme Court. I graduated with honors from all my programs - and now he wants me to twirl?
"And I did it," Kelly said. "If you don't get how demeaning that is, I can't help you."

Texto completo: Megyn Kelly is finally speaking out about the movie "Bombshell," which explores sexual harassment at her former employer, Fox News.
"I wasn't sure if I wanted to say anything re 'Bombshell,' a film re sex harass. at Fox," the lawyer-turned-anchor tweeted Thursday ahead of posting the nearly 30-minute segment on her YouTube and IGTV channels. "But in the end I wanted the women who lived it to have the last word."
Kelly is portrayed in "Bombshell" by Charlize Theron, who said she didn't talk with the anchor before doing the film because she thought it would put too much pressure on both of them.
In the video, Kelly had a negative reaction to a scene in the film where Margot Robbie's character essentially blames Kelly's silence for the continuing harassment, and Theron's Kelly responds, "Look around, snowflake. How do you think a woman gets a prime-time Fox show?"
Kelly claims she still wouldn't cut the scene from the film because it represents a real regret for her in her career. "I've looked back on my own life, every moment from that moment forward and I do wish I had done more. Even though I was powerless, even though it would've been a suicidal move for me careerwise, what if I had just said, 'screw it?' " she said.
As for the infamous "spin" in Fox CEO Roger Ailes' office, Kelly, who left Fox News in 2017, admitted she did it: "I know people think it's like, 'Oh, you had to spin around,' but I remember feeling like ... I put myself through school. I was offered a partnership at Jones Day, one of the best law firms in the world. I argued before federal courts of appeal all over the nation. I came here, I'm covering the United States Supreme Court. I graduated with honors from all my programs - and now he wants me to twirl?
"And I did it," Kelly said. "If you don't get how demeaning that is, I can't help you."

Texto completo: Books may be made of paper and slim enough to fit into a bag, but they have the power to transport readers to another time and place, change moods from sad to happy and back again, and keep their owners up all night in suspense. For many, there's nothing like perusing the aisles of a good bookstore, spotting an enticing title, holding it and feeling the promise of a good time ahead. We asked the owners of some of Bergen's favorite bookstores to name fiction and non-fiction must-reads, and to share the advantages of buying local. Here's what they have to say.
Kenny Sarfin — owner of Books and Greetings in Northvale Great work of nonfiction: Catch and Kill by Ronan Farrow (Little, Brown and Company, 2019)
"This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse. And it's the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement." [As described on Booktable.net]
Great work of fiction: What Happens in Paradise by Elin Hilderbrand (Little, Brown and Company, 2019)
"Hilderbrand's winter series takes place in St. John and is the perfect book to curl up on the couch with on a cold winter day. [As described on the author's website:] A year ago, Irene Steele had the shock of her life: her loving husband, father to their grown sons and successful businessman, was killed in a helicopter crash. But that wasn't Irene's only shattering news: he'd also been leading a double life on the island of St. John, where another woman loved him, too."
Advantages of neighborhood bookstores: "People like shopping local because they get a personal touch. We get to know our customers and what they like to read and recommend books to them. You can't get that online. Our customers become our friends."
Matt Whiteley — owner of Gotham Underground in Ramsey Great work of fiction: Daytripper by Fabio Moon Gabriel Ba (Vertigo Comics/DC Comics, 2011)
"Daytripper is arguably one of the best graphic novels in the past 20 years. It does not necessarily transport the reader away from the cold of winter, but it is set in the South American tropics, where the weather is always warm. The book follows Bras de Oliva Domingos from childhood to his golden years and how he navigates life, love, loss and mortality. The book recognizes that all the small moments in life are just as important as the biggest ones and that death is not to be feared, but is an important part of humanity. Daytripper is also one of the most beautifully drawn and colored books we have seen in years."
Great work of nonfiction: Maus: A Survivor's Tale Volumes 1 & 2, written and illustrated by Art Spiegleman (Pantheon, 1996)
"Maus is considered by many to be the best graphic novel ever created. The book tells the story of two generations of Holocaust Survivors: Vladek, Spiegleman's father who survived Auschwitz, and Artie, his son. The characters in the books are anthropomorphized, where the Nazis are cats and the Jews are mice. This is a visual representation that allows the reader to take in much of the brutality without the stark humanization. Spiegleman visited his father at his home in Queens, the Catskills and his hospital room with a tape recorder, and interviewed his father about his past in Europe in order to create the comic. This book speaks to relationships, love, history and the will to survive."
Advantages of neighborhood bookstores: "Purchasing books from our shop instead of an online retailer is better for a few reasons. The first and probably most important is that the customer comes into a store filled with things they love or never heard of and can get recommendations from employees or other customers. The store creates a sense of community where like-minded individuals can meet and discuss their interests.
"Also, buying a book in person gives you the opportunity to examine it, touch the pages and judge the condition. You know exactly what you are buying. Whereas no matter how great the pictures, descriptions and reviews of a book online, you run the risk of not receiving the item as it was described. And does anyone want to pay extra for shipping costs? Shopping locally in your town or county is better for the environment and community."
Chris Lutz — manager of The Curious Reader in Glen Rock Great work of fiction: All The Greys On Green Street by Laura Tucker (Viking Books for Young Readers, 2019)
"This artsy debut middle grade novel is heady, beautiful and one of my favorite books of the year. A moving story of family and mental illness, this book is both warm and poetic, and a truly welcome read for kids and adults alike."
Great work of nonfiction: It Began With a Page: How Gyo Fujikawa Drew the Way by Kyo Maclear, illustrated by Julie Morstad (HarperCollins, 2019)
"Some of my favorite nonfiction books are picture books, as the best ones have an almost mystical way of distilling something complicated down to the barest essentials. This is exactly that kind of book. It's the true story of how a legendary illustrator came to be and the kinds of systematic racism and sexism that she had to slog through. Excellent and illuminating."
Advantages of neighborhood bookstores: "The Curious Reader is a unique children's bookstore that specializes in the offbeat and unusual. We're lucky to be part of our community and connecting with kids through the books that they read. This magic is something that an online-only retailer simply can't do."
Walter Boyer — co-owner of Bookends in Ridgewood Great work of fiction: Ask Again, Yes by Mary Beth Keane (Scribner, 2019)
"A very engaging, moving story about two families dealing with a shared tragedy. Written by a local author, Mary Beth Keane from Pearl River, New York." (She will be appearing at The Ridgewood Public Library on Wednesday March 11 at 7 p.m.)
Great work of nonfiction: Educated by Tara Westover (Random House, 2018)
"A coming-of-age story about a woman who grew up in a dysfunctional family, and how she escapes through education."
Advantages of neighborhood bookstores: "In addition to a full selection of children's, young adult and adult titles, Bookends offers the largest selection of autographed books signed by sports stars, musicians, celebrities, politicians and New York Times bestselling authors in New Jersey. We also host author events at our store, and work with local schools, libraries and women's clubs who host author events to the tune of 125-150 events per year."

Texto completo: "The last year was very stressful. ...
I was getting anxiety attacks. ...
I see it like a nightmare."
Jorge Garcia, talking about being deported to Mexico
After almost two years in Mexico, Jorge Garcia — whose deportation in January 2018 became a national story after a Free Press report — is back home in metro Detroit.
Garcia, 41, arrived at Detroit Metro Airport last month on Christmas Day, hugged by his two children and wife shedding tears of joy, his family members said.
"I'm really happy" to be back, Garcia, of Lincoln Park, said Friday. "The last year was very stressful, it got to the point where my blood pressure was very high, I was getting anxiety attacks. ... I see it like a nightmare ... something like a bad dream."
Garcia was granted two waivers by U.S. immigration officials with the Department of Homeland Security, said his attorney Mayra Lorenzana-Miles. He is now a lawful permanent resident of the U.S., getting his official card this week, and is on a path to U.S. citizenship in a few years, she said.
"Welcome Home Jorge," read a large banner inside a room at the Lincoln Park public library on Friday afternoon, where supporters gathered to celebrate his homecoming.
The Free Press reported on Garcia's deportation on Jan. 15, 2018, capturing his emotional farewell at Detroit Metro Airport as tearful family members hugged him one last time before he was escorted through security by a federal immigration agent. After 30 years living in the U.S. with no criminal record, he was kicked out of the country.
The Free Press story was picked up my numerous media outlets, including CNN, New York Times, BBC, prompting a national debate over immigration enforcement in the Trump administration. The Free Press later went to Mexico to report on Garcia's struggles in an unfamiliar country.
Garcia was born in Mexico and was brought to the U.S. as a child when he was 10 years old by an undocumented relative. He was too old to qualify for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), missing the age requirement by just one year. Since 2004, he and his family have been trying to obtain legal status, hiring attorneys and following the law.
Garcia was previously ordered removed from the U.S., but had gotten stays of removal. That changed after Donald Trump became president as authorities toughened immigration enforcement. In November 2017, Garcia was ordered to leave.
ICE officials have defended his deportation, saying that Garcia was "an unlawfully present citizen of Mexico" who "was ordered removed by an immigration judge in June 2006."
Garcia had no criminal record, worked as a landscaper, and paid his taxes, said advocates and U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn.
"He never got a traffic ticket," Dingell said at the homecoming celebration on Friday. "He worked hard. ... He had never done anything wrong."
Garcia got an interview in February at an American consulate office in Mexico, but was denied, said his wife, Cindy Garcia. His waivers were then approved in September, said his attorney.
Cindy Garcia was hoping he would be home in time for Halloween or maybe Thanksgiving, but authorities kept on asking for paperwork such as medical history, she said.
"The whole two years, we had PTSD, anxiety, depression," Cindy said.
"It was anxious not knowing when he could come home, your hopes resting on the timeline of government officials," she said.
"We just didn't know when" he could come home, she said.
Finally, he was approved just a few days before Dec. 25.
Cindy then bought him a plane ticket.
"I was on my way to the airport" in Mexico City, Jorge said, recalling his trip back to the U.S. "But I was in denial. I was thinking it wasn't true."
It wasn't until he got the necessary stamp after arriving in Detroit Metro Airport and seeing his family greet him that he finally did breathe a sigh of relief.
Cindy Garcia said she had told the children they were going to the airport to pick up an uncle because she wanted it to be a surprise and because she was still uncertain whether he would make it.
Almost two years prior, Cindy and her two kids sobbed at Detroit Metro Airport as they hugged Garcia before he was escorted away by immigration agents. On Dec. 25, they cried again at Detroit Metro Airport, but this time, there were tears of joy.
"I was surprised," said his son, Jorge Garcia Jr., 14, recalling the Christmas Day scene. "I started crying when I saw him."
Being without a father at home for two years "felt weird," he said. "It's been hard, not having a dad."
His daughter Soleil, said: "When I first saw him, I was crying because I was happy."
Soleil had to celebrate her Quinceañera (15thbirthday), a rite of passage for many Mexican American teenage girls, without her father. There's a traditional father-daughter dance she had to do instead with a grandfather.
"It was just very sad knowing that he wasn't here with us during certain events," she said.
The Garcias thanked Rep. Dingell and the UAW Local 600, of which Cindy is a member, and was supportive of them.
Rep. Dingell said "there are too many families that are being torn apart."
Pastor Jack Eggleston of Unity Lutheran Church in Southgate spoke at the homecoming at the library, introducing the Garcias.
"This has been a long ordeal," he said. "But the community has been aching with them."
Cindy said the two years without Jorge was emotionally tough for the family, with her and the two kids going through tough moments.
"My children have suffered," she said. "We screamed and yelled" at times, "but we got through this."
Meanwhile, Jorge was alienated living in Nicolas Romero, about one hour from Mexico City. He lived with an aunt, but didn't have any social connections that could help him establish a new life.
Now, Cindy said she intends to continue fighting for others who were in her situation, with families broken up by deportations. When Garcia was deported two years ago, supporters held up signs at the airport reading: 'Stop Separating Families.'
Cindy told the Free Press: "I am going to fight more than ever now for these broken immigration laws to be fixed so that no other family has to endure what we did because I know the feeling and I don't want any other children separated from their families because it's a hardship on the kids, on the parents, the whole family in general."
While in Mexico, Jorge bought a chain and medallion with an image on the front of Jesus Christ and on back of Our Lady of Guadalupe, an iconic figure for many Mexican Catholics.
He said his faith in her and religion gave him strength over the past two years.
"Basically, every day I was praying," Jorge told the Free Press. "I was praying for something to change. And it did."

Texto completo: Many good wines have a built-in defense against being consumed by children: They are inherently bitter, a flavor that children seem genetically hard-wired to abhor.
Eventually, taste buds evolve. Young adults come to love many bitter flavors, whether in beer, dark chocolate, arugula, Negronis, coffee or tea.
Despite the prevalence of bitter flavors in popular foods and beverages, many people resist the idea that bitterness can be a positive. The old saw has it that American wine consumers talk dry but drink sweet.
The negative connotation of bitterness extends to wine descriptions. Despite the many examples of excellent wines that contain bitter flavors, no producers want to associate their wine with the word bitter. Few consumers would find such a description to be particularly attractive.
Wine marketers know that the public will flock to wines described as smooth, silky, velvety, fruit-forward, spicy, bold and rich. Bitter? Not so much.
I'm hoping that 2020 might be a year for rehabilitating the notion of bitterness in wine. I started to think about this on a trip in November to northern Italy, a land where bitter flavors seem to be built into the cuisine.
On arriving in Milan, I had dinner at Carlo e Camilla, a restaurant serving creative interpretations of northern Italian food in a beautifully restored old mill.
Seeking a bit of warming comfort on a cold, rainy night, I ordered a glass of Valpolicella Classico and was delighted with its clear-as-a-bell flavors, ringing of tart cherry and ending with a refreshing bitterness that prompted the next sip.
The next day, I finished a quick pizza lunch with an espresso, pulled and poured into a tiny cup. It was the proverbial Italian coffee experience, just enough to bolt in one go - This one was ideal: smooth, radiant in flavor, bitter at the end and perfectly refreshing.
That night at dinner at Trattoria Masuelli San Marco, a traditional Milanese restaurant with a blessedly regional wine list, I drank an excellent Barolo Bricco Delle Viole 2007 from G.D. Vajra, vibrant and expressive with a touch of welcome bitterness as the other flavors faded away.
These beverages, though very different, had in common that punctuating bitterness. In each case, it was both cleansing and revitalizing, an acknowledgment of what had come before and a shift in attention to what would come next.
This attractive bitterness is one component of a spectrum of flavors that evolve directly from the fermentation of wine grapes. Wine can offer other forms of bitterness that may not always be so pleasing.
Tannic red wines can be astringent, a drying sensation in the mouth that can be experienced as bitter. Tannins that are part of a harmonious whole don't bother me, so long as they suit the intent of the wine.
I expect a top Barolo or Bordeaux to be tannic in youth. These tannins might be fine and barely detectable, yet firm enough to wrap up the flavors and nuances of the wines for quite a few years until they integrate. Then the youthful bitterness and astringency will largely evaporate to reveal the complexities within.
Similarly, a rustic young red from southern Italy might be robustly tannic yet still be a pleasure to drink, the astringency and bitterness of the tannins balancing out the sweet fruit.
Tannins generally come from the skins, seeds and stems of grapes, which is why white wines are rarely tannic. To provide wine with color, red grapes are crushed and macerated with their skins, and sometimes seeds and stems. To avoid color in white wines, the juice is whisked away from the pigment-bearing skins, with a notable exception.
That is the category of orange wines, white wines made as if they were reds, macerated with their skins until they take on an amber tinge. Depending on how long the juice stays in contact with the skins, these wines can become starkly tannic and quite bitter. It's all a matter of balance.
I find the welcome sort of bitterness most often in Italian reds. It doesn't matter which region or what grape, it seems to cut across both, whether Valpolicella of the Veneto, Barbera d'Asti of the Piedmont, Chianti Classico of Tuscany, the aglianicos of Campania or the Etna rossos of Sicily.
I find it in French wines, too, though not as pervasively. Good Beaujolais often has a welcome bitter component, as do the syrahs of the Northern Rhone, Bordeaux and cabernet francs of the Loire. In Spain, I sense it in traditionally made Riojas and the mencias of Ribeira Sacra.
Alcohol level plays a role, though. The higher the alcohol, particularly when you get to the range of 14.5% and above, the more likely a wine's procession of flavors will culminate in sweetness rather than bitterness. This is partly because of the elevated amount of glycerol found in high-alcohol wines. The combination of fruitiness, alcohol and glycerol contributes to a perception of sweetness, even if the wine contains no residual sugar.
The alcohol level in American wines can often provide a clue as to whether the wine will have a refreshing snappiness, of which bitterness is a component, or a flabby sweetness.
Sweet flavors of course are highly popular, whether in some of America's most expensive cult wines or in mass-produced supermarket wines. I don't quibble with anybody who enjoys them.
But stay aware of the flavors that make so many red wines so delicious, as well as other foods. Perhaps we can make 2020 a bitter year, and I mean that in the best possible way.

The divide over Trump has made us all stupid OP-ED

Texto completo: Donald Trump is impulse-driven, ignorant, narcissistic and intellectually dishonest. So you'd think that those of us in the anti-Trump camp would go out of our way to show we're not like him - that we are judicious, informed, mature and reasonable.
But the events of the past week have shown that the anti-Trump echo chamber is becoming a mirror image of Trump himself - overwrought, uncalibrated and incapable of having an intelligent conversation about any complex policy problem.
For example, there's a complex policy problem at the heart of this week's Iran episode. Iran is not powerful because it has a strong economy or military. It is powerful because it sponsors militias across the Middle East, destabilizing regimes and spreading genocide and sectarian cleansing. Over the past few years those militias, orchestrated by Qassem Suleimani, have felt free to operate more in the open with greater destructive effect.
We're not going to go in and destroy the militias. So how can we keep them in check so they don't destabilize the region? That's the hard problem - one that stymied past administrations.
In the Middle East, and wherever there are protracted conflicts, nations have a way to address this problem. They use violence as a form of communication. A nation trying to maintain order will assassinate a terrorism leader or destroy a terrorism facility. The attack says: "Hey, we know we're in a long-term conflict, but let's not let it get out of hand. That's not in either of our interests."
The attack is a way to seize control of the escalation process and set a boundary marker.
These sorts of operations have risks and rewards. A risk is that it won't cease the escalation, just accelerate it. The radicals on the other side will get enraged and take to the streets. Their leaders will have to appease that rage.
A reward is that maybe you do halt the escalation. The other side implicitly says: "Message received. We'll do some face-saving things to appease the streets, but we don't want this to get out of hand, either." Another reward is that you've managed to eliminate an effective terrorist like Suleimani. Talent doesn't grow on trees.
The decision to undertake this sort of operation is a matter of weighing risk and reward. And after the Suleimani killing, you saw American security professionals talk in the language of balancing risk and reward. Stanley McChrystal, a retired general, and Michael Mullen, a retired admiral, thought it was worth the risk. Susan Rice, a former national security adviser, thought it wasn't.
But in the anti-Trump echo chamber, that's not how most people were thinking. Led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, they avoided the hard, complex problem of how to set boundaries around militias. Instead, they pontificated on the easy question not actually on the table: Should we have a massive invasion of Iran?
A great cry went up from the echo chamber. We're on the brink of war! Trump is leading us to more endless wars in the Middle East! We're on the precipice of total chaos! This was not the calibrated language of risk and reward. It was fear-stoking apocalyptic language. By being so overwrought and exaggerated, the echo chamber drowned out any practical conversation about how to stabilize the Middle East so we could have another righteous chorus of "Donald Trump is a monster!"
This is Trump's ultimate victory. Every argument on every topic is now all about him. Hating Trump together has become the ultimate bonding, attention-grabbing and profit-maximization mechanism for those of us in anti-Trump world. So you get a series of exaggerated fervors - the Mueller report! Impeachment! The Steele dossier! - that lead ultimately nowhere.
Most of this week's argument about the Middle East wasn't really about the Middle East. It was all narcissistically about ourselves! Democrats defend terrorists! Republicans are warmongers! Actual Iranians are just bit players in our imperialistic soap opera, the passive recipients of our greatness or perfidy.
The world is more complicated than this cartoon. Love or hate him, Trump has used military force less than any other president since Jimmy Carter. When it comes to foreign policy, he is not like recent Republicans. He is, as my colleague Ross Douthat put it, a Jacksonian figure, wanting to get America out of foreign entanglements while lobbing a few long-distance attacks to ensure the crazy foreigners stick to killing one another and not us.
And this is the final paradox. For all the Sturm und Drang that surrounds Trump, populist Republicans and Democrats are gravitating toward the same foreign policy: We're in the middle of a clash of civilizations; the Middle East is so screwed up, we should just get out; we're too stupid/ineffective/racist/imperialistic to do any good there anyway.
We fight viciously about Trump, but underneath, a populist left-right curtain is descending around America, separating us from the Mideast, China, even Europe. The real high-risk move is the one both parties are making together: that if we ignore the world it will ignore us. (It won't.)
Maybe once the Inflammatory One is finally gone from the scene we can have an intelligent conversation about that.

Why Golden State 'booms' are a bust for so many

Texto completo: Californians, being tougher than we look, have found ways to survive our economic busts.
It's the booms that really break us.
This essential truth is now being missed. Today, politicians and media alike juxtapose the hallmarks of California's current boom with our deep problems — as if they represented a paradox. How can a place be so wealthy and progressive, they ask, and yet so poor and ungenerous at the same time?
"California Is Booming," the New York Times asked recently, "Why Are So Many Californians Unhappy?"
The answer to that question lies in the question itself: So many of us are unhappy precisely because California is booming.
This is no paradox, because our successes and our problems are intertwined. California's tendency to turn everything — from housing to health — into an investment, full of speculation — has made everything, even our booms, volatile and risky.
The signature effect of the now-concluding decade of boom is, of course, homelessness. When the economy grows here, so does homelessness.
Why? In this decade, our boom in jobs and income among the wealthy and middle class created more housing demand. But we couldn't produce enough housing to keep up with demands. Housing prices soared. And as people moved into cheaper neighborhoods and paid higher rents, they effectively forced out poorer longtime residents, some of whom ended up on the streets.
Booms exacerbate California's already significant income gap. Rising wages have been good for our most successful, high-income workers, but they also fuel cost of living increases for middle class and poor families, whose gains have not kept up. These higher costs are why California ranks at or near the top on national poverty measures, and why the state has seen an exodus of middle- and low-income people.
When this state really soars, it feels like it's flying away.
California booms are dangerous in other ways, too.
Our state has made its costliest policy mistakes during good times, often to help people deal with skyrocketing growth. Most famously, as housing prices surged in the late 1970s, voters eager to cut soaring property taxes approved Proposition 13, without considering how the ballot initiative might make it harder to govern California.
That is hardly the only example.
Our local governments now face fiscal peril because of the unsustainably high boosts of public employee pensions approved during the late 1990s tech boom. And today's investor-owned utility crisis, which is literally sparking fires across the state, is rooted in poorly conceived deregulation during that same '90s boom.
When the booms are this tough, it's not hard to find Californians who remember our busts fondly. Downturns create moments when things are cheap enough to take a risk, start a business and snap up a piece of the California dream.
I'm here writing this column because of a bust: The Great Recession. The 2008 collapse, which led to a decline in housing prices, made it possible for me to take a chance on a lower-paying nonprofit media job. Then, in 2011, when prices were still depressed, I bought a small San Gabriel Valley home that would have been unaffordable before that economic collapse — and that I couldn't dream of affording today.
Governments also tend to treat citizens better during busts. The state was far more generous with subsidies and tax breaks for businesses during the Great Recession; today it is busy imposing more regulations and costs.
That recession also saw the federal government take big steps that assisted Californians, via the economic stimulus legislation and Obamacare. But, today, during the boom, our state and its people find themselves under attack from the same federal government — precisely because our boom and its successes are seen as a threatening counter-example to the president's reactionary policies.
The other bad news about California good times is that future booms are likely to be even tougher.
Over the years, all of our booms have changed our character as a state. Once, we were a place of arrival, a destination for new immigrants and the young and ambitious. Back in those days, our busts allowed for surges of new residents. But now, the cost of entry for newcomers has become prohibitively high. That means we are less a state of immigrants and more a state of longtime Californians struggling to hold on.
Perhaps our state and its governments should stop encouraging booms — our de facto policy for decades — and instead pursue more policies that reduce our natural volatility. But that will require us to think of California as a place where we want to spend our lives, rather than a stock exchange of bungalows and beaches.
So happy new year, and good luck finding shelter from the boom.

Texto completo: Jan. 11, 1839: Sculptor Franklin Simmons, whose public works of art include the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow statue and the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Portland and the Soldiers’ Monument in Lewiston, is born in a part of Lisbon that later becomes the town of Sabattus.
Simmons, who grows up in Bath and Lewiston, begins working on sculpture models by using coarse clay from the banks of the Androscoggin River. He opens a sculpture studio in Portland after graduation from Bates College. He proprproduces his first commercial statue, depicting Maj. Gen. Hiram Berry, for the city of Rockland.
His statue of William King, Maine’s first governor, and Vice President Hannibal Hamlin, another Maine luminary, are on display in Washington, D.C.
He also creates the statue of President Ulysses Grant, shown in a Union Army uniform, that stands in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. He plans to do one of President Abraham Lincoln as well, but the day after the two meet in April 1865 to schedule a sitting, John Wilkes Booth shoots the president fatally.
Simmons’ pieces eventually include more than 100 busts in marble and 15 public monuments.
Simmons moves to Rome in 1868, following in the footsteps of many American sculptors who want to gain exposure to and knowledge about the centuries-old Italian tradition of marble carving. After the king of Italy decorates him three times for his work, he dies on Dec. 8, 1913, in the Italian capital while taking a hot bath, according to The New York Times.
Jan. 11, 2012: For the second time in two years, Hostess Brands, which employs about 370 people at a bakery in Biddeford, appears in bankruptcy court because of insolvency.
A spokesman for the company, whose cake products include Twinkies and Ding Dongs, says the filing will not result in job losses in Biddeford.
However, embroiled in a strike that includes workers at the Biddeford plant, the national company closes all 33 of its bakeries in November that year, and a bankruptcy judge issues a ruling the following March that authorizes the company to sell everything it owns.
Flowers Foods Inc. buys most of Hostess’ assets in July 2013, including the Biddeford bakery, but it puts that property up for sale the following year. The site never reopens as a bakery.

Simmons moves to Rome in 1868, following in the footsteps of many American sculptors who want to gain exposure to and knowledge about the centuries-old Italian tradition of marble carving. After the king of Italy decorates him three times for his work, he dies on Dec. 8, 1913, in the Italian capital while taking a hot bath, according to The New York Times.
Jan. 11, 2012: For the second time in two years, Hostess Brands, which employs about 370 people at a bakery in Biddeford, appears in bankruptcy court because of insolvency.
A spokesman for the company, whose cake products include Twinkies and Ding Dongs, says the filing will not result in job losses in Biddeford.
However, embroiled in a strike that includes workers at the Biddeford plant, the national company closes all 33 of its bakeries in November that year, and a bankruptcy judge issues a ruling the following March that authorizes the company to sell everything it owns.
Flowers Foods Inc. buys most of Hostess’ assets in July 2013, including the Biddeford bakery, but it puts that property up for sale the following year. The site never reopens as a bakery.

Texto completo: Let us not go again to war. Let us not go to war because we cannot afford to "win" another war. There would be no winning this war. There is only losing, at a cost that staggers every dimension on all sides - in lives, in money and in the squandered opportunity to do anything better with our collective time and resources on this already beset planet.
I'm speaking here of war with Iran, our current precipice. But I issue the warning more generally, too. Bookmark this page and pull it up as prophylaxis anytime the drums of war begin rattling anew: War isn't just tragic. It is increasingly dumb and pointless, too.
War is becoming an outdated means of human conflict resolution. Technology is turning armed conflict into an endeavor increasingly dominated by what war scholars call "asymmetric warfare" - meaning that weaker powers like Iran can now marshal so much strength that they are no longer very weak, exacting a mighty cost of victory even to the world's pre-eminent global superpower. Then there is climate change, which has ratcheted up the opportunity cost of every conflict; anytime we are fighting each other, we are absconding in the larger and more important fight for the habitability of the planet.
You may debate whether any particular historical war worked out well for its agitators. But there should be no debate that many of America's recent wars have ended in misery for all. Our politicians talk of war as a last resort, but that is only to keep up appearances, because the truth is too terrible to admit: that our ever-more-expensive war machine (a cost of nearly $740 billion in 2020) can buy us little peace. Rather than a last resort, war now offers no resort. War can no longer be defended as the thing to do after everything else has failed. War must instead be seen as failure itself.
I had thought the futility of war might be grasped by most American politicians by now. One of Donald Trump's rare bright spots as a candidate was his departure from the post-9/11 Bush-Cheney doctrine that doubled down on heedless U.S. military interventionism. In his oft-stated aversion to "endless war," Mr. Trump's sentiment matched the public's - a Pew poll this summer showed that most Americans, including most military veterans, now believe that our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have not been not worth fighting. Mr. Trump seemed to be heeding the public's caution back in the summer when he abruptly called off a strike against Iran in retaliation for its shooting down a U.S. surveillance drone.
But in killing Iran's most important military leader, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Mr. Trump opened the door to war. Now Iran is retaliating, and a cycle of escalation looks possible - even if, for now, Mr. Trump is backing away from further conflict. It's beginning to feel a lot like 2003 again, with some of the same pundits and politicians who were in favor of a war with Iraq now repeating similar talking points about Iran. While noting that he'd like to avoid war, Mr. Trump himself has suggested that war with Iran would be a cakewalk: "It wouldn't last very long, I can tell you that," the president told Fox Business in June.
Don't fall for it. It's plain dishonesty: How could anyone who has lived through the quagmire of Iraq and Afghanistan think war with Iran will be anything but long and brutal? In those conflicts, America's overwhelming military might stumbled on local culture, geography, ethnic and religious rivalries, and, most of all, the determination of an entrenched, committed foe that could melt in and out of the local population.
As Vox's Alex Ward points out, Iran has almost three times as many people as Iraq did when we invaded in 2003. It also has treacherous geography, and it controls a great many proxy forces across the Middle East and even in likely sleeper cells in Europe and Latin America. Iran also possesses a sophisticated cyberwar operation - it is believed to be behind recent hacks into American banks and other targets and to have spread disinformation and propaganda on social networks around the world.
The United States would overwhelm Iran in a conventional head-on war, but like China and Russia, Iran has adopted a deep capacity to mount "hybrid war" - conflict that involves both conventional and unconventional means of war. (For example, Iran could expand its operations on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, dealing a costly rise in global energy prices.) As Mr. Ward concludes: "A U.S.-Iran war would be a bloody hell during and after the fighting."
This gets to the immense folly at the heart of our military might. Though the United States spends more on the military than the next nine countries combined, we have not been able to purchase much peace through strength. That's because our strength is clearly of a type, and our years in Iraq and Afghanistan have made plain our vulnerabilities.
Among other shortcomings, our military is still buying mostly big, old defense technologies (like aircraft carriers and bombers) from the military-industrial complex, even if many of these technologies face obsolescence under a future of artificial intelligence, unmanned battlefield robots and other cyberweapons. Our country's efforts at adopting artificial intelligence technology in the military might not be enough to counter our rivals, including Russia and China.
The upshot is this: The United States holds military supremacy over the world's waters and the airspace, but our control is limited and contestable. The last two decades have made clear that even for America, war is never simple. We should fear it. We should avoid it.
And we ought to look for more fruitful things to do with our money and our lives, like making life on earth more livable, not less.

CAMPAIGN 2020: IT'S ALL OVER SAVE FOR THE FACEBOOK POSTURING

Texto completo: These annoying calendars keep insisting it's 2020, the year I said I'd finally start paying attention to the race for the White House, but as usual, I'm already too late.
It's over and Trump won, according to Facebook, which as you know, is the only thing that matters in 21st century America, even if Facebook has to say so itself.
Maybe this escaped you early in the week, but an internal Facebook memo first published in The New York Times and generated by one Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook VP, concluded that Facebook was probably responsible for President Donald Trump getting elected in 2016 and that the Trump campaign's singularly effective use of Facebook's advertising platforms, "may very well lead to the same result" in 2020.
Mr. Bosworth apparently takes no joy in knowing this, much less saying it.
"As a committed liberal I find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result," Mr. Bosworth wrote in the memo, in which he cautioned against pulling any levers. "As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear."
Again, too late. You've become an entity that can change history with the bump of an algorithm. Fear it now.
But just for the hell of it, as if it still matters, let's in the space remaining try to situate ourselves in the election process, take a look back to see how we got to a place where Facebook is running the culture, the country, and much of the world, and look boldly forward to oblivion.
C'mon, it'll be fun.
It is 297 days until the election. It is three days until the final Democratic debate before the Iowa caucuses. It is always approximately eight minutes before Mr. Trump tweets something intemperate about one of those potential opponents. It is 23 days until those Iowa caucuses, 31 days until the New Hampshire primary, 52 days until Super Tuesday (when there are 16 primaries), 108 days until the always-too-late Pennsylvania primary, 184 days until the severely anticlimactic Democratic National Convention, and 226 days until the even less climactic Republican National Convention, unless you enjoy playing Finger the Future Felon from the lineup of Trump operatives. No fair picking the president because there's just no telling how many times he'll be totally exonerated again between here and there.
When all of that ends, the real dirt will start to come out.
Now let's look back to Feb. 4, 2004, just 15 years ago this winter, when, from his Harvard dorm room, Mark Zuckerberg and his cohorts at the school for really, really smart kids launched Facebook in its initial contrivance. As explained by one of his buddies, Arie Hasit, to an Israeli publication in 2009, Facebook started because "We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was 'hotter' and, according to the votes, there would be a ranking."
Really, really smart kids.
You might find it offensive that a comingling of sophomoric banalities would, in 15 years, turn into a force that could turn democracy on its head, but how do you think the producers of "Are You Hot?" feel?
Don't remember the TV show "Are You Hot?"
Maybe because it lasted only a year, but using the same hormone-heated paradigm, how did it fail? On "Are You Hot, the Search for America's Sexiest People" Americans willing to put their perceived hotness before a panel of judges including Lorenzo Lamas did so with relish. Even in a country growing dumber by the minute, America somehow wasn't having "Are You Hot?" but a year later, it was ready for Facebook.
By the way, if you remember that the lone "Are You Hot?" winner was New Orleans actress Chantille Boudousque, that probably doesn't mean you should try out for "Jeopardy!" The show's main contribution to the culture was that it inspired a "Saturday Night Live" spinoff on which the hotness of Betty Boop was assessed against that of Yosemite Sam. How could I make that up?
OK, back to the future. This week Facebook officially decided not to limit how political ads can be targeted (as Google has, and Twitter banned them altogether). Also, Facebook won't be fact-checking them.
This comes less than three months after Mr. Zuckerberg dined with Mr. Trump in Washington, after which Mr. Zuckerberg insisted that he was not lobbied by the president to stick to his policy. If you've forgotten Facebook's policy, it's that anybody can say anything on this platform and do anything on Facebook Live including live stream the slaughter of 51 people in two New Zealand mosques, and if Facebook isn't totally fine with it, some remedies will be discussed, but they probably won't be very effective.
To be fair, Facebook has made some modifications. First-time offenders of its stricter protocols on Facebook Live can now be suspended.
Oooh.
So as we wade into the 2020 campaign, remember, it's not about democracy, leadership, statesmanship, vision, courage, management, character, intelligence, empathy, resilience, discipline and self-control - this isn't even about politics anymore.
It's about who, inside or outside the USA, can best manipulate Facebook.
God Bless America.

Texto completo: The year is 2002. You're at a gas station, filling up your first-generation Honda Pilot with $1.41 per gallon gas and buying Doritos 3Ds and Pepsi Blue. At the register, you glance down to see a shirtless and somewhat doughy Tom Brady hugging a football on the cover of a Sports Illustrated that declares him “The New Prince of the NFL."
Six Super Bowl wins, 14 Pro Bowl selections, and several discontinued junk foods later, Brady still reigns supreme. He's the GOAT, not just in the NFL but in the city of Boston.
Today, the celebrated quarterback's future with the Patriots is unclear. Brady's contract voids on March 17, one day before the new league year formally begins. He will then become an unrestricted free agent.
If Brady decides to hang up his Patriots jersey for good this year, he will join a hallowed Hall of Fame of former Boston megastars. But the end of his reign will also leave a gaping void in a city accustomed to the presence of sports royalty. And the question remains as to who could reasonably inherit the crown.
Many cultural heavyweights have graced the region. (See: transcendentalists Thoreau and Emerson, several American presidents, advocate Helen Keller, martyr Crispus Attucks, chef Julia Child, activist Malcolm X, author W.E.B. DuBois, and Onesimus, the enslaved African who saved the city from smallpox.) But the athlete has always occupied a special place in the hearts of Bostonians.
Of course, there was Ted Williams who managed, at 41, to hit .316 and slug .645. Then Bill Russell, the towering cornerstone, off-court activist, and impenetrable shot blocker of the Celtics' 1960s dynasty, and his teammate Bob Cousy. The otherworldly ice artist Bobby Orr. The triple-doubles and trash talk of Larry Bird, and the Golden Gloves of Carl Yastrzemski. The consistent brilliance of Ray Bourque. The heart and grit of linebacker Tedy Bruschi. And the October juggernaut David Ortiz and his Game 4 homer that resuscitated the Red Sox to end a World Series drought. And that's to name just a few.
For nearly two decades, Brady has been a constant, silencing the naysayers with yet another broken record and another Super Bowl ring. His stardom extends beyond the field. A December quiz by The New York Times revealed that one out of two Americans recognizes Brady — a greater percentage than Elizabeth Warren, Beyoncé, Greta Thunberg, and Cristiano Ronaldo.
But Brady is also like a favorite pair of jeans: familiar, reliable, and unmatched in pliability until they tear in the knees or throw a pick-6 with 9 seconds remaining in a playoff game.
Whether Brady wants to patch up for another season at Gillette remains in question. If he steps away from the game or commits to another team, the Boston sports landscape will be left searching for its next icon.
Rob Gronkowski, in all his zany glory, entranced fans as the court jester within Brady's kingdom, but he ruled out a return to the roster in December. Olympic gold medalist (and Needham local) Aly Raisman and Bruins' forwards David Pastrnak and Brad Marchand compete in sports that just don't ignite the kind of cultural fervor that football does in New England and beyond.
The Celtics host a number of players — Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker — who could catapult to Boston sports stardom depending on their statistics and length of tenure here. But these days, the most beloved Celtic is the outsize Tacko Fall, who has played just three games for the team but still managed to be a top vote-getter in the early rounds of NBA All-Star voting. In terms of personality and skill, the city's most eligible leading sportsman is Mookie Betts, who could be traded before or during the season as the Red Sox try to lower payroll.
Perhaps the most viable contender for Brady's throne is someone hardly any American can recognize. After all, it took a freak injury to Patriots stalwart Drew Bledsoe to put Brady in the pocket and land him, jersey-free, on Sports Illustrated seven months later and in uniform on the cover 20 times since.
Within the Library of Hot Takes, there is a sprawling wing devoted to Tom Brady. So if there is anything to be gleaned from his tenure in New England, it is that predicting the future is a fool's game . . . and that the fountain of youth apparently flows with water — 25 glasses a day to be exact.

Texto completo: The Labor Department's monthly jobs report suggests that the economy ended 2019 on a steady footing.
The American labor market completed a decade-long marathon of hiring in the final month of 2019, and still shows few signs that it is running out of breath.
Payroll gains in December capped a year of steady but slowing gains in employment, the government reported Friday, nudging the year's total past 2.1 million jobs. That was fewer than 2018's additions but more than enough to outpace population growth.
"We had relatively strong and steady job growth over the year despite a number of headwinds including a trade war with China, weaker global activity and heightened policy uncertainty," Gregory Daco, the chief United States economist at Oxford Economics, said. Employers added 145,000 workers in December.
Cooling job creation is normal in the 11th year of an economic expansion and a record-breaking streak of job gains. Looking ahead, Mr. Daco said the nation's job machine was likely to crank down further.
"I know it's hard to get accustomed to," he said, adding that he expects average monthly job growth to fall to 125,000 from 175,000 last year. "But that's still enough to provide for a stable unemployment rate and provide for people coming back into the labor force."
One discouraging piece of the Labor Department's monthly report was anemic wage growth. "It's easier to get a job than a raise in this economy," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
Consumer spending is a pillar of the economy, and it depends on income growth. Over the past 12 months, wages grew just 2.9 percent. That was substantially below the 3.3 percent average in 2018.
"Something that the Fed has been humbled by is how little wage acceleration there's been," Ms. Swonk said, referring to the Federal Reserve.
Even so, the report is unlikely to push policymakers at the central bank from their wait-and-see approach on further cuts to its benchmark interest rate.
The labor squeeze has helped workers at the lowest end of the pay scale, giving their wages a push that exceeds the average increase. Minimum-wage increases across 21 states and 26 cities and counties this year could further help pull up paychecks at the bottom.
By contrast, wage growth for managers slowed in December.
Limp wage growth is puzzling when the jobless rate has settled at 3.5 percent, a half-century low. Finding qualified workers was the top challenge cited by small-business owners in December, according to a monthly survey by the National Federation of Independent Business.
What the tightening labor market has done, though, is draw in people who were not previously job hunting. Nearly three-quarters of new hires have come off the sidelines.
The unemployment rates for groups that have tended to receive a smaller share of the expansion's rewards -- high school dropouts, African-Americans and Latinos -- have also dipped since December 2018.
The share of the population in the work force remains at the top of the postrecession range, even though it's lower than before the financial crash of 2008. Many of the new entrants have been women, who now make up a majority of the nonfarm payroll for the first time in nearly a decade and dominate sectors that are expanding fastest, like health care.
Their participation in the labor force, though, still lags rates in most European countries, which tend to offer better parental leave and child care options.
A broader measure of unemployment that includes part-time workers who would prefer full-time jobs and those too discouraged to even bother to look for work fell to 6.7 percent, the lowest level since the mid-1990s, when the Labor Department started publishing that statistic.
"The best is yet to come!" President Trump posted on Twitter on Friday after the stock market briefly hit a new high.
The gains have been uneven.
Job totals, of course, can mask wide differences based on location, skills and industry. And finding stable jobs that pay middle-income wages, offer benefits and a regular schedule can be difficult.
Health care and hospitality, leisure, professional and business services flourished last year.
The retail sector, which scraped along for much of 2019, was buoyed by the holiday season, but recently announced store closings could reverse those gains in the coming months.
Mining and manufacturing also struggled. Industrial goods and automobile manufacturers were the hardest hit, in part because of the trade war, said Andy Challenger, a vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm that tracks layoff announcements.
"As rosy as the numbers look from a high level, there's still pain out there, jobs cuts that are happening, industries that are struggling and people losing their jobs," he said.
Because the company's survey tracks layoff announcements, Mr. Challenger said, it's "a bit more forward looking" than the Labor Department's figures. Plans can change, he noted, but the results "point to sentiments, if they think they're going to cut."
Boeing, as well as the aerospace industry on the whole, is still reeling from the aftermath of two accidents that killed 346 people. Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselage for the 737 Max, said on Friday that it would lay off 2,800 people in response to Boeing's decision to suspend production of that jet.
The manufacturing sector is particularly important to Mr. Trump and his voters, and "especially in an election year, the trajectory is going to be important," said Rubeela Farooqi, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics.
There has been some progress on the trade front: The United States and China are expected to sign an agreement on the first phase of talks next week.
But persistent uncertainty, which nudges businesses to be more cautious in hiring and investment, is far from clearing. Two-thirds of Chinese imports, worth $ 360 billion, are still subject to tariffs. And Mr. Trump has said he will impose more tariffs on imports from Europe this month.
The threat of a broader clash between the United States and Iran after the president's decision to kill a top Iranian general has added to the unsettled atmosphere. Iran struck American air bases in Iraq in retaliation this week, but the attacks are said to have resulted in no casualties, and tensions have eased.
The Labor Department will update December's report two more times, and November's numbers once more.
Much more substantial revisions are scheduled to be released next month, when the government publishes its annual update of payroll gains. Preliminary data released over the summer indicated that job growth through last spring was weaker by about 500,000 jobs than initial estimates. That will change some year-to-year comparisons.
Location matters a lot.
Julia Pollak, a labor economist for the employment site ZipRecruiter, said the combination of strong wage and job growth had been concentrated in nine states.
In the top four -- Utah, Nevada, Arizona and Colorado -- the expansion has been driven by the technology industry. Those states have benefited in part because they have lower housing costs than Silicon Valley, Ms. Pollak said.
Their less congested roads and airspace are also a draw, especially for companies that are building and testing technologies like drones and driverless cars, she added.
Even companies in California -- still a powerhouse of job creation -- are putting their customer service and call centers in these nearby states.
On the West Coast, Washington is also notching strong gains, Ms. Pollak said, while in the South, Florida, Alabama and South Carolina have done well.
"Yes, I do plan on hiring," said Robert Herman, who owns a mobile pet grooming franchise in Charleston, S.C., where the jobless rate was 1.8 percent in November.
This year, he said he planned to add a fifth van to his fleet of moving dog and cat salons and hire two more employees. Between commission and tips, he said, his workers earn an average of $ 20 to $ 25 an hour.
"We're doing great," he said.

Texto completo: One reader cheers, "Good for them." Another calls them "hyperprivileged." Some are dismayed by the extensive media coverage.
To the Editor:
Re "Going Rogue: Prince Harry and Meghan Surprised the Palace" (news article, Jan. 10):
The real story here is that two young people who are constantly in the public eye and relentlessly followed and photographed by the media simply want to lead normal lives while contributing to improving the human condition in a meaningful way.
Instead, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to live their lives in a way that works for them is being portrayed as some sort of a royal imbroglio and as a selfish act intended to destroy the House of Windsor.
I have no fear that the British royal family is in jeopardy due to this couple's decision, and even if it were, does that really deserve to be covered as a catastrophic and earth-shattering global event?
Alan Safron
Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
To the Editor:
I am British and do not share the interest shown by many Americans in the British royals. I suppose it is a reflection of the amount of that interest, but it is dismaying to see The New York Times, of all papers, devoting pages (let alone a major editorial!) to the coverage of these piffling nonentities living in the most expensive social housing in history.
They are hyperprivileged, very wealthy people who contribute nothing but "celebrity" to society -- Kardashians with titles. Why their doings should be considered of concern to the educated, informed readers of your newspaper baffles me completely.
Michael Gorman
Chicago
To the Editor:
I say, good for them! They are putting their family first, which is what everyone should do. Prince William and Kate have things in hand and will do an excellent job in their roles. I believe that Harry is showing a great deal of strength, insight and love in this situation. He is recognizing the pitfalls of what is happening with Meghan as the same ones faced by his mother. I cannot blame him for wanting to protect her and his son.
He is so much like his mum, and she would be so very proud of him. I know I am.
Tammie Cole

To the Editor:
As a child of immigrants from a country ravaged by the colonization of Britain and as a grandchild of a refugees displaced by Partition, I have never had much sympathy for the British monarchy.
I would like to think that Meghan and Harry's actions will serve as a catalyst to the inevitable changes occurring to the British monarchy, but, in reality, the only way they can have any kind of impact on this system is if they choose to remove themselves entirely from the royal system, refuse their inheritance and drop their royal titles. Instead of taking this approach, Meghan and Harry are taking the easier approach of putting some distance between themselves and the royal family, but still continue to profit off their image as a royal.
Leela Mukherjee
Cupertino, Calif.
To the Editor:
Re "A Couple's Declaration of Independence From the Tabloids" (news article, Jan. 10):
The tabloid photographer Arthur Edwards's remark that Princess Diana's death was more than two decades ago and that Harry should move on shows his total lack of understanding of how traumatic the death of a mother can be for a 12-year-old. One doesn't simply move on; you carry it with you.
Harry has made no secret of how the death of his mother in a car accident after being chased by members of the British tabloid press has affected his emotional growth. Good for the Sussexes! May they have a long and happy marriage on their own terms.

Texto completo: The president and executive director of the trade organization, which is reeling from disputes involving racism and diversity, said they were stepping down.
The Romance Writers of America, grappling with the backlash to a racism dispute that has spurred furious debate over diversity and inclusion issues within the romance genre, said Thursday that its president and executive director have resigned.
In a statement, the trade organization, which has more than 9,000 members, called the events of the past few weeks "the most painful and tumultuous" of its history. Damon Suede, its president, has stepped down, "effective immediately," and Carol Ritter, its executive director, has also resigned, though she will remain in the position for the coming months to assist with the leadership transition.
The R.W.A. said it would not immediately name a new president, instead "working transparently with its membership" to develop a process for appointing Mr. Suede's successor. It didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Writers, agents and others in romance publishing -- a lucrative segment of the overall publishing industry with a deeply engaged base of readers -- have called for Mr. Suede and Ms. Ritter's resignations since late last year, when the organization came under scrutiny for its handling of an ethics complaint against Courtney Milan, a writer and former R.W.A. board member.
Ms. Milan, who is Chinese-American, had criticized "Somewhere Lies the Moon," a book set in China in the 1800s, as a "racist mess," prompting its author, Kathryn Lynn Davis, and her employer, Suzan Tisdale, to file ethics complaints against Ms. Milan. The R.W.A.'s punishment -- suspending Ms. Milan and barring her from holding leadership positions -- was widely criticized by other R.W.A. members and romance writers. It also prompted wider debate over how the romance genre handles issues of race, diversity and inclusion.
The departures were the latest developments in a head-spinning week for the organization. On Wednesday, several major romance publishers, including Harlequin and Avon, said they wouldn't attend or sponsor the R.W.A.'s annual conference this year, citing concerns with R.W.A.'s commitment to diversity. Earlier in the week the R.W.A. canceled its awards program, the Ritas, after contestants and judges dropped out.
"We are committed to supporting our authors, however, we cannot support R.W.A. or the national conference until you are fulfilling your mission to your members," said the president and chief executive of Kensington Publishing, Steven Zacharius, in a statement.
Mr. Suede's resignation "is a good first step," HelenKay Dimon, a former R.W.A. president, said in an email. "With that barrier removed, R.W.A. can sit a full Board and start a difficult self-assessment."
In its statement on Thursday, the R.W.A. said it would do "whatever it takes" to "restore the trust we have lost."
It added: "We hope you will join us -- collaboratively and productively -- in rebuilding an R.W.A. that serves its diverse and talented members well into the future. We believe this community is worth saving."

Texto completo: "Thank God they are free," one Londoner said. "All of this is about her race, I know it because as a Caribbean woman who did not grow up here, I have experienced it myself."
LONDON -- When Prince Harry and Meghan announced this week that they would be stepping back from their royal duties and spending extensive time in North America, many of Britain's minority residents said they felt a burst of relief.
At long last, many said in interviews, the couple might finally escape the abuse, much of it racially tinged, that has been heaped upon them by the British press, particularly the country's raucous tabloids.
"Thank God they are free," said Sanaa Edness, lifting her arms to the sky as she walked through Fordham Park in southeast London. "Nobody should tolerate bullying and abusive behavior because of the color of their skin. All of this is about her race, I know it because as a Caribbean woman who did not grow up here, I have experienced it myself."
It wasn't supposed to end up like this.
When an African-American bishop and a gospel choir performed at Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding ceremony at Windsor Castle in May 2018, it set a precedent for many of Britain's people of color, who until then had felt excluded from the profoundly white culture and traditions of the British monarchy.
Young black women with no particular interest in the royal family gathered around their television screens and watched with excitement as the beautiful biracial American actress walked down the aisle of St. George's Chapel and took up her newly found status as the Duchess of Sussex. They hoped that her union with the popular prince would mark a new era for the royal family, one that would usher in fresh and more relatable values.
But even before the wedding, the then Ms. Markle had come under frequent attack in the British tabloids, prompting Prince Harry, while they were dating, to issue a pointed statement condemning the "racial undertones" of opinion pieces and news articles.
And since the Daily Mail's 2016 headline, "Harry's girl is (almost) straight outta Compton," the duchess has been the subject of dozens of racist and sexist stories with references to her "exotic DNA" and descriptions of her family history going from "cotton slaves to royalty via freedom in the US Civil War."
After the couple married in 2018, and Ms. Markle officially joined the royal household, the tabloids shifted gears, presenting her as a termagant who shouted at her staff and brought her sister-in law Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, to tears. Some headlines referred to her as "Hurricane Meghan," the "Difficult Duchess" and "ME-GAIN."
"They wanted to show her up as the angry black woman like a thorn against the sweet English rose petals that is Mrs. Kate," Ms. Edness said.
In a rare ITV television interview broadcast in October, the duchess opened up about her struggles and revealed that her friends had warned her that if she married Prince Harry, the British tabloids would "destroy her life."
The tabloids deny that their coverage shows racial bias, saying they have a right to scrutinize the couple when they are being supported by public funding.
"Most of the media is ignoring the whole racism factor that has clearly played a big role in the couple's decision," said Nadine Batchelor-Hunt, former president of Cambridge University's Black and Minority Ethnic campaign.
"Racism issues are spoken about more in the popular discourse in the United States," she continued. "People are more conscious of it, whereas here the black community is a lot smaller and it's not really raised as a significant issue regularly."
In the latest census in 2011, black residents made up only around 3 percent of Britain's population, with 87 percent white and the rest from other ethnic groups. In the United States, by contrast, non-Hispanic white people account for only 60.4 percent of the population in 2019, while black people were the largest minority, at 13.4 percent.
Ms. Batchelor-Hunt also pointed out that royal correspondents and commentators are predominantly white. "Many of them are unaware when they are being outright racist and how their comments become amplified across social media," she said.
In an opinion piece published in The New York Times on Thursday, Afua Hirsh, the author of "Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging," looked at the relationship between the coverage of the duchess and Britain's class culture.
"In Britain's rigid class society, there is still a deep correlation between privilege and race," she wrote. "The relatively few people of color -- and even fewer if you count only those who have African heritage -- who rise to prominent success and prosperity in Britain are often told we should be 'grateful' or told to leave if we don't like it here."
In the interviews, a persistent theme was surprise that senior members of the royal family had not shown enough support for Meghan. Many said they have watched in astonishment as Buckingham Palace has released several statements in defense of Prince Andrew, who has been embroiled in a child sex trafficking scandal, while staying silent on the systematic attacks on the duchess.
"She didn't get the support she needed from the royal family," said Carol Lengolo, a mother of two from southeast London, who grew up in South Africa as a big fan of the monarchy. "You never see them speaking out about the racism, standing beside her, defending her. She's been all alone."
Ms. Lengolo said she was happy and relieved that the couple would finally be free of all the abuse and negativity. She could not understand why anyone was surprised by the announcement.
"These people needed to do this for the sake of their mental health and to protect their newborn son," she said. "I support them 100 percent. I'm truly happy for them."
Tabloid columnists expressed shock and outrage at the announcement by Prince Harry and the duchess on Wednesday, accusing them, among other things, of being "selfish," "scheming," "hypocrites" who had shown an "atrocious lapse of judgment" and were "trying to bring down the monarchy."
"I've seen some disgraceful royal antics in my time, but for pure arrogance, entitlement, greed and willful disrespect, nothing has ever quite matched the behavior of the 'Duke and Duchess of Sussex,"' wrote Piers Morgan, a columnist for The Daily Mail.
"I put inverted commas around those titles because I sincerely hope they won't exist much longer."
The popular black comedian Gina Yashere responded to Mr. Morgan's column on Twitter saying: "Please. Every black person knew this was coming. Constant racist vitriolic abuse disguised as criticism."
Mr. Morgan responded: "Oh Gina, stop being so ridiculous. The criticism of Meghan Markle has nothing to do with her skin color and everything to do with her being a shameless piece of work doing huge damage to our Royal Family."
Ms. Lengolo's 13-year-old daughter, Tshego, sees it differently. She idolizes Ms. Markle and hopes to be an actress in Los Angeles one day. She said that while she was disappointed the duchess would be distancing herself from the royal family, she was also proud of her for making such a "brave" and "powerful" decision.
"I think it's just appalling how they can just judge someone by their skin tone," Tshego said, her voice rising with emotion.
"Take Kate for example," she continued. "She got married to a member of the royal family and we don't hear much said about her. But all of a sudden, a person of color comes into the royal family and everyone just jumps and goes after her. If she was white, she wouldn't be treated like this, and that is just the cold reality."

Texto completo: SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The N.F.L. has no shortage of great football families.
The Mannings produce exceptional quarterbacks. The Longs -- the father, Howie, and the son, Chris -- were defensive mainstays. Don't bother trying to count all the members of the Matthews clan.
Now we have the Bosas.
The five players who recorded the most quarterback pressures this season, according to Pro Football Focus, have a combined 28 seasons of N.F.L. experience. Just behind them, at No. 6, is Nick Bosa, who was drafted out of Ohio State less than nine months ago.
That puts Bosa in position to win the same award that his older brother, Joey, a star defensive end for the Chargers, collected in 2016: defensive rookie of the year.
Nick Bosa, also a defensive end, totaled 80 sacks, hurries and hits for the San Francisco 49ers, tormenting offenses with a blend of power, speed and technical expertise amplified by a sophistication uncommon for his age, particularly at that position. The 49ers head coach, Kyle Shanahan, has joked that Bosa has been learning pass-rush moves since he was 3.
That wouldn't be surprising given that his father, John, was also an N.F.L. defensive end; after being picked in the first round of the 1987 draft, John Bosa played three seasons with the Miami Dolphins.
By his second game with San Francisco, Bosa was drawing two blockers and sometimes a third. In his seventh game, four days after he turned 22, he had three sacks and an interception against the Carolina Panthers.
"He loves close-quarter combat," said Robert Saleh, the 49ers' defensive coordinator.
Ahead of the 49ers' playoff game on Saturday against the Minnesota Vikings, The New York Times spoke with an array of experts to learn why Bosa has excelled this season. They were effusive.
"God puts his hands on certain people's shoulders and just says, 'You're gifted, now what are you going to do with that?"' said Howie Long, the league's defensive player of the year in 1985, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and now a Fox analyst. "He's one of those guys. He's built for football."
Here is some of what the other experts had to say:
Interview excerpts have been edited for clarity.
Trevor Pryce recorded 91 sacks for three teams over 14 seasons: Nick Bosa looks like he does one exercise a week, and that's squat. He has never skipped leg day.
Richard Dent, who amassed 137.5 sacks in 15 seasons, is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame: When the 49ers drafted Bosa, it looked like somebody at Ohio State knows some fundamentals about footwork.
Larry Johnson Sr., the defensive line coach at Ohio State, has tutored 15 Big Ten defensive players, or linemen, of the year: He's got absolutely unbelievable eye-hand coordination. It's like he's catching a fly out of the air.
Mike McGlinchey is the 49ers' starting right offensive tackle: He's so good at seeing how offensive linemen move and feeling it out during the rush that he can feel imbalances, he can feel shifts of weight.
Johnson: We want the tackle to stop his feet, panic, and when you do that, if I get too close to your space, what do you start doing? You step backward or you shoot your hands to get you off. Bosa gets right into your face. That's why you see Nick always closing the fight.
Long: When you get in the league, your physical elevator is through the roof and your mental elevator's in the basement. Throughout the course of your career, the elevators are moving in different directions, and somewhere in the middle you hit your peak -- 28, 29 -- and the intellectual and physical side pair up. By the time your mental elevator is through the roof, your physical elevator's in the basement and you can't do a damn thing about it. His mental elevator is two floors ahead of where it should be right now.
McGlinchey: When we were going against each other a lot in camp, to study the film it's like, "All right, this is what he did to me today." And then it would be something completely different tomorrow that you have to fix again. It's that process of not being able to prepare for just one thing.
Pryce: The closer you are to the tackle, you make him make a decision right now. Nick gets as close to him as possible and makes a fight in the phone booth, because he knows his hands are better. It's a much more cerebral way of playing the game than I've ever known.
Long: The way he takes on a block, the way he sheds a block, the way he plays blocking combinations, it all lends to an extended career. Because he's so technically sound.
Pryce: He's beyond technically sound. Technically sound is what I was. He's technically savvy.
Long: More often than not, you have guys that are one-trick ponies running around the corner or they might have one secondary move, occasionally. He can set moves up. He can go up and under. He can beat you around the corner. Or he can use power.
Dent: He uses his feet like he uses his hands. That means no matter what he's doing with his hands or his shoulders or his head, his feet always continue moving up field.
Long: He can play third-and-1 as well as he can play third-and-10. His fourth quarter looks like his first quarter.
McGlinchey: If you're on him, he still finds a way to keep moving toward the quarterback, and that's what's really hard. Most guys don't have his mind-set of go, go, go, either. And that's as much of a weapon as anything else.
Johnson: He's starting to get used to the chipping and then two guys blocking him. At the start, he was rushing and guys started chipping. Whoa, what was that. Now they're doing it every play. Why? Because it's important to shut him down.
Shanahan: There's certain edge rushers -- there's a few of them in this league, and Bosa is one of them -- but when those guys can affect the quarterback on any play, you've got to be very smart. I don't care who the tackle is, there are certain type of rushers, if the guy he's going against is a really good player and he knows you're throwing it every down, that guy is not going to be able to block him eventually.
Saleh: His movement skills, his instincts in pass rush, his feel in pass rush, is beyond what a rookie feels.
Pryce: I had a coach my rookie year who said he loves playing rookies because they're too stupid to know they're not supposed to be that good. And I think Nick Bosa doesn't understand that he's not supposed to dominate the game the way that he has.

Texto completo: The university investigated its history with Mr. Epstein after Joichi Ito, the face of its prominent Media Lab program, acknowledged receiving money from the convicted sex offender.
Over 15 years, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly donated to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Top administrators knew about the gifts, felt conflicted about them, and accepted them anyway. The university's president even signed a thank-you note.
But on Friday, months after the campus was roiled by revelations of Mr. Epstein's financial ties to the school's prominent Media Lab program, investigators hired by the school absolved M.I.T.'s leadership of breaking any rules.
The law firm Goodwin Procter spent four months compiling a report on M.I.T.'s dealings with Mr. Epstein, who killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell in August while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. The investigation found that Mr. Epstein made 10 donations -- totaling $ 850,000, slightly more than M.I.T. had previously disclosed -- from 2002 to 2017. Mr. Epstein also visited campus at least nine times from 2013 to 2017, a period that followed his conviction on sex charges involving a minor in Florida.
The university took action against only one person still connected with the school: Seth Lloyd, a mechanical engineering professor who previously acknowledged accepting money from Mr. Epstein, was placed on paid leave. The report found that Mr. Lloyd had "purposefully failed" to inform M.I.T. of multiple donations from Mr. Epstein, including a $ 60,000 gift deposited into his personal bank account.
The report concluded that Mr. Epstein's visits, along with any donations made after his 2008 conviction in Florida, had been enabled by Mr. Lloyd or Joichi Ito, the former director of the Media Lab who stepped down in September. (Mr. Ito also resigned from The New York Times Company's board.)
The 61-page report, based on dozens of interviews and a review of more than 610,000 emails and documents, cleared others of wrongdoing, including the university's president, L. Rafael Reif. Mr. Reif acknowledged last year that he had signed a letter thanking Mr. Epstein for a donation in 2012, but the report said he "had no role in approving" the donations.
One current and two former M.I.T. vice presidents who learned of Mr. Epstein's donations in 2013 and began quietly approving them were rebuked in the report, but not disciplined because it concluded that they had not broken any university policies.
The three vice presidents -- R. Gregory Morgan, Jeffrey Newton and Israel Ruiz -- made "significant errors in judgment that resulted in serious damage to the M.I.T. community," according to the report.
Mr. Ruiz is the school's executive vice president and treasurer, although the university announced last month that he would step down this semester for a career outside of academia. The announcement made no mention of the Epstein scandal.
Mr. Ruiz said in a statement that he was confident that the university's leadership and broader community would "create an effective and successful path forward."
Mr. Morgan and Mr. Newton have retired from the university. They did not respond to requests for comment.
According to the report, the men debated whether to accept Mr. Epstein's money "in the absence of any M.I.T. policy regarding controversial gifts." They reached a compromise: Under "an informal framework," the school would accept the donations while insisting that the gifts be small and unpublicized to prevent Mr. Epstein from using them to improve his reputation or gain influence at the university, the report said.
Efforts to reclassify Mr. Epstein's donations as anonymous "made it impossible for all but a select few to see the number or amount of Epstein donations," the school's executive committee said in a statement. The committee called for university employees "to take steps to protect and ensure the integrity and factual accuracy of the donor database."
Denis A. Bovin, a member of the executive committee, said at a news conference that M.I.T. had not thought it would need a policy concerning gifts from someone with Mr. Epstein's past.
"We never thought in our history that we'd have this kind of problem," he said.
Mr. Lloyd, the professor, is now under review in the mechanical engineering department, with proceedings "moving swiftly," Alan G. Spoon, a member of M.I.T.'s board of trustees, said during a conference call with reporters.
Mr. Lloyd, who was introduced by his book agent to Mr. Epstein in 2004, declined to comment.
The report focused heavily on Mr. Ito, the former Media Lab director, who acknowledged raising $ 1.7 million from Mr. Epstein for the lab and his own outside investment funds. The disclosure raised an uproar at a program that prides itself on its contrarian culture.
Mr. Ito, a master networker who raised at least $ 50 million for the Media Lab, met Mr. Epstein in 2013 at a TED conference in California and then "cultivated" the financier as a donor and a link to other wealthy people, according to the report.
Mr. Ito resigned from the Media Lab in September. He also stepped down from several other boards and a visiting professorship at Harvard. He did not respond to a request for comment.
The report found that Mr. Epstein's presence on campus had disturbed Media Lab staff members -- investigators were told that Mr. Epstein was sometimes accompanied by young female assistants -- and that Mr. Ito probably sensed their nervousness. In 2013, Mr. Ito expressed concern that a proposed campus visit from Mr. Epstein and the director Woody Allen could result in a public relations headache, investigators found. A Media Lab communications employee distributed photos of one event to other people at the lab, writing in an email that they should "feel free to post on social media -- as long as Jeffrey Epstein does not appear in any of the photos!"
News reports about other internal emails previously demonstrated how Media Lab officials had obfuscated Mr. Epstein's relationship with the program. The emails included references to donations from other wealthy figures that purportedly involved Mr. Epstein.
In one 2014 email, Mr. Ito wrote that a $ 2 million gift from the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had been "directed by Jeffrey Epstein." In a subsequent email, another lab official wrote that "for gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey's name as the impetus for this gift." In another email exchange, Mr. Ito discussed how Mr. Epstein was helping to connect the lab to Leon Black, the founder of Apollo Global Management, a prominent private equity fund. One email indicated that Mr. Black had given the lab $ 4 million.
Mr. Gates has denied that Mr. Epstein directed grant-making on his behalf. A representative for Mr. Black said he could not immediately be reached for comment.
Roberto Braceras, a Goodwin Procter partner who led the investigation, said on the conference call that his team spoke with representatives of Mr. Gates, who "deny that any Gates donation had any relationship to anything regarding Epstein." He said Mr. Black's representatives could not be reached, but added that "there's no evidence that Black's donations were the result of Epstein's encouragement."
The university has already set up two faculty-led committees to work on new policies for gifts and the vetting of donors. Those committees are expected to deliver their recommendations in the spring, and the executive committee said administrators should work closely with them to put such policies in place as soon as possible.
Crystal Lee, a graduate student at M.I.T., said she was relieved that Mr. Lloyd was no longer teaching students. But she said the report did not answer all the questions she had.
"I am still troubled by many of the specific details of the case that will go unresolved with the report's air of finality," she said.
For example, she said, the university offers only "woefully inadequate" support for mental health, despite the circumstances of the scandal.
"I am optimistic that M.I.T. can and should change, if only because of my fellow students, who have done so much work to make this campus a better place," she said.
Kate Kelly contributed reporting. Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.

Texto completo: An investigation that began in the pages of The Times becomes a criminal case in a courtroom.
Certain stories demand our attention, over and over. That's how we feel about the story of Harvey Weinstein.
Today's episode about his criminal trial in Manhattan, which began this week, marks the eighth time we've devoted a show to the subject.
From the beginning, the story of Weinstein, the allegations against him of a pattern of sexual misconduct and the system that facilitated it -- which became the subject of a Pulitzer Prize-winning line of coverage in The Times by our colleagues Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey -- has sent shockwaves across the United States and the world. It ignited a social movement and forced a social and political reckoning over sex, power and accountability that is still playing out.
Our coverage began in the fall of 2017 with Jodi and Megan's original investigation, which they laid out in detail on the show. The episode introduced Weinstein to listeners -- a prominent, wealthy and well-connected Hollywood figure accused of serially abusing women in the entertainment industry.
Next, we explored the impact of Megan and Jodi's investigation, which prompted dozens of new accusers to come forward, including a woman named Katherine Kendall, who told us her harrowing story on the show.
Soon after, when the actress Ashley Judd, another Weinstein accuser, filed a lawsuit against Weinstein -- not for sexual misconduct, but for the damage he did to her career -- we looked at the economic toll of sexual harassment and whether the law sufficiently protects against it.
As Megan and Jodi's reporting deepened, we examined the apparatus of complicity around Weinstein that allegedly allowed him to repeatedly abuse women, year after year, without legal or, seemingly, professional consequence.
Then, as Megan and Jodi finished a book about Weinstein that brought new revelations about his conduct, we explored a lesser-told part of the story: the role of the famous feminist mother-and-daughter lawyers Gloria Allred and Lisa Bloom in reinforcing the legal system that many people believe kept Weinstein's conduct secret for so long.
Finally, as Weinstein's trial began in New York, we turned to Jodi and Megan for two more episodes, which ran yesterday and today, that explained why a case that involved more than 80 accusers had turned into a criminal trial with just two plaintiffs.
Now, as the trial gets underway and an investigation that began in the pages of The Times becomes a criminal case in a courtroom, we encourage you to revisit those episodes, especially if you missed them the first time around, for a look at how the Weinstein case unfolded. As for us, we will continue to cover the story as urgently as ever.

Welcome back
This week, after scattering to the four corners of the earth over the holidays, our producers returned to the office with a surprising unity of mind:
On 'The Daily' this week
Monday: Helene Cooper on the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani: What the administration "will have to answer to the American people," she tells us, "is whether or not this assassination was worth it."
Tuesday: "What we've seen is that the U.S. has effectively turned General Suleimani into a martyr." Farnaz Fassihi looks at Iran's reaction to the death of its most powerful military commander.
Wednesday: John Bolton, the former national security adviser, said he would be willing to testify in the impeachment trial. Will the Senate let him do it? We asked Julie Hirschfeld Davis.
Thursday: Law enforcement pressured Lucia Evans to cooperate in the case they were building against Harvey Weinstein. Then they dropped her from the case.
Friday: In Part 2 of our Weinstein story, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey explain why, after more than 80 women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the film producer, the criminal charges he's facing in New York center on just two.

Texto completo: Mr. Sanders edged out his competitors in The Des Moines Register/CNN poll released on Friday, the first significant survey from Iowa in nearly two months.
DES MOINES -- Bernie Sanders edged ahead of his Democratic rivals in Iowa, affirming his resurgence less than four weeks before next month's caucuses, according to a new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN.
The poll showed that Mr. Sanders was the first choice for 20 percent of would-be caucusgoers, an increase of five percentage points from November, when The Register last polled the state. He was followed closely by Elizabeth Warren at 17 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 16 percent and Joseph R. Biden Jr. at 15.
The results are the latest sign that Mr. Sanders -- lifted by his loyal supporters and an unchanging message -- has strong campaign momentum heading into the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and has rebounded politically after having a heart attack in October. It is the first time he has led a Register poll this cycle. In 2016, Mr. Sanders battled Hillary Clinton to a virtual tie in Iowa, transforming him into a threat for the Democratic nomination.
The poll was less kind to Mr. Buttigieg, who held a dominant lead in the last Register poll, with 25 percent support. That poll also showed Ms. Warren at 16 percent and Mr. Biden at 15 percent.
To say the poll was highly anticipated is an understatement. The poll is the first significant survey from Iowa in nearly two months, a drought that has left a murky picture of the Democratic primary race in a state that conducts its first-in-the-nation caucuses. Iowans famously break late, sometimes making their final decision in the weeks and days before the caucuses occur, and every campaign will be scrutinizing the results for signs that their candidate is strengthening -- and that their rivals are weakening -- heading into the final stretch.
The poll numbers are the latest evidence that the race in Iowa remains fluid and winnable for the top four candidates, who have all crisscrossed the state in recent weeks to try to persuade supporters to come out for them on caucus night. Only 40 percent of respondents said their minds were made up, a reflection of the indecision on the ground, where conversations with Iowans often reveal that they still favor multiple candidates.
Of paramount importance to many Democrats in Iowa is beating President Trump in the general election in November. But the absence of a clear front-runner, along with no indication that any one candidate will break away from the pack in the remaining weeks, has left many voters unsure where to align their preferences.
Amy Klobuchar, who has attracted more interest in recent weeks but has yet to convert that into an increase in actual support, held steady at 6 percent, good for a distant fifth place in the poll. Cory Booker, who is hoping for a lucky break, also remained unchanged at 3 percent, behind the entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who was at 5 percent.
The poll of 701 likely Democratic caucusgoers was conducted Jan. 2-8 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
Political officials here widely believe that there are five tickets out of Iowa this year, instead of the typical three.
Much has changed since The Register last released its poll on Nov. 16. Kamala Harris, who was once considered a top-tier candidate but had seen her standing severely slip, dropped out of the race, leaving her supporters scrambling to find an alternative candidate to back. The House of Representatives voted to impeach President Trump. And escalating tension with Iran has pushed foreign policy to the forefront of a primary race that had so far focused more squarely on domestic issues.
The deadline to qualify for Tuesday's Democratic debate was 11:59 p.m. on Friday, and normally, an Iowa poll released hours before such a deadline could bolster candidates on the cusp of qualifying. But this time, no one was on the cusp.
Mr. Booker and Mr. Yang both met the Democratic National Committee's donor requirement, but Mr. Yang had only one qualifying poll of the required four, and Mr. Booker had none. The Iowa poll gave Mr. Yang his second qualifying mark, but it was not enough to get him into the debate.

Tensions Over Religion And Race Are Roiling An Elite Private School

Texto completo: The New York City school is once again embroiled in a debate over its handling of race, religion and ethnicity.
Ethical Culture Fieldston, one of New York City's most proudly progressive private schools, is facing a backlash over its handling of race, religion and ethnicity for the second time in less than a year.
In the past few months, some Jewish parents have accused school administrators of not acting aggressively enough to address what the parents said were anti-Semitic comments by at least one teacher and a guest speaker.
The tensions boiled over on Thursday, when the school fired a history teacher who has criticized Israel in school and on a personal Twitter account.
The dismissal of the teacher, J.B. Brager, which came after an assembly focused on anti-Semitism and anti-bias training, was first reported by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. The move quickly touched off a protest by Fieldston graduates.
Lauren Coulston, a spokeswoman for the school, declined to discuss the precise reasons for the firing, saying that Fieldston "does not comment on personnel matters."
"We can reaffirm, however, that the school does not tolerate hurtful offensive or exclusionary content or comments from any member of the community," Ms. Coulston said on Friday. "Students, parents, employees, and other members of our community all face consequences for behavior of this nature."
The episode comes at a highly charged moment for the school, and for New York.
Fieldston spent much of last year trying to contain a rebellion by its students, some of whom locked themselves in buildings on the school's campus in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in March to protest what they said was a racist school culture.
The school agreed to many of the students' demands, including anti-bias training and a commitment to hire more teachers of color.
But the fragile peace that followed was short-lived. The student protests about perceived racism against people of color soon gave way to anger among Jewish parents concerned about anti-Semitism.
In November, Kayum Ahmed, a director at the Open Society Foundations philanthropic organization who had been invited to speak at an assembly at the high school, responded to a student's question about South Africa by linking what Jews endured during the Holocaust to violence against Palestinians in Israel.
Some parents, offended by the comment, urged school leaders to issue a forceful statement condemning it. The debate over Mr. Ahmed's remarks was reported by the online publication Tablet as well as the Washington Free Beacon. Mr. Ahmed did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.
A few days after the assembly, the head of the school, Jessica Bagby, and the high school principal, Nigel Furlonge, sent an email to students and parents calling Mr. Ahmed's remarks "deeply hurtful." The school, Ms. Bagby and Mr. Furlonge wrote, "vehemently opposes anti-Jewish words, deeds, and sentiment."
Before the winter break, Fieldston scheduled an assembly focused on anti-Semitism for Thursday, Jan. 9, and announced that two Reform Jewish rabbis would speak.
Fieldston was founded in the late 19th century by Felix Adler, a Jewish educator, and has long served a significant number of Jewish students. But parents' concerns that the school has looked the other way on anti-Semitism have plagued Ms. Bagby throughout her four-year tenure.
The New York Times reported in 2017 that she had referred privately to "Zionist" parents raising questions about aspects of the school's experimental approach to combating racism.
The comment alarmed George Burns, the principal of Fieldston's lower school at the time, The Times reported. Mr. Burns's unexpected departure that year prompted a torrent of anger from parents, teachers and students.
Fieldston, which has around 1,700 students from prekindergarten through 12th grade and annual tuition of about $ 53,000, is substantially more racially diverse than many other private schools in the city, and it awards more than $ 14 million a year in financial aid.
The debate at the school is playing out against a backdrop of heightened tensions among Jewish residents of New York and the surrounding area.
Orthodox Jews have faced a series of violent anti-Semitic attacks across the city and state in recent weeks, prompting local officials to increase security in neighborhoods with large Jewish populations.
This week, tens of thousands of people marched against anti-Semitism in New York City. In an email this month, Ms. Bagby encouraged Fieldston families to join the march.
Dr. Brager, the teacher who was dismissed, is transgender and uses the pronouns they and them. Complicating the debate over the comments that some parents objected to, Dr. Brager is also Jewish.
The Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported that Dr. Brager's Twitter account, which by Friday had been made private, had included posts critical of the two rabbis asked to speak at Thursday's assembly.
"Sure go ahead and invite two white men who run Reform congregations, both of whom are Zionists," Dr. Brager said in one message. After Mr. Ahmed's comments in November, Dr. Brager wrote on Twitter, "I refuse to 'reaffirm the value' of ethnonationalist settler colonialism," according to Tablet.
Two Fieldston parents who spoke to their children about the assembly and reviewed a brief video clip of the meeting said that Dr. Brager had raised a middle finger at one of the rabbis before walking out of the room during the assembly on Thursday.
Dr. Brager did not respond to a request for comment.
Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said on Friday that the group was "pleased that the Fieldston administration took this matter seriously and heard the concerns of students and parents who were justifiably appalled by the faculty member's hurtful and offensive tweets."
But a letter protesting Dr. Brager's firing and calling on the school to reinstate them had collected several hundred signatures since Thursday evening.
"We see clearly that Fieldston administrators Jessica Bagby and Nigel Furlonge are not interested in addressing anti-Semitism or protecting Jewish community members," the letter said, "but in signaling to conservative Jewish donors that the school will punish dissenters from those donors' views."

Texto completo: The latest movie in the "John Wick" saga airs on HBO, and the Raconteurs perform songs off their new album on "Austin City Limits."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's on TV
JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 3 -- PARABELLUM (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. At just over two hours, this over-the-top action flick is propelled forward mostly by a series of impeccably choreographed fight scenes. It is the third installment in the "John Wick" franchise by the returning director Chad Stahelski, and it picks up where the second film left off. John (Keanu Reeves) has been excommunicated from the High Table, the global society of villains to which he once belonged, and has a multimillion-dollar bounty on his head. Suddenly there's a killer on every corner. Knowing he's outnumbered, John heads to Morocco in hopes of revoking his death sentence. Along the way he seeks help from his former mentor (Anjelica Huston) and a friend from his past (Halle Berry), who has a couple of merciless dogs trained for combat. Writing in The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said that the movie's endless cycle of violence can become deadening, but its elaborate thrills give it its edge.
LOVE IN WINTERLAND (2020) 9 p.m. on Hallmark. This new romantic drama stars Italia Ricci as Alice, a finalist on a dating show in Los Angeles. During the last round of dates, the show's bachelor, Tanner (Jack Turner), invites Alice on a trip to her scenic Vermont hometown. There, she bumps into her high school sweetheart, Brett (Chad Michael Murray), who just happens to own the inn where the show's cast and crew are staying, and their reunion rekindles strong feelings.
AUSTIN CITY LIMITS 11 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). After an 11-year hiatus, Jack White's the Raconteurs returned last summer with a third album, "Help Us Stranger." It's as if they never left. The singles "Sunday Driver" and "Now That You're Gone," one, a classic rock 'n' roll hit, the other, a bluesy tune about a love lost, fit well into their previous records. The four-piece performs their new songs in this live performance, joined by the Austin-based funk duo Black Pumas.
What's Streaming
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks walked away from the Golden Globes empty-handed last week. But the actors may have a shot at Oscar nominations, to be announced Monday. For a look at their earlier work, revisit this riveting crime caper by Steven Spielberg, based on the autobiography of the real-life impostor Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio). Upset by his parents' divorce and his father's troubles with the I.R.S., Frank runs away from home. He manages to steal millions of dollars before turning 19 by forging checks and posing as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. His schemes take him all over the world, with a seasoned F.B.I. agent (Hanks) right on his tail. Writing in The Times, Stephen Holden called DiCaprio's performance "sensational."

Oprah Winfrey, AppleTV+ pull out of documentary centered on Russell Simmons' accusers

Resumen: Oprah Winfrey cited creative differences in pulling out, along with AppleTV+, from a documentary focusing on sexual misconduct by Russell Simmons.

Texto completo: Oprah Winfrey has pulled out of an documentary centered on sexual misconduct allegations against music executive Russell Simmons, weeks before the film was slated to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.
Winfrey on Friday announced the decision to step aside as executive producer from the still-untitled project, a collaboration with documentary directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering. She also said the project will no longer stream on AppleTV+, as had been scheduled after the Jan. 25 Sundance premiere.
Winfrey made clear she supported the women who spoke to the filmmakers, but cited creative reasons and the pressing festival deadline as her reasoning for withdrawal.
"First and foremost, I want it to be known that I unequivocally believe and support the women. Their stories deserve to be told and heard," said Winfrey in a statement released by AppleTV+ "In my opinion, there is more work to be done on the film to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured and it has become clear that the filmmakers and I are not aligned in that creative vision. "
Russell Simmons urges Oprah Winfrey: Stop working on the #MeToo documentary
"Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering are talented filmmakers. I have great respect for their mission, but given the filmmakers’ desire to premiere the film at the Sundance Film Festival before I believe it is complete, I feel it’s best to step aside," Winfrey added.
Simmons, 62, went on Instagram in December, pleading with Winfrey to pull out of the project, while denying the accusations. He called Winfrey a "shining light to my family and my community" and someone who's "contributing so much to my life that I couldn't list a fraction of it in this blog. "
"This is why it’s so troubling that you choose me to single out in your recent (documentary)," he continued. "I have already admitted to being a playboy more (appropriately titled today 'womanizer') sleeping with and putting myself in more compromising situations than almost any man I know. "
The Sundance Film Festival describes the documentary as "the haunting story of music executive Drew Dixon, whose career and personal life have been deeply affected by the abuse she faced from the men she admired in the industry she loves. . . The film follows Dixon (producer of hit records by 2Pac, Method Man, and Mary J. Blige) as she grapples with her decision to become one of the first women of color to come forward as part of the #MeToo movement. "
In 2017, The New York Times reported that Dixon was working her dream job in 1995 as an executive at Def Jam Recordings, which Simmons co-founded. She said the mogul regularly harassed her and exposed his erect penis to her, and later that year raped her in his downtown Manhattan apartment. She quit Def Jam soon afterward.
According to Simmons' Instagram post, Winfrey's producers told him the documentary focuses on three "hand-chosen women. "
Tina Tchen, president and CEO of the Time's Up Foundation, issued a statement supporting the accusers.
"These women are brave. We believe them," Tchen said. "As Oprah made clear in her statement, any decision by her and Apple regarding this documentary does not change the underlying facts. We assert Time's Up's unwavering support for these survivors. We are in awe of their courage and strength. We will continue to fight for them, and we will continue to fight for a future where black women are truly heard and believed. "
Dick and Ziering’s responded to the news of Winfrey's withdrawal with a statement to Deadline. com:
“Revealing hard truths is never easy, and the women in our documentary are all showing extraordinary strength and courage by raising their voices to address sexual abuse in the music industry. While we are disappointed that Oprah Winfrey is no longer an Executive Producer on the project, we are gratified that Winfrey has unequivocally said she believes and supports the survivors in the film. "
"The film is a beacon of hope for voices that have long been suppressed, and an inspiration for anyone wanting to regain their personal power. ”

Texto completo: IMAGINE THIS: a facility in southern Xinjiang province in China, in a dusty village nestled among fields of barren walnut trees. It is surrounded by a tall brick wall, two layers of barbed wire, cameras on every corner, and a guard wearing a black helmet and protective vest with a metal detector at the entrance. This is a school?
The building, recently described in a New York Times article, is a clue to the eradication of a people's culture and language taking place every day in concentration camps in western China. The building is in fact a boarding school and part of China's attempt to wipe out the mind-set of the ethnic Uighur population and others, including Kazakhs. They are Turkic Muslims, and about 1.8 million of them are now incarcerated in camps that China calls 'vocational education' facilities but look more like prisons.
As the Times article and other recently published research has revealed, China's attempts to suppress Uighur traditions start with the youngest. Children are separated from their parents " who are hauled off to faraway camps " and the kids are then subjected to intensive indoctrination at places such as the boarding school. The goal is to erase from their minds the Uighur language and cultural ways and replace them with coerced respect for China's ruling Communist Party and the traditions of its Han- majority population.
In the village with the barbed wire, government officials call the children 'kindness students,' referring to the party's supposed generosity in making special arrangements. But the glove bearing this generosity has a fist inside. As Adrian Zenz at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation has documented, in some Uighur-majority regions in southern Xinjiang, preschool enrollment more than quadrupled in recent years, exceeding the average national enrollment growth rate by more than 12-times. Why? Because parents, and in some cases both parents, have disappeared into the camps. China is carrying out cultural genocide and social reengineering on young minds when they are most impressionable.
China has claimed the campaign is a response to extremism and violence in Xinjiang a decade ago, but these methods far exceed what would be needed for counterterrorism. The punishment of the Uighur Muslims appears to fit the definition of crimes against humanity. The annual report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, released Wednesday, says: 'Security personnel at the camps subjected detainees to torture, including beatings; electric shocks; waterboarding; medical neglect; forced ingestion of medication; sleep deprivation; extended solitary confinement; and handcuffing or shackling for prolonged periods, as well as restricted access to toilet facilities; punishment for behavior deemed religious; forced labor; overcrowding; deprivation of food; and political indoctrination.'
That is some 'kindness.' Congress should promptly finish with legislation that would pave the way for sanctions on those responsible for the repression. If this horror is not ended soon, the entire world must ask: Should China be allowed to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in one city while running concentration camps in another?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – It is “highly likely” that Iran shot down the civilian Ukrainian jetliner that crashed near Tehran late Tuesday, killing all 176 people on board, U.S., Canadian and British officials declared Thursday. They said the fiery missile strike could well have been a mistake amid rocket launches and high tension throughout the region.
The crash came just a few hours after Iran launched a ballistic attack against Iraqi military bases housing U.S. troops in its violent confrontation with Washington over the U.S. drone strike that killed an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general. The airliner could have been mistaken for a threat, said four U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost 63 citizens in the crash, said in Ottawa: “We have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence. The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.”
Likewise, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison offered similar statements. Morrison also said it appeared to be a mistake. “All of the intelligence as presented to us today does not suggest an intentional act,” he said.
The assessment that 176 people were killed as collateral damage in the Iranian-U.S. conflict cast a new pall over what had at first appeared to be a relatively calm aftermath following the U.S. military operation that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
It was not immediately clear how the U.S. and its allies would react. Despite efforts by Washington and Tehran to step back from the brink of possible war, the region remained on edge after the killing of the Iranian general and Iran’s retaliatory missile strikes. U.S. troops were on high-alert.
At the White House, President Donald Trump suggested he believed Iran was responsible for the shootdown and dismissed Iran’s initial claim that it was a mechanical issue with the plane.
“Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side.” Trump said, noting the plane was flying in a “pretty rough neighborhood.”
Late Thursday, the U.S. House approved a measure that aims to bar any further military action against Iran without congressional approval. However, the resolution approved by the Democratic-majority House is nonbinding and, at any rate, no similar measure could pass the Republican-controlled Senate.
As for the airliner shootdown, the U.S. officials wouldn’t say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile, believed to be fired by Russian Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. But they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communication interceptions and other similar intelligence.
The New York Times posted a video Thursday it said it had verified showing the moment the apparent missile struck the plane over Iran. The video shows a fast-moving object rising before a fiery explosion. An object, apparently on fire, then continues in a different direction.
A preliminary Iranian investigative report released Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the aircraft was trying to turn back for the airport when the burning plane went down.
The Iranian report suggested that a sudden emergency struck the Boeing 737 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines late Tuesday, when it crashed, just minutes after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran.
Investigators from Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization offered no immediate explanation for the disaster, however. Iranian officials initially blamed a technical malfunction for the crash, something backed by Ukrainian officials before they said they wouldn’t speculate amid an ongoing investigation.
Before the U.S. assessment, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency quoted Hasan Rezaeifa, the head of the of civil aviation accident investigation commission, claiming that “the topics of rocket, missile or anti-aircraft system is ruled out.”
The Ukrainian International Airlines took off at 6:12 a.m. Wednesday, Tehran time, after nearly an hour’s delay at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport, the main airport for travelers in Iran. It gained altitude heading west, reaching nearly 8,000 feet, according to both the report and flight-tracking data.
Then something went wrong, though “no radio messages were received from the pilot regarding unusual situations,” the report said. In emergencies, pilots reach out to air-traffic controllers to warn them and to clear the runway for their arrival, though their first priority is to keep the aircraft flying.
Eyewitnesses, including the crew of another flight passing above, described seeing the plane engulfed in flames before crashing at 6:18 a.m., the report said. The crash caused a massive explosion when the plane hit the ground, likely because the aircraft had been fully loaded with fuel for the flight to Kyiv, Ukraine.
The report also confirmed that both of the “black boxes” that contain data and cockpit communications from the plane had been recovered, though they sustained damage and some parts of their memory was lost.
Hours before the plane crash the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had issued an emergency flight restriction barring U.S. carriers and pilots from flying over areas of Iraqi, Iranian and some Persian Gulf airspace warning of the “potential for miscalculation or misidentification” for civilian aircraft due to heightened political and military tensions.
Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s Security Council, told Ukrainian media that officials had several working theories regarding the crash, including a missile strike.
“A strike by a missile, possibly a Tor missile system, is among the main (theories), as information has surfaced on the internet about elements of a missile being found near the site of the crash,” Danilov said.
Ukrainian investigators who arrived in Iran on Thursday awaited permission from Iranian authorities to examine the crash site and look for missile fragments, Danilov said.
The Tor is a Russian-made missile system. Russia delivered 29 Tor-M1s to Iran in 2007, and Iran has displayed the missiles in military parades.
Iran did not immediately respond to the Ukrainian comments. However, Gen. Abolfazl Shekarchi, the spokesman of the Iranian armed forces, denied a missile hit the airplane in a comments reported Wednesday by the semiofficial Fars news agency. He dismissed the allegation as “psychological warfare” by foreign-based Iranian opposition groups.
Ukraine has a grim history with missile attacks, including in July 2014 when one such strike downed a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard.
The plane was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. Many of the passengers were believed to be international students attending universities in Canada; they were making their way back to Toronto by way of Kyiv after visiting with family during the winter break.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, “Undoubtedly, the priority for Ukraine is to identify the causes of the plane crash. We will surely find out the truth.”
The crash ranked among the worst losses of life for Canadians in an aviation disaster. The flag over Parliament in Ottawa was lowered to half-staff, and Prime Minister Trudeau vowed to get to the bottom of the disaster.
The U.S. accident investigator, the National Transportation Safety Board, is talking to the State Department and the Treasury Department about traveling to Iran to inspect the U.S.-built aircraft and working with Iranian authorities despite U.S. economic sanctions against that country. In a statement Thursday the NTSB said it “continues to monitor the situation surrounding the crash and evaluate its level of participation in the investigation.”
U.S. officials have expressed concerned about sending employees to Iran because of the heightened tensions.

Texto completo: Today is Saturday, Jan. 11, the 11th day of 2020. There are 355 days left in the year.
Birthdays: Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien is 86. Director Joel Zwick is 78. Country singer Naomi Judd is 74. Golf Hall of Famer Ben Crenshaw is 68. Singer Robert Earl Keen is 64. Director Malcolm D. Lee is 50. Singer Mary J. Blige is 49. Musician Tom Rowlands of the Chemical Brothers is 49. Actress Amanda Peet is 48.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed the Grand Canyon National Monument (it became a national park in 1919).
In 1913, the first enclosed sedan-type automobile, a Hudson, went on display at the 13th National Automobile Show in New York.
In 1935, aviator Amelia Earhart began an 18-hour trip from Honolulu to Oakland, California, that made her the first person to fly solo across any part of the Pacific Ocean.
In 1943, the United States and Britain signed treaties relinquishing extraterritorial rights in China.
In 1964, Surgeon General Luther Terry issued "Smoking and Health," a report that concluded "cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and to the overall death rate."
In 1977, France set off an international uproar by releasing Abu Daoud, a PLO official behind the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
In 1978, two Soviet cosmonauts aboard the Soyuz 27 capsule linked up with the Salyut 6 orbiting space station, where the Soyuz 26 capsule was already docked.
In 1989, nine days before leaving the White House, President Ronald Reagan bade the nation farewell in a prime-time address, saying of his eight years in office: "We meant to change a nation and instead we changed a world."
In 2000, whittling away more of the federal government's power over states, the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that state employees cannot go into federal court to sue over age bias. Carlton Fisk and Tony Perez were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
In 2003, calling the death penalty process "arbitrary and capricious, and therefore immoral," Illinois Governor George Ryan commuted the sentences of 167 condemned inmates, clearing his state's death row two days before leaving office.
In 2010, a federal judge in San Francisco began hearing arguments in a lawsuit aimed at overturning Proposition 8, California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage. (Chief US District Judge Vaughn R. Walker later overturned the ban; his ruling was upheld on appeal to the US Supreme Court.) Mark McGwire admitted to The Associated Press that he'd used steroids and human growth hormone when he broke baseball's home run record in 1998. Miep Gies, the Dutch office secretary who defied Nazi occupiers to hide Anne Frank and her family for two years and saved the teenager's diary, died at age 100.
In 2015, more than a million people surged through the boulevards of Paris behind dozens of world leaders walking arm-in-arm in a rally for unity against three days of terror that killed 17 people and changed France.
Last year, an estimated 800,000 government workers missed their paychecks for the first time since the government shutdown began three weeks earlier. The New York Times reported that federal law enforcement officials were so concerned about the behavior of President Trump in the days after he fired James Comey from the FBI that they opened an investigation into whether he had been working for Russia against US interests. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the state's three-member Cabinet granted posthumous pardons to four African-American men who'd been accused of raping a white woman in a 1949 case that had come to be seen as a racial injustice.

Daily on Healthcare: Democrats want FDA to have more drug recall power

DEMOCRATS WANT TO GIVE FDA MORE POWER ON UNSAFE DRUGS: Democrats are working to give the Food and Drug Administration more power to recall dangerous drugs.
Under current law, the most forceful action the FDA can take is to ask companies to voluntarily recall their products from the market, but then the agency doesn’t have control over how products get recalled. The FDA leans on pharmacies and drug companies to contact customers directly about the dangers of the medicines and getting rid of them, and drug companies are allowed to simply refuse to take action.
This isn’t true for other products the FDA regulates. It has the power to recall medical devices, nicotine products, and vaccines. For drugs, the FDA can put out a safety warning but it cannot order stores to take products off shelves or make manufacturers pull marketing of a drug from their websites.
Democrat Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, who oversees the House subcommittee that determines funding for the Department of Health and Human Services, has been pushing for a few years to let the FDA have more power over recalls. She’s been successful at giving the FDA more authority before: She introduced a bill over food recalls that Barack Obama signed into law in 2011.
On Friday, she’s reintroducing the Recall Unsafe Drugs Act alongside other Democratic co-sponsors that would give the FDA mandatory recall authority over drugs.
Much of Congress’s focus on prescription drugs during the past year has been on their prices, but reports of unsafe medicines could give the bill more momentum this session. The legislation is landing at a time when millions of customers are reeling from news that the heartburn treatment Zantac, available both over the counter and with a prescription, has been tested and found to have the carcinogen NDMA. The blood pressure drug valsartan contained the chemical, too, and faced recall requests from FDA last year.
Bloomberg reported in December that FDA officials don’t seem to want more control over recalls, and the pharmaceutical industry also opposes the move because it largely complies with FDA requests. It remains to be seen what the position of the new chief of the agency, Dr. Stephen Hahn, will be.

ANTI-OBAMACARE STATES FACE DEADLINE ON SUPREME COURT RESPONSE: Republican-led states that have signed onto a lawsuit threatening to invalidate all of Obamacare have until 4 p.m. Friday to respond to Democrat-led states that want the Supreme Court to hear and decide on the case this year, ahead of the presidential election.
KANSAS REACHES DEAL ON MEDICAID EXPANSION: Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, reached a deal with Republicans to expand Medicaid, estimated to enroll 150,000 more people in government coverage. The deal sets up a reinsurance fund, charges enrollees around $25 in premiums, and will allow people to get referrals to work — but won’t require them to work as a condition of staying enrolled in Medicaid. Neighboring Oklahoma is set to put the question of Medicaid expansion to voters through a ballot measure, and Missouri is headed in the same direction.
GUTTMACHER URGES MORE STATES TO LOOSEN ABORTION RESTRICTIONS PAST VIABILITY: The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, has released a policy document urging states not to have any limits on abortions, saying that “using gestational age as a legal cutoff for abortion care is harmful at any point in pregnancy” and that “states can and should expand access to abortion throughout pregnancy.” The District of Columbia and seven states do not specify gestational age in their abortion laws.
‘WAKEUP CALL’: ALCOHOL-RELATED DEATHS HAVE SKYROCKETED SINCE 1999: The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reported Friday that nearly 1 million people died of alcohol-related causes, such as liver disease and overdoses, between 1999 and 2017. Researchers analyzed death certificates and noted that the number of deaths linked to alcohol more than doubled from 35,914 in 1999 to 72,558 in 2017.
“The current findings suggest that alcohol-related deaths involving injuries, overdoses, and chronic diseases are increasing across a wide swath of the population,” said NIAAA Director Dr. George F. Koob. “The report is a wakeup call to the growing threat alcohol poses to public health.” Researchers found that people aged 45-74 had the highest rates of alcohol-related deaths but the steepest increases were among people ages 25-34. The said increases in alcohol consumption over the past 20 years are consistent with increasing rates of “deaths of despair,” or deaths by suicides and overdoses.
Flashback: We’ve done data analyses on the rise in alcohol-related deaths, and how complicated it is to push for regulations given that any restrictions arouse fear of making the problem worse through prohibition-like policies.
VAPING LUNG INJURIES ARE UP: As of Jan. 7, 2,602 people have been hospitalized for vaping-related lung injuries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The death toll has also risen to 57 across 27 states.
IS CALIFORNIA GETTING INTO THE PHARMA INDUSTRY?: Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday that his state might create its own generic drug label in an effort to increase market competition to lower prices for Californians. Newsom has included the proposal in his 2020/2021 budget plan, which he will discuss in a Friday press briefing. “A trip to the doctor’s office, pharmacy or hospital shouldn’t cost a month’s pay,” Newsom said. “The cost of healthcare is just too damn high, and California is fighting back.”
Health policy experts are skeptical: Healthcare industry experts’ ears perked up Thursday but said Newsom’s plan may not have much of an impact on prices. “This is not a bad move,” USC health economist Geoffrey Joyce told the Los Angeles Times. “But I wouldn’t oversell it. It will make a modest dent in overall drug spending and drug pricing in California. You are benefiting a modest group of patients, but you are benefiting them in a significant way.”
GETTING PEOPLE TO SPIT INTO TEST TUBES MAY HAVE PAID OFF: Ancestry DNA test company 23andMe used all of that genetic material it has collected and developed an antibody to treat inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis. The company inked a deal with Spanish drug company Almirall to license the antibody as a treatment for dermatological diseases.
JUSTIN BIEBER REVEALS LYME DISEASE DIAGNOSIS: Bieber, 25, revealed on Instagram Thursday that he has Lyme disease and responded to months of scrutiny that his disheveled appearance was linked to a possible drug habit. “While a lot of people kept saying justin Bieber looks like shit, on meth etc. they failed to realize I've been recently diagnosed with Lyme disease, not only that but had a serious case of chronic mono which affected my, skin, brain function, energy, and overall health,” he wrote. Bieber also teased a docu-series that YouTube will publish so that fans can get a closer look at Lyme disease and his diagnosis.
Lyme disease has gotten a bit more attention recently as Congress included funding for Lyme disease research and prevention efforts in December’s year-end spending package. New Jersey Republican Chris Smith, the bill’s lead sponsor, has been working to pass Lyme disease legislation for nearly 30 years and called the bill a “whole-of-government approach” when he spoke to Cassidy last month.

Texto completo: Author Marianne Williamson has ended her long-shot bid for the White House after laying off her whole campaign staff shortly after the new year.
She announced her exit from the race on Friday in a statement titled, "With love and gratitude."
"The primaries might be tightly contested among the top contenders, and I don’t want to get in the way of a progressive candidate winning any of them," she said.
Williamson, 67, surprised Beltway insiders by leveraging her national profile and 4.1 million social media followers, amassed partly through her previous work as Oprah Winfrey's spiritual counselor, into more than 130,000 donors and a spot in the first two Democratic debate rounds.
But the New York Times best-selling writer, who became the most-searched 2020 presidential candidate after the Detroit debate for warning of the Trump administration's "dark psychic force," struggled to find establishment support for her quixotic campaign.
While on the trail, Williamson pushed for the creation of a U.S. Department of Peace, which she proposed would also oversee gun control measures and reparations, calling for a $200 billion to $500 billion investment in the African American community over a period of 10 years.
"These are not times to despair; they are simply times to rise up," Williamson said. "A politics of conscience is still yet possible. And yes. love will prevail."

‘It’s the racism’: Professor says Meghan Markle quitting royal family because her mother is black

Texto completo: Meghan Markle, the first biracial member of the British royal family, is leaving Buckingham Palace behind because of the racism she has endured, according to a California professor.
Afua Hirsch, a journalism professor at the University of Southern California, pointed to bias in the royal family against people of color.
"In Britain’s rigid class society, there is still a deep correlation between privilege and race," wrote Hirsch in the New York Times. "The relatively few people of color — and even fewer if you count only those who have African heritage — who rise to prominent success and prosperity in Britain are often told we should be 'grateful' or told to leave if we don’t like it here."
Friends of Markle, 38, warned her not to marry Prince Harry, 35, saying the tabloids would "destroy" her life. After more than a year of racially tinged stories, including a BBC 5 presenter's claim that the couple's newborn baby was a "chimpanzee" and the Daily Mail's claim that Markle had "exotic DNA," Harry and Markle issued a statement disclosing their decision to leave the royal family.
"After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution,” read part of the statement.
The relationship between the royal family and the British press has been strained in the decades since Princess Diana died in a car crash spurred by paparazzi.
"Both she and Harry appear to have gained crystal clear vision as to their reality," added Hirsch. "It’s no wonder the couple want to leave and — as the coded statement that they want to raise their son Archie 'with the space to focus on the next chapter' seems to suggest — protect him from the bile to which they’ve been exposed."

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — The formerly sparse craft beer scene in San Juan County will become a little more crowded next year.
The Bow & Arrow Brewing Co., based in Albuquerque, will be opening the Rambler Taproom on East Main Street in Farmington in early 2020, according to founder, president and CEO Shyla Sheppard. The 1,200-square-foot space will feature a seating capacity of less than 30. It will not brew beer on site, but will feature all the Bow & Arrow products that are available at the main location in Albuquerque.
Sheppard runs Bow & Arrow with her partner Missy Begay. Their company has been described as the first brewery in the country that is owned and operated by Native women, and Bow & Arrow has been profiled in publications and web sites ranging from The New York Times and The Guardian to Vice.com and NationalGeographic.com.
The Farmington City Council approved a small brewer 1st off-site location liquor license for the Rambler Taproom at its Dec. 10 meeting. The business will be located in Suite 109 of the GoTo Plaza at 5100 E. Main St., a development best known for its anchor tenant, a Durango Joes Coffee location.
Sheppard said she and Begay chose Farmington for their first satellite operation for a variety of reasons. She noted the existence of the Three Rivers Brewery and the recently opened Lauter Haus Brewing Co. in Farmington, and said both are excellent. But she believes the market here remains underserved.
"I feel like we could really add something to the craft beer scene there in Farmington," she said. "We brew some styles that are a little different."
Bow & Arrow has partnered with Navajo Agricultural Products Industry for some of its brewing ingredients in the past, and Sheppard said she looks forward to opening an operation in closer proximity to that company. She said Bow & Arrow also will explore the idea of finding and working with other producers in the Four Corners area.
Sheppard, a North Dakota native who is a member of the Three Affiliated Tribes, also said she and Begay, who is Navajo, like to spend a lot of time in the Farmington area. That made it a natural choice for their second operation, especially since Sheppard said she will be spending a lot of time here to get the taproom open.
"I've really grown to appreciate it," she said of the Four Corners area. "I love the outdoors, and spend a lot of time camping and going to Navajo Lake and Glade Run (Recreation Area). I like trail running and mountain biking. And I love the landscape there."
The name Sheppard and Begay chose for their Farmington location reflects their affection for this area.
"We like the idea of the Four Corners and the Great American Southwest — ramblers and seekers," she said. "We chose the name in that spirit. It made a lot of sense for that location."
Sheppard said the taproom will feature the same vibe as Bow & Arrow's main location in Albuquerque, 608 McKnight Ave. NW, which has a modern beer hall design. Long wooden tables with bench seating, high ceilings, concrete floors and exposed ductwork are accented by an expansive bar, chandeliers, natural lighting and custom woodwork.
"It's a community gathering place," she said, describing its inclusive atmosphere. "You can hear each other and have conversations."
Live music has not been a part of the mix at the Albuquerque location, she said. Shepard did not rule out live entertainment for the Farmington taproom, but she said if it is offered, it will be presented sparingly.
The Rambler Taproom will offer all the Bow & Arrow products, many of which are flavored with fruits ranging from strawberries and key limes to tangerines, as well as a wide array of hops. Sheppard said beers will be sold by the glass, in growlers and in barrel-fermented bottles.
Sheppard said construction on the site has not gotten underway yet, but the build-out is not expected to take long. She said she expects the taproom to open at the end of the first quarter of 2020 or the beginning of the second quarter. The business is expected to employ between five and eight people, she said.
Mike Easterling can be reached at 505-564-4610, or via email at measterling@daily-times.com.

Music or murder? You'll laugh either way

Texto completo: How about a pair of plays that don't take themselves too seriously and that are famously enjoyed by their casts, to welcome back Brevard's theatergoers after the holiday break?
That classic of American dark comedy, "Arsenic and Old Lace," will be presented Jan. 10 through 26 at Surfside Playhouse in Cocoa Beach. "Mamma Mia!," the musical comedy woven from the songs of ABBA, plays Jan. 10 through Feb. 2 at Titusville Playhouse, and again Feb. 7 through 23 at the Henegar Center.
The New York Times' revered theater critic Brooks Atkinson called Joseph Kesselring's "Arsenic and Old Lace" "so funny none of us ever will forget it," and theaters around the world haven't.
In the words of Surfside Playhouse director Bryan Bergeron, "It is famous for its longevity. At any given time, there are probably 15 theater companies around the country doing it. It is a good, consistent piece of repertory for community and regional theater and it translates well to modern times."
That's because its story is timeless, although it was written in 1939: Newspaperman Mortimer Brewster (Edward Johnson), who knows that his family is touched by insanity, is visiting a pair of sweet spinster aunts who poison men and bury the bodies in what his brother Teddy (Chris Tsocanos) digs as locks of the Panama Canal, he thinks, in the cellar of the Brewster home. Teddy thinks he's Theodore Roosevelt. Older brother Jonathan (FLORIDA TODAY's John Torres) is a sadistic killer who received plastic surgery to conceal his identity and now looks like Boris Karloff.
That is one of the wink-wink-nod-nod jokes of the play: Karloff played Jonathan Brewster in the original Broadway production. In another, Jonathan describes his odd family as, "if Strindberg wrote 'Hellzapoppin.'"
Unlike Cary Grant, who famously did not enjoy his role in the 1944 movie version of "Arsenic and Old Lace," the actors at Surfside are more than pleased with theirs, according to Bergeron.
"They're having a ball," he said. "Some characters are only onstage for one scene and there's a lot of hanging around for some of them, but they love it because it is so funny, so crazy."
And then there's "Mamma Mia!," a great favorite of the cast members who have appeared in it over the years at various theaters. The show has been brought back to Titusville because audiences love it too.
The plot is simple: A young woman who is about to marry invites three of her ex-rocker mother's former lovers to the ceremony in hopes that one of them will be revealed as her father, all to the tune of ABBA's greatest hits.
"It's been a blast," associate director Niko Stamos said. "We have a lot of the people who have appeared in 'Mamma Mia' before, but we have some new people too. Laura Hodos, who was Mama Rose in 'Gypsy' (last season), has returned to play Donna, and Olga Intriago, who was a member of the ensemble, has moved up to play Sophie, one of the principal roles. This play really is about people coming to the theater to enjoy themselves, and from our perspective, it's really fun to have familiar faces back, the whole family back together."
The show, the first mainstage production, should do well in Melbourne too, he added.
"It's light, it's fun and there is that music that everyone knows. Come to the theater and enjoy yourself."

Youth football is too dangerous for our children

Texto completo: THE ISSUE
The National Football League “looks remarkably spry at 100 years old,” James Surowiecki wrote for The New York Times last month. “The league remains enormously popular across lines of gender, race, age, class and even politics, and N.F.L. games remain pretty much the only sure thing for high ratings on the networks’ schedules — in 2018, they accounted for 34 of the top 50 broadcasts.” Yet there remain serious concerns about the violence within the sport and the lifelong health problems increasingly associated with playing football at any age level.
In many workplaces Monday morning, including ours, one of the biggest topics of discussion was “that play” in Sunday’s NFL playoff game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Seattle Seahawks.
As Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz was tumbling to the ground at the conclusion of a running play, Seahawks defender Jadeveon Clowney came behind him to finish the tackle. Clowney’s right elbow drove into the small of Wentz’s back, and his helmet collided with Wentz’s helmet, which subsequently smashed into the grass.
It happened in a flash and looked even more sickening on the slow-motion replay.
Wentz left the game and did not return. He had suffered a concussion, which was accompanied by a brief loss of memory and temporary difficulty remaining upright while in a sitting position, according to reports.
A terrifying moment. For Wentz. For Wentz’s family.
It also should have terrified parents whose children play football.
Football is a violent sport, even when the plays are “clean.” As The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Bob Ford wrote Monday of the Wentz play: “As much as the league would like to keep the violence but remove the risk, that’s not really possible. ... It happens, and it happened right there, in an NFL game in which they were playing for money, and one of 100 violent instances during the game led to an unfortunate injury.”
The risks inherent in football are hardly contained to the pro ranks. College, high school and even youth football can be brutal.
Consider the following:
— Chronic traumatic encephalopathy — a progressive, degenerative disease caused by repetitive brain trauma and better known as CTE — was found in 99% of deceased NFL players’ brains that were donated to scientific research, per a 2017 study.
— Even a “mild” case of CTE can lead to cognitive and memory issues, anxiety, depression, violent mood swings and suicidal thoughts. These can manifest at any age level, and symptoms worsen over time.
— A Harvard survey of nearly 3,500 former NFL players published in August found that 12% reported serious cognitive problems. That compares to about 2% of our general population. And about a quarter of those surveyed had anxiety or depression.
— “Playing youth tackle football may be exposing kids’ brains to that same risk,” a 2018 Men’s Health article reported. “A 2017 study ... found that people who started playing tackle football before age 12 doubled their risk of having behavioral problems and cognitive impairment, and tripled their risk of suffering from depression later in life.”
Let’s focus on that last point.
We’re not going to tell NFL or college or even high school players not to play football. But we think parents should strongly consider not allowing their children to participate in youth football. This is not a new stance for us; in 2016, we asked parents to weigh the risks football poses to their children, and last year we praised the wisdom of Andrew Luck’s early retirement from the NFL.
That Men’s Health article reported that about 3 million boys play tackle football in America, with about 40% of them between the ages of 7 and 11. While these participation numbers have dropped significantly in the past decade, we think they’re still too high.
But trying to alter America’s football culture can be slow going.
“From the peewees to the pros, we’ve long accepted the toll that football exacts on the body — the sore muscles, the broken bones, the torn ligaments, the lost teeth, the risk of paralysis, and, especially in recent years, the dangers of concussions,” the Men’s Health article noted. “The risks are worth it, the thinking goes, because the sport demands toughness and forges character.”
That kind of thinking belongs in the past.
“Tackle Can Wait,” a recent campaign by the Concussion Legacy Foundation, attempts to steer kids who are under 14 into flag football and away from the contact version, The Associated Press reported. “Tackle football is like smoking,” states the young player in a public service announcement. “The younger I start, the longer I’m exposed to danger.”
Parents ought to heed the words of Robert Cantu, co-founder of the CTE Center at the Boston University School of Medicine, and Mark Hyman, a professor at George Washington University, who wrote this in an August 2019 op-ed for The Washington Post: “Tackle football is dangerous for children. Children who play tackle football absorb repeated hits to the head. As adults, they’re at higher risk of suffering cognitive deficits as well as behavioral and mood problems. ... We’d suggest that, as the nation’s top doctor, the surgeon general put this warning on every youth football helmet and place it in bold type on all youth tackle football registration forms. A parent or guardian wouldn’t be able to sign up their child without seeing it.”
We would approve of such high-profile warnings, too.
This weekend, many will watch and cheer during four NFL playoff games. On Monday, many will turn their attention to the college football national championship game between Clemson and LSU.
We suggest that, while watching the action on the field, parents also reflect on what might be best for their young children.

Nicholas Kristof: Trump has a bizarre idea of winning

Texto completo: For now we seem to have averted an all-out shooting war between the United States and Iran.
Yet it’s not over. The world is more dangerous than it was a week ago, and President Donald Trump’s exuberance suggests that he may have learned precisely the wrong lesson from his clash with Iran.
Trump and some of his supporters are crowing at the lack of American casualties — Iran may have carefully aimed so as to miss people — in ways that remind me of the hubris preceding the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As there were then, there are today concerns about whether intelligence has been overstated, leaders are thumping their chests and there’s too much confidence in the ability of the military toolbox to solve complex problems.
Trump, who in 2012 repeatedly claimed that President Barack Obama would start a war with Iran to help win reelection, is already running election ads on Facebook trumpeting his killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani and saying that this is “keeping America safe.” Hmm. Look at the results so far:
• Iran has cast off nuclear curbs so that it is now potentially within five months of having enough fuel for a nuclear warhead, down from almost 15 years when Trump took office.
• United States forces may be pushed out of Iraq, allowing Soleimani to achieve in death one of his foremost goals in life.
• American forces in Syria may be difficult to support without the military presence in Iraq, so some or all of them might pull out as well, another strategic victory for Iran.
• The military campaign against the Islamic State is on hold, giving terrorists a chance to regroup.
• Iran’s regime, which had been threatened by enormous protests at home and in Iraq, has been rescued by Trump’s actions. Iranians have rallied around the flag, and the Iraqi narrative has changed overnight from the bullying of Iranians to the bullying of Americans.
• Instead of bringing troops home, Trump has had to deploy more to the Middle East at huge cost. We may think we can’t afford universal pre-K, but we don’t blink at lavishing billions of dollars on these military deployments.
• North Korea has gained leverage, because it knows that Trump has little appetite for two international security crises at the same time. Kim Jong Un has also surely absorbed the lesson that he must never give up his nuclear warheads, as Trump will strike countries that lack nuclear weapons while schmoozing with leaders who have them.
So much winning! And there will be more.
It’s true that Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said that Iran’s response had “concluded,” but Zarif is a moderate often outmaneuvered by hard-liners. I know this partly because back in 2004, after Zarif approved a visa for me, I was detained in Iran by security forces looking for information that could embarrass Zarif and get him fired.
My best guess is that Iran will strike back hard in a way that leaves it some plausible deniability. Perhaps it’ll be a truck bomb at a diplomatic mission or Trump property, or perhaps rocket attacks on a military site by a proxy, or a cyberattack on an oil refinery or the power grid, or perhaps mines that damage oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has options, and let’s not celebrate prematurely.
One reason to worry is that both sides have shown such a capacity for bellicosity and miscalculation.
Trump miscalculated by initially failing to respond adequately to a series of Iranian provocations beginning in May, leading to underdeterrence. Then he overreacted on Dec. 29, with strikes that killed two dozen people, and then again with the killing of Soleimani, in each case failing to appreciate the risks to Americans in Iraq.
As for Iran, the best evidence of Soleimani’s miscalculation is simple: He’s dead.
Perhaps the most consistent foreign policy mistake that the United States has made in my lifetime is a failure to appreciate nationalism, from Vietnam to Afghanistan, Iraq to Latin America. It’s an odd mistake for a country that was born because King George III failed to accommodate our own nationalism. Yet today as well we often overstate Iran’s religiosity but underappreciated its nationalist sensitivities.
I’ve found on my visits to Iran that when we don’t muck things up, ordinary Iranians are among the most pro-American people in the region. That time I was detained in Iran, my bags were carefully examined and X-rayed by a security goon, who snarled at me: “American reporters — bad!” Another X-ray operator nearby apparently didn’t quite realize what was going on, because he beamed at me and said in the friendliest of tones: “Americans — very good!”
Some day, people like the second X-ray operator will inherit his country, if we can avoid wars and manage the nuclear crisis. But the basic rule in international security, as in medicine, is “first, do no harm,” and Trump has violated that.

David Brooks: Trump has made us all stupid

Texto completo: Donald Trump is impulse-driven, ignorant, narcissistic and intellectually dishonest. So you’d think that those of us in the anti-Trump camp would go out of our way to show we’re not like him — that we are judicious, informed, mature and reasonable.
But the events of the past week have shown that the anti-Trump echo chamber is becoming a mirror image of Trump himself — overwrought, uncalibrated and incapable of having an intelligent conversation about any complex policy problem.
For example, there’s a complex policy problem at the heart of this week’s Iran episode. Iran is not powerful because it has a strong economy or military. It is powerful because it sponsors militias across the Middle East, destabilizing regimes and spreading genocide and sectarian cleansing. Over the past few years those militias, orchestrated by Qassem Soleimani, have felt free to operate more in the open with greater destructive effect.
We’re not going to go in and destroy the militias. So how can we keep them in check so they don’t destabilize the region? That’s the hard problem — one that stymied past administrations.
In the Middle East, and wherever there are protracted conflicts, nations have a way to address this problem. They use violence as a form of communication. A nation trying to maintain order will assassinate a terrorism leader or destroy a terrorism facility. The attack says: “Hey, we know we’re in a long-term conflict, but let’s not let it get out of hand. That’s not in either of our interests.”
The attack is a way to seize control of the escalation process and set a boundary marker.
These sorts of operations have risks and rewards. A risk is that it won’t cease the escalation, just accelerate it. The radicals on the other side will get enraged and take to the streets. Their leaders will have to appease that rage.
A reward is that maybe you do halt the escalation. The other side implicitly says: “Message received. We’ll do some face-saving things to appease the streets, but we don’t want this to get out of hand, either.” Another reward is that you’ve managed to eliminate an effective terrorist like Soleimani. Talent doesn’t grow on trees.
The decision to undertake this sort of operation is a matter of weighing risk and reward. And after the Soleimani killing, you saw American security professionals talk in the language of balancing risk and reward. Stanley McChrystal, a retired general, and Michael Mullen, a retired admiral, thought it was worth the risk. Susan Rice, a former national security adviser, thought it wasn’t.
But in the anti-Trump echo chamber, that’s not how most people were thinking. Led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, they avoided the hard, complex problem of how to set boundaries around militias. Instead, they pontificated on the easy question not actually on the table: Should we have a massive invasion of Iran?
A great cry went up from the echo chamber. We’re on the brink of war! Trump is leading us to more endless wars in the Middle East! We’re on the precipice of total chaos! This was not the calibrated language of risk and reward. It was fear-stoking apocalyptic language. By being so overwrought and exaggerated, the echo chamber drowned out any practical conversation about how to stabilize the Middle East so we could have another righteous chorus of “Donald Trump is a monster!”
This is Trump’s ultimate victory. Every argument on every topic is now all about him. Hating Trump together has become the ultimate bonding, attention-grabbing and profit-maximization mechanism for those of us in anti-Trump world. So you get a series of exaggerated fervors — the Mueller report! Impeachment! The Steele dossier! — that lead ultimately nowhere.
Most of this week’s argument about the Middle East wasn’t really about the Middle East. It was all narcissistically about ourselves! Democrats defend terrorists! Republicans are warmongers! Actual Iranians are just bit players in our imperialistic soap opera, the passive recipients of our greatness or perfidy.
The world is more complicated than this cartoon. Love or hate him, Trump has used military force less than any other president since Jimmy Carter. When it comes to foreign policy, he is not like recent Republicans. He is, as my colleague Ross Douthat put it, a Jacksonian figure, wanting to get America out of foreign entanglements while lobbing a few long-distance attacks to ensure the crazy foreigners stick to killing one another and not us.
And this is the final paradox. For all the Sturm und Drang that surrounds Trump, populist Republicans and Democrats are gravitating toward the same foreign policy: We’re in the middle of a clash of civilizations; the Middle East is so screwed up, we should just get out; we’re too stupid/ineffective/racist/imperialistic to do any good there anyway.
We fight viciously about Trump, but underneath, a populist left-right curtain is descending around America, separating us from the Mideast, China, even Europe. The real high-risk move is the one both parties are making together: that if we ignore the world it will ignore us. (It won’t.)
Maybe once the Inflammatory One is finally gone from the scene we can have an intelligent conversation about that.

Texto completo: In a rational world, the burning of Australia would be a historic turning point. After all, it’s exactly the kind of catastrophe climate scientists long warned us to expect if we didn’t take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, a 2008 report commissioned by the Australian government predicted that global warming would cause the country’s fire seasons to begin earlier, end later and be more intense — starting around 2020.
Furthermore, although it may seem callous to say it, this disaster is unusually photogenic. You don’t need to pore over charts and statistical tables; this is a horror story told by walls of fire and terrified refugees huddled on beaches.
So this should be the moment when governments finally began urgent efforts to stave off climate catastrophe.
But the world isn’t rational. In fact, Australia’s anti-environmentalist government seems utterly unmoved as the nightmares of environmentalists become reality. And the anti-environmentalist media, the Murdoch empire in particular, has gone all-out on disinformation, trying to place the blame on arsonists and “greenies” who won’t let fire services get rid of enough trees.
These political reactions are more terrifying than the fires themselves.
Climate optimists have always hoped for a broad consensus in favor of measures to save the planet. The trouble with getting action on climate, the story went, was that it was hard to get people’s attention: The issue was complex, while the damage was too gradual and too invisible. In addition, the big dangers lay too far in the future. But surely once enough people had been informed about the dangers, once the evidence for global warming became sufficiently overwhelming, climate action would cease to be a partisan issue.
The climate crisis, in other words, would eventually become the moral equivalent of war — an emergency transcending the usual political divides.
But if a country in flames isn’t enough to produce a consensus for action — if it isn’t even enough to produce some moderation in the anti-environmentalist position — what is? The Australia experience suggests that climate denial will persist come hell or high water — that is, through devastating heat waves and catastrophic storm surges alike.
You might be tempted to dismiss Australia as a special case, but the same deepening partisan division has long been underway in the United States. As late as the 1990s, Democrats and Republicans were almost equally likely to say that the effects of global warming had already begun. Since then, however, partisan views have diverged, with Democrats increasingly likely to see climate change happening (as indeed it is), while Republicans increasingly see and hear no climate evil.
Does this divergence reflect changing party composition? After all, highly educated voters have been moving toward the Democrats, less-educated voters toward the Republicans. So is it a matter of how well-informed each party’s base is?
Probably not. There’s substantial evidence that conservatives who are highly educated and well informed about politics are more likely than other conservatives to say things that aren’t true, probably because they are more likely to know what the conservative political elite wants them to believe. In particular, conservatives with high scientific literacy and numeracy are especially likely to be climate deniers.
But if climate denial and opposition to action are immovable even in the face of obvious catastrophe, what hope is there for avoiding the apocalypse? Let’s be honest with ourselves: Things are looking pretty grim. However, giving up is not an option. What’s the path forward?
The answer, pretty clearly, is that scientific persuasion is running into sharply diminishing returns. Very few of the people still denying the reality of climate change or at least opposing doing anything about it will be moved by further accumulation of evidence, or even by a proliferation of new disasters. Any action that does take place will have to do so in the face of intractable right-wing opposition.
This means, in turn, that climate action will have to offer immediate benefits to large numbers of voters, because policies that seem to require widespread sacrifice — such as policies that rely mainly on carbon taxes — would be viable only with the kind of political consensus we clearly aren’t going to get.
What might an effective political strategy look like? I’ve been rereading a 2014 speech by eminent political scientist Robert Keohane, who suggested that one way to get past the political impasse on climate might be via “an emphasis on huge infrastructural projects that created jobs” — in other words, a Green New Deal. Such a strategy could give birth to a “large climate-industrial complex,” which would actually be a good thing in terms of political sustainability.
Can such a strategy succeed? I don’t know. But it looks like our only chance given the political reality in Australia, the United States and elsewhere — namely, that powerful forces on the right are determined to keep us barreling down the road to hell.

Texto completo: Let us not go again to war. Let us not go to war because we cannot afford to “win” another war. There would be no winning this war. There is only losing, at a cost that staggers every dimension on all sides — in lives, in money, and in the squandered opportunity to do anything better with our collective time and resources on this already beset planet.
I’m speaking here of war with Iran, our current precipice. But I issue the warning more generally, too. Bookmark this page and pull it up as prophylaxis anytime the drums of war begin rattling anew: War isn’t just tragic. It is increasingly dumb and pointless, too.
War is becoming an outdated means of human conflict resolution. Technology is turning armed conflict into an endeavor increasingly dominated by what war scholars call “asymmetric warfare” — meaning that weaker powers like Iran can now marshal so much strength that they are no longer very weak, exacting a mighty cost of victory even to the world’s preeminent global superpower. Then there is climate change, which has ratcheted up the opportunity cost of every conflict; anytime we are fighting each other, we are absconding in the larger and more important fight for the habitability of the planet.
You may debate whether any particular historical war worked out well for its agitators. But there should be no debate that many of America’s recent wars have ended in misery for all. Our politicians talk of war as a last resort, but that is only to keep up appearances, because the truth is too terrible to admit: that our ever-more-expensive war machine (a cost of nearly $740 billion in 2020) can buy us little peace. Rather than a last resort, war now offers no resort. War can no longer be defended as the thing to do after everything else has failed. War must instead be seen as failure itself.
I had thought the futility of war might be grasped by most American politicians by now. One of Donald Trump’s rare bright spots as a candidate was his departure from the post-9/11 Bush-Cheney doctrine that doubled down on heedless U.S. military interventionism. In his oft-stated aversion to “endless war,” Trumps sentiment matched the public’s — a Pew poll this summer showed that most Americans, including most military veterans, now believe that our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have not been worth fighting. Trump seemed to be heeding the public’s caution back in the summer when he abruptly called off a strike against Iran in retaliation for its shooting down a U.S. surveillance drone.
But in killing Iran’s most important military leader, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Trump opened the door to war. Now Iran is retaliating, and a cycle of escalation looks possible — even if, for now, Trump is backing away from further conflict. It’s beginning to feel a lot like 2003 again, with some of the same pundits and politicians who were in favor of a war with Iraq now repeating similar talking points about Iran. While noting that he’d like to avoid war, Trump himself has suggested that war with Iran would be a cakewalk: “It wouldn’t last very long, I can tell you that,” the president told Fox Business in June.
Don’t fall for it. It’s plain dishonesty: How could anyone who has lived through the quagmire of Iraq and Afghanistan think war with Iran will be anything but long and brutal? In those conflicts, America’s overwhelming military might stumbled on local culture, geography, ethnic and religious rivalries, and most of all the determination of an entrenched, committed foe that could melt in and out of the local population.
As Vox’s Alex Ward points out, Iran has almost three times as many people as Iraq did when we invaded in 2003. It also has treacherous geography, and it controls a great many proxy forces across the Middle East and even in likely sleeper cells in Europe and Latin America. Iran also possesses a sophisticated cyberwar operation — it is believed to be behind recent hacks into American banks and other targets and to have spread disinformation and propaganda on social networks around the world.
The United States would overwhelm Iran in a conventional head-on war, but like China and Russia, Iran has adopted a deep capacity to mount “hybrid war” — conflict that involves both conventional and unconventional means of war. (For example, Iran could expand its operations on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, dealing a costly rise in global energy prices.) As Ward concludes: “A U.S.-Iran war would be a bloody hell during and after the fighting.”
This gets to the immense folly at the heart of our military might. Though the United States spends more on the military than the next nine countries combined, we have not been able to purchase much peace through strength. That’s because our strength is clearly of a type, and our years in Iraq and Afghanistan have made plain our vulnerabilities.
Among other shortcomings, our military is still buying mostly big, old defense technologies (like aircraft carriers and bombers) from the military-industrial complex, even if many of these technologies face obsolescence under a future of artificial intelligence, unmanned battlefield robots and other cyberweapons. Our country’s efforts at adopting artificial intelligence technology in the military might not be enough to counter our rivals, including Russia and China.
The upshot is this: The United States holds military supremacy over the world’s waters and the airspace, but our control is limited and contestable. The last two decades have made clear that even for America, war is never simple. We should fear it. We should avoid it.
And we ought to look for more fruitful things to do with our money and our lives, like making life on earth more livable, not less.

Texto completo: I guess we can get back to impeachment.
Donald Trump announced the Iran crisis was over Wednesday, adding that Americans “should be extremely grateful and happy.”
It’s not entirely clear who he wants us to be grateful to. God? Fate? The ayatollah?
Let’s take a wild guess that the answer is living in the White House.
It was a very short talk — less than 10 minutes — but the president still managed to give himself multiple pats on the back. (“Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before. ...”)
And, naturally, blame everything bad on Barack Obama. Trump threw in one whopping inaccuracy — this would be our friendly, peace-loving version of “big fat lie.” He is going to spend the rest of his life claiming the Obama administration paid Iran billions of dollars to get the nuclear peace accord. Utterly false, but you will never talk Trump out of it, any more than you’ll convince him that windmills don’t cause cancer or that he didn’t really win the popular vote.
Dark, suspicious minds wondered if the president had started the whole Iran crisis to get Americans to stop thinking about the impeachment story. Certainly possible. This is a guy who knows how to distract. He golfs, he tweets, he creates crises.
If Trump thought there was any chance of actually getting kicked out of office, God knows what he’d do. Invade another country? Arrest Nancy Pelosi? Pretend to adopt a pet?
Fortunately for him — if not for us — Mitch McConnell is running everything. The House impeachment vote is, of course, a done deal. The bill is going to reach the Senate sometime soon, and the majority leader has been dropping tiny hints that he’s leaning toward giving Trump a pass. (“I’m going to take my cues from the president’s lawyers.”)
During their deliberations, the senators apparently won’t be hearing from John Bolton, who’s now jumping up and down and waving his hand in an effort to volunteer to serve as a witness. Bolton would be the ideal person to ask about Trump’s plan to trade military aid to Ukraine for political dirt on Joe Biden. Granted, he’s a little late out of the gate. Probably been busy searching his conscience. Can’t possibly have anything to do with having a book coming out.
Doesn’t matter. McConnell has expressed zero enthusiasm for the idea of letting Bolton come — unless Donald Trump decides that the Senate’s top priority should be an unconstrained search for the truth. Hehehehe.
It would take four Republican defections just to get Bolton in the door. Even the most theoretically independent of them — even the ones who are at no political risk whatsoever — seem too terrified to stand up to their leader. (OK, Mitt Romney, one last chance.)
Some of the Republicans might think wistfully that Mike Pence — even Mike Pence — would be a big improvement over the guy we’ve got now. For the country, maybe, but not for Mitch McConnell. Trump is the perfect president for Mitch. For the past three years, the senator from Kentucky has basically been running the government. Somebody has to do it, and the administration’s people are barely capable of opening their office doors.
Trump’s two big victories as president have been the tax cut — organized and pushed through to law by Mitch McConnell — and a raft of new conservative federal judges. Listen to the president and you’d think he had the opportunity to name them all because Barack Obama just forgot — or was too lazy — to fill any openings. (“He gave me 142!”)
In the real world Obama was nominating judges like crazy. McConnell refused to even give them a hearing.
Thanks to his pal and protector Mitch, Trump has it both ways on issues like gun control and prescription drug prices. He can say he’s in favor of change without taking any risk that anything will be presented for his signature into law. Mitch has it all covered — with a lid. The House passed more than 400 bills last year, and about 80% of them are sitting around moldering on the Senate runway.
This is incredible power for a politician who’s never been elected to national office and isn’t even popular in his home state — one recent poll put him at the very bottom of the Senate, with a 37% positive voter rating in Kentucky.
Nevertheless, the country’s been Mitchified.
It’s really the McConnell era, and we ought to be discussing that every day, particularly whenever Donald Trump is within earshot.
There’s only so much the media can do to make this situation clear. We have certain journalistic rules against beginning news stories with, “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who actually runs the country, expressed support for his minion, Donald Trump ...”
But nobody’s stopping you. Tweet away. It’ll drive the president crazy. No idea how McConnell would react. He’s probably too busy making all the real decisions to notice.
