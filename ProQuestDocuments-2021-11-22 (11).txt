Texto completo: Washington • Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, criticized some of her Senate colleagues, including the majority leader, for appearing to “prejudge the evidence” in impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, becoming the second Republican senator to question Sen. Mitch McConnell’s pledge to coordinate with the White House.
Impeachment rules require a simple majority vote, meaning McConnell, R-Ky., can afford to lose only four members of his conference if he is to set the parameters of a trial. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, another moderate with an independent streak, said last week that she was “disturbed” by McConnell’s promise to work with the White House counsel to set the terms of the trial.
Both Murkowski and Collins also offered noncommittal positions on calling witnesses to an impeachment trial, which Democrats have pushed and McConnell has resisted. And both women questioned why the House did not go to court when administration officials ignored subpoenas. (Democrats, who control the House, have asserted that going to court to compel testimony from administration officials would take too long when the 2020 election is already in danger.)
“It is inappropriate, in my judgment, for senators on either side of the aisle to prejudge the evidence before they have heard what is presented to us, because each of us will take an oath, an oath that I take very seriously to render impartial justice,” Collins said in an interview with Maine Public Radio that was broadcast Monday. “That’s what it says, impartial justice.”

She specifically referenced remarks from McConnell, that he would take his cues from the White House, and from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, who openly supported the impeachment of the president.
“There are senators on both sides of the aisle, who, to me, are not giving the appearance of and the reality of judging this in an impartial way,” she said, a sentiment she echoed in a separate interview with News Center Maine, a local television station.
With Collins and Murkowski doubting their leaders’ approach, scrutiny will fall on independent-minded Republicans like Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and retiring Republicans such as Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who could force Republican and Democratic leaders to work out the terms of a trial the way they did in 1999 with the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.
An aide to McConnell on Tuesday pointed to instances during the Clinton impeachment trial in which Clinton and his lawyers were in communication with Senate Democrats over proceedings, suggesting that the current leader’s pledge to coordinate was nothing new and nothing to apologize for.
Collins, who was in the Senate during that trial, has repeatedly refused to weigh in on the allegations that Trump abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress, citing the need to remain impartial. She told both news outlets that she had compiled a thick notebook with documents from the last trial and had pressed Senate leaders to adhere to the framework set in 1999.
Drawing on her experience from the Clinton trial, Collins also said she was “open” to hearing from witnesses during proceedings against Trump. Democrats, led by Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, have pressured McConnell to allow them to call members of the Trump administration to testify in a trial.
Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., one of his caucus’s most vulnerable members, said in an opinion article published Monday in The Washington Post that “for Americans to have confidence in the impeachment process, the Senate must conduct a full, fair and complete trial with all relevant evidence regarding the president’s conduct.”
But while Schumer said in his opening proposal to McConnell that the issue of witnesses and documents should be determined before the trial begins, Collins said that she would prefer to wait to decide who specifically should be called.
“I think it’s premature to decide who should be called until we see the evidence that is presented and get the answers to the questions that we senators can submit through the chief justice to both sides,” she told the radio station.

The Associated Press
WHITE SETTLEMENT, Texas - A man who trained others in his Texas church to use guns to protect the congregation fatally shot a gunman seconds after he opened fire during a service, the Texas attorney general said Monday.
Jack Wilson fired a single shot, quickly ending the attack that killed two people at the West Freeway Church of Christ in the Fort Worth-
Area town of White Settlement. More than 240 congregants were in the church at the time.
Wilson's bio on Facebook listed him as a former Hood County reserve deputy and a firearms instructor. He posted about the
Attack a few hours after it happened, saying the event "put me in a position that I would hope no one would have to be in. But evil exists, and I had to take out an active shooter in church. I'm thankful to GOD that I have been blessed with the ability and desire to serve him in the role of head of security at the church."
Speaking outside the church, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said authorities "can't prevent mental illness from occurring, and we can't prevent every crazy person from pulling a gun. But we can be prepared like this church was."
The Texas Department of Public Safety on Monday identified the attacker as Keith Thomas Kinnunen, 43. His motive is under investigation.
Investigators searched Kinnunen's home in River Oaks, a small nearby city where local
Police said their department's only contact with the suspected gunman was a couple traffic citations.
"He didn't exist until yesterday," Deputy Police Chief Charles Stewart said.
But Kinnunen appeared to have more serious brushes in other jurisdictions. He was arrested in 2009 on charges of aggravated
Assault with a deadly weapon in Fort Worth and in 2013 for theft, according to Tarrant County court records.
He was arrested in 2016 in New Jersey after police found him with 12-gauge shotgun and rounds wrapped in plastic in the area of an oil refinery, according to a the Herald News Tribune in East Brunswick. It was not immediately clear how those charges were resolved.
Paxton joined other Texas officials in hailing the state's gun laws, which allow weapons in places of worship. He said the church's security team was formally organized after a measure was enacted this year that affirmed the right of licensed handgun holders to carry a weapon in places of worship, unless the facility bans them.
In a livestream of Sunday's church service in White Settlement, the gunman can be seen getting up from a pew and approaching someone at the back of the church before pulling out a gun and opening fire. Congregants can be heard screaming and seen ducking under pews or running as papers fly to the floor.
"I think you can see by the video, that that guy was surrounded rather quickly by more than just a few people," Paxton said.
Isabel Arreola told the Star-Telegram that she sat near the gunman and that she had never seen him before the service. She said he appeared to be wearing a disguise, perhaps a fake beard, and that he made her uncomfortable.
She said the man stood up, pulled a shotgun from his clothing, opened fire and was quickly shot.
"I was so surprised because I did not know that so many in the church were armed," she said.
Sunday's shooting was the second attack on a religious gathering in the U.S. in less than 24 hours. On Saturday night, a man stabbed five people as they celebrated Hanukkah in an Orthodox Jewish community north of New York City.
Prior to the shooting, the gunman had drawn the attention of the church's security team because he was "acting suspiciously," minister Jack Cummings told The New York Times. He said the team is composed of congregants who are licensed to carry guns and practice shooting regularly.
Cummings said the church added the team because of "the fact that people go into schools and shoot people."
The Texas Department of Public Safety on Monday identified the dead as Anton Wallace, 64, of Fort Worth and Richard White, 67, of suburban River Oaks.
Wallace's daughter, Tiffany Wallace, told Dallas TV station KXAS that her father was a deacon at the church and had just handed out communion when the gunman approached him.
"I ran toward my dad, and the last thing I remember is him asking for oxygen. And I was just holding him, telling him I loved him and that he was going to make it," Wallace said.
Her father was rushed to a hospital but did not survive, she said.
"You just wonder why? How can someone so evil, the devil, step into the church and do this," she said.
White's daughter-in-law, Misty York White, called him a hero on Facebook: "You stood up against evil and sacrificed your life. Many lives were saved because of your actions. You have always been a hero to us but the whole world is seeing you as a hero now. We love you, we miss you, we are heartbroken."
An elder at the church told the Times that one of those killed was a security guard who responded to the shooter.
"He was trying to do what he needed to do to protect the rest of us," said the elder, Mike Tinius.
The gunman was killed within six seconds of opening fire, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said. The quick reaction saved an "untold number of lives."
Britt Farmer, senior minister of the church, said, "We lost two great men today, but it could have been a lot worse."
The FBI was working to determine the shooter's motive. Matthew DeSarno, the agent in charge of the agency's Dallas office, said the assailant was "relatively transient" but had roots in the area.
Paxton said Monday that the shooter appeared to be "more of a loner." "I don't think he had a lot of connections to very many people," he said.
In a 2009 affidavit requesting a court-appointed attorney, Kinnunen listed having a wife and was living with four children, according to court records. He told the court he was self-employed in landscaping and irrigation work.
Church officials planned to make a statement Monday evening following a closed meeting and prayer vigil just for church members, Farmer said.
White Settlement's website says it was named by local Native Americans in the 1800s for white families then settling in the area. City leaders who worried that the name detracted from the city's image proposed renaming it in 2005, but voters overwhelmingly rejected the idea.

10 dumbest things celebrities said during 2019

Texto completo: They're famous for their films, TV shows and music, but sometimes celebrities make more headlines for the jaw-dropping, controversial or cringeworthy things they say.
Here are 10 times that Hollywood heavyweights put their foot in their mouth in 2019.

1. Kanye West's sickening self-praise
No stranger to nonsensical rants and an inflated sense of self, the rapper who made the 2013 album called "Yeezus," which included a song called "I Am a God," was at it again this year. While joining televangelist Joel Osteen on stage at a Sunday church service in Houston in November, West proclaimed, "The greatest artist that God ever created is now working for Him." He added, "I'm here in service to God. No weapon formed against me shall prosper."

2. Barbra Streisand's Michael Jackson misstep
Babs took a lot of heat after her tone-deaf comments about two men -- Wade Robson and James Safechuck -- accusing Michael Jackson of sexually assaulting them as children.
"His sexual needs were his sexual needs, coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has," Streisand told British newspaper The Times in a piece out last March. "You can say 'molested,' but those children, as you heard say (grown-up Robson and Safechuck), they were thrilled to be there. They both married and they both have children, so it didn't kill them."

3. Kelly Ripa's cluelessness
As college students across the county struggle to pay tuition, the TV host -- who boasts a reported net worth of $75 million -- thought it would be funny to joke that her son Michael Consuelos was living in "poverty" now that he's an NYU student and living in Brooklyn.
"He hates paying his own rent, and he is chronically poor," Ripa said on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" in October. "I don't think he ever really experienced, you know, extreme poverty like now."

4. Pete Townshend stains late bandmates' legacies
Fans of The Who guitarist "Won't Get Fooled Again" if they ever thought Townshend missed having his late bandmates, drummer Keith Moon and bassist John Entwistle, around for gigs.
"It's not going to make Who fans very happy, but thank God they're gone," the British rocker told Rolling Stone in an interview out in November, adding they "were ... difficult to play with."
Townshend also threw in that the two "never, ever managed to create bands for themselves. I think my musical discipline, my musical efficiency as a rhythm player, held the band together."

5. Kid Rock's obscene Oprah rant
The President Trump-loving rapper/country crooner's crass onstage rant at a Nashville bar in November was only made worse by the fact that its target was Oprah. Apparently under the influence of alcohol, Kid unleashed an ugly tirade of profanity too coarse to even be bleeped.

6. Justin Bieber's bizarre fight challenge
Who knew that the Biebs had it in for Tom Cruise? The answer is neither one of them, but that didn't stop the singer from challenging the "Top Gun" star to a row back in June.
"I wanna challenge Tom Cruise to fight in the octagon," Bieber tweeted at the time. "Tom if you don't take this fight your (sic) scared and you will never live it down. Who is willing to put on the fight?"
He even tagged Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White, but days later said he was just joking and that Cruise would "probably whoop my a-- in a fight."

7. Roseanne Barr attacks #MeToo accusers
There's no shortage of controversial or offensive things Barr has spewed, so just take your pick. The comedian incited groans again in March when she referred to women who shared their stories of sexual harassment or assault as "hos" during an interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens.
Barr said that a woman had recently told her, " 'Well they were there in the (hotel) room 'cause they thought they were gonna get a job 15 years ago.' " Barr said she responded, "It's like well, 'cause they're hos."

8. Louis C.K.'s abhorrent humor attempt
This isn't the best way to stage a comeback. Comedian Louis C.K., who admitted to masturbating in front of women in 2017 at the height of the #MeToo movement, has since returned to stand-up comedy with an international tour.
But a Holocaust joke he made in November, while earning applause from the crowd in Israel, didn't go over well with the rest of the world.
"I'd rather be in Auschwitz than New York City," he cracked. "I mean now, not when it was open."

9. Madonna's melodrama
When Madonna's interview with New York Times Magazine didn't turn out exactly as she'd hoped, she threw a hissy fit and declared that she felt "raped" by it.
Of the June article, titled "Madonna at Sixty," the singer posted on Instagram: "The journalist who wrote this article spent days and hours and months with me and was invited into a world which many people don't get to see, but chose to focus on trivial and superficial matters such as ... never ending comments about my age which would never have been mentioned had I been a MAN! ... sorry I spent 5 minutes with her. It makes me feel raped."

10. Kim Kardashian's roundabout realization
Who knew all it would take was a White House visit to get Kim K. to stop posting endless scantily clad selfies? The reality show star, who's had to mingle with politicians as she's taken up criminal-justice reform activism, explained the reasoning.
"I realized I could not even scroll through Instagram in front of my kids without full nudity coming up on my feed pretty much all the time," Kardashian told The Cut in November. "And I definitely contributed to that ... I also did think, like, 'OK, I'm here in the White House and then the next day I was posting, like, a crazy bikini selfie.' And I was thinking, 'I hope they don't see this. I have to go back there next week.' "

Texto completo: Senator Chuck Schumer was responding to an article that detailed how a number of White House advisers dealt with the president's order to freeze military aid for Ukraine.
WASHINGTON -- The Senate trial of President Trump must include witnesses and documents that answer new questions that have emerged about the roles top White House aides played in blocking the release of $ 391 million in military aid for Ukraine, Senator Chuck Schumer said Monday.
The comments by Mr. Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, came in response to an article published Sunday by The New York Times. It detailed how a number of White House advisers -- including the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney -- dealt with Mr. Trump's order to freeze military aid that was approved by Congress for Ukraine as it fights a war against Russia-backed separatists.
"Simply put: In our fight to have key documents and witnesses in a Senate impeachment trial, these new revelations are a game changer," Mr. Schumer said Monday at a news conference in New York.
Mr. Schumer said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, must allow the Senate to get more information about the roles played by Mr. Mulvaney and a second White House aide, Robert B. Blair, in blocking the aid, as well as insight into the effort by members of Mr. Trump's national security team in trying to get the hold lifted.
Spokesmen for both Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer said Monday that there had been no new negotiations between them over the format of Mr. Trump's impeachment trial. Most lawmakers are not expected back in Washington until next week, but Mr. McConnell is likely to address impeachment on Friday when he convenes the Senate to open the second session of the 116th Congress.
Mr. McConnell has told colleagues and the White House that he does not want witnesses called, seeing it as an opening for uncertainty during the trial. Mr. Trump, in private discussions, has told advisers that he understands Mr. McConnell's argument, but at times he has said that he wants witnesses.
Mr. McConnell's office declined to comment on Monday about Mr. Schumer's remarks. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
But a lawyer for Mr. Mulvaney said in a statement on Monday that the acting chief of staff would consider any request for him to testify.
"Should there be a Senate trial in which Mick's testimony is requested, we will analyze the request in consultation with the White House," said the lawyer, Robert N. Driscoll. "Whether the White House determines that valid constitutional concerns prevent his appearance or not, I am confident that neither Mick nor the president did anything remotely unlawful, much less anything warranting the House's partisan impeachment effort."
The Times article detailed actions by Mr. Mulvaney and other top White House aides, including John R. Bolton, the national security adviser at the time, and Mr. Blair, an adviser to Mr. Mulvaney. Those three men, as well as other Trump administration officials, have been barred by the White House from testifying before Congress despite subpoenas that have been issued.
The article described unreleased email exchanges involving Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Blair, showing them aware that the president's order would open him to criticism. The article also disclosed that Mr. Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper appealed to Mr. Trump in late August to release the aid, but he declined to do so.
And the article showed that the president reiterated his desire to keep the hold in place throughout the summer, as officials at the Office of Management and Budget -- which had embraced the role of finding ways to make Mr. Trump's policy demands a reality -- searched for a legal justification to maintain the freeze. Officials at the agency had conversations at various points over the summer with the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department and the White House Counsel's Office about the existence of the hold, The Times found.
By September, lawyers at the Office of Management and Budget had begun drafting an argument that, under his commander-in-chief authority, Mr. Trump had the right to ignore the congressional mandates around the Ukraine aid based on existing circumstances that could affect diplomatic efforts, The Times found.
These events, which were not revealed during House testimony or in the House's impeachment report, demonstrate why the Senate must have its own witnesses, Mr. Schumer said on Monday.
"This story makes the choice even clearer: Will the Senate hold a fair trial, or will it enable a cover-up?" he said. "President Trump, if you are so confident you did nothing wrong, why won't you let your men testify?"
Mr. Schumer was one of several key congressional Democrats who pushed on Monday for the Senate to hear from witnesses like Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Bolton, Mr. Blair and Michael Duffey, an official at the Office of Management and Budget.
Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which helped lead the impeachment investigation, said the new information needed to be part of the trial.
"New disclosures, in the form of additional documents and interviews, add to the overwhelming evidence of the president's abuse of his office," he said. "The Senate -- and the public -- deserve to see the full extent of the misconduct the White House has been concealing."
Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, who faces a competitive re-election campaign next year, also took up the topic on Monday, in an opinion article published in The Washington Post. "For Americans to have confidence in the impeachment process, the Senate must conduct a full, fair and complete trial with all relevant evidence regarding the president's conduct," Mr. Jones wrote. "I fear, however, that we are headed toward a trial that is not intended to find the whole truth. For the sake of the country, this must change."

Texto completo: Leonard, Antetokounmpo, Kerr and Ujiri also deserve NBA awards for the decade
With the 2010s ending Tuesday night, it's time to hand out some all-decade hardware. Here's how the major NBA awards would look if applied cumulatively from 2010 to 2019.
Criteria included individual statistics, contributions to winning, team success, impact on the sport, consistency, longevity, age and health. A player's achievements before 2010 were not considered.
MVP of the 2010s: LeBron James James is the only viable answer: He dominated the decade in virtually every category, outlasted the likes of Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan, and enjoyed a head start on younger contemporaries such as Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and James Harden. Along the way, James claimed three titles, three MVP awards and three Finals MVP awards while reaching the Finals in eight straight years.
He led all players in a wide variety of statistical categories, including minutes, points, win shares and postseason wins. He finished in the top four in MVP voting every year from 2010 to 2018, and he regularly ranked first in all-star votes, social media followers and sneaker and jersey sales. Plus, his three free agency moves " to Miami in 2010, to Cleveland in 2014 and to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018 " rearranged the league's competitive landscape.
Some observers, including a panel of New York Times writers, nominated Curry over James given that his three-point shooting has so directly shaped the modern game. Although Curry deserves major credit for the rise of the 'pace and space' era, James's influence on basketball as a sport, business and lifestyle is unmatched. From player empowerment to political activism to social media, James set the standard for the past 10 years.
Defensive player of the 2010s: Kawhi Leonard Draymond Green would have been the pick if not for Leonard's magical 2019 playoff run.
Although Green best represents modern defensive trends that favor mobility, positional versatility and interchangeable lineups, Leonard is a timeless lockdown specialist who made life miserable for the biggest superstars of his era. Leonard defended James in the 2013 and 2014 Finals; he won back-to-back defensive player of the year awards in 2015 and 2016; he received five all-defensive nods; and he limited Giannis Antetokounmpo in the 2019 Eastern Conference finals. On top of all that, he won two titles and two Finals MVP awards with teams that relied heavily on his shutdown capabilities.
Most improved player of the 2010s: Giannis Antetokounmpo Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP, is an incredible player and an even better player development story: The 'Greek Freak' went from a relative unknown in the Greek minor leagues to a next-generation Shaquille O'Neal in six years. Drafted 15th in 2013, the 25-year-old forward has improved his player efficiency rating, usage, scoring average and rebounding numbers every season during his seven-year career. He won the 2017 most improved player award and had a case to win it in 2016, 2018 and 2019, too.
Over that long stretch of steady growth, Antetokounmpo has built himself into an all-around force.
Sixth man of the 2010s: Andre Iguodala Jamal Crawford and Lou Williams each won three sixth man of the year awards over the past decade, but the quintessential substitute of the 2010s was Iguodala. Although the former all-star forward didn't shift to the bench until he arrived in Golden State in 2014, his willingness to sacrifice his minutes and scoring opportunities was a critical driver of the Warriors' dynasty. Iguodala claimed the 2015 Finals MVP award for his work guarding James, and he delivered memorable defensive stands against both the Cavaliers star and Durant in the years to come.
There's no Golden State 'Death Lineup' without Iguodala's quick hands, switching defense, passing and corner three-pointers.
Rookie of the 2010s: Blake Griffin This award goes to the player with the best rookie season of the decade; the one-year 'rookie' designation can't be turned into a cumulative honor. Yes, Griffin's selection comes with a bit of an asterisk because he redshirted his actual rookie year with a knee injury. That shouldn't matter. The 2011 rookie of the year averaged 22.5 points, 12.1 rebounds and 3.8 assists at 21, earning all-star honors and winning the slam dunk contest to boot. Griffin's 9.8 win shares as a rookie remain the most since Chris Paul had 10.4 in 2006.

Coach of the 2010s: Steve Kerr Kerr started at a disadvantage against the likes of Gregg Popovich, Rick Carlisle and Erik Spoelstra because he didn't begin coaching until 2014. He made up for lost time by presiding over the winningest five-year stretch in NBA history, stressing the importance of joy and depth while riding superstar-laden teams to three titles and five straight Finals appearances.
This is a philosophical pick, because Kerr made numerous key decisions that shaped the sport. The present and future of the sport are very much in Kerr's mold.
Executive of the 2010s: Masai Ujiri The 2010s were largely defined by the free agency moves of James, Durant and other superstars. Yet in the NBA's new player-driven era, Ujiri, the Toronto Raptors president, managed to swing the trade of the decade by plucking a disgruntled Leonard from San Antonio for a modest return. That blockbuster paid off with the 2019 title, an unthinkable occurrence for a cold-weather expansion franchise north of the border.

What will it take to beat Donald Trump?

Texto completo: Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both campaigned for, and won, the White House on the watchword "hope." What watchword will it take for a Democrat to win this time?
My suggestion: soap.
Nearly three years into Donald Trump's presidency, America needs a hard scrub and a deep cleanse. It needs to wash out the grime and grease of an administration that every day does something to make the country feel soiled.
Soiled by a president who, Castro-like, delivered a two-hour rant at a rally in Michigan the night he was impeached. Who described his shakedown of Ukraine as "perfect." Who extolled the world's cruelest tyrant as someone who "wrote me beautiful letters. ... We fell in love." Who abandoned vulnerable allies in Syria, then opted to maintain troops in the country "only for oil." Who, barely a year before the El Paso massacre, demonized illegal immigrants who "pour into and infest our Country."
The list goes on, and most everyone feels it. In June, the Pew Research Center published a survey on how the country sees the state of public discourse. The most striking finding: "A 59 percent majority of Republicans and Republican leaners say they often or sometimes feel concerned by what Trump says. About half also say they are at least sometimes embarrassed (53 percent) and confused (47 percent) by Trump's statements."
What's true of Republicans is far more so of the rest of the United States. Pew found that overwhelming majorities of Americans were "concerned" (76%), "confused" (70%), "embarrassed" (69%), "angry" (65%), "insulted" (62%) and "frightened" (56%) by the things Trump says.
These numbers should devastate Trump's chances of reelection. They don't, for three reasons.
First, 76% of Americans rate economic conditions positively, up from 48% at the time of Trump's election. Second, the progressive left's values seem increasingly hostile to mainstream ones, as suggested by the titanic row over J.K. Rowling's recent tweet defending a woman who was fired over her outspoken views on transgenderism. Third, the more the left rages about Trump and predicts nothing but catastrophe and conspiracy from him, the more out of touch it seems when the catastrophes don't happen and the conspiracy theories come up short.
No wonder Trump's average approval ratings have steadily ticked up since the end of October. In the view of middle-of-the-road America, the president may be bad, but he's nowhere near as bad as his critics say.
In that same view, while Trump's critics might be partly right about him, they're a lot less right than they believe. In a contest between the unapologetic jerk in the White House and the self-styled saints seeking to unseat him, the jerk might just win.
How to avoid that outcome?
The most obvious point is not to promise a wrenching overhaul of the economy when it shows no signs of needing such an overhaul. There are plenty of serious long-term risks to our prosperity, including a declining birthrate, national debt north of $23 trillion, the erosion of the global free-trade consensus, threats to the political independence of the Federal Reserve and the popularization of preposterous economic notions such as Modern Monetary Theory.
But anyone who thinks blowout government spending, partly financed by an unconstitutional and ineffective wealth tax, is going to be an electoral winner should look at the fate of Britain's hapless Jeremy Corbyn.
What would work? Smart infrastructure spending. New taxes on carbon, offset by tax cuts on income and saving. Modest increases in taxes on the wealthy matched to the promise of a balanced budget.
What these proposals lack in progressive ambition, they make up in political plausibility and the inherent appeal of modesty. They also defeat Trump's most potent reelection argument, which is that, no matter who opposes him, he's running against the crazy left.
Hence the second point. Too much of today's left is too busy pointing out the ugliness of the Trumpian right to notice its own ugliness: its censoriousness, nastiness and complacent self-righteousness. But millions of ordinary Americans see it, and they won't vote for a candidate who emboldens and empowers woke culture. The Democrat who breaks with that culture, as Clinton did in 1992 over Sister Souljah and Obama did in October over "cancel culture," is the one likeliest to beat Trump.
Finally, the winning Democrat will need to make Trump's presidency seem insignificant rather than monumental -- an unsightly pimple on our long republican experiment, not a fatal cancer within it. Mike Bloomberg has the financial wherewithal to make Trump's wealth seem nearly trivial. Joe Biden has the life experience to make Trump's attacks seem petty. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have the rhetorical skills to turn Trump's taunts against him.
As with most bullies, the key to beating Trump is to treat him as the nonentity he fundamentally is. Wouldn't it be something if his political opponents and obsessed media critics resolved, for 2020, to talk about him a little less and past him a lot more?
When your goal is to wash your hands of something bad, you don't need a sword. Soap will do.

Task force tackles online sex crime cases

Texto completo: Images and videos of child sexual abuse don't only exist in the dark corners of the internet. They are hiding in plain sight across New Mexico.
From January through Nov. 1, there were 977 investigations in the state into reports of adults creating, possessing or distributing images of child sex crimes, and committing other sex crimes against children, over the internet. That number, experts say, is more than double the number from last year. And while every viewing of those images is a crime, prosecutors say it also is a sign that a person might plan to — or already has — sexually abused a child.
"These are individuals that, generally speaking, are extremely dangerous, and a lot of times, there's this misnomer that these are just images," said state Deputy Attorney General Clara Moran.
Moran and other prosecutors do not like the commonly used term "child pornography" because it likens images of abuse to the legal, somewhat regulated industry of adult pornographic content, she said. Moran makes it plain: Many of these images are of children being raped.
While some people tend to believe such images involve children in faraway places, the reality is much different. Almost 90 percent involve children in the U.S., including New Mexico, said Anthony Maez, special agent and commander of the state attorney general's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
The task force has reviewed about 1,400 cyber-tips received from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, peer-to-peer networks and individuals, Maez said. Of the five types of crimes investigated by the group, the number involving images of child sexual abuse is by far the largest.
Not every tip leads to an investigation.
In 2019, the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force has received 592 documented complaints about possession of images of child sexual abuse, 304 about distribution of such images and 63 about creation of images, according to data provided by Maez.
"The number of tips that we see coming in, the volume is very high," he said, "and unfortunately there isn't enough law enforcement officers around the state to work these types of tips."
State law enforcement agencies have ratcheted up their battle against internet crimes against children. About 276 agents across 90 local, state, military and tribal agencies investigate these crimes. Together, they have received 76 documented complaints of child enticement, 21 complaints of a person traveling to meet a child with intentions of abuse, 52 complaints of adults directing obscenities to a minor and 14 complaints of sex trafficking of children, according to data collected by the task force.
An exploding problem Maez points to the ever-evolving world of social media and apps that make it easier to exploit children.
A recent investigation by the New York Times revealed many predators connect with children through gaming or social media platforms and chatrooms — venues that weren't as accessible five to 10 years ago. In 2008, the newspaper reported, 3,000 images of child sexual abuse had been reported. In 2018, there were more than 18 million.
Each new app, Maez said, is a new opportunity for child exploitation.
Criminal complaints, grand jury indictments and affidavits for search warrants filed in New Mexico's First Judicial District Court show how prevalent the use of social media and electronic devices is when it comes to the exploitation of children.
One such affidavit, filed Nov. 18, says blogging sites Tumblr and Reddit reported a 24-year-old man from Chimayó had uploaded images of child sexual abuse. A search of online court records shows he has not yet been charged with a crime. Another affidavit, filed in 2017, goes into graphic detail about a series of videos of girls ages 7 to 10 that authorities believe were shared by a Santa Fe man on a peer-to-peer website.
Española police Detective Ernest Saucedo wrote in a Dec. 3 affidavit that he received three tips from the attorney general's internet crimes task force accusing a 21-year-old man of uploading images of child sexual abuse online using three Yahoo email addresses. The man, Austin Martinez, has been charged with one count of possession of a visual medium of sexual exploitation of a child under 13.
There is no overarching profile of a person who views graphic images of children being sexually abused. Offenders live in both rural and urban areas, and while they tend to be male, they can be of any age.
A growing fight Each month, the task force receives about 110 tips from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the national clearinghouse for all reports made to the cyber-tip line, as well as reports from social media companies, which monitor their sites for potential illegal activity.
Of those 110 reports in New Mexico, Maez said about 63 percent originated from a person who saw an image on Facebook and reported it or from the company's detection software.
Facebook's latest transparency report says the company removed 11.6 million child abuse images worldwide from its social network from July through September of this year. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, removed about 512,000 images.
"Each time it is shared is a revictimization of that child victim," said Matt Baca, a spokesman for the New Mexico Attorney General's Office. "It is important for people to recognize that the sharing and individual viewing is a reoffense."
Concerns over the spread of images of child sexual abuse on the internet has prompted smaller police departments to become more aggressive. Roger Jimenez, interim chief of the Española Police Department, said his agency recently began working with the task force.
"It definitely does hit closer to home for some of the officers that actually live in a community where they're investigating these specific crimes," he said.
Often, officers will already know victims or the accused, Jimenez said, and that added level of familiarity makes the cases more difficult to handle.
Finding perpetrators Task force members say the long road to success in prosecuting internet crimes against children is similar to other kinds of sensitive investigations: Extensive interviews and researching a suspect's past are key before executing a search warrant.
You get one shot to find evidence in these types of cases, New Mexico State Police Agent Jessie Whittaker said, because once a suspect knows what investigators are looking for, they often will try to destroy or hide devices containing images -- or any trace that they created or distributed them.
He could go into a house armed with a search warrant but minimal information and "get a little bit of evidence for the case — maybe nothing," Whittaker said, and then realize later that he missed something key to prosecuting the case.
"What's the chance it's going to be there that next time coming back?" he asked.
Whittaker said he seizes cellphones or other devices while executing search warrants and takes them to the FBI's Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory in Albuquerque. He either gives the agency the materials to review or reviews the evidence himself.
The internet crimes task force also operates a mobile forensics lab, as well as labs across the state, Maez said, to avoid a bottleneck of cases.
"You can't arrest someone until forensics is completed," he said.
Moran said prosecutors typically will seek detention of a suspect after criminal charges are filed. But they are not always successful.
In the case of Martinez, state District Judge Jason Lidyard rejected Assistant District Attorney Ihsan Ahmed's motion seeking a detention until trial, ruling the state did not prove Martinez is a danger to the community.
Such decisions frustrate investigators and prosecutors.
"What you get a lot from the defense is that these are just images, they're just images — and that's just not true," Moran said.
Investigators say they believe people who view graphic photos and videos of child sexual abuse could be — and are likely to be — sexually attracted to children and might physically abuse a child.
"If someone is sexually attracted to children, it is not something that goes away," Moran said.
According to experts quoted in the New York Times investigation on the psychology of pedophiles, one study of 127 online offenders who had been arrested showed that less than 5 percent admitted to having molested a child. During in-depth interviews and polygraph tests, however, another 53 percent admitted to having touched a child. Moran said this holds true for New Mexico.
"Sometimes prosecutors can ask for a polygraph, and what we find is that these offenders oftentimes disclose ... they have been hands-on abusers and just haven't been caught or that they are planning to put hands on a child," she said.
Prosecutors and investigators say a law passed this year by the Legislature — the Electronic Communications Privacy Act — makes it more difficult to prosecute crimes against children.
The law requires law enforcement to obtain warrants including the specific information they are seeking on electronic devices, as well as the specific person or account targeted. It also requires that any evidence collected under a search warrant that does not fall under the specifications of the warrant be destroyed within 30 days.
That timeline sometimes does not allow for adequate development of a case involving images of child sexual abuse, Moran said.
"It's essential to these types of cases for law enforcement officers to be able to comb through all of the images," she said. In some cases, there can be terabytes of information to sift through.
Whittaker said the tight timelines also can make it difficult to retain exculpatory evidence, which can help establish a person's innocence if the suspect is arrested and his or her case goes to trial.
Privacy concerns and data breaches also have pushed social media platforms and apps to use end-to-end encryption, which makes conversations between a sender and recipient private and unable to be seen by a third party. In March, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to introduce the technology on Facebook Messenger.
"If Facebook decides to encrypt everything and not (see) who is doing what on the site or have that available, the tips will go down, but the exploitation is taking place out there," Maez said.
Awareness of these crimes, though distasteful, is critical, Maez said. While the majority of investigations by the internet crimes task force involve cases in which a child has been abused previously, Maez said the group also pursues local tips to stop such abuse from ever occurring.
Each year, the task force runs a public service announcement advertising the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's cyber-tip line. Maez also holds bimonthly training on investigatory techniques, such as how to mimic a person who is posting or responding to online ads for child exploitation, dark web surveillance and the use of cryptocurrency like bitcoin to purchase images of child sexual abuse.
"We are trying to cover every possible place where an individual may exploit a child," he said.

Texto completo: He played a key behind-the-scenes role in the Carnegie Commission report that led to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal funding.


Arthur L. Singer Jr., who became an unheralded father of public television in the late 1960s after commercial networks were famously accused of broadcasting a "vast wasteland" of programs, died on Wednesday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 90.
His death was confirmed by his son Charles.
In the formative years of government- and subscriber-funded public television and radio, Mr. Singer was said to have been instrumental in galvanizing federal officials, philanthropies and academics to seed the public airwaves with quality programming and to finance future development.
His efforts came in the wake of a speech in 1961 by Newton N. Minow, the newly named Federal Communications Commission chairman, to a roomful of 2,000 television executives in Washington, in which he dismissed their product as a "vast wasteland."
In a typical day of broadcasting, Mr. Minow said, "You will see a procession of game shows, violence, audience participation shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, Western bad men, Western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence and cartoons. And endlessly, commercials -- many screaming, cajoling and offending. And most of all, boredom."
According to Steven Schindler, writing in "Casebook for the Foundation: A Great American Secret" (2007), it was Mr. Singer, as executive assistant at the Carnegie Corporation of New York, who persuaded its president, John W. Gardner, in 1965 to create a commission that, with the endorsement of the White House, would study the future of educational television.
As Mr. Singer recounted it, David Ives, a friend who was working at WGBH-TV in Boston, called him in 1964 to ask his advice about whether a commission on the financing of public television should be named by the White House.
"I suggested a private commission with the president's blessing," Mr. Singer recalled in a brief memoir. "and that the scope be broadened to include the nature of educational television, not just its financing. At that moment, stimulated by Ives's call, the Carnegie Commission was born."
The 15-member Carnegie Commission on Educational Television would produce a report, "Public Television: A Program for Action," that laid the groundwork for the Public Broadcasting Act, which President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law in 1967, setting up the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which would seed the formation of PBS and NPR and an infusion of high-quality programming.
The columnist James Reston of The New York Times wrote that the Carnegie report was "one of those quiet events that, in the perspective of a generation or more, may be recognized as one of the transforming occasions in American life."
As Carnegie's liaison to the commission, Mr. Singer recruited the staff, including his former colleague Stephen White as its director (and later principal author of the report), and concurred in the appointment of James R. Killian Jr., the chairman of the corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as the commission's chairman.
"In addition to establishing the infrastructure for public broadcasting," Mr. Schindler wrote in the analysis for Duke University's Center for Strategic Philanthropy and Civil Society, "the commission laid the groundwork for connecting the American public to informative, entertaining and enlightening television and radio programming."
In an interview with the Columbia Center for Oral History in 1971, Mr. Singer said of the commission, "If there was any one thing at the foundation that I enjoyed most and took the greatest pride in its outcome, that's it."
Mr. Singer left the Carnegie Corporation in 1969 to become a vice president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, where he helped initiate two popular public television programs, "Nova" and "The American Experience." The foundation also financed popular science books, among them "The Making of the Atomic Bomb" (1986), a Pulitzer Prize-winning narrative by Richard Rhodes.
"He pointed out that since we gave people money for a living, we were mostly bearers of good news and we should feel good and make others feel good about the work we did together," Doron Weber, vice president for programs at the Sloan Foundation, said by email. "Having a good time was one indicator that we were doing our job."
Arthur Louis Singer Jr. was born on Feb. 14, 1929, in Scranton, Pa., as his parents were on their way to their new home in New Jersey. His father was in the textile business. His mother, Isabel (Corcoran) Singer, was a homemaker.
After graduating from Williams College in Massachusetts in 1950 with a bachelor's degree in economics and earning a master's in business administration at the University of Michigan, he served in the Navy in the Mediterranean.
Mr. Singer was a dean at M.I.T., where he helped establish the university press and organized the first meeting in the United States between American and Soviet experts of what became known as the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, named for the town in Nova Scotia where they were held.
In addition to his son Charles, he is survived by two other sons, Arthur and Philip; his wife, Joan (Cristal) Singer; and two granddaughters.
Jonathan F. Fanton, a former president of the New School, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, described Mr. Singer as his most important mentor.
"I learned a lot from him," Mr. Fanton said in an email: "Pick good people, give them room to grow, take responsible risks, look over the horizon for issues not identified or fully understood."

Local's new book offers tough love to Democrats

Texto completo: We all learned as kids that "you can't judge a book by its cover," but that rule doesn't apply when Rick Wilson writes about political campaigns.
Wilson, 56, lives in Tallahassee and is a nationally known campaign consultant, writing a column for The Daily Beast and appearing often in political panel discussions. For the past 30 years, he's been a strategist and advertising pitchman for Republican candidates, crafting images and messages that usually left Democrats weeping into their mocha java grande lattes.
His first book, "Everything Trump Touches Dies," topped the New York Times best-seller list last year. His new one, "Running Against the Devil," is coming out Jan. 14, subtitled "a plot to save America from Trump – and Democrats from themselves."
His book covers pretty much tell readers what's inside. The new one features a shadowy profile of Trump with red horns and a spade tail. But this isn't just an all-out hate fest.
"As I've said before, Trump isn't Hitler. Hitler had normal-sized hands and the ability to concentrate for more than 30 seconds," Wilson concedes. But assessing what re-electing Trump portends for "our national soul," he warns that "a generation will learn its behavior from the worst role model since Saddam Hussein."
C'mon, Rick, don't soft-pedal it.
Wilson is probably the funniest man in politics, a trade not known for madcap funsters. There's almost a whiff of guilt about giving his high-priced political advice to his lifelong opponents. But Wilson believes that what's good for the country – that is, defeating Trump – means going against his conservative principles.
"If Democrats win, I'm going to hate it rather a lot," he writes in an early chapter. "But there's more at stake than political and ideological preference now."
Liberal Democrats won't welcome views of an apostate Republican. But to beat Trump, they need to reach millions of voters who don't trust the government to regulate guns, dislike abortion and want an orderly immigration policy.
Democrats can't attract those voters by calling their beliefs "hate."
Tactically, Wilson calculates that 15 states matter next year. Florida, with 29 electoral votes, is the biggest of them, followed by Pennsylvania (20), Ohio (18), Georgia and Michigan (16 each) and North Carolina (15). Trump won them in 2016 and, if Hillary Clinton had carried Florida and just one of the others ....
Well, she didn't. And Wilson warns Democrats not to get misty-eyed over what might have been. He sternly suggests any campaign worker who talks about the popular vote, rather than the Electoral College, should be confined in the faculty lounge at Oberlin until Nov. 4.
Issues? You want issues? Wilson says Trump is the issue, and the Democrat message has to be "he lied to you." Daydreaming about free college, gun control and Medicaid for all is cool in New York and the West Coast – states the Democrats couldn't lose anyway – but Midwest farmers and Pennsylvania steel workers need to be shown the man they trusted three years ago hasn't delivered.
Lacking a "generational candidate" like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, Wilson says the Democrats need a good ol' bare-knuckle brawler who hits back hard – even harder – at Trump's Tweets and the raw rhetoric of his rallies.
"Like juggling, it's hard," Wilson says of combating someone as unprecedented as the president. "Like juggling chain saws with a live ferret in your pants, it's also dangerous. (You practice first with a dead ferret in your pants. Don't ask.) (parentheses his)
Aside from Trump, Wilson cautions Democrats that they're up against Fox News, sophisticated Russian agitprop, a GOP solidly united out of love or fear of their man, Twitter-Facebook imagery and, of course, tons of money. Plus, the White House can control the daily news with not one, but two, jumbo jets to run around the world on "official" business.
Difficult though it may be for Democratic activists to understand, millions of Americans really enjoy laughing at them. Trump has persuaded his followers that not only is he telling the truth (wind turbines cause cancer; Mexico pays for the wall) but that those who impeached him are liars.
"Democrats are running against a party and a constituency who not only view the president's loose relationship with the truth as tolerable," Wilson writes, "but who see any lie or conspiracy theory that accomplishes their beloved goal of owning the libs as acceptable and, in fact, desirable."

Texto completo: Siobhan Scott Heekin-Canedy and Michael Francis O'Hara were married Dec. 28 at the Basilica of St. John the Evangelist in Stamford, Conn. The Rev. Pioter Smolik, a Roman Catholic priest, led the ceremony.
The couple met at Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, Calif., from which each graduated, she with distinction.
Ms. Heekin-Canedy, 28, is pursuing a master's degree in international relations at Tufts University. From 2008 to 2014 she was an elite ice dancer who won the Ukrainian National Championship in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.
She is the daughter of Anne Heekin-Canedy and Scott Heekin-Canedy of Stamford. The bride's father retired as the president and general manager of The New York Times Company. Her mother, a stay-at-home parent who home-schooled the bride through middle and high school, until 1990 was the vice president for film development at MJJ Productions, which was the production company of the singer-songwriter Michael Jackson.
Mr. O'Hara, 27, is pursuing an online bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at Arizona State University and is a technical consultant based in Stamford for Cape Environmental Management, a water remediation company in Norcross, Ga., that works on Environmental Protection Agency Superfund projects.
He is a son of Mary O'Hara and Martin O'Hara of Sacramento, Calif. The groom's mother, a stay-at-home parent, home-schooled her nine children from kindergarten to Grade 12, with the help of his father, a secondary school math teacher who works extensively with curriculum development at John Adams Academy, a classical liberal arts charter school in Roseville, Calif.
In 2014, after Ms. Heekin-Canedy, a freshman, impressed Mr. O'Hara, a senior, with her remarks during the question-and-answer session of a lecture at college, he asked her to go waltzing with him, a Friday night tradition at school. A couple of weeks later they started dating. He proposed in January 2019 at Petrin Lookout Tower overlooking the night lights of Prague.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and an icon of the civil rights movement, revealed Sunday that he had advanced pancreatic cancer but planned to return to Washington to continue work and begin treatment.
“I have been in some kind of fight — for freedom, equality, basic human rights — for nearly my entire life," Lewis, 79, said in a statement. “I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now."
Survival rates for pancreatic cancer are grim, and Lewis said his cancer was Stage 4, the most advanced.
“I have decided to do what I know to do and do what I have always done: I am going to fight it and keep fighting for the beloved community," Lewis said. “We still have many bridges to cross."
Born on a sharecropping farm, Lewis has spent his life fighting for racial integration and civil rights, rising through the ranks of the civil rights movement before taking office. As the dean of the Georgia delegation, he is seen by many Democrats on Capitol Hill as the conscience of the caucus.
“You're not alone in this fight, my friend," Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, wrote on Twitter. “The whole nation, which owes you an incredible debt, is with you."
“If there's one thing I love" about Lewis, former president Barack Obama wrote on Twitter, “it's his incomparable will to fight. I know he's got a lot more of that left in him."

Sanders staffers complain about use of Amazon
Senator Bernie Sanders frequently attacks Amazon on the campaign trail, vowing to break up the online retail giant if elected and decrying its ability to pay no federal taxes on billions in profits.
That's why impassioned dissent erupted within the Sanders campaign earlier this year over its purchases of large amounts of supplies through Amazon, according to five people with knowledge of the situation. Carli Stevenson, then a senior Sanders campaign aide in New Hampshire, raised concerns directly with national campaign officials and suggested using a different company, three of the people said.
The Sanders campaign continued using Amazon despite the concerns. Through September, it had spent more than $233,000 on Amazon purchases. In a statement, Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said, "We agree that too few companies have too much power over our economy and our media in America and they often don't pay their fair share of taxes, which is why a Sanders administration will take them on."He declined to answer questions on why the campaign opted to use Amazon.

Texto completo: We hope everyone had a Merry Christmas. We want to thank Jessica Onsurez with the Current-Argus for providing us with space throughout the year to talk about what is happening around town, because there is so much to cover in Carlsbad.
Carlsbad even received a considerable amount of national attention because of the oil and gas boom. The Washington Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal all sent reporters here. For the most part, these stories captured exactly what is happening here – Carlsbad has become the epicenter of a shale revolution that means high paying jobs and a state surplus, but also led to housing shortages, road congestion and issues in the service industry.
Our community made some great strides in roads and housing this year, and we want that momentum to continue into 2020.
Early in the year, 2019's legislative session made everyone down here quite nervous, especially the introduction of a bill that would have banned fracking and cost the state billions of dollars. Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed and that disastrous idea did not see the light of day.
One positive outcome of the previous legislative session is that we did finally see a lot of momentum in terms of improving and repairing the state highways around southeastern New Mexico. Thanks to our legislative delegation for their dedication toward making this happen. There has also been an incredible amount of progress on the brine well remediation effort over the past few months – the plans that had been discussed for years have now become a reality.
As discussed in the last progress report, this has been one of our best years ever in terms of road improvements locally as well. The City of Carlsbad allocated $10 million to roads this year – about three times what was devoted in the previous year. There is clearly a lot left to do, but this issue is receiving the attention it deserves.
Assisting with our efforts toward road improvements has been the development of a very strong partnership with Eddy County and Carlsbad Municipal Schools. The passage of the school bond this year means our district is able to adjust for an increase in students. We are seeing several large housing developments going up around town, both to the north of the Flume and in southeast Carlsbad and the Lea Street area. These are great strides, and the City will work with these developers to ensure smooth progress.
On the commercial side, the opening of a new and much larger Albertsons Market was certainly one of the highlights for 2019. This investment in our community made life much easier for so many residents.
Highlights for the year also included this year's Energy Summit, where our current and former governor both helped present the "Spirit of the Oilfield" awards and former Dallas Cowboy legend Randy White fielded questions by a group of local students.
Carlsbad has changed in many ways over the past 20 years, but this community's heart is still bigger than ever. It has been an honor to serve you as mayor throughout 2019, and we're looking forward to a great 2020.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please call 575-887-3798.

Texto completo: Every year at this time, travel journalists sweep out the tumbleweeds between their ears and concentrate. This is when they gift the world with lists telling people where to go in the coming year. As one of the aforementioned travel list makers, I find that people really like the lists. They even read them, or at least they look at the pretty pictures. So I devised a very scientific formula to determine the “Destinations to visit in [fill in the year of your choice here]."
I begin by thinking of places I want to visit, and places where I'd like to return, and then I write them down. And, well, there you have it. It's kind of like making a shopping list, but with Caribbean islands and European cities instead of milk and Popsicles.
That's a slight oversimplification. I also look at travel trends to see what's catching people's fancy and what kinds of vacations (eco-friendly, wellness, adventure) are au courant. I listen to recommendations from friends and readers, and I also drool over Instagram photos. My methodology, as you may have gathered, is as logical as casting Denise Richards as nuclear physicist Dr. Christmas Jones in “The World is Not Enough."
So why on earth would you trust me, or The New York Times, or Travel + Leisure, or anyone else to tell you where to go in 2020?
Also, please see my list below of places to go in 2020.
Back in the old days, meaning pre-Internet, people went to their travel agents to plan vacations. I saw evidence of this on the television show “The Americans." Itineraries were spit out from loud dot matrix printers. The beauty of the practice was that the travel agent knew their customers and therefore could suggest trips to suit their clients' interests and budgets. Those trips were realistic. What can lists from random travel writers tell you? Most likely that Kraków is the new Zagreb, or Costa Rica is very 2017, and now St. Lucia is the destination of choice. That's fine for aspirational armchair travel, but let's get real: Are you really going to Kraków in 2020? (No offense, Kraków.)
According to the U.S. Travel Association, Americans received an average of 23.9 vacation days in 2018. A quarter of those days sat unused, and more than half of Americans said they left at least a few vacation days on the shelf. Those figures mean that the average American took 17.4 days of vacation in 2018.
Meanwhile, the New York Times offers an annual list of 52 (!) places that are must-see hot spots each year. So, 52 places in 17.4 days is a lot of travel stress. As my mother-in-law would say ¡Ay, díos mio! Even a website such as the Points Guy that recommends 20 must-visit places for 2020 is overdoing it a smidge.
But still, highfalutin' writers (myself included) with rampant cases of wanderlust and vivid imaginations are still spitting out a sugarload of these lists.
Again, please consult my list below of where to go in 2020.
While Forbes may be recommending that travelers head to Jaisalmer, India, in 2020, people are not rushing to book flights there. Instead, Travel Leaders Group, one of North America's largest travel agency companies, offered up a list of where people are actually planning to go next year. For international travel, locations include exotic destinations such as the Caribbean, western Europe, and Mexico. Domestically, travelers are looking at Hawaii, California, and Alaska.
Even Virtuoso, a network of 1,300 travel advisers who work with monied travelers to plan luxury trips, reports that the top global destinations their customers are booking are European countries such as Italy, France, and Greece. On the family side of travel, parents are planning to drop their ducats in Hawaii, Italy, and a remote place called Orlando.
Perhaps by now you've noticed a disconnect between what travel writers are recommending and where people are actually going. Are travel writers really that out-of-touch with the public? Are we too busy jetting off to Slovenia (please see my list below for details) to notice that the average American would prefer to flop on a beach while their ankle-biters make sand castles? Affirmative. But, speaking for myself, there's another reason why travel writers create these lists.
First and foremost, we're all looking to escape from the problems of the world; from impeachment trials to “Cats," the world is a scary place. On days when it feels like the planet has gone to Hades in a handbag, we'd all rather be on a white sand beach sipping a ridiculously tall rum-based, umbrella-ridden drink. Whether or not we can afford to take these trips is another matter altogether. But sometimes the idea and fantasy of escape is enough.
Then there are the individuals with the time and means to take these trips. There are adventurous spirits in the universe who crave wild, far-flung vacations. They only relax while challenging themselves. They live out of backpacks, or they have enough cash stuffed in their mattresses to stay at the Ritz in Paris. Whatever the case, these lists offer actual helpful suggestions.
Perhaps travel writers aren't as out-of-touch as you or I thought. At least that's what I'll tell my editor. So let's get to it. Here's my list of where you should go in 2020. I'm not going to serve up 52 destinations, because it's too overwhelming, and I'm far too lazy. Instead, how about 10 places you should consider? If you don't like any of my ideas, at least use up your vacation days. There's no law that says binge watching “The Crown" isn't a real vacation.
WHERE TO GO IN 2020 . . . or not
Ljubljana, Slovenia — A few weeks ago I wrote about a bike trip I took through the Julian Alps of Austria, Italy, and Slovenia. I had about 24 hours in Ljubljana and absolutely fell in love. As Arnold would say, 'I'll be back."
Burlington, Vt. — Because of its distance from Boston (about a four-hour drive), I feel as if Burlington doesn't get as much love in these parts as it should. But it's a charmer of a college town that has nature nearby, an impressive craft brewery scene, and quirkiness to spare.
Peloponnese, Greece — The Greek Islands are wonderful and a great destination to tick off your list, but instead of the usual Mykonos nuttiness, try the often-overlooked Peloponnese region. An hour's drive west of Athens, Peloponnese is the large peninsula that hangs from the rest of the Greek island and is filled with incredible scenery and history.
Bogotá, Colombia — Two years ago, every “Where to go" list included Cartagena, Colombia. It's time to get to the capital and rediscover the beautiful history and modern museums of Bogotá. The question that came to your mind as soon as you saw this location was likely “Is it safe?" The answer is the same I would give for any city. There are great neighborhoods and not-so-great areas. Be smart, do your research, and then have fun.
Savannah, Ga. — The Spanish moss that cascades off the trees sets the romantic, and decidedly creepy tone of the city. Every city can make the claim that it has its own unique personality, but in the case of Savannah, the personality is real. It has an incredible culinary scene, a deliciously sordid past, and a gorgeous cemetery where you can wander for an entire day.
The beaches of Nha Trang, Vietnam — At the risk of sounding like one of those pompous travel writers who is always talking about the next big thing, let me tell you about the next big thing. The beaches and national parks of Vietnam are underrated jewels. The prices are low, the food is incredible, and the beaches rival anything you'll find in the Caribbean or French Polynesia.
THE REST OF THE BEST
Bequia, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines — The Caribbean the way it used to be.
Ogunquit, Maine — It has one of the nicest beaches in the state, the perfect cliff walk, and plenty to do on rainy summer days.
Edinburgh, Scotland — Boston has a new direct flight to the Scottish capital of cool.
Marrakech, Morocco — Brimming with color, culture (an Yves Saint Laurent museum!), and shopping.

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is asking NBC to refuse to air the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
Scott and U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, penned a letter to NBC Universal CEO Stephen Burke and NBC Olympics president Gary Zenkel asking they join in demanding the International Olympic Committee strip the Games from China or else not air the two-week event.
Scott and Hawley cited China's human rights abuses against the Muslim Uyghurs and the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in their letter, first reported by Axios.
"Communist China is one of the great human rights abusers in the world, and it presents a threat to the safety and security of every athlete and tourist who will travel to Beijing," they wrote.
China has set up a surveillance infrastructure "that tracks every person's location and internet activity ... [and] uses millions of cameras, powered by facial recognition technology, to spy on and persecute those who criticize the regime."
In addition, "documents obtained by the New York Times revealed the lengths to which Communist China uses this technology to track and oppress Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic group in the province in Xianjing. ... And they confirmed, as had previously been reported, that more than a million Uyghurs are in prison and 're-education camps,' simply because of their religion."
NBC Universal, the letter said, "is faced with an important decision. ... By overlooking China's human rights record, you betray your viewers in misleading them about the most important threat facing our values and our way of life. Please pick human rights over profits."
NBC Universal did not return a request for comment
Scott has been outspoken on China during his first year in office, telling CNBC in November, "Communist China wants to control the entire world, including Americans. They're not our partner. They're never going to be our partner under these existing leadership teams."

In California: A new internet privacy law returns power to consumers

But first, Christmas cash burning a hole in your pocket? Here's a list of small, largely independent California boutiques ready to help you spend that money.
In California is a roundup of stories from newsrooms across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Sign up for M-F delivery here!
'I always feel like somebody's watching me'
Who could know a 1984 song would become so accurate? Today, Americans' every move is tracked across the internet by a trillion-dollar industry that mines and stockpiles thousands of their data points to target ads at them. You don't need to feel like you're being watched — you are.
But starting Wednesday, Californians will have the right to see what information companies are collecting about them and request they stop selling it. The landmark California Consumer Privacy Act has the potential to become a national law if other states follow or companies extend those rights beyond our state lines, privacy advocates say.
Here's a big thing to know about the new law: You have to take action. That means you need to send companies a form requesting the details on what they've sold and directing them not to sell anything else. Within 10 days, expect confirmation that your request has been received. Within 45 days, you should get a response (which may be to request more time). The nonprofit Common Sense has some sample forms (i. e. Snapchat, Spotify and TikTok) and an FAQ.

Brees talks 2004 Chargers, and the worst NFL pre-season predictions
“Worst mistake ever” – Drew Brees, on the (then) San Diego Chargers’ decision to bring in a little QB competition in 2004. I’d say it worked out for the longtime Saints quarterback and expected Hall of Famer.

Who's watching $8 billion meant for local jails?
California's Public Safety Realignment initiative of 2011 transferred people convicted of certain nonviolent crimes, as well as those who would not need to register as sex offenders, from prisons to local jails. At the time, the overcrowded conditions of the prisons violated protections against cruel and unusual punishment, and inmates weren't getting the mental health and medical treatment they needed, courts ruled.
Many inmates were transferred to local jails, along with about $8 billion since 2011, which was designed to cover the costs of the diversion. But lax spending rules and limited scrutiny from both state and county officials have allowed county officials to use those dollars to cut their own costs elsewhere, a McClatchy and ProPublica investigation has found.
Shasta County's civil grand jury said the sheriff's office used realignment money instead of county funds to pay for its work-release program; in Monterey County, a civil grand jury found money targeted for education courses went instead to cover a guard's salary.

Texto completo: A Nigerian publisher and former presidential candidate has been released on bail after a monthslong imprisonment that heightened fears of deteriorating protections for free expression in Africa's most populous nation.
Omoyele Sowore, the founder of the website Sahara Reporters, had been held for most of the past five months by Nigeria's equivalent of the Secret Service, the Department for State Services, or DSS. Two earlier court orders to release Sowore on bail had been ignored by the authorities.
At a court appearance Dec. 6, Sowore, then temporarily free, was wrestled to the floor of a courtroom and taken into custody by the DSS, an incident that stirred outrage when it was circulated on social media.
Sowore still faces trial on charges of treason, money laundering and "cyberstalking" - the last for allegedly insulting the president, Muhammadu Buhari, on television. His bail conditions stipulate that he may not leave the Nigerian capital, Abuja, or speak to the press, but that did not stop him from giving a short statement after his release.
Six members of Congress in the United States had appealed to the Nigerian attorney general on behalf of Sowore, who lives in New Jersey with his wife and children but whose work focuses on exposing corruption and government malfeasance in Nigeria.
His wife, Opeyemi Sowore, said that she was grateful for his release but that her family was still praying for the "holiday miracle" of his return home to Haworth, New Jersey, where the family's neighbors have campaigned for the Nigerian authorities to free him.
"My No. 1 concern is for his safety," Opeyemi Sowore said. "We remain resolute on Yele being cleared of all baseless charges," she added, using the short form of Omoyele.
Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said that he was gratified to hear of Omoyele Sowore's release but that he and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, also of New Jersey, would watch Sowore's case closely.
"I expect the government of Nigeria to ensure his continued safety and security now that he is out of custody," Menendez said.
Gottheimer added: "We will not stop working until Yele comes home."
Sowore had once been seen as supportive of Buhari, but he came to be one of the administration's fiercest critics. In February, Buhari was elected to a second term in an election in which Sowore ran unsuccessfully against him.
Sowore was arrested Aug. 3 on one of his frequent trips to his native country when he was about to lead a protest against the government with the social media tagline #RevolutionNow.
His critics accuse him of trying to overthrow the Nigerian government, rather than, as his supporters claim, merely pointing out government corruption and wrongdoing.

Enough wrath for all: Six times Trump attacked his friends

Texto completo: President Trump is famous for taking down his enemies with slashing comments and tweets. But, sometimes, his friends and allies get a strong dose of the Trump treatment as well.
The president's friendships are reportedly defined by fealty. He surrounds himself with faithful stewards of his message. And, while he is willing to hear a variety of opinions, dissent is not to be aired publicly, and perceived mistakes are not taken lightly. He can be quick to punish, it is said, lobbing broadsides that can resemble the taunts he tweets at his enemies. For some, a door stays open to the rekindling of the friendship. Less so for others.
Here are six friends who stepped out of line and felt some degree of Trumpian wrath.
Lindsey Graham
Today an ally, Graham and Trump's disagreements surfaced early in the 2016 race and remain on issues that include foreign policy. When missile strikes from Iran hit Saudi oil facilities on September 14, 2019, Graham was quick to criticize Trump's "measured" response, which he called weak. “Sanctions so far haven’t worked, and I doubt they ever will. So, I think an appropriate military response is in order," Graham told reporters. “I actually think it’s a sign of strength," Trump fired back. "Ask Lindsey how did going into the Middle East, how did that work out?"
David Bossie
The head of Citizens United goes back years with Trump and was an early booster for him in 2016. But Bossie drew Trump's ire after a Campaign Legal Center report published jointly with Axios in May detailed how the Bossie-led Presidential Coalition raised $18.5 million in 2017 and 2018, spending just $425,000, or 3%, on direct political activities. Only one super PAC, America First Action, run by Linda McMahon, is authorized by Trump.
“The president was livid when he learned about what David Bossie’s group was doing," a person close to the Trump campaign told the Washington Examiner. In response, the campaign issued a tartly worded statement attacking unaffiliated booster organizations. An early draft included Bossie's name. Bossie's actions, a source close to the president told the New York Times, were akin to stealing from the boss. For almost three months, Bossie was kept off the air at Fox News, where he is a contributor. The two reportedly made up in August during a meeting at the White House. A former White House official told the Washington Examiner that, to their knowledge, “matters have been patched up." Today, Bossie's Presidential Coalition is targeting, with big ad buys, vulnerable Democrats in districts won by Trump in 2016 for their impeachment votes.
Paul Ryan
Ryan spent much of the 2016 presidential race voicing strident objections to candidate Trump. With the election in hand, however, Ryan made his about-face. As House speaker for the first half of Trump's term, Ryan was a key steward of the president's first major domestic policy achievement, the GOP tax bill.
Details of Ryan's time working alongside Trump emerged this summer, as relayed in a new book, American Carnage: On the Front Lines of the Republican Civil War and the Rise of President Trump, by Tim Alberta. “Those of us around him really helped to stop him from making bad decisions. All the time,” Ryan said. “I’m telling you, he didn’t know anything about government." The former speaker described wanting to "scold him all the time" but making sure to do so privately. "He actually ended up kind of appreciating it.”
Trump was quick to lash out at the former speaker, tweeting three times about Ryan and condemning his fundraising and leadership record. “Couldn’t get him out of Congress fast enough!” the president wrote. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn one day later, Trump blasted Ryan as a “baby” and a “terrible speaker” and said, “Paul Ryan let us down. Paul Ryan was a terrible speaker. He didn’t know what the hell he was doing.”
Jeff Sessions
Sessions entered the Alabama Senate race in November, igniting the chance for a possible "collision course" with Trump, embittered by Sessions's decision to recuse himself as attorney general from the Russia investigation, the New York Times reported.
Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse Trump in 2016, suffered numerous Trump verbal lashings, including in an Oval Office interview with Hill.TV where Trump took multiple shots, calling him "mixed up and confused" and saying, "I don't have an attorney general." Trump called Sessions a "dumb Southerner" and "mentally retarded," Bob Woodward's book reported, is said to have called Sessions an "idiot" to his face, and referred to him as the bumbling cartoon character Mr. Magoo in private.
Despite the animus, Sessions has proven a steadfast ally to the Trump presidency from the outside. In the statement announcing his Senate run, he reiterated his loyalty. “When I left President Trump’s cabinet, did I write a tell-all book? No. Did I go on CNN and attack the president? No. Have I said a cross word about President Trump? No,” the statement said. “I was his strongest advocate. I still am. We must make America great again.”
Kim Jong Un
Trump has tried to portray how good his relationship is with the Korean dictator, sharing how the two leaders “fell in love” and saying Kim wrote him “beautiful letters.”
But with North Korea continuing its nuclear weapons program and issuing vague threats of a "Christmas present" for the United States, Trump has turned menacing toward his new friend, saying Kim could lose "everything."
He warned early this month that the romance could come to an end. "Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way," Trump tweeted. "He does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States."
North Korea warned it might start calling Trump a "dotard" again.
Fox News
While Fox is viewed as one of the president's biggest boosters and the network's coverage has generally been favorable, Trump, in recent months, has turned on Fox over stories he doesn't like. “The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down!” Trump wrote this summer. “We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn’t working for us anymore!”
Trump said in August on Brian Kilmeade's radio show: “I’m not happy with Fox,” calling the network's polls “phony.” And, two weeks ago, he advised them, "Get a new pollster!" The spat does not extend to the president's allies on Fox's night-time shows, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson, and Sean Hannity, nor to Fox Business, home of "The Great Lou Dobbs," whose relationship with Trump is close enough to be a "mind meld."

Paul Krugman: Big money and America’s lost decade

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren has been getting a lot of grief in the news media lately. Some of it, no doubt, reflects campaign missteps. But much of it is a sort of visceral negative reaction to her criticisms of the excessive influence of big money in politics — a reaction that actually vindicates her point.
It’s true that earlier in her career Warren, like just about everyone else, did fundraisers with wealthy donors. So? Charges of inconsistency — “you said X, now you say Y” — are all too often a journalistic dodge, a way to avoid dealing with the substance of what a candidate says. Politicians should , after all, change their minds when there’s good reason to do so.
The question should be, was Warren right to announce, back in February, that she would halt high-dollar fundraisers? More broadly, is she right that the wealthy have too much political influence?
And the answer to the second question is surely yes.
The first thing you need to know about the very rich is that they are, politically, different from you and me. Don’t be fooled by the handful of prominent liberal or liberal-ish billionaires; systematic studies of the politics of the ultrawealthy show that they are very conservative, obsessed with tax cuts, opposed to environmental and financial regulation, eager to cut social programs.
The second thing you need to know is that the rich often get what they want, even when most of the public want the opposite. For example, a vast majority of voters — including a majority of self-identified Republicans — believe that corporations pay too little in taxes. Yet the signature domestic policy of the Trump administration was a huge corporate tax cut.
Or to take an issue close to Warren’s heart — and her signature policy achievements — most Americans, including a plurality of Republicans, favor tougher regulation of big banks; yet even before Donald Trump took office, the relatively mild regulations put into effect after the 2008 financial crisis were under sustained political assault.
Why do a small number of rich people exert so much influence in what is supposed to be a democracy? Campaign contributions are only part of the story. Equally if not more important is the network of billionaire-financed think tanks, lobbying groups and so on that shapes public discourse. And then there’s the revolving door: It’s depressingly normal for former officials from both parties to take jobs with big banks, corporations and consulting firms, and the prospect of such employment can’t help but influence policy while they’re still in office.
Last but not least, media coverage of policy issues all too often seems to reflect the views of the wealthy. Take, for example, the issue of policies to combat unemployment.
Unemployment in the United States is currently at a historical low, just 3.5% — and we’re achieving that low unemployment without any sign of runaway inflation, which tells us that we were capable of this kind of performance all along. Remember when people like Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told us that high unemployment was inevitable because of a “skills gap”? They were wrong.
But it took us a very long time to get here, because unemployment receded only slowly from its post-crisis peak. The average unemployment rate over the past decade was 6.3%, which translates into millions of person-years of gratuitous joblessness.
Why didn’t we recover faster? The most important reason was fiscal austerity — spending cuts, supposedly to reduce the budget deficit, that exerted a steady drag on the economy from 2010 onward. But who was obsessed with budget deficits? Voters in general weren’t — but surveys indicate that even when the unemployment rate was above 8% the wealthy considered budget deficits a bigger problem than lack of jobs.
And the news media echoed these priorities, treating them not as the preferences of one small group of voters but as the only responsible position. As Vox’s Ezra Klein noted at the time, when it came to budget deficits it seemed that “the usual rules of reportorial neutrality” didn’t apply; reporters openly advocated policy views that were at best controversial, not widely shared by the general public and, we now know, substantively wrong.
But they were the policy views of the wealthy. And when it comes to treatment of differing policy views, the media often treats some Americans as more equal than others.
Which brings me back to the 2020 campaign. You may disagree with progressive ideas coming from Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, which is fine. But the news media owes the public a serious discussion of these ideas, not dismissal shaped by a combination of reflexive “centrist bias” and the conscious or unconscious assumption that any policy rich people dislike must be irresponsible.
And when candidates talk about the excessive influence of the wealthy, that subject also deserves serious discussion, not the cheap shots we’ve been seeing lately. I know that this kind of discussion makes many journalists uncomfortable. That’s exactly why we need to have it.

MODERN MATINEES: JACK LEMMON at the Museum of Modern Art (Jan. 1-Feb. 28). The museum's salute to Lemmon begins on New Year's Day with one of the actor's earliest gigs: an Army training film called "Once Too Often," in which Lemmon plays a soldier who pushes his luck. That short will be followed by "Phffft," a 1954 comedy that is just as much a showcase for the sublimely aloof Judy Holliday as it is for Lemmon. The title is a description of the couple's marriage, which goes phffft when they divorce at the beginning of the film, even though they clearly still adore each other. Lemmon's greatest performances follow later in the series, which includes six films that the star made with Billy Wilder; "Glengarry Glen Ross" (on Jan. 29), with his surprising, vulnerable turn as the faltering salesman Shelley Levene; and Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" (on Feb. 6), in which Lemmon makes a late entrance as a bad father and nearly steals the movie.

'STRANGE DAYS' at IFC Center (Dec. 27-28). This decade began with Kathryn Bigelow's becoming the first woman to win a best director Oscar. So what better way to send it off than with her 1995 science fiction feature, the climax of which is set in what was then the future (New Year's Eve 1999) even as the film commented on the then-recent past (the 1992 Los Angeles riots). Although virtual reality never quite caught on in the way that "Strange Days" seemed to predict -- a never-sleazier Ralph Fiennes stars as a dealer of illicit V.R. fantasies -- the film holds up exceptionally well; it was both of and ahead of its time.

'THE WHITE SHEIK' at Film Forum (through Jan. 7). This restoration of the first solo-directed feature by Federico Fellini ("a highly touted young Italian director," Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times when the movie opened here in 1956, four years after its premiere) gets the ball rolling on the filmmaker's centennial. Expect more revivals throughout 2020, but few will have the light charm of this early work, with Brunella Bovo as a naïve young bride who wanders off from her honeymoon in Rome to meet her idol, Fernando Rivoli, a.k.a. the White Sheik (Alberto Sordi), a swashbuckler from photographed comics.

Texto completo: Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.

ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER at New York City Center (Dec. 27, 8 p.m.; Dec. 28, 2 and 8 p.m.; Dec. 29, 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Dec. 31, 7 p.m.; Jan. 1-2, 7:30 p.m.; through Jan. 5). Ailey's winter season rolls into the new year with programs that feature company classics (you can see the timelessly rousing "Revelations" on Saturday afternoon, on Sunday afternoon and evening, and on Tuesday and Thursday) and works recently added to the repertory. Among those are "Ode," a profound statement on gun violence by Jamar Roberts, a company dancer and the resident choreographer (on Sunday afternoon, Wednesday and Thursday); "Fandango," a demanding duet by Lar Lubovitch not performed by this company in a decade; and works by Camille A. Brown, Aszure Barton and Donald Byrd.

DORRANCE DANCE at the Joyce Theater (Dec. 27, 8 p.m.; Dec. 28, 2 and 8 p.m.; Dec. 29, 2 p.m.; Dec. 31, 7:30 p.m.; Jan. 2, 8 p.m.; through Jan. 5). On Tuesday, the final week of this company's winter residency begins, and it is again anchored by "The Nutcracker Suite," Michelle Dorrance, Hannah Heller and Josette Wiggan-Freund's festive new work set to the effervescent rendition of Tchaikovsky's holiday soundtrack by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn. Joining it is "Lessons in Tradition," a dialogue between Dorrance and the renowned clown performer Bill Irwin, with the singer and jazz bassist Kate Davis; "Harlequin & Pantalone," a duet between Irwin and the beguiling Warren Craft; and "Basses Loaded," which brings together four tappers and four bass players.

NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (Dec. 27, 8 p.m.; Dec. 28, 2 and 8 p.m.; Dec. 29, 1 and 5 p.m.; Dec. 30, 2 and 7 p.m.; Dec. 31, 2 p.m.; Jan. 2, 7 p.m.; through Jan. 5). In the real world, Christmas is over, the gifts are already unwrapped and Christmas trees around town prepare for the sidewalk. Onstage at Lincoln Center, the holiday endures for another 10 days with the magnificent conifer in "George Balanchine's The Nutcracker" growing nightly to impressive heights. Through the tale of Marie's triumph over the Mouse King, her eventful tour through the Kingdom of Sweets and her enchanting encounter with the Sugar Plum Fairy, this top-notch production continues to celebrate childhood wonder into the new year as it has since 1954.

'NUTCRACKER ROUGE' at Theater XIV (Dec. 27, 8 p.m.; Dec. 28, 5 and 10 p.m.; Dec. 29, 4 and 9 p.m.; Dec. 31, 10 p.m.; Jan. 2, 8 p.m.; through Jan. 26). In Santa's annual performance review of whether the choreographer and director Austin McCormick has been nice or naughty, McCormick is clearly gunning for the latter with his scintillating, scantily clad riff on "The Nutcracker" for adults only (21 and older). Singers, dancers and aerial artists spread holiday cheer -- and their legs -- in this glittery and flamboyant production that incorporates elements of burlesque, circus and opera. A special New Year's Eve party, which includes a 10 p.m. performance and post-show dancing with the cast, would be a decadent way to greet the new year.

Texto completo: Readers discuss how today's audiences should view classic operas from another era that have offensive stereotypes.
To the Editor:
Re "Classical Opera's Racism Problem," by Katherine Hu (Op-Ed, Dec. 23):
Congratulations on a thoughtful piece about racism in opera. However, by her admonition to treat "classic operas as historical artifacts instead of dynamic cultural productions," Ms. Hu risks contributing to the continued ossifying of the genre.
Ms. Hu's assertion that the path to securing opera's future is "to view the opera house as both a museum and a classroom" worries me. People don't go to operas to view historical artifacts through a glass case. They go to see living, breathing drama that has something to say about their own lives.
To confront the racism problem in opera -- which undeniably exists -- modern productions can use the outmoded stereotypes and prejudices in these pieces not only to shed light on the negative attitudes that existed when the opera was composed, but also to comment on ways these issues still manifest today.
For instance, Heartbeat Opera's recent productions of "Der Freischütz" and "Fidelio" are set in contemporary America, and present provocative and timely statements on gun culture in the South and police brutality in cities, respectively.
Simon Cohen
New York
To the Editor:
As a white operagoer, I find Katherine Hu's suggestion that majority-white audiences "may be less aware of the offensive caricatures they're seeing onstage" rather patronizing. We don't need to replace one ethnic or racial stereotype with another one.
One would have to be very obtuse indeed to miss the racism and sexism implicit in Pinkerton and Cio-Cio San's relationship in "Madama Butterfly." I don't believe that too many people form their opinions about other people from the "fantastical and fictional" characters depicted in operas.
Regarding racist attitudes, Rodgers and Hammerstein said it very well in "South Pacific": "You've got to be carefully taught."
Debra Yoo
Portland, Me.
To the Editor:
As both an unabashed progressive and an opera fan, I found Katherine Hu's opinion piece about "racism" in opera to be topical but without remedy. Mankind has evolved over the centuries to the point that what was inexplicably "acceptable" in its time is no longer. Puccini was a product of his times. It is his music, a glorious elixir for the soul, that brings us back time and again, not his social views, if indeed we even can assess them by the portrayal of Ping, Pang and Pong.
Yes, we should press all the arts to serve as a classroom and reflect from where we have come and where we are, but we should not change a thing about any of these masterpieces, irrespective of being cognizant of many of the artists not sharing today's social views.
Lou Maione
New York
To the Editor:
I do not think "racist," "sexist" or "Orientalist" operas must be bowdlerized for the benefit of those who need to be politically correct. The plots of most operas are absurd, and the audiences know it. Since many operas were composed 150 years ago, they obviously reflect the prejudices of the era. So what? ("Carmen" scandalized the audience at its 1875 premiere.)
Operagoers are unlikely to walk out of the theater feeling newborn xenophobia based on grotesque characterizations. People go for the orchestral and vocal music, the emotion, the sets and costumes, to enjoy the suspension of disbelief.

Will McConnell Let the Senate Hold a Fair Impeachment Trial?

Texto completo: December 18 - Today the House of Representatives will vote on whether to impeach President Trump. If it votes yes, sometime early in the new year I will take an oath on the Senate floor to uphold the Constitution, review evidence and follow the facts wherever they lead, regardless of party or ideology. Every one of my colleagues will be required to do the same.
As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of holding powerful people accountable. I know that every trial requires fairness and truth. Having worked my whole life serving the people, I know that any trial that abandons the pursuit of truth cannot be considered fair or just.
But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, appears more interested in covering up the president's misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness. He is already trying to limit the impeachment trial by preventing witnesses from testifying, and he has all but announced a verdict. In doing so, he showed the American people that he has no intention of honoring his oath.
Let's be clear: Mr. McConnell doesn't want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up.
Fortunately, Mr. McConnell does not have the power to unilaterally undermine this trial. Every single senator will be empowered with an equal vote on how the trial will proceed. Though in just the past year, Mr. McConnell has used his position to unilaterally block legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act, lower the prices of prescription drugs and address the gun violence epidemic, he cannot wield the same authority in a Senate impeachment trial.
In this trial, senators will be far more than jurors. Every one of us will vote to determine the rules for the trial, decide which witnesses testify and ultimately serve as both court and jury. Each of us will be called on to uphold our oath with every decision we make. We will all be held accountable by the American people if we refuse to discover the facts relevant to the articles of impeachment.
The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, has made a reasonable request to hear from four additional witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the president's misconduct and to review documents that shed light on why the administration initially decided to cut off military aid to Ukraine.
We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who admitted to Mr. Trump's bribery scheme on live television, and from the former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has been shopping stories about Mr. Trump to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress. Every senator should want to hear from anyone who can speak directly to the president's misconduct related to the articles of impeachment.
Even Richard Nixon allowed the key figures behind the Watergate scandal to speak to Congress, and he eventually turned over incriminating portions of his Oval Office recordings to investigators. But Mr. Trump has stonewalled Congress and inhibited our ability to seek justice by demanding that those closest to the center of the Ukraine scandal stay silent.
Senators must be allowed to subpoena relevant witnesses and submit questions to them directly. The Senate should not vote on any article of impeachment or consider a motion to dismiss the trial until we have reviewed the additional testimony and evidence that Mr. Schumer has requested.
I have never been in a courtroom where the accused can unilaterally block witnesses from testifying or prohibit prosecutors from asking witnesses questions. No court would allow a trial to proceed this way, and neither should any member of the Senate.
Ensuring the integrity of this trial is a solemn responsibility for every senator, with consequences that extend far beyond any one presidency. My colleagues and I have a duty to use our voice and our vote to insist on a fair trial, rooted in the pursuit of truth. We must demonstrate to the American people that in our system of justice all are equal under law, and that there are not two sets of rules, one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else. We must conduct the Senate impeachment trial in a way that is fair and that reflects impartial justice.
History will judge the actions taken by the United States Senate at a time when our Constitution and the rule of law were at stake. I'll be fighting for justice and accountability, and my colleagues should too.
Kamala D. Harris is a Democratic senator from California.

Whicker: Santa Anita turns to technology in effort to limit horse tragedies

Texto completo: They will not quit running into each other. They will not quit having heart attacks, or clipping the heels of their competitors. They will not stop getting sick.
But maybe more thoroughbreds will get through this Santa Anita meet alive, thanks to a scanner that deepens the power of probability.
Santa Anita is the first track to use the Mile-Pet Scanner, developed by the veterinary medicine department at UC Davis.
Its purpose is to find things inside a horse’s leg, specifically the ankles, that will cause a problem today and tomorrow.
It will not eliminate tragic outcomes on the racetrack, but the hope is it will keep unfit horses in the barn and perhaps reduce the 2019 death toll of 37, capped by Mongolian Dream in the last steps of the last race of the Breeders’ Cup in November.
Forget all the championship performances that preceded it that weekend, before the arrival of the dreaded Green Screen. The New York Times headlined it like this: “Another Horse’s Death Overshadows Vino Rosso’s Win At Breeders’ Cup Classic.”
According to Dr. Andrew Spriet of UC Davis, the Mile-Pet finds trouble spots in two ways.
“Before, we could only see the images in two dimensions,” he said. “Now we can use three dimensions.
“And before, we could focus on the structural problems. This allows us to see what the molecular issues might be, and we can take action before it becomes a bigger injury.”
Dr. Dionne Benson is the chief veterinary officer for the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita. She points out that most of the concerning injuries involve the ankle, specifically the sesamoid bones.
We have sesamoids, too, but horses have three of them inside each limb, and they provide anchor points for the ligaments. Heavy work can cause the ligaments to rub against those bones and cause damage, which, until now, couldn’t always be seen by imaging technology.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scans have been involved in racing for many years. But in order to properly examine a horse, you needed comprehensive anesthesia, when the horse has to lie down.
“They can’t tell us how they’re feeling coming out of anesthesia,” Dr. Benson said, “and when they do wake up it can be dangerous for them and the people working with them.”
UC Davis found a scanning technique that bypassed all that. The horses are still sedated, but they are still standing. They can be guided into a wheeled device shaped like a ring that compresses tightly around the leg.
“Since horses can sleep standing up,” Dr. Benson said, “this makes the procedure simpler and also faster.”
Spriet said four horses were recently scanned at UC Davis in a span of 35 minutes. Nine horses at Santa Anita have been examined with the Mile-Pet technology.
Still, there has to be a trigger mechanism to send a horse to the new scanner.
Trainers who feel a horse isn’t reacting normally, or even if the horse’s performance has slipped inexplicably, can ask for a Mile-Pet scan, which begins with the injection of an isotope.
“A lot of people have a misconception about a bone, as if it’s made of steel or some other substance,” Benson said. “A bone is a very active thing, and it changes, particularly after exercise. What this technology does is show us what’s going on before there is a fracture.
“It’s always a challenge, but 80 percent of the problems involve the sesamoid or something else in the fetlock area.”
Spriet emphasizes that the Stronach Group’s investment is a prime reason this technology has become available. There have been complaints about the manner of Santa Anita executives, particularly when it comes to pressuring trainers to fill out fields with horses that the trainers feel aren’t ready to run. But Stronach management, particularly with Craig Fravel on board, seems to realize another 2019 is not survivable.
There are too many downward pressures on horse racing’s popularity, and too many trainers and top horses moving east and south for bigger purses, to tolerate Santa Anita’s image as an equine graveyard.
The track also plans to install a standing MRI at the Nuclear Medical Facility early in 2020.
Spriet has said the Mile-Pet will “transform the diagnostic approach for finding pre-existing conditions in horses.”
Naturally, the picket lines won’t dissipate if the death toll goes down. Nobody applauds a pilot for a safe landing. And the fingernail-chewing will not decrease Saturday when the new meet begins.
It is not about eliminating the risk. For the short term, it’s about eliminating confusion and dread from Santa Anita’s pre-existing conditions.

Texto completo: They will not quit running into each other. They will not quit having heart attacks, or clipping the heels of their competitors. They will not stop getting sick.
But maybe more thoroughbreds will get through this Santa Anita meet alive, thanks to a scanner that deepens the power of probability.
Santa Anita is the first track to use the Mile-Pet Scanner, developed by the veterinary medicine department at UC Davis.
Its purpose is to find things inside a horse’s leg, specifically the ankles, that will cause a problem today and tomorrow.
It will not eliminate tragic outcomes on the racetrack, but the hope is it will keep unfit horses in the barn and perhaps reduce the 2019 death toll of 37, capped by Mongolian Dream in the last steps of the last race of the Breeders’ Cup in November.
Forget all the championship performances that preceded it that weekend, before the arrival of the dreaded Green Screen. The New York Times headlined it like this: “Another Horse’s Death Overshadows Vino Rosso’s Win At Breeders’ Cup Classic.”
According to Dr. Andrew Spriet of UC Davis, the Mile-Pet finds trouble spots in two ways.
“Before, we could only see the images in two dimensions,” he said. “Now we can use three dimensions.
“And before, we could focus on the structural problems. This allows us to see what the molecular issues might be, and we can take action before it becomes a bigger injury.”
Dr. Dionne Benson is the chief veterinary officer for the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita. She points out that most of the concerning injuries involve the ankle, specifically the sesamoid bones.
We have sesamoids, too, but horses have three of them inside each limb, and they provide anchor points for the ligaments. Heavy work can cause the ligaments to rub against those bones and cause damage, which, until now, couldn’t always be seen by imaging technology.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scans have been involved in racing for many years. But in order to properly examine a horse, you needed comprehensive anesthesia, when the horse has to lie down.
“They can’t tell us how they’re feeling coming out of anesthesia,” Dr. Benson said, “and when they do wake up it can be dangerous for them and the people working with them.”
UC Davis found a scanning technique that bypassed all that. The horses are still sedated, but they are still standing. They can be guided into a wheeled device shaped like a ring that compresses tightly around the leg.
“Since horses can sleep standing up,” Dr. Benson said, “this makes the procedure simpler and also faster.”
Spriet said four horses were recently scanned at UC Davis in a span of 35 minutes. Nine horses at Santa Anita have been examined with the Mile-Pet technology.
Still, there has to be a trigger mechanism to send a horse to the new scanner.
Trainers who feel a horse isn’t reacting normally, or even if the horse’s performance has slipped inexplicably, can ask for a Mile-Pet scan, which begins with the injection of an isotope.
“A lot of people have a misconception about a bone, as if it’s made of steel or some other substance,” Benson said. “A bone is a very active thing, and it changes, particularly after exercise. What this technology does is show us what’s going on before there is a fracture.
“It’s always a challenge, but 80 percent of the problems involve the sesamoid or something else in the fetlock area.”
Spriet emphasizes that the Stronach Group’s investment is a prime reason this technology has become available. There have been complaints about the manner of Santa Anita executives, particularly when it comes to pressuring trainers to fill out fields with horses that the trainers feel aren’t ready to run. But Stronach management, particularly with Craig Fravel on board, seems to realize another 2019 is not survivable.
There are too many downward pressures on horse racing’s popularity, and too many trainers and top horses moving east and south for bigger purses, to tolerate Santa Anita’s image as an equine graveyard.
The track also plans to install a standing MRI at the Nuclear Medical Facility early in 2020.
Spriet has said the Mile-Pet will “transform the diagnostic approach for finding pre-existing conditions in horses.”
Naturally, the picket lines won’t dissipate if the death toll goes down. Nobody applauds a pilot for a safe landing. And the fingernail-chewing will not decrease Saturday when the new meet begins.
It is not about eliminating the risk. For the short term, it’s about eliminating confusion and dread from Santa Anita’s pre-existing conditions.

Texto completo: U.S. military leaders are weighing whether to abandon a drone base in Niger as part of a reshuffling of troops around the world.
The decision to stop using the base is part of discussions to reduce American forces from West Africa as the Pentagon refocuses on confronting China and Russia, according to the New York Times.
In recent years, the U.S. military increased its presence in Africa, building the huge drone base from where it launches drone aircraft to combat extremist organizations.
U.S. Africa Command announced in early November intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations were being conducted from the base, nearly a year after it was supposed to have been completed.
Niger Air Base 201 was supposed to be finished by the end of 2018, but bad weather and harsh conditions pushed back the opening. The base had a $110 million price tag and the cost of operating the facility was expected to cost about $30 million per year.
The United States had a 10-year lease agreement for use of the base, which was the largest installation Air Force personnel have ever built.
Photo Caption:In this photo taken Monday, April. 16, 2018, A U.S. and Niger flag are raised side by side at the base camp for air forces and other personnel supporting the construction of Niger Air Base 201 in Agadez, Niger. On the scorching edge of the Sahara Desert, the U.S. Air Force is building a base for armed drones, the newest front in America’s battle against the growing extremist threat in Africa’s vast Sahel region. Three hangars and the first layers of a runway command a sandy, barren field. Niger Air Base 201 is expected to be functional early next year. The base, a few miles outside Agadez and built at the request of Niger’s government, will eventually house fighter jets and MQ-9 drones transferred from the capital Niamey. The drones, with surveillance and added striking capabilities, will have a range enabling them to reach a number of West and North African countries. (AP Photo/Carley Petesch)

Annalee Newitz: What arguments about ‘Star Wars’ say about democracy

Texto completo: Like a lot of Americans, I have formative memories of my first exposure to George Lucas’s epic tale of space Rebels defeating a planet-destroying Empire. I got so excited as a little kid in 1977 about seeing “Star Wars: A New Hope” that I threw up outside the theater.
Years later, I was thoroughly disoriented when I found out on the news that Star Wars was no longer a movie; it was a nuclear missile defense system described by Ronald Reagan as the most futuristic arsenal ever built. Officially called the Strategic Defense Initiative, the Star Wars weapons system never came to fruition. But it forever changed the way an entire generation thought about the “Star Wars” movies.
Lucas’s series about interstellar superweapons became a way of talking about American power in the world. When “Star Wars: A New Hope” was released, the Vietnam War had just ended in traumatic ambiguity, Richard Nixon had resigned under the threat of impeachment, and the old American dreams didn’t fit our changed reality.
“Star Wars” became a new national mythos; it rebooted America’s revolutionary origin story and liberty-or-death values using the tropes of science fiction. Now, however, the movies no longer strike the same chord. Just as America’s political system is falling into disarray again, our cultural mythmaking machine is faltering as well.
When I say “faltering,” I don’t mean economically. The “Star Wars" franchise is among Disney’s most lucrative properties. But each new installment has escalated conflicts between fans over everything from character arcs to the diversity of its cast. Filmmakers are torn between catering to the base, with its rabid nostalgia for the 1970s and ’80s movies, and striking out into new territory that feels more relevant to the 21st century. The cinematic results are uneven at best.
“The Rise of Skywalker,” released last week, is a muddled and aimless homage to previous films in the series. Its countless callbacks to the older films feel like an effort to “make ‘Star Wars’ great again,” though it does manage to deliver a few liberal-sounding messages. Call it the Joe Biden of “Star Wars” movies.
To continue the analogy, you might say that “The Last Jedi,” “The Force Awakens,” and “Rogue One” are in the Barack Obama tradition. They gave fans truly diverse casts and grappled in a relatively nuanced way with the class and race conflicts that have hovered at the margins of every “Star Wars" story.
They also made fans of the early movies livid. Some used social media to demand that Disney stop with the politically correct storytelling, while others launched racist attacks on the Vietnamese-American actress Kelly Tran, who plays the engineer Rose Tico in two of the films.
I’m not the only one who has noticed this obvious parallel to American electoral politics. JJ Abrams, who directed “The Rise of Skywalker,” noted in a recent interview that the vicious polarization within Star Wars fandom is not a phenomenon restricted to “Star Wars.” As he put it, “This is about everything.”
And a recent study by Morten Bay, a University of Southern California digital media researcher, revealed that over 50 percent of the venom directed on Twitter at Rian Johnson, director of “The Last Jedi,” came from the same sources as Russian election meddling.
Using the analytical tools that other technologists deployed to uncover Russian influence during the 2016 election, Mr. Bay found that “bots, trolls/sock puppets or political activists” were using the “Star Wars” debate “to propagate political messages supporting extreme right-wing causes and the discrimination of gender, race or sexuality” and that “a number of these users appear to be Russian trolls.” So it seems that it was political operatives, not fans, who were denigrating the movie and fomenting some of the virulent racism and misogyny against its cast.
Using “Star Wars” as the vehicle was a canny move by the trolls. Fans, like the American electorate, are polarized and angry. Online and in real life, they scream at one another about how Luke Skywalker would really behave decades after finding out that his dad was Darth Vader.
Often these fights begin with someone asserting that the latest “Star Wars” movie ruined their childhood. That’s not wrong. An attack on “Star Wars” is an attack on what many adults of George Lucas’s generation were taught as children: that the most important good guys are generally white men, and the biggest threat on earth is a superweapon.
The problem is that nobody agrees anymore on what the good guys look like, nor what this century’s global threat really is. Fights over “Star Wars” cut to the core of American identity — all the way down to our childhood selves — because they aren’t just squabbles over whether Rey’s Force powers are realistic. They’re about who we are as a nation, and how we will survive as a people in the future.
There are hints of a new hope for the franchise in works set outside the movies’ central plotline. Delilah S. Dawson’s recent “Star Wars" tie-in novel “Phasma” reveals that the First Order wrecked the environment on Captain Phasma’s home planet, leaving our battered protagonist no choice but to join the bad guys. In the new Disney Plus television series “The Mandalorian,” the hero comes from a marginalized group whose planet was strip-mined by Imperials seeking the precious metal beskar. These stories gesture at a revitalized “Star Wars” mythology that might speak to people who fear rising seas more than superweapons.
Maybe the unresolved outrage set off by “The Last Jedi” and “The Rise of Skywalker” is a sign that this franchise needs to make way for a new set of stories. Americans’ trust in government is being ripped apart by scandal and a looming impeachment trial. We desperately need a new American mythology to fit the 21st century realities of a majority-minority nation dealing with planet-wide threats like climate change.
The process of revitalizing American democracy doesn’t begin and end at the voting booth. We also have to tell better stories about ourselves.

Shuttered Philadelphia Refinery May Get New Life After Fire, But What Might It Become?

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA - It’s not often that 1,300 acres of industrial land become available on the edge of a major city center, especially not with good road, rail and water links to the outside world. But the shutdown and bankruptcy of a major refinery have put the site and its infrastructure into play.
More than a dozen entities are interested in buying all or part of the South Philadelphia Refinery, which was shut down in June after an explosion caused an extensive fire. Before its closing, the refinery produced more gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products than any other refinery on the East Coast.
The large size of the parcel, its location in the heart of the Northeast and its proximity to transportation make it an attractive proposition to energy companies that want to restart all or part of the refinery, or combine its previous output with biofuels or renewable energy such as solar.
“For this mass of ground to become available is extraordinary,” said J. Eustace Wolfington, the senior managing director in the Philadelphia office of Newmark Knight Frank, a real estate firm.
But the refinery’s future is clouded in part by questions over viability. Its current owner, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, filed for bankruptcy protection twice in less than two years, citing the rising cost of crude oil and the high expense of buying biofuel credits to meet federal requirements. In its latest filing in July, the company blamed its woes on damage caused by the explosion.
The plant’s ability to survive was also called into question in September by an industry report from the consulting firm IHS Markit, which projected declining demand for gasoline and other refined products over the next 30 years because of increased fuel efficiency and greater use of electric vehicles.
Production cuts
Refineries, especially those on the East Coast, are expected to respond to the projections by cutting production by two-thirds by 2050, IHS said in the report, which examined the future of the refinery for the city of Philadelphia.
Still, a refinery could be reopened on the site, IHS said, or the plant could be overhauled to make biofuels, renewable energy, petrochemicals or heavy manufacturing. The size and location of the site could also make it suitable for a new logistics and warehousing center, the report suggested.
Other refineries have been repurposed, it noted, including the Imperial Oil Refinery in Nova Scotia, which became a port terminal after closing in 2013, and a Shell Haven refinery in Britain that closed in 1999 and was converted to a container port with distribution facilities.
Demand for the site may be limited by heavy contamination from some 150 years of refining, which left behind a cocktail of hazardous chemicals such as benzene and toluene. Contaminants are being cleaned up by a contractor for Sunoco, an oil company that owned the site until 2012, overseen by state and federal environmental regulators.
Potential buyers may consider the site’s vulnerability to a possible rise in the sea level, given that it is bordered by a tidal section of the Schuylkill. The river has already flooded some sections of the complex and is expected to inundate it further in coming decades.
Another challenge is the densely populated sections of South Philadelphia, where residents, many of them impoverished, blame decades of air pollution from the refinery for high rates of asthma and other illnesses.
‘The site’s gold’
Still, Wolfington of Newmark Knight Frank said the site offered a rare opportunity for redevelopment.
“The site’s gold. It’s right on the Schuylkill River, you have incredible infrastructure for rail and waterway freight, you have great highway access and plenty of natural resources,” he said. “So it could be industrial, retail, residential, office. The real estate possibilities are endless.”
The environmental issues are “not insurmountable,” Wolfington added. As an example, he pointed to the nearby Philadelphia Navy Yard, a formerly contaminated site covering about the same amount of land as the refinery. That site has been successfully redeveloped as a mixed-use business hub and now has about 170 tenants from different industries and institutions, occupying around 7.5 million square feet of new or refurbished space.
Contamination problem
Not everyone agrees on the site’s reuse possibilities.
Its contamination would make a mixed-use development implausible, said Kevin C. Gillen, a real estate economist and senior research fellow at Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation in Philadelphia. Instead, he said, its size and location make it more suitable as a logistics center.
“Cheap land, lots of it, access to plenty of infrastructure and a significant circumscribing of alternative uses all pretty much point in one direction,” he said in an email.
Any purchase agreement will have to be approved by a bankruptcy court in Delaware, where Philadelphia Energy Solutions filed for reorganization. In November, Judge Kevin Gross set an auction date of Jan. 17 for bids by 15 parties, most of them unidentified, that have expressed an interest in the company’s assets.
The company said in court documents that the sale of some or all of its assets would be the “best alternative” for all stakeholders, but it has also proposed a debt-for-equity swap as an option.
But the court, which has scheduled a bankruptcy confirmation hearing for Feb. 6 and 7, might decide that the sale of the site, rather than the business on it, would be the best way to pay creditors, said Bruce Grohsgal, a professor of bankruptcy law at Widener University’s Delaware Law School.
Although such a ruling is rare, “this might be an example of where that’s the case because the going concern of a refinery has been lost from the fire, and the real estate might very well be worth more than the enterprise,” he said.
Back to the start
One possible buyer that has announced its interest is Philadelphia Energy Industries, a new company set up by Philip Rinaldi, a former chief executive of Philadelphia Energy Solutions. Rinaldi retired in 2017 but wants to restart the refinery in cooperation with a partner that would also make renewable diesel and build solar cells on the site.
The city of Philadelphia has avoided taking sides, saying it has limited authority over the privately owned site. But in late November, it issued a 45-page report that concluded any future use should protect public health, be economically beneficial and establish “openness, transparency and trust” with residents.
The city is aiming to cut carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, and it would like to see renewable energy production on the site, said the city’s managing director, Brian Abernathy. But it is unlikely to be able to stop refining operations there despite calls by environmental and residents’ groups for it to do so.
Still, the bankruptcy suggests that any new refiner will have to make significant changes to run a viable business, Abernathy said.
“This was a difficult financial model to make work as an independent refiner,” he said. “Those economics would still be challenging even with a new buyer.”
Abernathy said a restarted refinery would have the best chance if it was bought by a larger company with the resources to add a fuel-blending capacity, which would enable it to avoid the heavy costs of buying credits to comply with federal renewable fuel rules.
Another option is a hybrid of refining and renewable fuel production, reflecting both market signals and policy goals, said Mark Alan Hughes, the faculty director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman School for Energy Policy and a member of the city’s advisory committee on the site.
“They’re predicting a steadily declining place for things like the refinery that was,” Hughes said, referring to lower projections for gasoline demand. “The kind of mix that tries to lower the profile of fossil fuel activity is, I think, the most likely outcome.”

Texto completo: David Trott, the Oakland County Republican who served two terms in Congress, blasted President Donald Trump in a letter to the editor of The Atlantic, saying Trump is unfit for office and should be removed.
"Trump is psychologically, morally, intellectually, and emotionally unfit for office," Trott wrote in the letter, which appeared in the print magazine but not online, calling Trump's actions in office "frightening."
He said Trump's "inability to follow normal decision-making protocols has created chaos in our foreign policy and put our country at risk."
"We can only hope Congress impeaches and removes him so we have a choice between two adults in 2020."
Trott made similar comments in a front page article of the New York Times on Sunday in which it became clear why he didn't seek a third two-year term in 2018 representing Michigan's 11th Congressional District.
Trott said that during a closed door meeting with fellow Republican lawmakers in the summer of 2017 he had expressed concerns about Trump's erratic behavior. The word quickly got back to the president and Trott decided not to seek re-election rather than face Trump's wrath.
Many Republican lawmakers feel Trump is unfit for office, Trott told the newspaper, but are fearful of saying so publicly.
Meshawn Maddock, chairwoman of the 11th Congressional District Republican Committee, was quoted in the Detroit News as calling Trott a "Democrat in disguise," She said Trott had abandoned his constituents, allowing a Democrat to win his old seat.

Trump backs reelection of Collins

Texto completo: In a tweet Monday, President Donald Trump wrote he agrees 100% that Collins is needed to ensure Republicans keep control of the U.S. Senate next year.
In tweet, president agrees ‘100%’ that Republicans need senior senator from Maine
When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine refused to vote for him.
Denouncing him for mocking the vulnerable and attacking “ethnic and religious minorities,” she wrote in House Speaker Paul Ryan instead, a choice that did not even register in the final results since the Wisconsin Republicans had not registered as any sort of candidate in Maine.
But it appears Trump, unusually for him, is not holding a grudge.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham issued a tweet recently hailing Collins, a four-term Republican, for showing “unbelievable courage” during the bitter confirmation fight last year surrounding U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh “and at other times when our country has needed a steady voice.”
“We need her to ensure a GOP majority in 2020,” Graham wrote, and urged his supporters to send money to Collins’ campaign.
Graham also linked to her recent reelection announcement.
On Monday evening, Trump retweeted Graham’s words and added a few of his own.
“I agree 100%!” Trump wrote.
It marks one of the few times Trump has directly praised Collins, who has proven a presidential ally on some key issues and a thorn in his side on others, especially in her 2017 vote to block repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
The day after her speech in favor of Kavanaugh in September 2018, Trump told reporters, “I thought that Susan was incredible yesterday.”
Collins has avoided saying anything about whether she will endorse Trump in 2020, focusing instead on what she perceives as the need to work with him on matters of national importance.
While she has not taken a stand on the presidential race next year — which is bound to have a major impact on her effort to win a fifth term — she also has not retracted any of the harsh comments she issued about Trump in a 2016 column in The Washington Post.
Collins has expressed distaste for Trump’s tweets on a number of occasions, occasionally denouncing some as over the line and sometimes simply wishing he would stop using the social media platform.
It is not clear whether Trump has ever referred to Collins so directly before on Twitter.
In 2018, he blasted a bipartisan immigration bill she cosponsored, claiming it would be “a total catastrophe” for the nation.
Generally, though, he has avoided mentioning her.
Trump has retweeted or touted U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, dozens of times. The president has also assailed Gail Collins, a New York Times columnist, more often than he has ever referred to Maine’s senior senator.
One of the Democrats hoping to unseat Collins in Maine’s election next year, Betsy Sweet of Hallowell, wrote Tuesday on Twitter that Trump and Graham want Collins to return to the Senate in 2021 “because they know she’ll take the side of Republican special interests, not the people of Maine.”

Texto completo: BEIJING - The Hong Kong government on Wednesday condemned Christmas Eve violence in the Asian financial hub, calling it "outrageous," after tear gas, pepper spray, a water cannon and other weapons were used to quash protests.
In the busy shopping and tourist districts of Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok, marches through malls in which protesters chanted slogans, sang parodies of carols and targeted Beijing-aligned businesses soon spilled onto the streets, owing to the heavy presence of undercover officers and anti-riot units.
Around 9:45 p.m. Tuesday, tear gas was fired on crowds blocking Salisbury Road outside the historic Peninsula Hotel, where riot police and tactical units were joined by a water cannon vehicle and two armored cars.
It was the first time this month that police resumed their use of tear gas to disperse protesters, after a period of calm followed last month's pro-democracy landslide win at District Council elections. A government spokesman said rioters damaged traffic lights, blocked roads, set fires and attacked police officers. He said the government "severely condemned" the "rioters' behavior," which led to the disruption of traffic around the city.
"These acts seriously disrupted social order, affected the festive mood and obstructed other people from enjoying the festive season, which are outrageous," the government spokesman said.
Before midnight, police swept along the waterfront Avenue of Stars, using pepper spray to disperse attendees from the site of their planned Christmas Day countdown. Instead, the holiday was rung in on the steps to Tsim Sha Tsui's bar strip, where minutes before police lobbed tear gas grenades at people who had gathered around an arrested protester.
Further north, tear gas and a water cannon were deployed against protesters in densely populated Mong Kok, where clashes continued into the early hours of Christmas.

Art Foundation Sued Over Mass Layoffs

Texto completo: The lawsuit asks to be certified as a class action and seeks back pay and other damages for former employees.
A dispute over the dismissal of dozens of workers from the Marciano Art Foundation widened on Monday as lawyers representing a former employee accused the organization of breaking a state law that requires notice before mass layoffs.
About 70 people working at the foundation, a private, nonprofit museum in Los Angeles, were laid off in November, days after taking steps to form a union. At the same time, the foundation, which was created by two brothers who co-founded the Guess clothing empire, told those employees in an email that it would close its current exhibition early, citing "low attendance the past few weeks."
Lawyers representing one of the laid-off workers, Kenneth Moffitt, filed a suit that they said was accepted Monday by the California Superior Court in Los Angeles. That complaint asserted that the foundation and the brothers, Paul and Maurice Marciano, had violated a law that requires certain employers to provide employees and government officials at least 60 days written notice before ordering a mass layoff, relocation or cessation of operations.
The suit asked to be certified as a class action and for the former employees to be awarded damages of at least 60 days back pay and the value of lost benefits. It also asked for an injunction forbidding the defendants from engaging in unlawful practices.
"The law is the surest way we have to hold the Marcianos accountable," Mr. Moffitt said by telephone.
Richard Rosenberg, a lawyer who was listed on the National Labor Relations Board website as representing the foundation in a matter involving that agency, said by email that the foundation and its owners knew of Mr. Moffitt's filing.
"They are aware of the new lawsuit and believe that there is no merit whatsoever to the underlying California WARN Act claim," Mr. Rosenberg wrote, referring to the law requiring notice before certain layoffs. He added: "They will respond to the claim appropriately when the time comes."
The foundation, which has said it had a collection of more than 1,500 works by artists including David Hammons, Cindy Sherman and Damien Hirst, opened in 2017 in a 90,000-square-foot former Masonic Temple on Wilshire Boulevard.
The unionization attempt was seen as part of a recent wave of similar efforts at institutions including the New Museum and the Guggenheim in New York, and the Frye Art Museum in Seattle.
After the dismissals in November, union organizers said the layoffs were retaliatory and asked the National Labor Relations Board to order the reinstatement of the former employees.
In December, the foundation announced that it was permanently closed, adding that its "only goal was to give back to Greater Los Angeles by fostering an appreciation of the arts accessible to everyone and free to the public." Around the same time, its website was shut down.
The Marciano brothers have been listed in numerous tax filings as the foundation's sole directors. Daniel B. Rojas, one of the lawyers filing the suit on behalf of Mr. Moffitt, said that it appeared likely that the brothers had made the decision to dismiss the employees.

6 books whose writers seemed to predict our reality

Texto completo: 'Blade Runner,' the movie based on Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,' takes place in a futuristic November 2019. In reality, replicants and floating cars have failed to materialize. Compare that to Margaret Atwood's 'The Handmaid's Tale,' which, when it was published in 1985, was deemed 'powerless to scare,' according to one New York Times critic. At the time, the idea of global pandemonium seemed dubious, even in fiction. Live Aid had united billions, NASA was eyeing Mars and, on-screen, John Hughes freed teenagers from their trappings. The gloom of the Cold War seemed to be lifting. And yet, almost 35 years later, here we are in a dystopian patriarchy.
Clairvoyance is a hit-and-miss aftereffect of writing stories. Arthur C. Clarke would be heartbroken to know that the closest we've come to space tourism is Elon Musk, but Mary Shelley might rejoice in the news that, 136 years after 'Frankenstein,' doctors would perform the first successful kidney transplant.
It's not often a writer can throw a dart into the future and hit treble 20. Here are six who did. (Caution: spoilers.)

The Victorian mystery that predicted trolling 'The Invisible Man,' by H.G. Wells

Weapons experts could argue that Wells's 'War of the Worlds' was his most prescient book, imagining hordes of Martians armed with chemical weapons and invasive plant life. But that book's predecessor, 1897's 'The Invisible Man,' truly glimpsed the future. Albino optics student Griffin has perfected a drug that renders him transparent, and he uses it to commit incognito attacks on those around him: burglary, arson, kidnapping. Uncomfortably human, Griffin is a raging voice doomed to feel ignored. His spirit lives on in every expletive posted under local news stories on social media.
An Alexa precursor's battle cry 'Murmur,' by Tim Earnshaw

Earnshaw's underrated L.A. trilogy is some of the most enjoyable science fiction ever published. In each installment, the protagonist overhears the theme tune from 'Bewitched' and then succumbs to a bizarre phenomenon. The hero of 1999's 'Murmur' is Pacific Coast creative Ken Leverton, who begins to hear objects talking to each other: ATMs, forks and data cables all babble away, while his old suitcase recounts a holiday he'd forgotten. Then the products turn nasty, reveling in their disdain for humans, or 'dumb muds' as they call us. Is this what we should expect when Alexa gets sick of repeatedly playing 'Mr. Brightside'?

The aliens with a head start on climate change 'The Kraken Wakes,' by John Wyndham

Master of the cozy catastrophe, Wyndham unknowingly stepped into the 21st century when he penned 'The Kraken Wakes' in 1953. Aliens abandon their home planet and relocate to the Mariana Trench, where they begin harvesting cruise ships. When man retaliates with nukes, the invaders begin to blowtorch the polar ice caps. Our heroes, Mike and Phyllis Watson, watch in disbelief as sea levels slowly rise, forcing their retreat to Cornwall (now an island), and causing the British government to flee to Harrogate.

Super-fast forays into dial-up 'Snow Crash,' by Neal Stephenson

When Stephenson unleashed 'Snow Crash' in 1992, the term 'surfing the Internet' had only just been coined. Certainly, the idea of MMOs (massively multiplayer online games) seemed niche. But that's what Fortnite is today, and that's what this book's Metaverse is, with its billions of users so dependent on computers that they've started to succumb to the machines' viruses. Although not as prophetic as E.M. Forster's 'The Machine Stops' " which, in 1909, may have planted the seed for FaceTime with a mother chatting with a projected image of her faraway son " 'Snow Crash' scores extra points for its uncanny vision of private armies and refugees herded onto city-sized rafts.

Carving up the U.K. 11 years before Brexit 'Divided Kingdom,' by Rupert Thomson

In 2005, Britain is 'a troubled place, obsessed with acquisition and celebrity.' So the government decides to preemptively 'quarter' the country based on temperament in this nightmare tale. Long before Brexit made the country's constitutional voting map look like Mr. Burns from 'The Simpsons,' 'Divided Kingdom' split Britain into four colors, each matching one of the vital humors, including green for melancholic, yellow for choleric and blue for phlegmatic. Our hero, Thomas Parry, has been designated sanguine/red blood, but one night finds his chance to jump the border. If this vision of Britain wasn't isolationist enough, Thomson's first book, 'Dreams of Leaving,' depicts an English village that no one is allowed to leave.

Making America great, Part 1 'It Can't Happen Here,' by Sinclair Lewis

This newspaper has already detailed how Trumpism was cloned from Lewis's dystopian satire. But frankly, the similarities between Berzelius 'Buzz' Windrip, the populist president, and today's Republican administration are so strong that they're worth underlining. A leader who brands himself champion of the 'Forgotten Men'? Check. Swipes at 'highbrow intellectualism'? Deposed allies? Broken electoral promises? It seems it was all there in 1935, right down to the Canadian visa frenzy. 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' might be the most lasting political book ever written, but 'It Can't Happen Here' predicted 2016 and beyond with such aplomb that it should be filed under astrology.

Texto completo: Headnote Commentary
(NNPA)-December 18-Today the House of Representatives will vote on whether to impeach President Trump. If it votes yes, sometime early in the new year I will take an oath on the Senate floor to uphold the Constitution, review evidence and follow the facts wherever they lead, regardless of party or ideology. Every one of my colleagues will be required to do the same.
As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of holding powerful people accountable. I know that every trial requires fairness and truth. Having worked my whole life serving the people, I know that any trial that abandons the pursuit of truth cannot be considered fair or just.
But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, appears more interested in covering up the president's misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness. He is already trying to limit the impeachment trial by preventing witnesses from testifying, and he has all but announced a verdict. In doing so, he showed the American people that he has no intention of honoring his oath.
Let's be clear: Mr. McConnell doesn't want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up.
Fortunately, Mr. McConnell does not have the power to unilaterally undermine this trial. Every single senator will be empowered with an equal vote on how the trial will proceed. Though in just the past year, Mr. McConnell has used his position to unilaterally block legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act, lower the prices of prescription drugs and address the gun violence epidemic, he cannot wield the same authority in a Senate impeachment trial.
In this trial, senators will be far more than jurors. Every one of us will vote to determine the rules for the trial, decide which witnesses testify and ultimately serve as both court and jury. Each of us will be called on to uphold our oath with every decision we make. We will all be held accountable by the American people if we refuse to discover the facts relevant to the articles of impeachment.
The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, has made a reasonable request to hear from four additional witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the president's misconduct and to review documents that shed light on why the administration initially decided to cut off military aid to Ukraine.
We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who admitted to Mr. Trump's bribery scheme on live television, and from the former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has been shopping stories about Mr. Trump to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress. Every senator should want to hear from anyone who can speak directly to the president's misconduct related to the articles of impeachment.
Even Richard Nixon allowed the key figures behind the Watergate scandal to speak to Congress, and he eventually turned over incriminating portions of his Oval Office recordings to investigators. But Mr. Trump has stonewalled Congress and inhibited our ability to seek justice by demanding that those closest to the center of the Ukraine scandal stay silent.
Senators must be allowed to subpoena relevant witnesses and submit questions to them directly. The Senate should not vote on any article of impeachment or consider a motion to dismiss the trial until we have reviewed the additional testimony and evidence that Mr. Schumer has requested.
I have never been in a courtroom where the accused can unilaterally block witnesses from testifying or prohibit prosecutors from asking witnesses questions. No court would allow a trial to proceed this way, and neither should any member of the Senate.
Ensuring the integrity of this trial is a solemn responsibility for every senator, with consequences that extend far beyond any one presidency. My colleagues and I have a duty to use our voice and our vote to insist on a fair trial, rooted in the pursuit of truth. We must demonstrate to the American people that in our system of justice all are equal under law, and that there are not two sets of rules, one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else. We must conduct the Senate impeachment trial in a way that is fair and that reflects impartial justice.
History will judge the actions taken by the United States Senate at a time when our Constitution and the rule of law were at stake. I'll be fighting for justice and accountability, and my colleagues should too.
(Kamala D. Harris is a Democratic senator from California.)

We need - and generally get - competence from bureaucrats

Resumen: Here’s some of what it takes: * You need a legislative draftsman, someone who understands the specialized language of bill-writing and how to translate ideas into law; * You’ll almost certainly need several lawyers involved to steer clear of legal shoals, as well as budget experts who can handle cost estimates and projections; * It’s helpful to have someone who understands what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior in the field you’re addressing; * There are a lot of subject matters that play a role in almost any major problem: environmental, financial, security and military, logistics, health, education, international dimensions — and you’ll want to be able to consult with experts in all of them; * Because, almost invariably, you’re dealing with computer systems or actual machinery, it’s helpful to have the appropriate types of engineers on hand; * It’s often helpful to work with a historian or two who can put the problem in context; * You need people who are familiar with the private sector and understand what businesses and corporations can and cannot reasonably achieve, since so many issues today involve both the public and private sectors; * You have to be able to understand and cover the politics of your approach, meaning you need people who can bridge the White House and Congress or the governor’s office and the legislature; * Somewhere along the line you’ll need PR experts who understand radio, print, TV, and social media, since you’ll have to enlist the public, or at least win its support; * And, of course, you’ll need to figure out how to raise the money you’ll need, both through the public purse and from the private and nonprofit worlds. By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ...

Texto completo: Not long ago, I was in a meeting to talk about a public policy issue. It was a little complex, and as we considered the various angles I began to think about what it would take to translate talk into change on the ground. I wasn’t analyzing the politics of it — I was focused on the types of people who’d have to roll up their sleeves.
What I came away with was a list of skills, none of them unusual, but all of them vital to getting things done in the increasingly complicated world that government faces. Here’s some of what it takes: * You need a legislative draftsman, someone who understands the specialized language of bill-writing and how to translate ideas into law; * You’ll almost certainly need several lawyers involved to steer clear of legal shoals, as well as budget experts who can handle cost estimates and projections; * It’s helpful to have someone who understands what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior in the field you’re addressing; * There are a lot of subject matters that play a role in almost any major problem: environmental, financial, security and military, logistics, health, education, international dimensions — and you’ll want to be able to consult with experts in all of them; * Because, almost invariably, you’re dealing with computer systems or actual machinery, it’s helpful to have the appropriate types of engineers on hand; * It’s often helpful to work with a historian or two who can put the problem in context; * You need people who are familiar with the private sector and understand what businesses and corporations can and cannot reasonably achieve, since so many issues today involve both the public and private sectors; * You have to be able to understand and cover the politics of your approach, meaning you need people who can bridge the White House and Congress or the governor’s office and the legislature; * Somewhere along the line you’ll need PR experts who understand radio, print, TV, and social media, since you’ll have to enlist the public, or at least win its support; * And, of course, you’ll need to figure out how to raise the money you’ll need, both through the public purse and from the private and nonprofit worlds.
My point is simple: To make our system and this country work, we need a lot of experts and competent bureaucrats to deal with the problems that come cascading down on government. And here’s what I can tell you, after decades of close contact with federal civil servants: We have them. By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ... We’re blessed with a lot of talented people.
Which is why I’ve never shared the contempt and outright hostility toward federal bureaucrats that is so often expressed in the public arena these days. They deal with very tough problems and they’re usually good at what they do. They just don’t toot their own horns about it.
This was on full display in the recent House Intelligence Committee hearings on impeachment. As New York Times columnist David Brooks put it recently, "[T]he civil servant witnesses answering questions inspired a lot more confidence than the elected officials who were asking them." He went on to quote political scientist Hugh Heclo, "It is when you deal with someone who does not perform in a ‘professional’ manner that you learn to appreciate those who do."
This doesn’t mean that there aren’t some bad apples within the bureaucracy. There always are, but they’re rare. And most of the time, inspectors general, administrative processes, and, when it’s working, congressional oversight address the problems reasonably well. Attacking cabinet officials and civil service employees publicly, the way President Trump seems to enjoy doing, seems counterproductive. These are, after all, the very people he has to depend on to move his programs forward.
In the face of the many challenges we confront, the professionalism, talent, and competence of our civil servants matter. We’ve been fortunate: many of them have withstood attacks on themselves and the systems they depend on for support. So far.

Texto completo: The Neediest Cases Fund has told the stories of the less fortunate since 1912. Elisha Brown and Sara Aridi, the lead writers this year, reflected on their work.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
On Christmas Day in 1911, Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times, met a man on the street without a place to sleep. Mr. Ochs gave the man his business card and several dollars. "If you're looking for a job," Mr. Ochs said, "come see me tomorrow."
The experience inspired the publisher to think about the less fortunate. The following year Mr. Ochs sent a reporter to New York City's private welfare agencies to tell the stories of people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Times published profiles of these people in the newspaper. In response, readers started sending donations to what would come to be known as The Neediest Cases Fund.
The campaign has raised over $ 300 million since it began. The New York Times Company pays the administrative fees, and all of the money goes to those in need.
Every year since 1912, The Times has profiled people who were aided by donations to the campaign. This year, the reporters Elisha Brown and Sara Aridi were tapped to tell these stories. They reflected on their experiences and what they hope readers will take away. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.
What was the reporting process like?
ELISHA BROWN We worked with seven organizations this year. The subjects of the articles have gotten aid through The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which raises money and donates it to aid organizations. People are given items like new winter clothes for their children or money to help cover expenses like medical bills. There was one person who needed MetroCards to get to college.
SARA ARIDI Usually, we would be assigned articles, then we coordinate with the agency. They ensure that people are comfortable and willing to answer some questions that might be a little sensitive or a little tough to answer. The reporting took me up to the Bronx a few times, it took me down to Brownsville a bunch of times, out to East New York, down to Bensonhurst and into Queens.
Who were some of the people that you profiled?
BROWN I enjoyed writing about one young woman, Evelyn Marin. She had been married to her husband for only a few months when he committed suicide. Then she received a pancreatic cancer diagnosis. She had to have other surgeries but she overcame that in the past year, and now she is cleared to work again. To see someone keep going and get back on her feet is pretty inspiring.
ARIDI There was a high school senior I interviewed named Destinee Gonzalez Gil. I think her story really resonated with readers. When she was 6, she had a younger brother who died of a rare genetic disorder, and that really affected her. She developed a learning disability. Her parents were consumed with caring for her brother, so they weren't necessarily always able to give her 100 percent of their attention. Later on, her parents had two more sons, and they both developed the same complications. Now, both of her brothers are bedridden. They are tied up to machines. They can't really communicate.
The family welcomed me into their home. Destinee has been worrying about college, worrying about her SATs, but she's also been one of the main caregivers for her brothers. Like Elisha said, to see young people who have gone through so much already, and to continue to be strong, and to focus on their own goals, and their own ambition, is just really, really inspiring.
What were you thinking about as you profiled the subjects?
BROWN I think what's really important, throughout the interviews and reporting process, is to establish who the people are, and their goals and accomplishments, beyond the fact that they received assistance. Some of the stories are just hardship after hardship. But we also want to talk about the subjects' aspirations in life and the things they're really passionate about.

Commentary: Christianity Today’s call for Trump’s ouster roils the evangelical waters

Texto completo: The timing of Christianity Today's editorial calling for President Donald Trump’s ouster couldn’t have been better. With impeachment voted and Congress gone for the holidays, it dropped into a beautiful D.C. news vacuum.
Boom!
Front pages of The Washington Post and The New York Times. Interviews on CNN. Commentary everywhere. And why not? Trump's support among white evangelicals has been the biggest religion story of his presidency, so his rejection by their flagship publication had to be news.
As usual, Trump helped the coverage along by flying to his own defense. "The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!” tweeted the most transactional of politicians.
Over the signature of outgoing editor Mark Galli, the editorial carefully took that into consideration. Yes, Trump had earned evangelical backing by his Supreme Court appointments and his "defense of religious liberty." However: "None of the president’s positives can balance the moral and political danger we face under a leader of such grossly immoral character."
Citing founder Billy Graham's original injunction that the magazine make its opinions known "with both conviction and love," Galli quoted at length from its condemnation of President Bill Clinton at the time of his impeachment 21 years ago. "The President's failure to tell the truth — even when cornered — rips at the fabric of the nation."
Bottom line: "Unsavory dealings and immoral acts by the President and those close to him have rendered this administration morally unable to lead."
Concluded Galli:
"Unfortunately, the words that we applied to Mr. Clinton 20 years ago apply almost perfectly to our current president. Whether Mr. Trump should be removed from office by the Senate or by popular vote next election — that is a matter of prudential judgment. That he should be removed, we believe, is not a matter of partisan loyalties but loyalty to the Creator of the Ten Commandments.
Unsurprisingly, Trump's court evangelicals weren't buying."
"Less than 20% of evangelicals supported @HillaryClinton in 2016 but now @CTmagazine has removed any doubt that they are part of the same 17% or so of liberal evangelicals who have preached social gospel for decades!" tweeted Jerry Falwell Jr. "CT unmasked!"
"The magazine Billy Graham helped to start over 60 years ago in no way resembles its founders’ vision," tweeted Jack (no relation) Graham, pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas. "It is increasingly liberal and out of step and out of touch with conservative Christians and churches."
Billy's son Franklin, whose strident partisanship has done much to undermine his father's legacy of pastoral inclusiveness, weighed in heavily. "Yes, @BillyGraham founded Christianity Today; but no, he would not agree w/ their piece," he wrote in one tweet. "He’d be disappointed." Then, in a follow-up, he revealed:
"I hadn’t shared who my father @BillyGraham voted for in 2016, but because of CTMagazine’s article, I felt it necessary to share now. My father knew @realDonaldTrump, believed in him & voted for him. He believed Donald J. Trump was the man for this hour in history for our nation.”
But the next generation of Grahams pushed back.
Tweeted Billy's grandson Boz Tchividjian (who, it should be mentioned, teaches law at Falwell’s Liberty University), "A heavy hearted bravo to CT! Well said on so many levels. I believe my grandfather would have had a similar perspective. Thank you."
Boz's brother Aram laid on the sarcasm: "I’ll never forget that day in 2016 when my grandfather, @billygraham, shrugged off the symptoms of Parkinson’s and hydrocephalus, got up out of bed for the first time in a year, drove down to the polling station, and cast his vote. What a glorious memory!"
"What strikes me as most significant in the long run, is that everyone is invoking Billy Graham," said Grant Wacker, the retired Duke Divinity School professor whose second book on the foremost Protestant of his age, One Soul at a Time: The Billy Graham Story, came out in September. "CT does it twice: This is what our founder would want us to do."
Leaving aside the vexed questions surrounding Billy Graham's exercise of his franchise the day after his 98th birthday, it's important to recognize that CT's long-standing focus on the moral character of presidents was the touchstone of approval for Graham himself. As late as January 1974, Wacker notes, the evangelist was defending Richard Nixon on the grounds that "a man of such high moral character" could not have been involved in Watergate.
It was only after reading the transcripts of the White House tapes in April of that year that Graham, saying he "nearly vomited," broke with the president.
And CT followed. In July 1974, a month before Nixon resigned in the face of certain impeachment in the House and likely conviction in the Senate, the magazine declared, "The transcripts show him to be a person who has failed gravely to live up to the moral demands of our Judeo-Christian heritage. We do not expect perfection, but we rightly expect our leaders, and especially our President, to practice a higher level of morality than the tapes reveal."
Such personal moralism has been evangelicalism's distinctive contribution to American public life. That so many evangelicals have been prepared to sell it for a mess of Trumpian pottage is a loss for all of us.
In the present case, the obvious rejoinder from Trump's evangelical apologists is to concede his moral flaws but insist these don't outweigh the good they think he's done. Like so many Republicans in Congress, however, they have clearly concluded that if you are not 100 percent with Trump, at least in public, you are against him.
Meanwhile, we can wonder whether the CT editorial will move the needle of Trump's evangelical support down.
"Christianity Today is a dying magazine," Robert Jeffress of Dallas' First Baptist Church told Fox's Lou Dobbs. "It has very little influence in the evangelical world."
By contrast, Wacker points out that while its hard-copy circulation may be only 90,000, the online magazine counts 5 million discrete monthly visits.
"CT has a great influence," he said. "A lot of other evangelicals intensely resent the power of CT. (The editorial) does push the needle. It pushes it a lot."
"It's courageous," Boz and Aram's sister Jerushah told CNN's Erin Burnett. "My grandfather always said that courage is contagious. My hope is that an article like this will be the first step for people to actually stand up and start saying, 'You know what? I'm actually not comfortable.'"
On Sunday, in a backhanded acknowledgment of CT’s influence, nearly 200 of Trump’s “evangelical faith leaders” sent a letter to publisher Tim Dalrymple protesting the editorial for disrespecting them and their followers.

Texto completo: Sin sorpresa para muchos, Nueva York ha sido calificada de lejos como la ciudad con la gente menos amable en todo el país , según una nuevo sondeo realizado por Business Insider.
34.3% de los encuestados dijeron que los neoyorquinos eran los más rudos del país, casi el doble que el segundo clasificado, Los Ángeles (19.7%).
Los resultados se basaron en dos encuestas en línea realizadas en octubre y noviembre de 2019. A más de 2 mil adultos estadounidenses se les pidió elegir las cinco ciudades menos amables de una lista de las 50 áreas metropolitanas más grandes de la nación.
La noticia no es una sorpresa para muchos. En 2011 el historiador de la ciudad de Manhattan, Michael Miscione, dijo a The New York Times que los neoyorquinos han sido considerados groseros desde finales del siglo XVIII.
“No he visto a un verdadero caballero, un hombre bien educado, desde que vine a la ciudad”, dijo el ex presidente John Adams sobre NYC en 1774: “En sus entretenimientos no hay conversación que sea agradable; no hay modestia, no hay atención el uno al otro. Hablan muy alto, muy rápido y en conjunto . Si le hacen una pregunta, antes de que pueda pronunciar tres palabras de su respuesta, se lanzarán sobre usted nuevamente y hablarán”.
Nueva York es además la ciudad más cara del país y la que recibe más turistas.
Detrás de NYC y Los Ángeles, las siguientes ciudades más rudas fueron Washington D.C. (18.9%), Chicago (18.6%) y Boston (14.9%).

Texto completo: In September 1897, a letter arrived in the newsroom of The Sun, one of New York's great newspapers of the day. The author was a child whose "little friends" had been questioning something close to her heart: Santa Claus.
Virginia O'Hanlon's earnest letter came across the desk of Francis P. Church, a Columbia College grad and long-time Sun writer who produced on deadline a short reply that became one of the most read, and best remembered, editorials ever written.
What Church did in less than 500 words was give Virginia — and indeed all of us — a reason to believe. As the former editorial page editor of The New York Times, Howell Raines, once observed, "What this child is doing is knocking on the door of the adult world and asking to be let in. And what this editor is doing is protecting her — and his adult readers."
Virginia went on to marry, have a family and become a school teacher and principal; she worked 43 years in the New York City school system. She died in 1971 at age 81.

"Is there a Santa Claus?" is reprinted from the Sept. 21, 1897, edition of The Sun of New York City.
We take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently the communication below, expressing at the same time our great gratification that its faithful author is numbered among the friends of The Sun:
Dear Editor, I am 8 years old. Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus. Papa says, "If you see it in The Sun, it's so." Please tell me the truth: Is there a Santa Claus?
Virginia O'Hanlon
115 W. 95th St.
Virginia, your little friends are wrong.
They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except (what) they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men's or children's, are little. In this great universe of ours, man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus. It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.
Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that's no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.
You may tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.
No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives, and he lives forever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.

Alternative to Student Loans Gains Support. There's a Downside.

Texto completo: Income-share agreements, promoted by Betsy DeVos and Silicon Valley, may wind up merely shifting the payment burden from some students to others.
Q: When is a student loan not a student loan?
A: When it's an "income-share agreement," a new financial instrument being promoted by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.
With total outstanding student loan balances at $ 1.6 trillion and rising, politicians are looking for solutions. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have proposed forgiving much or all existing debt while making public colleges and universities tuition-free. President Trump is said to be searching for his own loan plan.
This month at a national conference of college financial aid administrators, the Department of Education proposed an alternative: income-share agreements, a private-sector financial product that is increasingly popular among education start-ups in Silicon Valley.
The vast majority of regular student loans are issued by the federal government. After graduating, students are obligated to pay back the principal and accruing interest. If they don't, their wages can be garnished, credit damaged, and loans turned over to a collection agency.
Loan repayment is a huge and growing problem. One study projects that nearly 40 percent of students who borrowed in the mid-2000s will eventually default.
Income-share agreements look a lot like loans, at first. In both cases, a bank gives students a certain amount of money to pay tuition, fees and other college expenses. Like a loan, it is a legally binding contract that obligates students to make monthly payments until their obligation is fulfilled.
The difference is in the repayment. Loan payments are typically driven by principal and interest. Income-share agreements payments are driven by income and time. Students agree to pay a certain percentage of their earnings for a fixed period. If they make more, they pay more. If they make less, they pay less. Students with high earnings could end up paying back the equivalent of a loan with a high interest rate. Students with meager earnings could pay back less than the original principal.
In that sense, an income-share agreement is like a loan with a built-in insurance policy. Students forgo some of the potential upside of making a lot of money after graduation in order to eliminate some of the downside of making little or no money instead. Regular federal student loans have a similar provision, allowing students to limit their payments to a percentage of their income.
Income-share agreements are often used by "coding boot camps," private-sector companies ineligible for federal student loans. Boot camps offer short-term training in high-demand skills like software engineering and data science. At Flatiron School, for example, students can opt to pay 10 percent of their gross income for 48 months after graduating, through such an agreement. If their annualized income falls below $ 40,000 in a given month, they owe zero -- but that won't count as one of the 48 months. The most they can pay, in total, is 150 percent of Flatiron's upfront tuition fees.
Traditional colleges and universities are also experimenting with this financing, most prominently Purdue. The Purdue program adjusts the payment terms depending on students' academic majors, because some fields are more lucrative than others. A computer science major who graduates next spring with a $ 10,000 income-share agreement would owe 2.32 percent of income for 88 months, around seven years. A philosophy major would owe 4.01 percent for 116 months, or nearly 10 years. Philosophy majors pay a higher percentage for longer because their expected income is less.
Proponents note that colleges have a financial stake in the success of students whose education is funded this way, something that is not the case with regular student loans. With very few exceptions, it doesn't matter how many of a given college's graduates default on traditional loans. Colleges are paid up front. With income-share agreements, colleges make less if their graduates make less and more if they make more.
Legislation has been introduced in Congress that would solidify the legal standing of the agreements and set limits on their terms. At the financial aid convention this month, Department of Education officials announced an experimental initiative that, if expanded, could eventually increase their use by orders of magnitude. The program would give students the option of converting their regular student loans into income-share agreements. Colleges would pay the federal government back and effectively become the bank, taking on the upside and downside risk.
With these agreements growing in popularity and political support, potentially affecting millions of college students, it's worth asking what could go wrong.
Many of the current ones have terms that appear to be reasonable, or at least comparable to private education loans. But the first version of a new financial product can be very different from the 10th or 100th -- especially when the goal is to put your best foot forward to get federal approval and federal funds.
The model legislation, sponsored by the Republican senators Todd Young and Marco Rubio and the Democratic senators Mark Warner and Chris Coons, would allow banks and colleges to set terms that are vastly more onerous than what Flatiron, Purdue and others are offering today. Payments of 7.5 percent of income could last for as long as 30 years, and months where people don't earn enough to owe money wouldn't count as a payment, even though banks could still charge a separate fee. This could effectively extend an income-share agreement for someone's entire working life. Payments as high as 20 percent could last longer than a decade.
Repayment is also more complicated than with a regular student loan, because students have to regularly provide tax returns, payroll stubs or other evidence of how much money they earn. Failure to provide that information in a way that meets the exact terms of the agreement could throw the contract into default, converting it into a debt subject to collections, garnishment and all the rest. In other words, all of the problems the new loan products are supposed to avoid. Of course, the consumer protection provisions of existing student loan programs have troubles of their own.
Purdue markets its income-share agreements as an alternative to private and parent-backed loans. That suggests that students using them will have already taken out the maximum available federal loans, which means they will have to pay a percentage of their income in addition to monthly payments on their regular debts. Although Purdue makes a point of asserting that its income-share agreement is "not a loan or other debt instrument," the practical effect is to remove the ceiling on colleges' ability to be paid by financial products that walk, talk and quack like students loans. The distinction between "debt" and "money you are obligated by force of law to pay" may have some legal meaning, but will most likely be lost on naïve students who have never borrowed money in their lives.
While Purdue advertises it as a "potentially less expensive option" for college financing, the university does not plan to lose money on the program, which means that, by definition, it will not be less expensive for the average student. The private-sector providers also plan to turn a profit, which means students will pay more, on average, than they would have paid upfront.
Giving colleges an incentive to enroll students in programs that lead to high-paying jobs may result in more well-designed programs. But it also gives colleges a reason to see people who need more academic support -- or who don't prioritize becoming rich -- as "subprime children," as the author Malcolm Harris put it in a New York Times Op-Ed.
For some students, income-share agreements may prove as useful as a loan, and possibly less anxiety-producing. But these agreements bring no new money to the challenge of making college affordable. They only shift the payment burden from some students to others. That won't change the fact that nearly all students are paying more for college than ever before.

To the Editor:
Re "States Unequal in Preparation for the Census" (front page, Dec. 16):
The census is one issue that should be held above the blue state versus red state dynamic. Many cities and towns in the Midwest and the South have been transformed by immigrants. If they do not respond in significant numbers, the communities they live in will be shortchanged for federal dollars for infrastructure projects -- like bridge repairs, school construction and hospital renovations -- and support services like Medicaid and addiction prevention.
This hurts all of us, regardless of political affiliation or citizenship status.
Foundations and nonprofits in communities across the country have already been stepping forward to provide funding to help ensure that we have an accurate count. We also need to continue to push for our state and local government leaders to put more support behind these efforts.
Advocacy by foundations and nonprofits helped secure $ 40 million in funding here in New York City, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo kicked in an additional $ 20 million statewide. We must continue the fight to address the obvious needs we face in 2020.

Texto completo: He reported on Castro's rise and the Bay of Pigs invasion and, as an opinion writer, criticized, in retrospect, a Times reporter's Stalin-era dispatches.
Karl E. Meyer, a third-generation journalist who fortified his reporting as a foreign correspondent and editorial writer for The Washington Post and The New York Times with a scholar's grasp of historical context, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 91.
The cause was prostate cancer, his wife, Shareen Blair Brysac, said.
As one of the most adventurous reporters of his generation, Mr. Meyer covered Fidel Castro's revolution in Cuba, the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion there, the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia, the plundering of the world's cultural patrimony and much more.
As a columnist and editorialist with a doctorate in politics, he shaped and supported his opinions through firsthand reporting, defying what he once called the patron of his "unruly calling," St. Simeon Stylites, who pontificated for 30 years from atop a stone pillar (or column) in fifth-century Syria without abandoning his perch.
In 1962, Mr. Meyer, mining his sources for The Post, and Tad Szulc, a correspondent for The Times, jointly detailed the Bay of Pigs episode in the book "The Cuban Invasion: The Chronicle of a Disaster."
Mr. Szulc had broken the news early in 1961 that a rebel army was being covertly trained to topple Castro. The publisher of The Times agreed, in the interests of national security, not to report that the invasion was imminent and that the plot was being financed and directed by the Central Intelligence Agency.
President John F. Kennedy had been publicly furious about disclosures about the preparations for the raid. But he later confided to The Times's managing editor at the time, Turner Catledge, "If you had printed more about the operation, you would have saved us from a colossal mistake."
Mr. Meyer had also been among the first journalists to report on the failed coup.
It was not Mr. Meyer's first encounter with Castro; in the late 1950s he interrupted a vacation to arrange a secret rendezvous with him in Castro's mountain retreat. In a deliberately cryptic cable to Robert H. Estabrook, The Post's editorial page editor, from Santiago de Cuba, on the island's southeast coast, Mr. Meyer wrote: "Business good in our calling. Need more time to interview brothers. Unless I hear from you, I will be off."
When Mr. Meyer did not hear back, he took off by horseback. He returned to Santiago de Cuba to find a return telegram from his editor. "Take all the time you need," it said. He had already gathered enough information to produce a five-part series on Castro's revolutionary agenda.
In 1968, Mr. Meyer scored a hard-to-get visa to Czechoslovakia after lunching with Joseph Alsop, the influential Post columnist. Mr. Alsop, he recalled, referred him to a photograph showing the Czech leader Alexander Dubcek with Soviet leaders and observed: "Of course the Russians will invade. You can tell by their expressions. They want to eat him alive."
Mr. Meyer arrived in Prague in time to cover the invasion.
He later said his diplomatic coverage had been guided by the advice of Flora Lewis, whom he succeeded as The Post's London bureau chief when she became The Times's foreign affairs columnist. He quoted her as saying: "Remember, Karl, it's not the ambassadors you want to cultivate but the No. 2 person in the embassy. They have better information and can afford to be indiscreet."
In 1990, as an editorial writer for The Times, Mr. Meyer was assigned the delicate task of responding to a new biography by S.J. Taylor, "Stalin's Apologist," which elaborated on serious reporting lapses by Walter Duranty, the Moscow bureau chief of The Times in the 1920s and early '30s.
In a signed editorial, Mr. Meyer concluded that Mr. Duranty had been guilty of "some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper" -- including his indifference to the 1930-31 famine in which millions perished in Ukraine, a result of Stalin's policy of forced collectivization of farms. Mr. Duranty had dismissed the reports of famine as "mostly bunk."
"Having bet his reputation on Stalin, he strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes," Mr. Meyer wrote. "He saw what he wanted to see."
Mr. Duranty won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage. In 2003, despite continued controversy over the award, the Pulitzer board decided that it did not have enough grounds to revoke the prize.
Mr. Meyer's opinion bore more fruit in another case, when ancient monuments were about to be lost to flooding with the construction of the Aswan Dam in Egypt in the 1960s.
He proposed in an editorial that one of the major artifacts be preserved and presented as a gift to the United States, which was providing major financial support for the dam project. The Egyptians selected the gift: the Temple of Dendur. The first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, suggested the recipient: the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The reconstructed temple remains a showpiece of the museum.
Karl Ernest Meyer was born on May 22, 1928, in Madison, Wis., a grandson of Georg Meyer, the editor of Die Germania, a German-language newspaper in Milwaukee in the early 1900s. Karl's father, Ernest L. Meyer, was a columnist for The Capital Times in Madison and moved to New York in 1935 to write a column for The New York Post. His mother, Dorothy (Narefsky) Meyer, was a teacher.
After graduating from the Elisabeth Irwin School in Greenwich Village, Mr. Meyer earned a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Wisconsin in 1951. He received a master's degree in public affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University and a doctorate in politics from Princeton.
He was hired by The Times as a reporter in 1952 and left four years later for The Post, where he was an editorial writer for eight years, London bureau chief for five and New York bureau chief for two. He was the American correspondent for the British magazine New Statesman from 1961 to 1965.
A visit to Peru in 1959 sparked an enduring fascination with archaeology, leading to Mr. Meyer's book "The Plundered Past" (1973). It was serialized in The New Yorker and became the basis of a 1974 ABC television documentary, "The Culture Thieves," which helped inspire a cultural heritage restitution movement.
Mr. Meyer had been a contributing editor and television columnist for the magazine Saturday Review for four years when he joined the Times editorial board as a senior writer on foreign affairs in 1979. He retired in 1998.
He edited World Policy Journal, the flagship publication of the World Policy Institute, from 2000 to 2008. In an interview with The Times while in that post in 2002, he warned about "the emergence of a politically powerful Christian right."
"It worries me, as I worry about the rise of militant Islam or Hindu nationalism," he said. "These are all variations of the same problem. They seek a theological sanction for secular foreign policy choices."
After he retired from The Times, Mr. Meyer and his wife, Ms. Brysac, who is also a journalist, wrote the first of five books on which they collaborated, "Tournament of Shadows: The Race for Empire in Central Asia" (1999), inspired by their trip through the Khyber Pass.
His first two marriages, to Iris Hill and Sarah Peck, ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Brysac, whom he married in 1989, he is survived by three children from his second marriage, Ernest, Heather and Jonathan Meyer; three granddaughters; and his sister, Susan Meyer.
In 1990, Mr. Meyer edited an anthology, "Pundits, Poets and Wits: An Omnibus of American Newspaper Columns" (1990), in which he quoted an essayist's prediction in 1866 that with "the rise of neutral, fact-based reporting," editorials would soon be obsolete.
"The opposite happened," Mr. Meyer wrote. "Opinion journalism acquired fresh life, as readers, swamped by fact, turned to editorials for selection and judgment, salted by adjectives not sanctioned in news departments."
"They have been energetic advocates," he added, "exerting influence through the quality of their arguments and their independence from an electorate that has learned to put up with them."

Texto completo: Vanessa Friedman, the fashion director and chief fashion critic for The Times, discussed "Stare Shopping in the Face," a special section.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
December is a season of consumption, and in the last two decades shoppers have filled their closets with what's known as fast fashion: inexpensive clothing inspired by runway looks.
But in our haste to find the latest holiday sweaters and party dresses, the hands dyeing the yarns or sewing the hems on those dresses are often an afterthought.
On Sunday, in a special print section, "Stare Shopping in the Face," editors at The New York Times set out to examine the people involved in manufacturing and buying contemporary fashion.
Reporters looked at the low wages of garment workers; interviewed young women who covet inexpensive clothing; detailed efforts by the retailer H&M to become more transparent about its supply chain; and profiled a designer making "trashion:" new clothing from used fabrics.
Vanessa Friedman, the fashion director and chief fashion critic for The Times, discussed the special section and what she hoped readers would take away from it. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
What made this a topic you wanted to address right now?
We've been talking about sustainability and fashion for a very long time. Clearly, it's a topic that has become more pressing for people, whether they are consumers, or just people who like fashion, or people who are interested in the environment. This seemed like a good moment to pull the threads together and really look at it.
What changes have we seen in sustainable fashion over the last decade?
In 2009, Copenhagen held the first really recognized sustainable fashion conference. At that time, no one in the industry was thinking about this question at all.
In fashion, just in the last year, brands and consumers and designers have really woken up to the need to act more responsibly about their designs and their manufacturing costs. They have begun to talk about it in a way they never had before.
What surprised you most to come out of the reporting?
The role social media has played in all of this really surprised me. We know that lots of people sell stuff on Instagram, and it's very important to brands for marketing. But so many consumers are buying things because of what they see on Instagram. It was a real shock to understand how much the psychology of buying and the behavior of buying have changed.
What topics do you want to explore going forward?
I think we'll look a lot more at what is happening in fashion in terms of repurposing waste material or old garments -- what they call upcycling. I think that's all going to become an increasingly important part of the fashion cycle. There are companies that are doing that already, but I think it will happen more.
And also watching how companies try to take control of their own supply chain and to be transparent about it and let consumers and watchdogs in on that process. I think in the past there's been a real fear in fashion that if companies weren't perfect they would get attacked. Now, brands are willing to say, "We're not perfect, but we're trying, and here's what we're trying to do." Holding them to it is a really important part of this too.
What do you hope readers take away from this reporting?
I hope it makes them think, maybe before they make a purchasing decision, about the human effort and the human touch that have gone into making everything they own, even if it's a really cheap T-shirt. I hope that they think a little bit more about something they probably knew, but may not have fully embraced, which is that it is really hard to make clothes that can sell for very cheap prices and turn over very quickly in a way that is responsible. If it seems unbelievable and too good to be true, it probably is -- and consumers have the power to change that.

The 12 podcasts of 2019 you need to listen to

Texto completo: My favorite podcasts of 2019 were those that seemed at first about one thing — Dolly Parton, the reality TV show “Cops,” the mysterious death of New York City punk rocker nearly four decades ago — and carried you away on tangents you never saw coming.
Which, mind you, is not to say I lost all of my ardor for the tried-and-true-crime podcasts, such as “In The Dark,” my favorite of 2018, which just this week resulted in the release on bail of Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man tried six times who six times had his convictions overturned. There remain plenty of those, though I’ve perhaps become more discerning in my criminal tastes.
The list below presents the dozen podcasts that still resonate for me as the year comes to an end. They’re not in any particular order, so the numbers aren’t rankings, but the first two here are my favorites of the year.
1. Headlong: Running From Cops : Dan Taberski returned this year with his third great podcast in a row – “Surviving Y2K” and “Finding Richard Simmons” preceded this one – and this might be his best. A deep dive into the history of the reality TV series “Cops,” this podcast explores everything from the impact of the show on real-world policing to the way the series may interfere with the rights of the arrested in ways you’d never considered. Entertaining, and it makes you think.
2. The Ballad of Billy Balls : This podcast opens like a typical true-crimer – who killed punk rocker and small-time drug dealer Billy Balls in his East Village apartment in 1982 – but under the empathetic storytelling of host iO Tillett Wright it becomes something much more that incorporates love and grief, family and memory. Billy’s girlfriend Rebecca is an amazing presence throughout the podcast, which reveals one secret after another as Wright seeks the truth of the story.
3. 1619 : This podcast from the New York Times came on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves in America. No dry history lesson, the anthology-style five-episode podcast looks at ways in which the impact of slavery has rippled across four centuries of our history tot he present day. Topics range from the economy to land ownership to health care. If you’d like to get a sense of it, dip your ears into the episode by the Times’ Wesley Morris who explores the ways in which black American music seeded every genre we listen to today — including yacht rock.
4. Dolly Parton’s America : Host Jad Abumrad grew up in Tennessee where Dolly Parton is everywhere, and, like many, he took her a little bit for granted. Then Abumrad noticed how in these divided times everyone from MAGA hat-wearers to drag queens loves Dolly, and he started to investigate. He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

Liberals are piling on J.K. Rowling because they aren't used to disagreeing with artists they like

Texto completo: J.K. Rowling caused quite a stir last week by tweeting out a defense of a British researcher who was fired for having the wrong opinion on transgenderism.
My colleague Madeline Fry wrote about the substance of the controversy, but one thing that has struck me about the tone of the criticism has been the sheer level of sorrow from liberals that an author they liked could take a position they found so problematic. The New York Times ran an op-ed headlined, "‘Harry Potter’ Helped Me Come Out as Trans, But J.K. Rowling Disappointed Me.'" An author at Vox declared that Rowling had "ruined Harry Potter."
As conservatives, we're used to disagreeing politically with artists and entertainers who we like. Sure, we may take potshots at Hollywood celebrities or authors, but those of us who consume art, literature, or popular entertainment more or less expect that the producers of such media are going to have political views that we find noxious. It's not as if conservatives just sit around reading C.S. Lewis over and over and watching Clint Eastwood movies. And we aren't shocked if some author, actor, or musician says something we find objectionable. It's our expectation that they will.
But for liberals, there's a broad assumption that artists are going to be more or less on the same page as they are. So that's why it's especially jarring to them if an icon such as Rowling displays insufficient wokeness. And it's why the cultural Left is so quick to jump over any statement by any popular artist or entertainer that deviates from liberal orthodoxy.
In a way, it's similar to why liberals get so irrationally angry about Bari Weiss writing for the New York Times or at conservatives being given a platform at universities. They believe that they should have control over all such institutions.

Texto completo: Several presidential candidates spending their weekend in Iowa denounced the racist motivation behind an intentional hit-and-run that left a 14-year-old central Iowa girl injured earlier this month.
Natalia Miranda, 14, was struck by a hit-and-run driver in Clive on Dec. 9. The driver, Nicole Poole Franklin, 42, allegedly told police she targeted her victim because the girl "is Mexican."
Franklin has been charged with attempted murder in the hit-and-run case and faces theft, public intoxication and felony hate crime charges stemming from an incident at a gas station, where police arrested her, 15 minutes after the teen was hit.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she is hoping a central Iowa teenager who was intentionally hit by a driver earlier this month has a "speedy recovery.
"While campaigning in Iowa, the senator from Massachusetts wrote on Twitter she is "heartsick for this teenager and her family."
"Hateful, bigoted language has violent consequences, and we've seen that in the surge of hate crimes since 2016," Warren wrote in her tweet.
Hate crime reports increased 17% in 2017 from the year prior, according to the New York Times. It marked the third consecutive year hate crime reports had risen "as heated racial rhetoric and actions have come to dominate the news," the Times reported.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg referenced the case while campaigning in Indianola and Perry on Sunday. Buttigieg said there was "something very wrong in the heart" of Franklin.
"That problem will be waiting for the next American president. I am running to be the president who can respond to that crisis, that moral as well as political crisis," he said. "Pick up the pieces of a divided nation. Bring us together in the name of our common values and move us forward before it is too late."
In the midst of his four-day bus tour across Iowa, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey told reporters in Newton on Sunday that "Americans should reject that kind of hate crime."
"Whoever is the next president has to understand that the majority of our terrorist attacks in America since 9/11 have been right-wing, extremist attacks," he said, adding that the next president will have to address hate crimes from the Oval Office.
Register reporters Barbara Rodriguez and Austin Cannon contributed to this report.

We have two moon parties, but no sun to shine

Texto completo: Here's a theory for why our politics are so confusing these days: Neither party wants to be a majority party.
From an ideological perspective, majority parties are, by nature, weird. For instance, the long-dominant FDR coalition included a strange mix of blacks and segregationists, corrupt city machines and the reformers who hated them.
Over the several decades that followed, most major policy questions were hashed out within the Democratic Party. The Republicans factored in mostly as stalemate-breakers. So, for instance, the great intra-Democratic Party fight between liberals and Southern segregationists was only settled when Republicans sided with the civil rights bloc. Eighty percent of Republicans voted in favor of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, while fewer than 70 percent of Democrats did.
Samuel Lubell, a Polish-born political analyst, famously described this dynamic as the "sun and moon" system of political parties. In our "political solar system," Lubell wrote in 1951, "it is within the majority party that the issues of any particular period are fought out; while the minority party shines in reflected radiance of the heat thus generated."
The Democratic sun started its long arc of descent in 1968. In 1972, Richard Nixon managed to pick off sizable support from the white working class for a massive landslide re-election victory. Ronald Reagan's victories and the subsequent GOP capture of the House in 1994 -- after a 40-year Democratic reign -- seemed to seal the deal.
But then, as New York Times columnist David Brooks noted in 2011, "something strange happened. No party took the lead." The outcome, he wrote, is "both parties have become minority parties simultaneously. We are living in the era of two moons and no sun."
Nearly a decade later, things are even more bizarre. We may be more partisan than ever, but the partisans tend to dislike their own parties -- they just hate the other party more.
There are many reasons for this polarization, but one of them is that the most committed members of each party have a decidedly lunar mindset. Progressives and conservatives alike are convinced they are victims of the Powers That Be. One of the main arguments that propelled Trump to the White House and sustains his GOP support today is the feeling that the right has lost every important battle of the last 40 years.
The left is hooked on the same feeling. Each side defines the Powers That Be differently, though there is some overlap when it comes to animosity toward economic "elites" (hence Fox News host Tucker Carlson's populist assaults on the free market and praise for Elizabeth Warren's economic program). Hillary Clinton was the candidate of the establishment, and even though she won the Democratic nomination, nearly all the passion in the party flows to some version of Bernie Sanders' or Elizabeth Warren's radical indictment of the system.
As political consultant Luke Thompson notes, minority parties tend to obsess about unity because without it they are even more powerless. This makes ideological purity a vital source of cohesion. Majority parties have both the luxury and the burden of power. To govern is to make policy choices, and choosing A over B will always disappoint the backers of B.
Writing in 2017, Thompson argued that the GOP needed to come to grips with the fact that it was the majority party and behave accordingly, stringing together disparate and often disagreeable factions.
See Parties/page f3
The Democrats, by betting on the "ascendant coalition" of minorities, immigrants and the young to get Barack Obama elected, had not realized that this coalition was good at voting for Obama but unreliable for other Democrats.
The problem is that the ideological purity dominating both sides is a kind of righteous victimhood. The result is a Democratic Party suffused with a sense that it should be a majority party but is being denied its rightful status, making denunciations of "white supremacy" and the "oligarchy" simultaneously more intense and comforting. Voter suppression is a legitimate issue, but it is not the unified field theory for Democratic failures some want it to be -- nor can voter fraud be blamed for Republican failures. Meanwhile, the GOP could be a majority party, but the perceived need to be a Trump party prevents it from even trying. Not only are Trump's politics fueled by culture war resentment and victimology, but his bottomless need for adulation is simply an inadequate rationale for a sun party to hold a majority together.
Both parties are weakened by decades of misguided reforms and the growth of a media industrial complex invested in telling its customers what they want to hear, making it impossible for either moon to achieve the escape velocity required to become a sun party.
As political scientists Steven Teles and Robert Saldin argue, the best way out is for new moderate political factions to organize and demand concessions for their support. But that will require a lot of work, made all the more difficult by the burden of toiling in moonlight.

Utah’s latest ski destination: Woodward Park City

Texto completo: Woodward Park City, an action-sports destination and ski resort, has just opened in Park City. The 125-acre property includes indoor and outdoor facilities designed for year-round use, with camps and programs dedicated to skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding and more.
Woodward has been operating athletics-driven summer camps for 50 years; the first location was a gymnastics camp in rural Pennsylvania. Since then, the camps have evolved to focus on action sports like skateboarding and bicycle motocross along with programs dedicated to cheerleading and parkour. In 2011, Woodward was acquired by POWDR, a Park City-based company that operates ski resorts, produces adventure sports content and offers experiences like heli-skiing and white-water rafting. Woodward Park City is considered the company’s flagship location.
“This is the first time we’ve been able to dream everything from the ground up, on the hill and on-site,” said Tucker Norred, Woodward Park City’s senior marketing manager.
The property includes nine ski and snowboard terrain parks, more than 10 tubing lanes, three lift-serviced mountain bike trails, two outdoor skate parks, and a 66,000-square-foot indoor facility featuring a 10,000-square-foot concrete skatepark, trampolines, a spring floor, air bags and foam pits. There’s also a cafeteria and a third-floor cafe with a full bar that overlooks the indoor facilities below.
The idea, according to Norred, is to create something for everyone, from first-time skiers and snowboarders to those at Olympic training levels. All facilities are closely designed with skill development and progression in mind.
Skiers may already be familiar with Woodward — four POWDR resorts, including Boreal Mountain in California and Copper Mountain in Colorado, previously included Woodward features ranging from one-off “pop-up parks” to halfpipes. This winter, those resorts, plus two more (including Woodward Park City), will debut full “Woodward Mountain Park” experiences, which center on progression zones that start with beginner offerings, leveling up to expert terrain parks.
“It’s all about rethinking the terrain park experience,” said Megan Baroska, POWDR’s senior vice president of corporate strategy and communications. “The Woodward Mountain Park has an intuitive progression of zones that builds up and progresses as you develop skills.”
On the mountain, first-time skiers and riders will begin, fittingly, at the Start Park, where they will learn basic building blocks, like how it feels to lean forward in your boots to move. After developing more advanced skills, skiers and riders can try their hand at the Peace Park, a freestyle terrain park designed by the Olympic snowboarder Danny Davis, and at Red’s Backyard, a “rail garden,” inspired by the Colorado backyard of Olympic gold medalist Red Gerard. Rated like typical trail maps, the Mountain Park is meant to function intuitively as a self-guided experience with on-site coaches available to offer tips, or can also be explored with an instructor or through a camp program.
Killington Resort in Vermont started rolling out Woodward offerings in November, with plans for the full Mountain Park to be open by late December.
“We’re excited to be able to tap into Woodward’s focus on progression, and have already had a great response,” said Mike Solimano, president and general manager of Killington Resort. “It’s helping us bring a new type of experience on the mountain to all different kinds of skiers and riders.”
Woodward Park City’s summer offerings will include mountain biking, skateboarding and the full range of indoor and outdoor action sports facilities. Summer and winter camps will be available (winter camps are for ages 7 and up, and are three to five days long, $399 to $799), but Woodward Park City also allows for drop-in experiences — a lift ticket for skiing or mountain biking for the day, a daylong ski or snowboard lesson, or a two-hour tubing session. Also available are monthly memberships for unlimited access to the facilities.
While Woodward’s programming primarily targets children, Norred emphasized that Woodward Park City has offerings for all ages.
“You can take an adult-specific ski or board beginner lesson. We have yoga classes and ‘adult swim’ — adults-only time at the indoor skatepark,” he said. Or the parents could stay in the cafe: “Mom and Dad can hang out up there and watch the magic happen.”

Texto completo: There is mystery in this week's poem of lostness and ice: I don't know the full story behind where and how the poem's speaker finds himself having fallen asleep in a pew - and I don't need to. Myronn Hardy vividly conjures a moment and a mood, a sense of the untethered and the transitory that I can immerse in, understand and relate to without knowing the backstory. I love this poem's specificity, how its lines keep us in midair between stanzas, and that it leaves us with the ephemeral solidity of ice.
Myronn Hardy is the author of several books of poetry, most recently "Radioactive Starlings," published by Princeton University Press. His poems have appeared in The New York Times Magazine, Ploughshares, the Virginia Quarterly Review and elsewhere. He teaches at Bates College.
Impossibility You didn't expect to fall asleep
but you did briefly in the pew.
Briefly in the dim quiet
before the brief ballad of priests.
No myrrh that day
but always marble gold reminders
of what survives within the earth.
A woman from Angola walks near you
with a squirt bottle.
Her gaze determines you were dragged inside.
Seraphs did it because you wanted
to recall Catholic school
because you were lost.
Because someone you don't know
will bring you a sack of grapes a
bottle of water.
Because you don't know if your
love is near or wants to see you.
You will leave in a month.
You attempt to hold that slippery thing
but understand you will fail.
Impossible snow impossible
sea frozen over in shards.
Someone will meet you wearing
shards that will melt.
She will tell you the story of ice.

Texto completo: Post-Gazette TV writer Rob Owen answers reader questions online every Friday in Tuned In Journal blog at post-gazette.com/tv. Here's a selection of recent queries.
Q: I'm curious to know how local TV stations protect their news crews. I've read about some news crews being verbally attacked while setting up in other cities. I would be disappointed if anything like that happened here.
- CHRIS, PITTSBURGH
Answer: I put this question to Pittsburgh news directors Kathy Hostetter (KDKA-TV), Jim Parsons (WTAE-TV) and Scott Trabandt (WPXI-TV) with an understanding of the sensitive nature of the query and a desire not to publish a response that gives away anything that could jeopardize news crew safety. Only Ms. Hostetter responded.
"We've had some incidents where crews have been approached and have felt uncomfortable," she wrote. "In every situation, they've done the right thing by getting away and calling 911 if they felt it was necessary. One such instance resulted in filing a police report in case it would become something more.
"Additionally, it's always been our practice that if a crew doesn't feel safe at a scene it is always at their discretion to leave," Ms. Hostetter continued. "It's never questioned. We trust our staff to practice good common sense and practice good situational awareness."
Q: I've noticed that KDKA-TV sports hasn't been doing their weekly "Extra Effort Award" lately. Did they drop it or is it on hiatus?
- RON VIA EMAIL
Answer: KDKA-TV general manager Chris Cotugno said: "With our enhanced relationship with the WPIALs, we are looking to revamp the program. The Extra Effort is just on a brief hiatus."
Q: Is Henry Winkler's show "Better Late Than Never" coming back on TV? I really like that show!
- RANDI,
SQUIRREL HILL
Answer: Last month, an NBC spokeswoman said a decision on the show's future has not been made. But the longer the network waits, the less likely the show will be back. The series last aired in early 2018, so don't hold your breath for more. At the same time, TV is more flexible today, so it could conceivably return.
Q: My wife is intrigued by the British royals. I guess I'm too American; the thought of "royalty" leaves me cold. She got pumped when the third season of "The Crown" was released. We've watched the first two episodes, and they are going over old news, stuff they've already covered in depth. The difference is the tone. In the initial iteration Elizabeth and Philip had a rocky relationship, continual tension and mucho complaining by Phil.
In this season, so far, they are lovey-dovey, laugh together, cry together, just "getting on" (as the Brits say) superbly. Did the real royals put up a fuss as to how they were portrayed in the first two seasons? And did they mandate that the show make them look better?
- JIM VIA EMAIL
Answer: No, the royal family has no input in the making of Netflix's "The Crown."
I think the difference in season three is the characters are more settled in their lives together so there's less tension in the relationship.
Showrunner/writer Peter Morgan told The New York Times that what is different in season three is that "it has gone from being a story about a woman finding her way, navigating with her partner, to a woman at the heart of a family drama."

Texto completo: Egg freezing was supposed to be as revolutionary as birth control. It hasn't lived up to the hype -- but it has still changed women's lives.
The potential for egg freezing to allow women to pause their biological clocks is one of the most astonishing developments of recent fertility science. The promise was thrilling: Women could enjoy more time to find the right partners, break up with the wrong ones and become emotionally and financially ready to become mothers.
Enthusiasts even fantasized the technology would promote gender equality by giving women control over their fertility so that they wouldn't have to scale back their career ambitions during their 20s and 30s. "Freeze Your Eggs. Free Your Career" blared a 2014 cover of Bloomberg Businessweek.
When Facebook and Apple announced that same year that they would pay for egg freezing for employees in a "game-changing perk," Apple said in a statement, "We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families."
Egg freezing was an act of self-care -- and professional advancement -- for the modern woman.
"All the talk in the beginning was about how egg freezing would be as big as the birth control pill and liberate women," said Janet Takefman, a reproductive health psychologist at McGill University in Montreal, who has counseled more than 200 women considering egg freezing.
And women responded to this promise. In 2009, the first year the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology started collecting egg freezing data, 475 women went through the procedure, in which an average of 10 eggs are surgically removed and preserved in liquid nitrogen after 10 days of hormonal stimulation. In 2017, more than 9,000 women froze their eggs.
Now we have a chance to look back and ask: Did egg freezing live up to its hype?
The most obvious question is whether egg freezing worked by allowing women to have children later. Although SART collects data on pregnancy rates using frozen eggs, it doesn't break out whether women had frozen them as part of in vitro fertilization treatment or fertility preservation during illness, or to delay childbearing. So I contacted four fertility clinics that have been in the field the longest to find out. (I froze my eggs at two of them and haven't yet thawed.)
One surprising theme emerged: Fewer women than expected -- about 10 to 15 percent at the clinics I spoke to -- had returned to thaw their eggs to make babies from them, despite investing significant time and money, from $ 6,500 to $ 10,200 per procedure, not including drugs and storage.
I talked to James Grifo, director of New York University's Langone Prelude Fertility Center, who broke out the numbers on the first wave of freezers. Of 231 patients who had frozen their eggs from 2005 to 2009, only 88 had returned to use them, and 29 women took home babies, including three sets of twins.
Given that the average age of freezers at N.Y.U. then was 38, those women would be between 48 and 53 today. "Most of them likely have returned, if they were going to," Dr. Grifo said. "Maybe the others decided they weren't going to use them. I know that some had babies naturally. It's hard to keep track because patients don't tell us."
As for the more recent freezers, only time will tell. We don't know how many are waiting to come back in two or 10 years when they are ready to become mothers. Clinical data doesn't reveal who's planning a wedding or juggling three first dates on Bumble or recovering from breast cancer or grieving a parent or mulling over the idea of becoming a single parent. It doesn't tell us whether women wanted a few extra years to go back to school, start a business, train to hike the Pacific Crest Trail or go to therapy after a divorce to figure out how to pick a better partner next time.
So perhaps we should be asking a different question that focuses on the freezing instead of the thawing: Were women happy they froze?
Here we have better data on the psychological benefits: In one 2016 N.Y.U. survey of 224 egg-freezing patients, 60 percent reported feeling less time pressure while dating. One-quarter said they felt "more relaxed, focused, less desperate and with more time to find the right partner." A whopping 96 percent would recommend egg freezing to others.
Similarly, a 2018 University of California, San Francisco, survey of 200 women found that 89 percent were satisfied with their decision to freeze, even if they never used their eggs.
Yet there's another part of the story that needs to be acknowledged: egg freezing's power to disappoint. In the University of California survey, 16 percent experienced "moderate to severe regret" if they hadn't frozen a lot of eggs or received adequate counseling.
Or when their thawed eggs don't make a baby and their natural fertility is gone. The woman who appeared on Bloomberg Businessweek's egg-freezing cover in 2014 is a case study: At age 39, Brigitte Adams, a marketing consultant in Los Angeles, froze 11 eggs. Yet those eggs failed to produce a pregnancy six years later.
Ms. Adams says she feels a responsibility to warn women to be realistic that the technology might not work. "I'm still positive about egg freezing, but I'm not positive about how it's being marketed," Ms. Adams told me. She's now 47 and mother to an 18-month-old daughter conceived through donor eggs and sperm. She urges doctors to counsel women to bank several cycles of eggs to give themselves a better chance of success.
There's hope for a new generation of freezers who doctors say are younger and more savvy, despite being bombarded with ads for egg-freezing parties and discounted cycles. They're also prouder. "The biggest change I'm seeing is that egg freezing is no longer done in secrecy," said Alan Copperman, medical director of Reproductive Medical Associates of New York, which has offered egg freezing since 2005. "There's less stigma. Now patients come in with friends and post pictures on social media." On Instagram, #eggfreezing has 21,000 posts.
This new guard is also more open to single motherhood. Of the women who have thawed, the doctors told me it's split between single and partnered. "They say: 'I want those eggs for myself. When I decide to have a child, I'll have a child.' They don't necessarily want it linked to a relationship," said Georgia Witkin, Reproductive Medical Associates' director of psychological services.
So what are the lessons from egg freezing? It hasn't transformed the workplace, as many had hoped. "It didn't really change society's expectations about when women are supposed to have babies or can put their careers on hold," Dr. Takefman said.
But egg freezing has changed women's personal lives in profound ways. It has given many a sense of hope about the future. For women grieving the end of their fertile years, egg freezing stopped the sadness that they were losing the ability to be mothers. Or as one woman told me, "After I froze, I just felt normal again."
We probably won't know for years whether egg freezing will truly allow a significant number of women to have biological children later in life or whether some of those women will find other ways to be mothers. But we do know it gave many women a feeling of control over their lives -- and a chance to recalibrate their baby-making timelines. When you've got eggs waiting for you in the freezer, the years in between are sweeter and brighter.

Texto completo: The Communist Party is reviving traditional beliefs for political gain -- while cracking down on some faiths.
BEIJING -- In the northern suburbs of this city is a small temple to a Chinese folk deity, Lord Guan, a famous warrior deified more than a millennium ago. Renovated five years ago at the government's expense, the temple is used by a group of retirees who run pilgrimages to a holy mountain, schoolchildren who come to learn traditional culture and a Taoist priest who preaches to wealthy urbanites about the traditional values of ancient China.
Perched atop a hillock overlooking the sprawling capital, the temple is a microcosm of a new civil religion taking shape in China -- an effort by the Chinese Communist Party to satisfy Chinese people's search for moral guidelines by supplementing the largely irrelevant ideology of communism with a curated version of the past.
This new state-guided religiosity is the flip side of the government's harsh policies toward Islam and Christianity. Officials believe these two global faiths are hard to control because of their foreign ties, and they have used negotiation or force -- diplomacy with the Vatican, arrests of prominent Protestants, internment camps for Muslims -- to try to bring these religions to heel.
Yet Beijing's recent turn to tradition may be even more significant. Even though Islam and Christianity are world religions, in China they remain minor, with the number of their combined adherents amounting to less than 10 percent of the population. Most Chinese believe in an amalgam of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and other traditional values and ideas that still resonate deeply.
For this silent majority of hundreds of millions of people, the government's newfound support for things like the temple to Lord Guan is welcome -- a feeling that the Chinese Communist Party hopes will bolster its legitimacy, especially given the irrelevance today of its founding ideas. The benefits of its move to embrace the past may seem obvious, but the shift marks a radical departure, not just for a party officially committed to atheism but also from how reformers over the past century have imagined a modern, prosperous China.
From the 19th century onward, China's elites argued that the country's traditions and faiths were a major reason for its decline. Reformers in 1898 called for temples to be converted into schools. While the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai-shek approved of four religions -- Buddhism, Taoism (sometimes called "Daoism"), Christianity and Islam -- it largely considered traditional Chinese beliefs to be superstitions and advocated the destruction of temples.
Scholars estimate that by the middle of the 20th century, half of the temples that existed in China at the end of the 19th century had been destroyed. An 1851 survey of the old city of Beijing listed 866 temples; today, I count just 18. At the end of the 19th century, most villages had at least one temple and many had half a dozen; vast sections of the Chinese countryside now have no temples at all.
When the Communists took power in 1949, they, like the Nationalists, officially recognized four religions -- but then promptly began persecuting them. Traditional faiths came under especially harsh treatment, with the government banning bedrock traditional practices, from worshiping ancestors and local deities to following the advice of geomancy masters and spirit mediums.
The three decades of reform that started in the late 1970s loosened controls over society, allowing the revival of all religions and many traditions that had been proscribed. Despite periodic crackdowns, churches and mosques, but also temples, were rebuilt, and clergy trained. Although all faiths were supposed to remain under party control, religious feeling boomed, with the number of believers in China topping 500 million by 2010.
Xi Jinping's rise to power in late 2012 marks a new era, the third, in the history of the Chinese Communist Party's religious policies. Instead of the destruction of the Mao years and the relatively laissez-faire approach of the reform period, the state has embarked on a form of highly curated revivalism.
One part of its approach rests on a deep suspicion of Christianity and Islam. The party's policy toward Islam has been the most draconian. Some believers, especially Uighurs in the northwestern province of Xinjiang, have been subjected to a policy of forced secularization. This has included sending hundreds of thousands of Muslims to re-education camps, compelling restaurants to serve pork and alcohol, and forbidding fasting during Ramadan.
The policy toward Christianity is more nuanced. Last year, Beijing struck a deal with the Vatican to jointly appoint Catholic bishops. The Vatican seemed to hope to reverse the decline in the number of Catholics in China. But for Beijing, the measure was a way to tighten control over the Catholic clergy -- and, by extension, the church itself.
Protestantism poses an especially vexing problem for the party. It is arguably China's fastest-growing religion, with an estimated 60 million or more adherents today (compared with one million in 1949), including some 20 to 30 million who are thought to worship in unregistered (or underground) Protestant churches. But the faith lacks a unifying structure that would allow for negotiations. And so the government has fired a few shots across the bow, closing several of the country's best-known underground churches.
In many ways, however, the Xi administration's embrace of traditional faiths is more radical. Since taking office, the president has met with Buddhist leaders, and his government has allowed Taoism to flourish. The state recently issued a landmark plan to improve social mores, the first such program since 2001.
The plan stems from a widespread feeling that China's relentless drive to get ahead economically has created a spiritual vacuum, and sometimes justifies breaking rules and trampling civility. Many people do not trust one another. The government's blueprint for handling this moral crisis calls for endorsing certain traditional beliefs.
The epic paper -- it runs to 10,000 Chinese characters, and would be significantly longer translated into English -- doesn't mention Communist China's founding father, Mao Zedong, or his successors and their ideologies, focusing instead on Mr. Xi and his efforts to fix social problems like "money worship and hedonism." It does invoke Communist slogans such as "core socialist values," but in contrast to the previous such document from 2001 -- which made only passing reference to Chinese traditions -- it calls the past a "rich source of morality." The plan orders party officials to promote "ancient and worthy sages," as well as to "deeply expound" traditional concepts such as "ren'ai" (benevolence), "zhengyi" (righteousness) and "jianyi zhengwei" (standing up bravely for the truth).
This effort is not an attempt to replace Communism with Confucianism. Yet it is fair to say that for the first time since China's imperial order collapsed in 1911, a central government is embracing the ideas that made up the political-religious order that ran China for much of the past 2,500 years. Why? Not only to address China's moral vacuum, but also as a populist measure. The country is entering a more uncertain era, of slower growth and rising inequality, and Beijing is draping itself in the mantle of tradition to broaden its appeal.
In doing so, the government seems to be assuming that traditional Chinese values and beliefs are easier to control than foreign religions, and that supporting them will outweigh the costs of suppressing Islam and Christianity. But I have my doubts.
During a visit this fall to the Lord Guan temple, I saw a dozen or so people, mostly in their 30s and 40s, reading works by Wang Yangming, a philosopher born in the late 15th century. On the face of it, this was in line with government policy: The party has embraced Wang for exemplifying an incorruptible spirit and matching words with deeds.
But after reading a passage of Wang's work, the men and women sat around a big wooden table, wielding brushes to write out, over and over again, his most famous phrase: "zhi xing he yi" (knowledge and action are one). This knowledge, according to Wang, comes from an inner light, a conscience -- one that no government, no matter how powerful, can control.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — When the Newseum opened here on prime Pennsylvania Avenue real estate in 2008, Stephen Colbert joked that they got the name wrong. They should have called it the Newsoleum, he claimed: “The joke's on you, journalists." People and things don't end up in museums, he said, until “there's no use for them anymore."
As a journalist, I'd naturally wanted to visit the Newseum since first hearing of it. It's packed with tributes to the First Amendment and the vital history of the nation's print and electronic media. For over a decade the six-floor building has housed several tons of the Berlin Wall, galleries of Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs and editorial cartoons, and at least one bathroom adorned with glass tiles engraved with the kind of inadvertently comical headlines that editors wish they'd flushed. “High Schoolers Ignorant of Finances, Quiz Shows," reads one from the Denver Post. (We'll wait while you read that last bit twice.)
I'd get to the Newseum eventually, I figured. Then, a couple of months ago, the institution abruptly announced that it would be closing by the end of the year. Stop the presses! Time to pack my reporter's notebook and book a flight.
“Are you coming to say goodbye to us?" asked the smiling woman at the coat check when I arrived. The building has been sold to Johns Hopkins University; some artifacts will head out on traveling exhibitions or go on display at the area's two airports. The digital version of Today's Front Pages, the crowd-pleasing collection that has greeted visitors on the sidewalk outside, will remain online, and the administration and board of trustees are exploring options for potential future sites for the museum.
But the closing of the current location — just across from the National Gallery of Art, with a spectacular view of the nearby US Capitol from the sixth-floor terrace — will be a big loss for Washington tourism. Just as publishers have learned the difficulty of selling newsprint in the age of the Internet, the nonprofit Newseum has been unable to lure enough paying customers to sustain itself amid so many world-class Smithsonian museums along the National Mall, which are free of charge.
Reliving the news can require a robust constitution. One of the first displays at the Newseum is a massive tangle of twisted metal recovered from the World Trade Center ruins, backdropped by a gallery of outraged front pages dated Sept. 12, 2001. On the third floor, the faces of hundreds of journalists who died or were killed while reporting the news are gathered in a haunting, elegant memorial. Bostonians might sense an eerie deja vu in a basement gallery dedicated to FBI investigations, where the Marathon bombing and the manhunt for Whitey Bulger both figure prominently.
But there are lighter sides, too. Late-night comedy is well-represented, including the set from “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart" and a screening room looping recent clips from fake newscasts and talk-show monologues. In a display covering the press's role in the American Revolution, the apoplectic comedian Lewis Black jokes, “From what I gather, a number of our Founding Fathers had anger management issues."
And in a short film on sports in American life, the late Bert Sugar recalls an era when sportswriters wouldn't dare report unflattering news about superstar athletes, who boosted circulation numbers. He recounts a tale of Babe Ruth, “buck naked," sprinting through a dining car on a train, chased by an equally undressed woman brandishing a knife.
“Well," as one reporter supposedly said to his poker mates, “there goes another story we won't cover."
The whole town is conversant in mediaspeak. At an eccentric dive bar near Dupont Circle called the Big Hunt, where Fox News flickered on the overhead TV, a young Oklahoman who recently completed his graduate studies at Harvard was eager to talk about his time in Boston. Wearing a suit and a dark blue tie with a pattern of little American flags, he eventually allowed that he works for Homeland Security. More than once, he prefaced his remarks with a favorite phrase: “Full disclosure," he said.
Despite the wishes of some in power, the closing of the Newseum does not in fact signal the impending obsolescence of a free press. Metaphor-wise, there's plenty more evidence of journalism's role in American life and history on permanent display around the capital. National Public Radio, for instance, offers a daily tour, which I took with a group of concerned individuals from Wisconsin, North Carolina, Peru, and Australia. The organization moved into its pristine new building, in the once-desolate NoMa (“North of Massachusetts Ave.") neighborhood, in 2013.
Visitors are treated to an inside look at the huge, multi-level NPR newsroom and one of the studios from which some familiar voices deliver the news to more than 1,000 member stations and an estimated 38 million weekly listeners. Amy, our volunteer tour guide, also gave us a glimpse of the NPR Music office, where the four members of a project called Mellotron Variations were setting up for a Tiny Desk concert. NPR headquarters has been awarded for its environmental design, Amy said, with a green roof, a comprehensive composting program, and two honeybee colonies perched outside the newsroom. They're affectionately known — brace yourself — as Swarming Edition and All Stings Considered.
Tours are also available of the Voice of America studios, adjacent to the Capitol Building, and many of the city's archival institutions feature further proof of journalism's ongoing role in a healthy democracy. (Only 13 percent of the world's people live in countries with a free press, as we learned in an orientation video at the Newseum.) Over at the National Portrait Gallery, there's a strong showing of notable journalists and historians, from the photographers Margaret Bourke-White and Ernie Pyle to the media moguls Adolph Ochs (New York Times) and Robert Johnson (BET).
Opened in 2016 as the newest museum of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum of African American History & Culture honors several news gatherers throughout its majestic space, from the founders of the first African-American newspaper, Freedom's Journal, launched in 1827, to Robert Churchwell, the “Jackie Robinson of journalism," who became the first black staff reporter at an all-white paper in the South when he joined the Nashville Banner in 1950. The work of many great photographers, of course, was critical to the spread of information about the black struggle in America; “Without the media, the Civil Rights movement would have been a bird without wings," as Representative John Lewis is quoted in an exhibit at the Newseum.
My brief two-day sortie through the nation's capital, where the news has been under attack, concluded at Off the Record. It's a plush, maroon-themed watering hole on the basement level of the historic Hay-Adams Hotel, just across Lafayette Square from the north face of the White House.
A boisterous happy hour crowd squeezed in amid the Christmas decorations, watched over by the famous political caricatures on the walls and the drink coasters. Few seemed to pay any mind as the TV screen over the bartenders' shoulders flashed CNN's Jim Acosta citing an unnamed source about the president's agitation over the impeachment hearings. The reporter was standing on his mark on the White House lawn, just a few hundred yards away.

Texto completo: "When I represent this district, the only thing on my agenda will be working to create well-paying and sustainable jobs, ensuring our children get a quality education that prepares them for the future and expanding access to health care so that no one goes without treatment or ends up bankrupt for getting sick."
Morris "Moe" Davis
Democrat running for NC's 11th District seat
ASHEVILLE – Morris "Moe" Davis, a 61-year-old Democrat, has announced a bid for NC's 11th district, Rep. Mark Meadows' vacated seat.
Davis' former roles include Air Force colonel, chief prosecutor at Guantánamo Bay, judge and law professor. But after returning home to Western North Carolina — Davis grew up in Shelby — he says his focus has been narrow.
"Western North Carolina ranks high in poverty and low in health care coverage and educational achievement," Davis said. "When I represent this district, the only thing on my agenda will be working to create well-paying and sustainable jobs, ensuring our children get a quality education that prepares them for the future and expanding access to health care so that no one goes without treatment or ends up bankrupt for getting sick."
'Moe' Davis' background Davis graduated from Appalachian State and the N.C. Central School of Law before joining the Air Force, where he served for 25 years. His military awards include the Legion of Merit, six Meritorious Service Medals, the Southwest Asia Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.
"America has abandoned its moral leadership in the world," Davis said. "We have lost our standing, and Mark Meadows has stood by and said nothing. For our national security — for our safety — we can't afford to keep him in office any longer."
Davis' website also highlights his support of the Green New Deal, abortion rights, DACA, marijuana legalization, universal background checks for gun purchases, and campaign finance reform to "dismantle Citizens United so corporations can no longer buy politicians." Davis said he will not accept PAC money for this campaign.
He filed to run for the seat on Dec. 11.
Guantánamo Bay Davis was Chief Prosecutor for Terrorism Trials at Guantánamo Bay from September 2005-October 2007.
According to Davis' campaign website, he resigned after refusing to use evidence obtained through torture in his prosecutions. However, Davis' legacy at Guantánamo isn't that simple.
Before his resignation, Davis was considered one of Guantánamo's most vocal defenders and "the most colorful champion of the Bush administration's military commission system," according to a 2008 New York Times profile of Davis.
"(Davis) once said sympathy for detainees was nauseating and compared putting them on trial to dragging 'Dracula out into the sunlight,'" NYT reporter William Glaberson wrote. He was "known for scorched-earth attacks on adversaries, be they terror suspects or lawyers."
"He was the attack dog for the military commission system," said Zachary Katznelson, a lawyer for Guantánamo detainees, told the Times in 2008.
In June 2007, Davis penned an op-ed for the New York Times entitled "The Guantánamo I know" in which he defended the conditions of the prison.
"LINDSEY GRAHAM, a Republican senator from South Carolina, is right: 'The image of Guantánamo Bay and the reality of Guantánamo Bay are completely different.' ... Reality for Guantánamo Bay is the daily professionalism of its staff, the humanity of its detention centers and the fair and transparent nature of the military commissions charged with trying war criminals."
Davis went on to explain that "the Constitution does not extend to alien unlawful enemy combatants" and asserted that "Guantánamo Bay is a clean, safe and humane place for enemy combatants, and the Military Commissions Act provides a fair process to adjudicate the guilt or innocence of those alleged to have committed crimes."
This assessment runs contrary to numerous national and international reports of torture at Guantánamo Bay, both physical and psychological. Davis was briefed on "the black sites ... (and) interrogation techniques" in 2005, he told the Columbia Center for Oral history in 2012. He explained that as soon as he was brought on that same year, he instructed prosecutors not to use testimony gathered during "enhanced interrogation."
"It doesn't excuse how they were treated while they were in our custody, but as far as my job as chief prosecutor for the military commissions, if we're not going to use that information, it makes it irrelevant for their trials," Davis said in 2012, in reference to his role as a prosecutor. "It wasn't my job to go prosecute the CIA agent who waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; it was my job to prosecute Khalid Sheikh Mohammed."
"High-value detainees" were transferred to Guantánamo from CIA black sites in 2006, and by October 2007, Davis had completely reversed course and resigned as chief prosecutor. Contemporary reports stated Davis felt pressured to prosecute "sexy" cases — the detainees with "blood on their hands" rather than low-level cases more likely to result in a conviction — before the 2008 election.
Defender, then critic Davis would become as vocal a critic of the proceedings at Guantánamo as he had been a defender.
In February 2008, he testified on behalf of a detainee — Yemeni national Salim Hamdan, Osama bin Laden's personal driver. Davis said publicly that although he was convinced the charges against Ahmed were ethical, he was no longer confident he could provide a fair trial given pressures to convict.
The next year, Davis was fired from a position as assistant director and senior specialist in national security for the Congressional Research Service at the Library of Congress after penning an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal critical of the Obama administration's handling of prosecutions at Guantánamo Bay. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, Davis sued for violation of his First Amendment rights. The Library of Congress ultimately settled for $100,000.
Most recently, Davis served as a judge for the Department of Labor.
Today, Davis has more than 153,000 Twitter followers and has appeared NBC, ABC, CNN, MSNBC, Fox and NPR, as well as contributing op-eds to publications including the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and the Guardian.
"When I represent this district, the only thing on my agenda will be working to create well-paying and sustainable jobs, ensuring our children get a quality education that prepares them for the future and expanding access to health care so that no one goes without treatment or ends up bankrupt for getting sick."

Sonoma County writer dives into the bohemian life of Alice Adams

Texto completo: She was a Southern girl with enough beauty to qualify as a belle. But Alice Adams was a 20th-century rebel, breaking with the social constraints of her North Carolina roots and proper Radcliffe education to build a bohemian writer’s life in the San Francisco Bay Area during the age of free love.
By the time of her death in 1999 at age 72, she had produced 15 books, both short story collections and novels, including the bestseller “Superior Women,” following the lives or four Radcliffe grads from the war years to the 1980s, a story loosely inspired by her own experience.
Another novel, “After the War” and another collection of short stories, were published posthumously.
A writer very much of her time, Adams gave voice to the experiences of a generation of women whose lives straddled two worlds — the strict formality of a pre-World War II girlhood in a segregated south to the social unraveling and women’s liberation of the 1960s and 1970s.
“I was bright in school and ran into trouble because of that Southern thing that women are supposed to be stupid,” she once said.
Adams pushed the boundaries of social convention and finally found her writing voice after moving with her husband, Mark Linenthal, to the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1940s.
Carol Sklenicka was intrigued by the story to be told in Adams’ life. The Jenner writer’s last biography, “Raymond Carver: A Life,” was named one of the Top 10 books of 2009 by the New York Times. In the wake of that triumph, she looked for another Northern California writer to examine. Adams, she said, seemed ideal.
This month, the New York Times singled out Sklenicka’s book, “Alice Adams: Portrait of a Writer” (Scribner), as one of “Nine Books to Watch for in December.” The Christian Science Monitor also named it one of their top 10 books for December.
“I was interested in writing about another short story writer. I’ve always loved short stories and with the Raymond Carver book, I was just really fascinated to find how the life and the stories lined up,” she said. “Not what is true in the stories, but how does a creative person make art out of the mess of their life, because everyone’s life is kind of a mess as they experience it from day to day.”
Carver, known for his “dirty realism,” offered a lot more mess to work with. The son of an alcoholic millworker and fisherman, he also struggled with the drink at the bare margins of the middle class, constantly on the move and financially struggling with two kids and a long-suffering wife.
Adams, by contrast, was raised an only child by two intellectuals. Father Nicholson Adams taught Spanish literature at the University of North Carolina. Her mother, with a graduate degree, toiled in the shadows as a frustrated faculty wife and later went back to school to become a librarian.
Through eight years of research, interviewing dozens of people, combing through Adams’ papers at the University of Texas at Austin, reading and re-reading everything Adams had written that she could find, and spending time in Chapel Hill where Adams spent her early years, Sklenicka explored the darker corners of the writer’s life. Her father dealt with depression and cheated on her mother, who became embittered and critical. Adams ran through a string of relationships, including with the writer Max Steele and the handsome, hard-drinking San Francisco interior designer Bob McNie.
“Alice’s love affairs and unembarrassed sexual vitality didn’t go with the picture of an intellectual woman we have in our culture,” Sklenicka said shortly before delivering her first reading at The Book Passage in Corte Madera earlier this month. “I was curious about it, and I came to admire her openness about it.”
At the reading, Skelenicka was wearing a long strand of blue glass beads, once worn by Adams and a gift from Adams’ only child, Peter Linenthal, who offered unqualified support for this first in-depth biography of his mother. Alice wore the necklace frequently over the years.
“I really trusted her and so I would just tell her anything she wanted to know,” said the 68-year-old artist, who lives on Potrero Hill in San Francisco and controls his mother’s literary legacy.
“The bulk of the primary material was at the Ransom Center (University of Texas), but I had some drafts of stories. I had things they didn’t have. And I connected her to anybody that I could think of that might be helpful who knew my mom.”
In the more relaxed world of the Bay Area, Adams shed her Southern formality, although she continued to draw from her early life in many of her stories, like the haunting “Verlie I Say unto You,” inspired by her family’s black maid, and Sklenicka’s favorite, “Roses, Rhododendron.”
“What I’ve come to love about Alice and what drew me to her in the first place was how she was a smart, attractive, ambitious woman who managed to do all these thing in an era and time when it was very difficult for a woman,” Sklenicka said.
“When Adams and her contemporaries emerged from Radcliffe, the war was over and there were no jobs for women. The pressure to default to marriage and motherhood was powerful.”
Adams married and had a child in her 20s but never succumbed to “The Feminine Mystique” identified by Betty Friedan in the early 1960s. “She never gave up on her dream of being a writer.”
Adams was 40 when her first novel, “Careless Love,” was published in 1966.
While her work was well-regarded in literary circles and regularly published in the New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly and other marquee publications, she might have felt she was not a full member of the club.
The prestigious American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters honored her with a prize in 1992, but never elected her to be a member even though friends, like fellow Bay Area writer Diane Johnson, were.
“It meant a lot to her and never happened,” Sklenicka said. Some sources suggested that while Adams was celebrated in New York and her books sold well, her absence from the scene may have undermined in her some ways.
“She thought New York or San Francisco were the best cities for a writer (but) that New York would be too much literary competition all the time,” Sklenicka said. “Too many parties with other writers. She felt she was more free to live her own life here and be a writer.”
Adams did receive her share of accolades, including the O. Henry Special Award for Continuing Achievement.
The writer spent her later years in a Victorian on the south side of Alta Plaza Park in Pacific Heights, which inspired her short story “The First and Only House.” She was well knit into Bay Area literary circles, and counted among her friends Anne Lamott, Ella Leffland, Millicent Dillon and Orville Schell.
Sklenicka is diligent and meticulous in her research. It wasn’t easy locating some of Adams’ stories, particularly those published in women’s magazines that tend not to be archived by libraries.
“Some of them were considered potboilers. But I found a lot of them interesting, because of how they related to her life,” she said.
In her research, Sklenicka uncovered details about Adams that even her son did not know.
“I didn’t know my mom had an affair with my preschool teacher,” he said. “There were a number of affairs I didn’t have any clue about. And at one level, well, great. She had a full life.”
Adams’ recognition as a writer has diminished in the last 20 years, Sklenicka conceded. But she said she hopes that will change with the publication of her biography and the reissue of a new version of “The Stories of Alice Adams” by Vintage.
Adams wrote in a voice that was both literary and conversational.
“It’s like someone talking to you. She skips around. One thing reminds her of another,” Sklenicka said. “It’s a lot like the way two people might just be gossiping and telling stories.”
Sklenicka said Adams’ mid-century milieu may be dated, but her themes transcend eras. “I would like to see her up there with some of the male writers whose names we all recognize, like John Updike and Saul Bellow and Raymond Carver,” Sklenicka said. “It may sound pretentious. But she’s in that realm of that amount of talent with so many beautiful stories.”

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
BLUE HERON at Corpus Christi Church (Dec. 22, 4 p.m.). This choir from Cambridge rightly cited for recording one of the albums of the year by my colleague Anthony Tommasini this month, returns to New York as part of the Music Before 1800 series. With the Dark Horse Consort, they perform "Christmas in Baroque Germany," with works by Praetorius, Gabrieli and others. Scott Metcalfe conducts.
212-666-9266, mb1800.org
'THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL PASSION' at the Met Cloisters (Dec. 21, 12:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.). David Lang's Pulitzer Prize-winning choral work surely ranks among one of the most successful recent pieces around, and here it receives two performances from the excellent Philadelphia-based choir the Crossing, led by Donald Nally. Before that, they give the premiere of "Spectral Spirits," a new work by Edie Hill on poems by Holly Hughes.
212-570-3949, metmuseum.org
MAKE MUSIC WINTER at various locations (Dec. 21). Make Music's winter festival may not have the sprawl of its summer counterpart, but there are still 13 participatory parades and other events dotted around the city, one of around 40 involved this year. Of particular note is an eight-hour performance of Satie's "Vexations," a one-page work played 840 times in succession, by amateur and professional pianists under the Oculus at World Trade Center, from 10 a.m. onward.

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
'MESSIAH' at St. Paul's Chapel (Dec. 20-21, 7:30 p.m., Dec. 22, 3 p.m.). Julian Wachner leads the best "Messiah" in New York City, and probably one of the best, period, with the Trinity Baroque Orchestra and the Choir of Trinity Wall Street, the singers of which also take on the solo parts. It's a sellout, but the Saturday performance will be streamed live on Trinity's website. For a live alternative, check out Kent Tritle conducting Musica Sacra at Carnegie Hall (Dec. 23, 7:30 p.m.)

Texto completo: Kellee Kim, a contestant who raised concerns about inappropriate touching, agreed to take part in the final episode only after she got a guarantee from CBS that she would be able to speak freely.
Ordinarily, the season finale of "Survivor" is a festive occasion. The contestants gather to reminisce about their time on an island off Fiji, and the winner is announced and awarded $ 1 million.
On Wednesday, it wasn't so simple.
As the CBS competition show limped to the end of Season 39, it was still scoring ratings, making an unlikely return to the top 10 as the seventh-most-watched entertainment program on network television.
But the announcement of the latest winner capped a season that did not provide the usual escapist thrills. This "Survivor" offended die-hard fans and some former cast members because of how the show handled female contestants' complaints of inappropriate touching against a male contestant.
For the first time, instead of airing live, the reunion special that is broadcast after the winner is announced was taped hours in advance. And as recently as a few days ago, a "Survivor" contestant who raised concerns about inappropriate touching, Kellee Kim, was not sure if she would be allowed to speak freely about her experience during the reunion.
The backlash over "Survivor," which ranks as CBS's highest-rated entertainment show for adults under 50, took place at a network that has been rocked by a societal reckoning on workplace sexual misconduct. The chief executive, a star anchor and several leading producers at the company have been felled since the start of the #MeToo movement.
Debra Katz, a lawyer representing Ms. Kim, contacted CBS late last week to express her concerns. After talks, the network said Ms. Kim would be permitted to speak freely at the reunion special.
In a statement this week, CBS also acknowledged that there were "things we could have done differently" this season, adding that "we are determined to do better going forward." The network also announced a series of "Survivor" production changes "to ensure that the events that occurred this season are not repeated."
In an interview on Wednesday evening after the reunion taped, Ms. Kim said, "What's really most important is that 'Survivor' and CBS took responsibility and apologized. These changes that I've been asking for for many, many months have been put into place, so no one else is going to have to go through something like this."
In an episode that aired last month, which was filmed months ago in Fiji, Ms. Kim said that a fellow contestant, Dan Spilo, had made her uncomfortable by repeatedly touching her without her consent. "Survivor" broadcast much of the footage of the unwanted contact.
After Mr. Spilo was issued a warning, the contestants were left to their own devices. Ms. Kim was ultimately voted off the show, prompting a backlash and underscoring an on-air statement she had made earlier: "There are always consequences for standing up." Mr. Spilo remained on the island for several more episodes.
In last week's episode, Mr. Spilo, a Hollywood talent manager, was removed from the show, as well as from the jury that awards $ 1 million to the season's winner. The only explanation for the decision was a title card onscreen saying he had been ejected "after a report of another incident" that occurred off-camera and did not involve a contestant. In a statement to People on Tuesday, Mr. Spilo apologized.
Ever since, "Survivor" has been on the receiving end of withering commentary. The New York Times television critic James Poniewozik faulted the show for "the inept, shameful, evasive way it handled sexual misconduct." A former "Survivor" contestant, Zeke Smith -- who applauded the sensitivity that the network and the show had displayed two years ago when he was outed by a fellow contestant as transgender -- also criticized the show. "This predator could have and should have been stopped long ago, but those in power made a choice not to stop him," he tweeted last week. "Shame on you, Survivor."
Ms. Kim's lawyer, Ms. Katz, said in an interview, "Sexual harassment should never be used for entertainment value. And what happened in this instance was completely unacceptable."
Even with the uproar, ratings have held steady. But many longtime fans have been furious.
"There was a lot of shock and horror and numbness," said Andy Dehnart, the creator of the website Reality Blurred, describing the reaction among "Survivor" superfans. "And there were a lot of questions about how this could happen at all."
For Wednesday's finale, CBS did not invite Mr. Spilo to the reunion special.
As late as last week, Ms. Katz said, it was unclear what role Ms. Kim would play, as well.
"Kellee was concerned that she was not going to be able to speak at the finale," Ms. Katz added. "And if she was allowed to speak, that it would be too scripted and she would not be able to say the things that were important for her to say."
Ms. Kim underscored the point by saying she was worried about "whether I'd get a free, open venue to speak."
On Dec. 13, with Ms. Kim's role in the finale still up in the air, Ms. Katz emailed CBS and MGM, the studio that makes the show.
"Let me be clear at the onset: Ms. Kim does not seek compensation," she wrote. "Her motivation in retaining counsel is to begin a productive dialogue about changes production and CBS must make in future seasons of the show."
In the email, Ms. Katz also described the show's "serious mishandling" of Ms. Kim's complaint, she said in an interview. It was not long after sending the email that CBS informed Ms. Kim that she would be permitted to speak freely on the final episode.
A CBS spokesman said, "There was never any doubt in our mind that she would be part of it and be able to speak freely about her experience." The spokesman added that her discussion with Jeff Probst, the show's longtime host, during the reunion special would be "broadcast unedited."
The opening minutes of the reunion proceeded as they would in any season. Mr. Probst talked about season highs with several contestants, and he announced the pop singer Sia's three favorite players of the season, along with cash prizes that go with it.
But then Mr. Probst dispensed with tradition and spoke one-on-one with Ms. Kim, with the pair sitting on stools.
Mr. Probst said this was a teachable moment and apologized for the way the show handled her allegations. As they sat down, he said, "You were right, you were right."
Ms. Kim, tearing up, said, "I hope this season of 'Survivor' isn't just defined by inappropriate touching or sexual harassment. I hope it's defined by change."
On Tuesday, CBS detailed its planned improvements for future seasons of "Survivor." One rule will say that unwanted physical contact or sexual harassment will not be allowed. The production will also assign an executive to the set so that contestants can express their concerns confidentially.
Ms. Kim said she was heartened by the response and wanted the network to see it through.
"I hope that this has been a true learning lesson and things are different going forward, but only time will tell," she said.

House Votes To Lift Cap On Write-Off

Texto completo: Efforts to eliminate the cap on a popular tax break have divided Democrats, and will die in the Senate.
WASHINGTON -- The House voted on Thursday to temporarily eliminate a tax increase on some high-earning residents of states like California and New York that was included in President Trump's 2017 tax overhaul, with some Republicans joining Democrats in support.
The bill would repeal a cap on a popular tax break that prevented taxpayers from deducting more than $ 10,000 in state and local taxes from their federal income taxes. It paired that repeal -- which would in effect be a tax cut for upper earners in high-tax states -- with an increase on the highest earners across the country by raising the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 37 percent.
In a procedural twist, Democrats agreed to a Republican amendment that would limit the bill's benefits for blue-state billionaires. It would maintain the so-called SALT cap on deductions for taxpayers earning more than $ 100 million per year, and direct the saved money to a $ 500 tax break for teachers and first responders. Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California, said the motion was accepted "in the spirit of the holiday season."
The bill, which was approved by a vote of 218 to 206, has no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate, and Mr. Trump has threatened to veto it.
But it was hailed as a victory by its Democratic champions, many of whom were elected last year in wealthy, suburban areas where the SALT cap had raised some voters' taxes.
"It's about fairness," Representative Thomas Suozzi, Democrat of New York and the lead sponsor of the legislation, said in an interview. "Do we want people moving away from New York to go to Florida because they lost their state and local tax deduction?"
When those residents move out of state, Mr. Suozzi said, "the remaining lower- and middle-income families are left holding the bag."
The 2017 Trump tax law limited deductions for state and local taxes paid, like income and property taxes, to $ 10,000 per household per year. That resulted in net tax increases for a slice of high-earning residents of areas with high income or property taxes, which tend to be concentrated in large metropolitan areas like New York City and high-tax states like New Jersey and California.
The SALT cap was tucked into the 2017 tax overhaul in part to help finance it and reduce its impact on the deficit. The bill passed on Thursday includes some budgetary gymnastics in order to avoid adding to the federal debt. It would repeal the SALT cap for three years while raising the top income tax rate for six years. Because of how Republicans structured the 2017 law, the SALT cap is set to expire and the top rate is set to rise on their own at the end of 2025.
Voter anger toward the SALT cap in certain areas appears to have helped lift Democrats in the 2018 midterms. In the months leading up to the election, the online research platform SurveyMonkey interviewed nearly 30,000 registered voters about their opinions on the tax law, their voting intentions and other topics. A New York Times analysis of that data suggests that the SALT cap may have had a significant effect on voters' views of the tax law -- and perhaps even on how they voted -- to a degree that could have influenced the narrowest races in those districts.
Efforts to repeal the cap have emerged as a division among Democrats who have long criticized Republicans for cutting taxes to favor the rich.
Many liberal policy analysts oppose raising the SALT cap, because it would mostly benefit high earners and they would rather use the money for spending programs to help the poor and middle class.
Repealing the cap "should not be a top priority," Seth Hanlon, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, wrote in an online column this month.
"If policymakers are concerned with the effect of the SALT cap on middle-class families," he wrote, "there are options to address it without providing enormous windfalls for the wealthy."
At least one leading presidential contender, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., favors eliminating the cap.
"This bill truly is a tax cut for the few," said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. "What Democrats are proposing today is regressive."
Mr. Suozzi said on Thursday that the repeal of the cap would be "100 percent paid for by the wealthiest Americans," by raising the top income tax rate.

Texto completo: (JTA) — Harvey Weinstein and his former studio’s board members have reached a tentative settlement deal for $44 million with women who accuse him of sexual misconduct, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The disgraced film producer, who is Jewish, has denied sexually harassing or abusing over 75 women.
He will stand trial in New York in June on criminal charges brought by two women, including rape.
In October 2017, The New York Times published a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Weinstein, who founded the Weinstein Co. with his brother after splitting from Miramax in 2005. It triggered the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment.
Actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd were among the first women to come forward.
Weinstein issued an apology acknowledging he had “caused a lot of pain,” but denied allegations that he harassed female employees over nearly three decades.
Weinstein, 67, is one of Hollywood’s most famous producers and has worked on a number of award-winning films, including “Shakespeare in Love,” “The King’s Speech” and “The Artist.”

Texto completo: President Trump will join fellow billionaires and heads of state at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, even as his nationalist ally, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, refuses to attend and will not let his ministers go.
The Davos meeting, scheduled for Jan. 21 to 24, is criticized for its elite deal-making and cosmopolitanism, which critics say undermine the sovereignty of nations. American presidents have typically avoided the event.
Trump, who touts himself as a populist, canceled his visit to the January 2019 confab amid the border security fight and shutdown, but next month he will make his second appearance as president at the annual celebration of internationalism.
Not so for Johnson, reelected as prime minister with a majority of 80 last week. Johnson said he plans to “get on with delivering the priorities of the British people,” a No. 10 official said, and has banned ministers from attending. "Our focus is on delivering for the people, not champagne with billionaires," a government source told the Daily Mail.
Ahead of his 2018 visit to Davos, concern abounded among regulars who saw the president's America First policies and pointed anti-internationalist rhetoric as a threat to the gathering.
These were quickly soothed. Trump "calmed the room with his speech," president of the Atlantic Council Fred Kempe told CNBC at the time. The mood had been "a hot room" ahead of the president's arrival. “I’d say 99% of them would have voted for Hillary Clinton had they had a vote,” Kempe said about the others in attendance. “They were ready to bite, ready to boo, ready to hate what he said.”
Headlines from the week were equally sanguine. "No fire and fury," Quartz said. "Trump and Davos: Not Exactly Best Friends, but Not Enemies Either," the New York Times wrote.
By the time of Trump's departure, many viewed Trump's bellicose positions as bargaining postures, instead. The president arrived a "party wrecker," left "a pragmatist," the New York Times said.
The experience stood in contrast to the fiery rhetoric that draws Trump's "Front Row Joes" — loyalists who line up days ahead of schedule after cross-country drives and red-eye flights — for his rallies.
Trump defenders rail against what they call the "party of Davos," as did Raheem Kassam, former adviser to Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and current co-host of Steve Bannon's impeachment podcast. Davos enemies such as Bannon and Kassam denigrate "unelected bureaucrats" working against the White House's political agenda, a "permanent political class" thwarting policy. Ex-Trump adviser Bannon is well documented in his disdain for party of Davos "propaganda," which he chides as antithetical to the president's policies.
Davos, by comparison, hosts pop-up shopfronts occupied by such Beltway-familiar names as Palantir Technologies, awarded a $111 million Army contract on Tuesday, flanked by a Philz, the San Francisco coffee shop, and Facebook, where Trump adviser and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel sits on the board.

Texto completo: Gross domestic product, a measure of the total value of the nation’s economic output over a time period, always has been among the broadest measures of economic perform-ance. But, as noted in a series of columns by David Leonhardt of The New York Times, it also has been an indicator of individual fi-nancial well-being because personal financial progress often rose in near accord with GDP.
That especially was true after World War II, when vast manufacturing enterprises acc-ounted for a high percentage of employment and powerful labor unions fought for labor’s share. It started to change in the 1970s and has accelerated since, so a graph line charting GDP growth still coincides roughly with the financial welfare of the top 10% of earners, but diverges sharply for the lower 90%.
Now the Commerce Department is working on a new calculation of GDP that still would calculate the overall performance but break it out to reflect the economic well-being of different income groups. The department plans to issue a prototype statistical model next year. Congress should mandate the new calculation.

Texto completo: The smell of baked granola and oatmeal shortbread cookies wafts onto a narrow street a couple of blocks from Bethlehem's busy Main Street.
The appetizing odor emerges from a neat brick building, painted a soft green, where nine people listen to music and converse while they seamlessly mix, roll and bake to keep up with demand ahead of Christmas.
This is The Granola Factory, a business born 13 years ago out of a bed-and-breakfast around the corner. The bakery's products have appeared on the "Rachael Ray Show" and been featured in The New York Times, making their way into about 180 stores across nine states in the process - up from fewer than 20 locations not even a decade ago.
Now, The Granola Factory is gearing up for its next stage of growth. Bethlehem Bar sales are surging at Wegmans and Whole Foods Markets, while granola production is increasing as the business gets ready to sell select products at Giant Food Stores in the new year, said Calvin Virgilio, the company's director of operations and the 32-year-old son of owners Robert and Suzanne Virgilio. While Virgilio declined to disclose sales figures, he pointed to the company's hiring plans - the business wants to add three employees by the spring - as a sign of The Granola Factory's outlook.
"It's grown to a good size," Virgilio said at the business' Long Street factory. "It's nine people working eight hours a day, making product."
Starting Jan. 6, Giant will start carrying two of the business' products - the original Bethlehem Inn honey pecan granola and the honey pecan granola with organic grains and honey - in nearly all of its more than 180 stores across Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, Giant spokeswoman Ashley Flower confirmed.
"We're excited to do so, as they are a local business with a high-quality product we think will really resonate with our customers," Flower said.
The company's growth comes during a time in which natural foods are outpacing gains in the overall food market, as consumers continue to choose simple, real food ingredients over processed options. The Granola Factory, Virgilio said, also appears to be benefiting from products that appeal to a wide range of people throughout the year.
For example, while sales of the company's granola, which retails at $5.99 for an 11-ounce bag, pick up in the New Year as people make resolutions, The Granola Factory is seeing growth from its Bethlehem Bar in the run-up to the holidays.
Those gains came after a change in the size offerings of the Bethlehem Bar, an oatmeal shortbread cookie that comes layered with chocolate, caramel and pecans or raspberry, white chocolate and almonds.
Previously, the bar was sold in a 6-ounce package priced at $4.99. But last year, at the suggestion of Whole Foods, The Granola Factory developed a smaller size easier for shoppers to devour in one sitting, Virgilio said.
The mini-bar, a 2.84-ounce version priced at $2.99, has performed well since being introduced this year at Whole Foods locations in the mid-Atlantic and at Wegmans stores in Pennsylvania and Maryland, he said. Wegmans also started selling a larger family pack of the Bethlehem Bars in its Pennsylvania and Maryland locations, at $10.99.
The business still makes and packages a 6-ounce bar, but the mini-bar and family pack are The Granola Factory's fastest-growing products, Virgilio said.
To help meet demand for the smaller size, Virgilio said, the business will get a flow wrapper in February, allowing it to wrap 60 mini-Bethlehem Bars a minute versus the current three-a-minute pace.
Granola, however, remains the business' foundation. After all, that's how this whole thing started.
Virgilio's parents, Robert and Suzanne, have owned and operated The Bethlehem Inn since 1988. Guests have always been served breakfast, and the family's honey pecan granola quickly became a memorable staple. As granola increasingly became popular in grocery stores, Virgilio said, the family decided it was time to package and sell the product.
The family built a small commercial kitchen in the inn's basement, baking and packaging the granola for retail stores in eastern Pennsylvania. Before long, the Virgilios made inroads at Wegmans and were able to buy the Long Street building, a former seafood market they turned into a bakery and opened in fall 2006.
By the time Calvin Virgilio joined the business in 2011, as a recent college graduate working in financial software and growing tired of regularly hopping on planes, the goal was to continue to grow the operation.
With that growth now happening, Virgilio said, it's crazy to think The Granola Factory used to be a one-oven operation. Today, it has six ovens.
"That's probably the most enjoyable part of where we are today is there are people who saw it four years ago that are still here," he said. "They connect with it."
That includes Sabrina Gonzalez, one of the business' production managers who will mark five years with the company in April. When the South Side Bethlehem resident started, after working as an assistant manager at retailer Wet Seal, she worked Monday through Thursday and left each day by 12:30 p.m.
Now, her days stretch from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.
Mike Galucy, also a production manager, started about 3½ years ago after two years at The Home Depot and a seasonal stint at Groupon. When he started, The Granola Factory employed five or six people and produced 28 bakings of granola a day - one baking is equal to five full sheet pans - and just a handful of trays of Bethlehem Bars a week, which was then more of a secondary product for the business.
That, he said, has now grown to 45 daily bakings of granola and 150 weekly trays of Bethlehem Bars, production that continues to increase and warrants additional hands.
Galucy, who lives in an apartment attached to The Granola Factory, and Gonzalez said the business is a tight-knit place where the crew works well together and gets to know one another. That kind of personal touch is exactly what The Granola Factory hopes comes through with each bite.
"Every day, we come here with the best positive attitude we have, and we put that into our product," Galucy said. "I think it shows with the taste and quality."

Court to Rule On Bias Laws And Religion In Workplace

Texto completo: The justices will attempt to balance two competing interests: avoiding interference in the affairs of religious groups and protecting their employees from discrimination.
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court said on Wednesday that it would decide how broadly federal employment discrimination laws apply to schools run by churches.
The court has been active in considering the relationship between church and state, generally siding with religious groups. It has ruled in recent years that a state must let a church participate in a government program, that a war memorial in the shape of a cross could remain on public property and that town boards may start their meetings with sectarian prayers.
The two cases the court agreed to hear on Wednesday will give the justices a chance to decide another aspect of the church-and-state divide -- what role the government can play in regulating religious institutions.
The new cases were brought by teachers in Catholic schools in California who sued their employers for job discrimination. The schools responded that the teachers were covered by a "ministerial exception" to employment discrimination laws established by the Supreme Court.
The new cases -- Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, No. 19-267, and St. James School v. Darryl Biel, No. 19-348 -- will decide how broad the exception is and how to balance the competing interests of avoiding interference in the internal affairs of religious groups while protecting their employees from discrimination.
That exception, the court said, in a unanimous 2012 decision, was needed to ensure that churches and other religious groups were free to choose and dismiss employees who perform religious work without government interference.
In that decision, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. described the conflict.
"The interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important," he wrote. "But so, too, is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith and carry out their mission."
That decision gave only limited guidance about how courts should decide which employees were covered, saying the court was "reluctant to adopt a rigid formula."
The 2012 case concerned Cheryl Perich, who had been a teacher at a Lutheran school in Michigan. Ms. Perich said she was fired for pursuing an employment discrimination claim based on a disability, narcolepsy.
Ms. Perich was a "called" teacher who had completed religious training and whom the school considered a minister. The Supreme Court ruled that she was subject to the exception and could not sue.
The new cases concern teachers without formal training or titles but who taught Catholic doctrine and other subjects. One of them, Kristen Biel, sued under the Americans With Disabilities Act after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and her contract was not renewed. The other, Agnes Morrissey-Berru, sued for age discrimination after her own contract was not renewed.
Federal trial judges dismissed both cases, saying the ministerial exception protected the schools. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, reversed those rulings, allowing the cases to proceed.
In separate decisions, the appeals court said the teachers were not covered by the exception established by the 2012 decision because neither they were not considered ministers by either themselves or their employers, as reflected in their job titles.
"Morrissey-Berru's formal title of 'teacher' was secular," a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit wrote in an unsigned opinion. "Aside from taking a single course on the history of the Catholic church, Morrissey-Berru did not have any religious credential, training or ministerial background. Morrissey-Berru also did not hold herself out to the public as a religious leader or minister."
"She committed to incorporate Catholic values and teachings into her curriculum, as evidenced by several of the employment agreements she signed, led her students in daily prayer, was in charge of liturgy planning for a monthly Mass, and directed and produced a performance by her students during the school's Easter celebration every year," the opinion said. "However, an employee's duties alone are not dispositive."
Nine judges dissented from the full Ninth Circuit's decision to deny rehearing in Ms. Biel's case, saying the three-judge panel had made a mistake in focusing on Ms. Biel's job title rather than the substance of what she did.
"Courts are ill-equipped to gauge the religious significance of titles or the sufficiency of training," Judge Ryan D. Nelson wrote. "Biel's title may appear to carry little or no religious significance to a court unfamiliar with the customs of Catholic education, but Biel's employment at St. James had significant religious substance."
Judge Nelson drew support from a concurrence in the 2012 decision that had featured an unusual alliance. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justice Elena Kagan, wrote that the exception "should apply to any 'employee' who leads a religious organization, conducts worship services or important religious ceremonies or rituals, or serves as a messenger or teacher of its faith."

A family asks for prayers to revive dead toddler
The toddler died suddenly over the weekend. Now, the family is asking members of their Redding megachurch to pray her back to life. Since Saturday, members of Bethel Church have been using prayer, music and song to bring back to life 2-year-old Olive Alayne.
"Bethel Church believes in the stories of healing and physical resurrection found in the Bible (Matthew 10:8), and that the miracles they portray are possible today," Bethel Church leaders said in a statement.
Olive Alayne stopped breathing early Saturday, and attempts to revive her were unsuccessful. Her family began its prayers shortly after she was declared dead and took to Instagram to ask others around the world to pray.
Plane theft, shrimp theft and See's Candies
A teenage girl busts through barricades and tries to steal a plane at Fresno Yosemite International Airport. She crashed into a building and fence but failed to get airborne.
A man stuffed 30 pounds of shrimp down his pants over three visits to a grocery store, Riverside police said. The whole thing happened over 15 minutes.
See's Candies, as familiar to many Californians as traffic, is beautifully celebrated in this story. Can you guess its No. 1 selling chocolate? The answer's at the bottom.
Death reports are public. Ventura County's elected leaders hope to change that.
Elected leaders in Ventura County want to block death records from the greater public and this week voted 5-0 to find a state legislator willing to sponsor legislation to get there. If supervisors get their way, the decision could impact all 58 counties.
The move comes at a time when the criminal investigation into the November 2018 mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill is reportedly drawing to a close. Officials have said they will release the autopsy records once the investigation ends.
Glen Smith, litigation director for the First Amendment Coalition, said the reports were an important part of government transparency and accountability. "If you have a child who died in foster care, somebody killed by a police officer or someone killed in an industrial accident or automobile accident, there is a real public interest in knowing what exactly happened to the deceased. "
Findings from death records have led to changes in public policy to prevent similar fatalities, including sudden deaths in infants, and the Ventura County Star used them to reveal autopsies were being done by an assistant who had no medical license.
The impeachment . . . and what else we're talking about
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said his GOP colleagues will "rue the day" they chose party over country on the day the House voted to impeach President Trump. (follow this developing story here).
Analysis: For Trump and Pelosi, impeachment will shape their legacies and their futures.
Boeing's decision to temporarily stop making its most popular passenger jet, the 737 Max, is having a ripple effect in California and across the global aerospace chain.

Resisting fracking across 1 million acres
Environmental groups say they plan to fight a Trump administration decision to allow fracking and oil drilling across more than 1 million acres in California. The move to lift the five-year moratorium followed a federal environmental report that concluded there were no adverse impacts of fracking that couldn't be alleviated. Enviro groups aren't in agreement.
Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves pumping chemically treated water into deep rock formations to create or widen cracks and release oil and natural gas.
The impacted counties include Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura. The lands are near forests, wildlife refuges and Carrizo Plain National Monument, and home to threatened and endangered wildlife, including San Joaquin kit foxes and California condors, environmental groups say.

Titans need to fight the nasty label of mediocrity

Texto completo: Kenny Vaccaro didn't wait for Monday to review tape of the Titans' first loss in five games.
He watched it Sunday night.
"We made some plays. We just got beat," said the safety. "... They played a good game."
Sometimes, Vaccaro said, you'll look back and say "Well, we killed ourselves." But he didn't think that this time.
The Texans' victory over the Titans, important as it was in the AFC playoff picture, was indeed one of those losses that lacked a glaring weakness on which to assign blame – other than maybe a few defensive lapses, a blocked field goal and a fluky, excruciating goal-line interception — and try to correct.
A lack of self-inflicted mistakes should make a defeat easier to accept and move on, but it won't.
Because what you're left with now can be especially deflating and difficult to admit: The Texans were just better.
And they were better than a Titans team that was at its best, one that entered a critical game on a tear, playing as well as any team in the NFL.
"We're disappointed when we lose," coach Mike Vrabel said Monday. "We put a lot into this every week, players and coaches. They'll be sore. You're always a lot more sore when you lose. That's how it goes. So we can't just pout and feel bad for ourselves, feel sorry for ourselves."
We're going to learn a lot about the Titans in the next week, and not just because a tough test against the Saints is next.
They can't regress back to average and hope to win – not after the previous weeks had offered such tantalizing hope for more.
This is going to be about overcoming failure – which this team has shown it can do – and keep finding what it was that allowed this team to catch fire in recent weeks.
It's about not overreacting or changing the formula. It's Ryan Tannehill continuing to play well. It's continuing to lean on Derrick Henry, ailing hamstring and all, to log carries early and set the tone. It's continuing to showcase breakout rookie receiver A.J. Brown, whose 13 targets in Sunday's game were four more than any Titans player had in any previous game this season. And he made the most of them.
No, the Titans' form didn't necessarily worsen this past Sunday. But the bubble did burst because they lost in a big moment that could ultimately define their season and send it in a troublingly familiar direction, perhaps a 9-7 finish for the fourth time in a row.
Barely missing the playoffs again with an identical record would be exponentially more disappointing than if they'd only won a handful of games in 2017 and 2018. If that was the case, the arrow would be pointing up, allowing everyone to feel much more positive about the immediate future.
Instead, after Sunday's defeat, the ramifications could be more of the same. The status quo hasn't been terrible, of course, but it's also unacceptable when you're always seemingly on the doorstep to more, never able to get there.
The good-to-great mantra of this past year spoke to the big-picture fear all along for the 2019 Titans: Mediocrity, which is a nasty, frustrating thing to combat for a pro sports franchise.
The Titans haven't often had that feeling of being that NFL team, the red-hot, improving squad that's delightful to watch, garnering national attention, making waves and trending upward so that suddenly anything seemed possible.
They tasted that this past month, as they were doing a lot right despite having things fall wrong Sunday.
Yes, they'll need help to make the playoffs. Yes, the next two games are tough ones against playoff-caliber opponents.
But the Titans' odds are better than you might think, especially after the Bills beat the Steelers in the Sunday nightcap.
FiveThirtyEight.com, as of Sunday night, gave the Titans a 54% chance – a coin flip, basically – to make the playoffs.
The New York Times put it at 48% (as of Monday night). And according to the Times' simulation model, which can offer different results each time, beating the Saints and Texans the next two weeks would put the percentage at around 90%, while beating only the Texans would still put the Titans' chances around 70%.
All is not lost – yet.
But the Titans can't keep letting the Texans beat them the next couple of weeks, too.

Texans recall 1998 votes on impeachment

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Twenty-one years, almost to the day, after U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin — then in his sophomore term — cast a historic vote on the impeachment of a president, on Wednesday will do it again, as will five other Congress members from Texas who also were House members in 1998.
Only this time, Doggett, now in his 13th term, will vote to impeach President Donald Trump. In 1998 he joined all Democrats in the Republican-controlled House in voting against the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.
How does it compare?
“There’s some similarities,” Doggett said. “Both lied. Clinton lied about sex. Trump lies as almost a way of life.”
But he thinks there are more differences than similarities because of the substance of the charges in each case.
“I feel it’s almost night and day,” Doggett said. Trump, he said, is doing “harm to our democracy” by inviting foreign involvement in U.S. elections, something Doggett calls “an open border policy.”
Clinton was impeached Dec. 19, 1998, for lying in testimony to a grand jury about his sexual relations with a White House intern and obstructing justice. He was
acquitted by the Senate. Trump is facing a vote on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He is all but assured of impeachment in the Democratic-controlled House and acquittal in the Republican-controlled Senate.
The other Texas members who will reprise their impeachment votes: Republicans Kevin Brady of The Woodlands, Kay Granger of Fort Worth and Mac Thornberry of Clarendon and Democrats Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston and Eddie Bernice Johnson of Dallas.
The Texans are expected to vote along party lines, the GOP members voting against impeachment and the Democrats voting in favor.
In 1998, the roles were reversed with the Republicans voting for impeachment and the Democrats backing the president.
Doggett points out that he started out being critical of Clinton, giving a speech demanding “integrity in public service.”
“I was one of the first to condemn Clinton,” Doggett told the American-Statesman. Doggett even keeps the front page clipping of the Statesman’s report from that day. But Doggett ultimately did not vote to impeach Clinton, nor did he vote in favor of an investigation, instead joining all Democrats in determining that the process was a partisan take-down — very similar to what Republicans are saying about the Trump impeachment. “I didn’t think it merited removal from office,” Doggett said.
“It was a tense atmosphere,” Doggett said of the Clinton impeachment, “but it was a different atmosphere from this.”
“The partisan divide is much stronger” now, and Republicans are in “total denial,” he said.
“Clinton did admit his wrongdoing,” Doggett said. “With Trump, his enablers cannot even say what he did was wrong because it was ‘perfect.’” Trump has described his phone call to the Ukrainian president, which is at the heart of the impeachment case, as “perfect.”
Trump asked for an investigation of political rival former Vice President Joe Biden at a time when the administration was withholding nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military assistance.
Thornberry, who is retiring next year, got blowback from Trump for saying in November on ABC's "This Week" that the phone call was “inappropriate.”
“I do not believe it was impeachable,” Thornberry added. Trump tweeted, "Republicans, don’t be led into the fools trap of saying it was not perfect, but is not impeachable.”
The vote, which is a critical step to the removal of a president, is sobering, especially for those who have already had the experience.
Jackson Lee, who was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 1998 and is still on the panel, told The New York Times how she felt after approving the two articles of impeachment in the committee on Friday.
“It sent chills through you,” she said.

Anne Hathaway on 'heartbreaking' eco-drama 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."

History repeats in Clinton, Trump impeachment dramas

Texto completo: President Bill Clinton stood at a lectern in the Rose Garden, surrounded by supporters, including his wife, first lady Hillary Clinton. The votes had been counted, and the news had arrived: He was being impeached.
"I hope there will be a constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a prompt manner," he said. "Meanwhile, I will continue to do the work of the American people."
He decried the "excessive partisanship" and "obsessive animosity" of the day. Then he turned around, shook hands, walked back into the White House, and threw a Christmas party.
In an amazing episode of "history repeats itself," the House is expected to vote to impeach President Trump on Dec. 18 — one day short of the 21st anniversary of the House voting to impeach Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998.
And it wasn't just Dec. 19 where impeachment and the holidays intertwined. Ten days earlier, at the very moment Clinton lit the National Christmas Tree, House Republicans unveiled their four articles of impeachment against the president. (Only two were passed by the House.)
It was a little bit different this time. On Dec. 5, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat from California, announced she was asking Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to proceed with articles of impeachment. It was the same day as Trump's tree lighting, but she made her speech seven hours before the event, not during. Earlier this month, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker who presided over the Clinton impeachment vote, complained on Fox News that "on the eve of Christmas, it is really sad" to see Democrats displaying such "partisanship" — seeming to forget that at Christmastime 21 years ago, he was doing the same.

Democratic debate on after parties reach labor accord
LOS ANGELES — The next Democratic presidential debate will go on as scheduled Thursday, after negotiators Tuesday reached agreement in a labor dispute that had threatened to upend the event while highlighting the influence that organized labor wields with the leading Democratic presidential candidates.
The debate, which will be held at Loyola Marymount University, had been in question since last week after the seven participating Democrats each said they would not cross a picket line, if there was one.
The dispute, between a cafeteria workers union and a food services company at Loyola Marymount, involved only about 150 workers and had drawn little notice over nine months. Yet in the heated political atmosphere surrounding the 2020 Democratic presidential contest, the impasse attracted outsized attention this month as the sixth primary debate approached.
Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez worked with the union, UNITE HERE Local 11; their employer, food services provider Sodexo; and other local officials. The two sides resumed negotiations Monday and announced a tentative agreement Tuesday morning.

Trump aide Gates is sentenced to 45 day in jail
WASHINGTON — Former deputy Trump campaign chairman Rick Gates was sentenced to 45 days in jail Tuesday despite crimes that could have put him in prison for five or six years after offering what prosecutors described as extraordinary cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.
Gates can serve the sentence on weekends, US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said. Gates, who will be on probation for three years, must pay a $20,000 fine and perform 300 hours of community service.
In sentencing Gates, Jackson said she struggled to balance his crimes with the vital "evidence about matters of grave and international importance" he offered federal prosecutors.
"Gates's information alone warranted, even demanded further investigation from the standpoint of national security, the integrity of our elections, and enforcing criminal laws," Jackson said.
A globe-trotting lobbyist who for a decade served as a right-hand man to former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, Gates, 47, pleaded guilty in February 2018 to lying to the FBI and conspiring to conceal tens of millions of dollars earned from lucrative lobbying work he and Manafort had done for Ukraine.
He went on to testify against Manafort, and two others in cases stemming from the probe into whether any American citizens conspired with Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.

President says he'll attend Davos economic event in '20
President Trump is planning to attend next year's World Economic Forum in Davos, according to four administration officials, after skipping the last such event during a partial US government shutdown.
The trip to Switzerland, a Jan. 21-24 gathering of business and political elites, will be an opportunity for Trump to tout his economic record ahead of the 2020 election.

Texto completo: Here's a theory for why our politics are so confusing these days: Neither party wants to be a majority party.
From an ideological perspective, majority parties are, by nature, weird. For instance, the long-dominant FDR coalition included a strange mix of blacks and segregationists, corrupt city machines and the reformers who hated them.
Over the several decades that followed, most major policy questions were hashed out within the Democratic Party. The Republicans factored in mostly as stalemate-breakers. So, for instance, the great intra-Democratic Party fight between liberals and Southern segregationists was only settled when Republicans sided with the civil rights bloc. Eighty percent of Republicans voted in favor of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, while fewer than 70% of Democrats did.

Samuel Lubell, a Polish-born political analyst, famously described this dynamic as the "sun and moon" system of political parties. In our "political solar system," Lubell wrote in 1951, "it is within the majority party that the issues of any particular period are fought out; while the minority party shines in reflected radiance of the heat thus generated."
The Democratic sun started its long arc of descent in 1968. In 1972, Richard Nixon managed to pick off sizable support from the white working class for a massive landslide reelection victory. Ronald Reagan's victories and the subsequent GOP capture of the House in 1994 -- after a 40-year Democratic reign -- seemed to seal the deal.
But then, as New York Times columnist David Brooks noted in 2011, "something strange happened. No party took the lead." The outcome, he wrote, is "both parties have become minority parties simultaneously. We are living in the era of two moons and no sun."
Nearly a decade later, things are even more bizarre. We may be more partisan than ever, but the partisans tend to dislike their own parties -- they just hate the other party more.
There are many reasons for this polarization, but one of them is that the most committed members of each party have a decidedly lunar mindset. Progressives and conservatives alike are convinced they are victims of the "Powers That Be." One of the main arguments that propelled Trump to the White House and sustains his GOP support today is the feeling that the right has lost every important battle of the last 40 years.
The left is hooked on the same feeling. Each side defines the Powers That Be differently, though there is some overlap when it comes to animosity toward economic "elites" (hence Fox News host Tucker Carlson's populist assaults on the free market and praise for Elizabeth Warren's economic program). Hillary Clinton was the candidate of the establishment, and even though she won the Democratic nomination, nearly all the passion in the party flows to some version of Warren's or Bernie Sanders' radical indictment of the system.
As political consultant Luke Thompson notes, minority parties tend to obsess about unity because without it they are even more powerless. This makes ideological purity a vital source of cohesion. Majority parties have both the luxury and the burden of power. To govern is to make policy choices, and choosing A over B will always disappoint the backers of B.
Writing in 2017, Thompson argued that the GOP needed to come to grips with the fact that it was the majority party and behave accordingly, stringing together disparate and often disagreeable factions. The Democrats, by betting on the "coalition of the ascendant" to get Barack Obama elected, had not realized that this coalition was good for that purpose but unreliable for a lasting political coalition.
The problem is that the ideological purity dominating both sides is a kind of righteous victimhood. The result is a Democratic Party suffused with a sense that it should be a majority party, but that it is being denied its rightful status, making denunciations of "white supremacy" and the "oligarchy" simultaneously more intense and comforting. Voter suppression is a legitimate issue, but it is not the Unified Field Theory for Democratic failures some want it to be -- nor can voter fraud be blamed for Republican failures. Meanwhile, the GOP could be a majority party, but the perceived need to be a "Trump party" prevents it from even trying. Not only are Trump's politics fueled by culture war resentment and victimology, but also his bottomless need for adulation is simply an inadequate rationale for a sun party to hold a majority together.
Both parties are weakened by decades of misguided reforms and the growth of a media industrial complex invested in telling its customers what they want to hear, making it impossible for either moon to achieve the escape velocity required to become a sun party.
As political scientists Steven Teles and Robert Saldin argue, the best way out is for new moderate political factions to organize and demand concessions for their support. But that will require a lot of work, made all the more difficult by the burden of toiling in moonlight.

Texto completo: Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders spends the week in the Golden State. Vaping sales drop off after people die. And a team with the New York Times spends three months living in an Oakland homeless encampment some compare to slums found in Pakistan and Mexico.
It's news for Tuesday.
And later, I'll talk to Desert Sun Features Editor Kristin Scharkey, who went digging for a lost ship deep in the desert.
I'm Arlene Martinez, and I write In California, a roundup of stories from newsrooms across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Sign up for M-F delivery here!
The Golden State feels the Bern
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday kicked off a Southern California tour in Coachella, where the entire City Council endorsed the candidate looking to unseat President Donald Trump. He'll spend the rest of the week here, heading to Los Angeles for the Democratic presidential debate on Thursday and to Moreno Valley on Friday for a town hall on his Green New Deal proposal. On Saturday, it's back to to Los Angeles for a rally alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y.
Hoping his proposals will resonate in the Golden State, the independent senator is punctuating his commitments to transforming the nation's healthcare, immigration and tax systems with California-specific appeals about issues like water and the wildfires that have ravaged the state.
Lessons in gender identity, O. J. 's Heisman and the measles at LAX
Boys can wear sparkles: A Ventura County school district gives elementary-age students lessons in gender identity.
O. J. Simpson's 1968 Heisman Trophy, which he won while playing at USC, is now in the collection of a Reno businessman.
Did you travel through LAX last week? You might want to do a measles check.
After people die, California vaping sales drop
After 52 people died and more than 2,400 were hospitalized with vaping-related lung illnesses, health officials warned consumers to stay away from vaping. In California, many consumers did.
Sales of legal THC-containing vapes in California’s legal market declined from around $82 million in August to $62 million in October, according to retail tracking data from BDS Analytics, which looks specifically at cannabis product sales. In response, the industry is working to make clear it wasn't the legal vapes but the contaminated, unregulated ones that pose the greatest dangers.
What else we're talking about
A opossum and her owner were stranded in Austin, Texas, for four days after being removed from a JetBlue flight headed for their California home.
A mountain lion kills three goats in Simi Valley between Thursday night and Sunday morning.
Alleged college admissions bribery scandal participant Lori Loughlin paid $500,000 to get her daughters into USC, but also asked them to do better in school, new court documents reveal.
Authorities intercepted an ultralight aircraft carrying 200 pounds of methamphetamine as it made its way into Riverside County from Mexico. Four men were charged with possession and intent to deliver meth.
Seven Democratic presidential hopefuls will go head to head during a debate Thursday after all, after party officials stepped in to settle a labor dispute that had threatened the Los Angeles forum.
3 months living in an Oakland homeless camp
It's been compared to slums found in Pakistan, Brazil and Mexico, but this homeless encampment is in Oakland. A two-person reporting team with the New York Times spent three months living there, and traveled to Mexico City to an encampment they heard was similar. But they found differences. The one in Mexico had on the whole more toilets, electricity and running water.
The editor of East Bay's homeless advocacy newspaper, Alastair Boone, counted 127 encampments in Oakland for the piece, and that didn't include the whole city.
Seeing people outside could become fairly common after the Supreme Court on Monday declined to revisit a lower court ruling that said homeless people can sleep outside if there's no suitable alternative, a blow to cities and counties that said the encampments were ripe for violence, disease and environmental hazards. Homeless proponents argued people shouldn't be punished for not having anywhere to go.
Her search for a lost ship in the desert
A phone call sent Desert Sun Features Editor Kristin Scharkey on a two-year search for a lost ship in the desert. Some say it's a Viking knarr, a merchant vessel, abandoned by Norse explorers who veered far south after navigating the Northwest Passage. Others think it's a Spanish galleon, full of black pearls, that made its way up the Gulf of California during the era of conquistadors. The quest took Scharkey longer than she intended, to places she hadn't imagined going. You can read the subscribers-only story here. And here's our Q&A:
We often get calls about intriguing stories. What drew you to follow this particular one?
After that phone call, I started poking around John Grasson’s website lostshipofthedesert. com. I got lost in the tales, the yarn he’d been unraveling for more than a decade. John catalogs references to the ship in books, newspapers and the like – I couldn’t believe the sheer number. I wanted to know more about how this paradox could be so persistent.
When did you realize, there is actually something here.
When John and I first met for breakfast, I was struck by his obsession. This is a man who considers the ship to be “the main focus” of his life. At that point, the story didn’t hinge on whether a ship could actually be found. For me, it became more about the believers in pursuit of its mystery.
Tell me a little about the research behind this project.
I started by reading everything I could about the ship – borrowing books from John, digging through newspaper archives. This inevitably led me to numerous studies about the desert’s geological history, to learn how a ship could have actually sailed in. As I continued to unravel various theories about the type of ship and its possible location, the “X in the sand” kept sliding farther south. This led me to Baja and another set of books and studies – this time about the Cucapá, the Colorado River delta’s indigenous inhabitants.
How did you end up in Mexico?
Theories swirl about the possibility of a ship in Laguna Salada, a dry lakebed just north of the Gulf of California. The first time I called a local farmer, Arturo Guerrero Cortés, it was actually to find out more about the region. As it turned out, he remembered seeing the wreckage of an odd-looking ship – and knew others who did, too. Photojournalist Omar Ornelas and I made several trips across the border to spend time with Arturo and a 62-year-old Cucapá auto mechanic, Jesús Antonio Muñoz, to listen to their memories.
It seemed your perspective on things changed as this project went along. What about this journey did that?
I don’t think it changed as much as it evolved. Oral tradition shapes this legend differently, depending on where – and who – you are. Initially, I found myself exposed to only one side of that story – the treasure hunters, the romantic mystique. Once we crossed the border, the legend became rooted in the difference between exploration and conquest, as I learned about it from indigenous Mexican men. The “lost ship of the desert” took me on a journey – one that ended in lament.
Why lament?
Because, as a white woman, I was confronted with the reality that my first interaction with the legend was that of adventure. I realized I’d only been learning about it from people who looked like me – and spoke the same language as me. I’m grateful to Omar, a bilingual Mexican man who has covered the U. S. -Mexico border for nearly two decades, for working on this project. As soon as he joined the team, we were able to conduct interviews in both English and Spanish. During that first conversation with Arturo and Jesús, the legend immediately shifted: It’s equally a reminder that settlement in this region came at a colonial cost. Lament came as I encountered the real-time repercussions of that legacy – and as I continue to wrestle with my place in it.
So, you’re the expert now. Is there a ship beneath the desert?
There’s certainly treasure all around, if you’re willing to look – and listen.

A smoke-and-mirrors trade deal

Texto completo: Ever since President Trump launched a trade war with China in March 2018, I have been hearing foreign policy elites say: 'Trump is a terrible president. But he's right about China, and I'm glad he's doing something about it.' Indeed, the trade war has been one of the few Trump policies that has won support from many Democrats. I have been much more skeptical, because I did not think Trump was focusing on the right issues or using the right approach. The paltry 'phase one' deal announced last week suggests that my skepticism was justified.
When we talk about the problem with China, we are really talking about at least three discrete sets of issues. First are concerns about industrial espionage, trade barriers and other bad behavior that arguably fuel China's economic rise at the United States' expense. Second are concerns that China will use its growing military might to dominate East Asia and to project power around the world, displacing the United States as a global superpower. Third are human rights violations that are an affront to American values: China's brutal repression of the Uighurs, its Orwellian surveillance state and the threat of a crackdown on Hong Kong.
Trump wasn't really focused on any of these concerns. His obsession is the U.S.-trade deficit with China, even though any reputable economist (a designation that excludes Trump trade guru Peter Navarro) would tell you that trade deficits don't really matter. Ironically, the U.S. trade deficit spiked during Trump's trade war.
Some of Trump's trade advisers have more ambitious goals. They want to eliminate unfair trade practices such as forcing the transfer of intellectual property from U.S. firms in China " even though former treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers argues that 'it cannot be argued seriously that unfair Chinese trade practices have affected U.S.-growth by even 0.1 percent a year.' More broadly, the China hawks want to derail the Made in China 2025 plan to compete with the United States in high-tech manufacturing sectors such as semiconductors, aerospace and electrical vehicles.
The details of the trade deal haven't been released, but there is no reason to think it will achieve any of these goals. U.S. Trade Representative Robert E.-Lighthizer claims that 'China made specific commitments on intellectual property, including counterfeiting, patent and trademark issues and pharmaceutical rights,' the Wall Street Journal reported. Maybe so, but China has made such commitments in the past without fully honoring them. The really difficult issues, such as opening up China to U.S.-firms, have been postponed until a second round of negotiations that few expect to go anywhere.
Trump has already rolled back some existing tariffs and canceled planned tariffs. He is maintaining tariffs on $370-billion of Chinese goods, but if a higher level of tariffs couldn't force fundamental concessions, how would a lower level do so? Indeed, the trade war, by spurring China to develop homegrown supply chains for high-tech products, may make Beijing more resistant to U.S. pressure in the future.
The administration's big boast is that this deal will lead to a $200 billion increase in U.S. exports to China over two years. (In 2018, U.S. exports to China totaled $179.3 billion.) But Chinese officials have not confirmed any such commitment, and trade experts are skeptical.
Lighthizer claims China will buy $40-billion to $50 billion in U.S. agricultural products annually " more than double the level in 2017 ($19.6 billion). Joe Glauber, a former chief economist at the Agriculture Department, notes that Chinese soybean imports are down 10-percent from 2017 levels " and soybeans account for nearly two-thirds of U.S. farm exports to China. He concludes that 'it will be very hard' to get to $40 billion, much less $50 billion. Are you surprised? This would not be the first time Trump has promised that China would make massive purchases of U.S. agricultural goods that never materialized.
While the benefits of the trade war are speculative, its costs are real: The Tax Foundation estimates that Trump's tariffs have cost Americans more than $88-billion so far, making this one of the biggest tax hikes in history. To cushion the blow, the administration gave $28-billion to farmers " twice the cost of the 2009 auto industry bailout.
Waging a trade war is like hitting your head against a wall " it feels good when you stop. But most trade experts agree with my Council on Foreign Relations colleague Edward Alden when he says: 'It's hard to see this China deal as the vindication of the president's tactics. It's a pretty small deal, coming at a pretty high cost.'
Indeed, the New York Times reports that Chinese hard-liners are 'jubilant and even incredulous' that they have gotten such a good deal. They have good cause to cheer because the real issues with China " from trade barriers to militarism in the South China Sea to human rights violations " remain unaddressed. Trump would rather trumpet 'our GREAT new deal with China' than take serious action to address the real challenges from China.

Texto completo: Nearly all of Rep. Jeff Van Drew's Washington staff resigned over the weekend as both Democrats and Republicans criticized the moderate New Jersey Democrat's apparent decision to switch parties just as the House prepares to undertake its historic vote on articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Van Drew, who hails from a conservative district that for 24 years before his election was represented by a Republican, is one of only two Democrats who voted against rules laying out the impeachment process.
"Sadly, Congressman Van Drew's decision to join the ranks of Republican Party led by Donald Trump does not align with the values we brought to this job when we joined his office," according to a letter from the five staff members, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times.
NBC News reported that a sixth staffer had also resigned. A seventh person also resigned, according to a person familiar with the situation in Van Drew's office, leaving his chief of staff as the sole remaining staff member in his Washington office.
Van Drew's decision drew bipartisan condemnations and is certain to become a dominant issue when he runs for reelection next year.
A Republican running for his seat called him a weasel who was not to be trusted. A Democratic foe labeled him a traitor. The governor of New Jersey said he lacked the courage to protect the Constitution.
"This is the end of his career," said David Richter, a Republican businessman who has been campaigning for Van Drew's seat in Congress since August and referred to him Sunday as a "weasel."
"If I have to put $1 million of my own money into this race, to win, I'm prepared to doit."
Van Drew did not return calls. But the freshman congressman who is up for reelection next year has told aides he is preparing to switch parties as soon as this week.
In an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News several weeks ago, Van Drew said that Trump would likely survive an impeachment process given Republican control of the Senate and that voters, not Congress, should decide Trump's fate.
"At ihe end of the day, I'm afraid all we're going to have is a failed impeachment," he said, adding: "The bottom line is he's still going to be the pres .dent of the United States, and the bottom line is he is still going to be the candidale of the Republican Party. So why don't we let the people do the impeachment oy voting in the electoral process the way that we usually do."
Richter, 53, said he had been told by Republican leadeis :n the that crosses Cape May, Cumberland and Atlantic counties in southern New Jersey that Trump was expected to endorse Van Drew. Still, he said he had no plans to step aside to clear an easy path to the Republican nomination for Van Drew.
'Tır in this thing all the way through," said Richter, a former chief executive of a publicly traded construction management firm, Hill International, who personally contributed $300,000 of the $413,000 his campaign raised during the first quarter.
"I've talked to a lot of Republicans," he said. "Nobody is happy about the switch."
Richter added that any support that Trump offered Van Drew, in exchange for the distraction a high-profile Democratic defection could offer in a week when the president faces impeachment, would quickly fade once Trump had "gotten what he wanted."
The state Republican chairman, Doug Steinhardt, could not be reached for comment. Mike Testa Jr., a Republican who was elected in November to Van Drew's former state Senate seat and who is a chairman of Trump's reelection effort in New Jersey, did not return calls.
The staff members who resigned include Van Drew's communications director, director of constituency relations and legislative director.
The resignation of the five staff members was reported by Politico.
In addition to Richter, Van Drew could face two other already-announced opponents, Brian Fitzherbert and Bob Patterson, if he pursues the Republican nomination.
"He's doing what he's done for nearly 30 years," Fitzherbert said of Van Drew. "Political survivorship. It's desperation."
Democrats were equally unsparing in their criticism.
"I think he's a traitor," said Brigid Harrison, a professor of political science at Montclair State University who had been taking steps toward challenging Van Drew as a Democrat in a primary. "I think it is something that is emblematic of the cynicism of our country."
Harrison said Sunday that an announcement about her candidacy was imminent. Well before word of the congressman's apparent plans became public, she said, she had met with Democratic county leaders in the district, who had declined to sign a letter backing Van Drew for reelection and had criticized his anti-impeachment stance.
The state's Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, vowed retribution as the national Democratic Party offered jobs to the members of Van Drew's congressional staff who had quit "to stand up for their Democratic values."
"Jeff Van Drew's decision to switch parties is a betrayal to every voter who supported him in 2018," Sweeney said in a statement. "But now he is out of the Democratic Party and in November, we are going to take him out of Congress."
Gov. Philip Murphy, speaking on CNN, predicted that Van Drew would be defeated.
"He's putting politics over the Constitution," Murphy said. "I think it's ridiculous."
If Harrison, who lives in Longport in Van Drew's district, wins the support of established Democratic Party leaders in the district, she may face a primary challenge of her own.
The left-leaning Working Families Alliance issued a statement late Saturday laying blame for the debacle on George Norcross III, a Democratic power broker who is a member of the Democratic National Committee and who had supported Van Drew's political climb from mayor to state senator to congressman.
"This is a direct result of the South Jersey Democratic machine's power - a machine that engineered Van Drew's rise knowing his values were out of step with the party," said Sue Altman, director of the alliance, an affiliate of the national Working Families Party.
On Sunday, she said she anticipated insurgent Democratic challengers.
"I think there's still some very qualified candidates who are going to emerge," Altman said. "I would imagine there's a real thirst for an anti-machine candidate."

Texto completo: Plan now for light rail
Manfred Rose is correct in agreeing with Wes Cortright, that planning for the next Interstate 5 Bridge should include the structural integrity to accommodate light rail (“Prudently plan for light rail,” Our Readers' Views, Dec. 9).
This type of forward thinking was included in the construction of the I-205 Bridge back in 1977 when Clark County commissioners insisted that the bridge be built to accommodate light rail, which it does. As was said, we may not want that now, but for future generations think ahead; one day there could be a light rail link all around the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Herrera Beutler sees clearly
Friday's statement marks Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler's first substantive comment on the impeachment hearings since Oct. 31, when she voted against opening the inquiry and called it “a farce.”
I am glad that Herrera Beutler can recognize a farce when she sees one. Congresswoman, I can, too.
Robert Freeman
Battle Ground
3rd District deserves better
In the Dec. 13 New York Times, a poll of all representatives in the U.S. House reported that Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, planned to vote “No” on the articles of impeachment of Donald Trump. Her reported rationale was, “The president's motives for his actions remain unproven.”
Let's be perfectly clear about something. The perpetrator's motive has nothing to do with whether a crime was committed.
By the “transcript” issued by the White House, the words of the acting chief of staff and other firsthand reports, we know for a fact that Trump attempted to leverage his office for personal, political benefit.
He sought to have a foreign government interfere in American elections to advantage himself. This is the definition of a high crime under the Constitution.
If a driver commits a fatal hit-and-run, leaving the scene of the accident, the driver's motive doesn't matter; the crime is fleeing the scene.
The 3rd Congressional District deserves a more intelligent and critical thinker as a representative in Congress than the feckless Jaime Herrera Beutler.

Web readers sound off
On “Clark County prosecutor calls for changes to law on domestic violence defendants”:
Our Judicial System has become nothing more than a well-oiled bureaucratic machine. The same system that we left and fought for independence from England for.
In no way are any or most of the facts known when initially facing the bench. It is a “get them in and get them out” assembly line by people who deal with the same thing day in and day out. They are apathetic to facts, they have heard it all and already have the plan in motion to keep it moving smoothly before any of them even hear from anybody personally involved.
That would take emotion. That would take a true desire to do what is best for the people involved. That has become in no way the concern. There is nothing that happens in this process that treats any one person as an individual. It would clog the cogs.
— Gayle Zimmerman
The system failed Tiffany Hill and her kids for sure. Such a sad outcome.
— Brandy Hess
Regarding what the judge said about not knowing if someone is violating a no-contact order if they want to reconcile or murder:
1. It. Doesn't. Matter. Why. Last I heard, violating the law was violating the law.
2. If you can see that the defendant also tried to buy a gun, why is the judge so stupid that he doesn't conclude that “Gee, maybe he's trying to kill her?”
— Tami Brewster
How about the judge making better decisions when prosecution was begging for higher bail or GPS monitoring? The judge's explanation was pathetic
— Peter Kim
It's sad that it takes a victim to have law enforcement and prosecutors to have a wake up call. Come on Americans, we can do better than this. It's time that us Americans wake up and start holding our senators, representatives, law enforcement, mayors, and any other judicial representatives accountable.
— Sandra Schnell
Here's an idea: Don't just take what prosecutors and judges say went wrong into account and how to change it. Why not ask the victims and survivors of domestic violence how the system worked and how it failed or lacked and go from there to make real changes?
— Patricia Reams
An ankle monitor is just a free iPhone watch.
— Noah Ortega
On “New Seasons Market sold to South Korean ownership group”:
What a pity. We need to have laws stopping foreign entities from buying our bridges, highways and businesses. It is going to hurt us big time in future days, because foreigners will have a lot of control over where we go and what comes to us.
— Tamara Kinman
The idea of New Seasons being a community partner in education, farm to table food, and supporting local charities and neighbors is how I remember the first Whole Foods when I lived in Austin. It would make for a great study on where they both diverted from their original intent.
— Laura L. Albright
Whole Foods leaves, Fred Meyer goes on strike and now this. All the feel-good stores are no longer feeling so great to shop at. Disappointed for sure.
— Erica Jordan
Not to get political, because I don't understand half of it, but isn't this exactly what Trump said wouldn't happen?
— Melissa Goldsbury Tauialo
The entity currently owns successful similarly sized and successful high-end grocers: Metropolitan Markets in Seattle, Bristol Farms and Lazy Acres in Southern California. I don't expect any changes; sharing “best practices” at the most.
— Frank Hood
I'm really angry. I love this store and support it because it's local. I don't support foreign

China Protests U.S. Expulsion of Envoys Accused of Spying

Texto completo: The diplomats were expelled after they drove onto a base that houses the headquarters of the Navy's SEAL Team 6. China's denial of the accusations is the first official acknowledgment of the episode.
WASHINGTON -- The Chinese government denounced on Monday the United States' secret expulsion this fall of two Chinese diplomats suspected of espionage, and asked for a reversal of the action. The expulsions appeared to be the first of Chinese diplomats suspected of spying in more than three decades.
The two men were detained with their wives after the group drove through the outer perimeter of a sensitive military base in Virginia -- the one that houses a fenced-off inner compound with the headquarters of the Navy's elite commando unit, SEAL Team 6, according to two people briefed on the episode.
The statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, made at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing, was the first official acknowledgment by either side of the expulsions, which were reported by The New York Times on Sunday. Neither Washington nor Beijing made an announcement at the time of the expulsions, and the State Department still has not publicly acknowledged them.
The two Chinese Embassy employees from Washington drove in late September without permission onto the base, the Dam Neck Annex of Naval Air Station Oceana, five miles south of downtown Virginia Beach. The men and their wives ignored a guard's order to turn around just inside an entry checkpoint and depart. They did not stop until fire trucks drove onto a road to block their path, according to people briefed on the intrusion.
American officials believed at least one of the men was an intelligence officer with diplomatic cover, the people said.
"The U.S. accusation on our officials is completely inconsistent with the truth," Geng Shuang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman and former employee of the embassy in Washington, said when asked in Beijing about The Times article. "We urge the U.S. to correct its mistake, withdraw this decision and protect Chinese diplomats' legitimate rights and interests according to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations."
He added, "We'd like to remind the U.S. that it is a reciprocal process for countries to grant work-related convenience and guarantee to foreign diplomats following the Vienna Convention."
The State Department did not reply to a request for comment on Monday. Last week, it declined to answer questions about the expulsions and base intrusion.
A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland, said the Defense Department had no information to provide about the episode. "We take the security of all our installations very seriously," he said.
The last known expulsion of Chinese diplomats suspected of espionage took place in 1987. That occurred after a nearly yearlong operation in which the F.B.I. caught one of the two diplomats trying to accept what the diplomat believed to be classified National Security Agency documents at a restaurant in the capital's Chinatown area from a person who was secretly working for the F.B.I. It was the first time the United States had expelled any Chinese diplomat since normalization of relations between the two nations in 1979.
After The Times story was published Sunday, some Chinese Embassy officials continued to insist in private that their colleagues who drove onto the base had made an innocent mistake. Earlier, Chinese diplomats had told associates that the embassy employees had been on a sightseeing trip.
One associate of the embassy said some Chinese officials were still asserting that the State Department had expelled the diplomats to retaliate for a propaganda campaign that Beijing had run in August against Julie Eadeh, a political officer in the American Consulate in Hong Kong. Chinese state-run news organizations accused Ms. Eadeh of being a "black hand" behind the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, and someone posted personal details of her online. That infuriated senior State Department officials, and the agency spokeswoman called the Chinese government a "thuggish regime."
Chinese diplomats asked the State Department whether it was carrying out the expulsions because of what happened to Ms. Eadeh, according to people with knowledge of the discussion.
The episode at the base intensified concerns within the Trump administration that Chinese intelligence agencies are expanding espionage efforts in the United States, whether through hacking, human intelligence gathering or other methods. American intelligence officials say they regard China as the greatest spying threat, in the same way that the Soviet Union was during the Cold War.
American officials said they were alarmed by several recent episodes in which Chinese diplomats have turned up unannounced or uninvited at research or government centers. On Oct. 16, just weeks after the base intrusion, the State Department announced it had imposed a new rule on diplomats working at Chinese Missions in the United States or its territories: The diplomats must give notice to the State Department before meeting with local officials or making visits to research or educational institutions.
A State Department official said at the time that the rule was a reciprocal action intended to push back against the Chinese government for restrictions it had imposed for years on travel by American diplomats. Such a rule had been under discussion for a while, but episodes like the one at the Virginia base accelerated the rollout of the rule, American officials said last week.

Outside shots: What a rez team is built on

Texto completo: In August, Netflix released 'Basketball or Nothing,' a gem of a series about a high school team in Chinle, a dusty pocket of the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona. The show ticks plenty of binge-watching boxes: an eye-catching setting, nail-biting moments on the court and compulsively watchable characters " particularly Raul Mendoza, the team's grumpy-yet-avuncular coach.
The show does have a flaw, though, and it's embedded in the title: The series suggests that the kids vying for a state title will have their lives entirely foreclosed upon them if they can't find a way to escape the reservation and get a college degree. 'There's really nothing going on in Chinle,' are the first words uttered in the series. Water is scarce, we are constantly reminded; unemployment and addiction are abundant.

It's not an incorrect assessment, but it is a narrow one. So it's worth watching the series in tandem with Michael Powell's engrossing, more expansive book, 'Canyon Dreams,' which covers the same team during the same 2017-18 season and clarifies its story. For the players at Chinle High School, the rez and the rest of the world aren't binaries in opposition. They're connected worlds that they're compelled to navigate as skillfully as they do the hardwood courts.

Basketball, Powell writes, is a 'harmonizing force in this immense land,' an essential part of day-to-day culture in Chinle. That means long lines at the ticket window on game days (some people hitchhike to out-of-town matches) and lots of people tuning their radios for game broadcasts throughout the Navajo Nation, which stretches across northern Arizona and New Mexico. But it also means Mendoza is treated as a standard-bearer for an entire community. Family members give him an earful about respect every time he benches their kid. 'In past seasons with different teams, witches had cast spells at him, and warlocks had conspired, and angry relatives had loosened the lug nuts on his tires,' Powell writes.
Powell, a former Washington Post reporter and now a New York Times sports columnist, lived in the Navajo Nation briefly a quarter century ago. He writes with a clear affection for the place, and as much respect and understanding of Navajo culture as an outsider can muster.
His position may explain why the central figure in his narrative is Mendoza, who is an outsider himself. Part Mexican and part Tohono O'odham (a southern Arizona tribe), Mendoza was hired by Chinle less for his precise cultural fit than because he has a state-title ring and a history as a counselor who keeps kids on track. Unemployment in the Navajo Nation is 45 percent, fewer than half of Chinle High School graduates go to college, and nearly every player on the team has a story about a broken home to share. 'Do you know what I'm proudest of in this life?' Mendoza tells Powell. 'Not a single one of those teenagers I counseled committed suicide. They lived, every single one of them.'

But Powell also widens his range to encompass the history and culture of the region. In Albuquerque, he catches up with a former Chinle player who's trying to make a life for himself after an injury, uncertain about life off the rez. Watching an English class at the high school, he notes how the Anglo teacher has to be attuned to cultural differences. (Likening a character to a snake? 'A snake was a powerful creature in touch with the spirit world and to talk of one was to risk that your hands and heart could swell dangerously.') Resident activists have made years-long, contentious efforts to foil exploitative developers, as 'the desire for jobs in a land with crushing unemployment collided with the urgency of preserving a sacred heritage.'
What mainly defines the culture in Chinle, in Powell's eyes, is a resilience that he's careful not to sentimentalize. For the most part, the kids here are just kids: They chase girls, party, half-listen to Mendoza's pleas to buckle down on defense. They are concerned about their futures but also blithely adaptive. One student with Ivy League ambitions, lacking a laptop and reliable electricity, writes English papers on his phone.
The games, for Powell and Chinle alike, are at once an escape hatch and a glue for the community. And the mood lifts whenever Powell covers a game day. Chinle High's boys tend to be shorter than their competitors, especially when they leave the Navajo Nation and play against mostly white teams around Phoenix. But life at a high-desert elevation has given them the endurance to compete, and once Mendoza's hectoring sinks in, the book becomes a gripping, propulsive story about a playoff run.
The basketball and cultural stories aren't parallel but braided, the problems woven around possibility. As a teacher tells Powell, 'You never have to worry here about waking up in the morning and asking yourself, 'What am I doing here? What is my purpose?' '

Texto completo: The thought first occurred to me five weeks ago, while watching the Oakland Raiders’ pass rush treat Philip Rivers like one of those inflatable pop-up dolls – you know, you keep knocking it down, and it keeps bouncing right back up – on the field at whatever they’re calling the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum these days.
It continued to nag at me during all of these weeks the Chargers have been on the road. It kept coming to mind Sunday, when they returned home to play before what would be conservatively estimated as 70 percent Minnesota Vikings fans, at the same time the Raiders were making their own melancholy farewell appearance in Oakland.
Today then, a few days before the Raiders and a chunk of their immense SoCal fan base play the Chargers in Carson, it’s time for some alternate history.
What would have happened, at that fateful NFL league meeting in January 2016 when Stan Kroenke’s fellow owners approved the Rams’ move to L.A. and his Inglewood stadium project, if those owners had given the Raiders the first option to become Kroenke’s tenant, rather than the Chargers?
We start this musing with an opinion that I’d maintained throughout the two decades of the league’s absence from L.A., when the city was no more than a stalking horse for other owners seeking stadium deals in their own cities: If and when a team finally set up shop here, it would have to deal with that huge segment of fans who refused to abandon the Silver and Black even after Al Davis moved the Raiders back to their ancestral home in 1995.
Those are the people you’ve seen in the Southwest Airlines terminals of area airports on Saturdays (or Sunday mornings) of Raiders home game weekends the last 25 seasons, flying up to the games and flying back afterward. Some are clad in their Black Hole costumes, and I’m guessing TSA employees have to remind themselves: These aren’t security risks, these are Raider fans.
(Feel free to insert your own one-liner here.)
Their commutes will be shorter beginning next season when the Raiders move into the $2 billion Allegiant Stadium near the Las Vegas strip.
But stay with me here: What if the Raiders had wound up in L.A. … and the Chargers had wound up in Vegas, a virgin territory with no previous NFL allegiances beyond monetary ones? It’s not that far-fetched.
From the Raiders’ standpoint, I’m guessing they would have found an immediate home somewhere in SoCal. Probably not the Coliseum, likely not the Rose Bowl, but possibly Dodger or Angel Stadium as a short-term abode. They would have had no trouble filling it with their own loyal (and eccentrically costumed) fans, while the Rams would still have been able to rebuild their SoCal fan base in much the same manner they have. There would be less snark about L.A. as an NFL town, and when the Inglewood stadium was ready the new occupants would be on relatively equal footing.
(You think the Raiders aren’t still strong here? There are still Raider Image stores at Universal Citywalk and in Moreno Valley, and the team’s fan club directory lists nine different booster clubs in SoCal, from Fillmore to Hesperia and including two in San Diego.)
But what of the Chargers?
Before I continue, I am fully aware that this column will likely draw a call or a text from the Chargers’ sharp vice president of public relations, Josh Rupprecht, asking what his franchise did to deserve this, and is it really a bad thing that the Chargers are here? We realize this is considered a long-term project to build a fan base. But three years in, you have to wonder if this market – the most diverse, and fickle, in North America – just might be too tough to crack.
Certainly, people in the NFL offices in New York are noticing. And the reports of friction between the Chargers and Rams involving the new stadium, now a $5 billion (and rising) project, don’t help the optics.
The Las Vegas component will not thrill our friends in San Diego, but consider the history of these moves.
When Mark Davis and the Raiders romanced Las Vegas early in 2016, no more than a couple of weeks after (a) their joint project with the Chargers on a new Carson stadium was shot down and (b) the Chargers got the first option to join Kroenke’s project with a year to exercise it, the man who arranged the Raiders-Vegas talks was Mark Fabiani. That is the same Fabiani who is still listed in the Chargers’ organizational chart as a special counsel to controlling owner Dean Spanos, and the same Fabiani who was in charge of the team’s stadium quest in San Diego.
Also, in many eyes – including these two – it’s the same Fabiani who torpedoed any chance of cooperation between Spanos’ organization and the politicians of San Diego with an uncompromising, hardball negotiating style that ultimately led to a total breakdown of relationships with city officials and the fans themselves. The moment the Chargers began openly seeking other alternatives was the moment the San Diego public began to turn away from Spanos and his team.
Fabiani later signed on as an advisor to Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, and it was through that relationship that Mark Davis was introduced to Adelson and the wheels began to turn toward the Raiders’ move to Nevada.
So, in our alternate history, it is entirely reasonable that having been shut out of L.A., Spanos turns his attention north on I-15, with Fabiani smoothing the way for the Chargers in the same way he made things happen for the Raiders.
Those bridge years might still have been spent in San Diego, and it’s possible the composition of crowds in that city would resemble what they are now in Carson. But Las Vegas would ultimately have been a far more hospitable destination for the Chargers, as a one-team town hungry for football. Spanos would have been a hero, rather than an interloper (as he’s considered by many in L.A.) or villain (in San Diego).
Plus it’s a lot closer than London, where reports earlier this season had the Chargers ultimately landing followed by Spanos’ vehement denial.
Instead, back in the real world, this is what we have: Minnesota Vikings fans dominating Dignity Health Sports Park this past Sunday, just like Green Bay Packers fans before them, and Pittsburgh Steelers fans, Denver Broncos fans, Houston Texans fans and Indianapolis Colts fans before that in 2019. It has to be discouraging for players and coaches who never get to play before a true home crowd.
The move to the bigger SoFi Stadium will not be a panacea – it’s more seats available for opposition fans, if anything – and while there will be an attempt to put the teams on equal footing in the shared stadium, it will be hard to forget that Kroenke is the owner and Spanos is the renter.
Meanwhile, SoCal Raiders fans will continue to flock to LAX, Burbank, Ontario, Long Beach and John Wayne airports to catch flights for their favorite team’s home games, or else will make the drive up I-15. As colleague Mark Whicker once observed, it’ll be like eight more championship fights a year in ‘Vegas.
An example: The New York Times quoted Ruben Maya, a law enforcement officer from Riverside who paid $12,000 for two personal seat licenses and $3,000 for 2020 season tickets for Raiders games in Vegas: “I live a six-hour drive from Oakland, but it’s only a 3-1/2 hour drive to Las Vegas. I’m going to come to every home game the first season.”
And, as has been the case for years, the Raiders’ ninth home game will come on the Chargers’ home field. There will be a preview Sunday afternoon.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "I Give Thanks for the Matriarchs" (Op-Ed, Nov. 25):
I read Margaret Renkl's essay with a flash of recognition. I, too, wear several wedding rings that belonged to the women who raised me.
When I married, I asked my aunt to send me my grandmother's ring to use as my own. I felt that it would have more meaning to me than any new ring could possibly have. But my aunt couldn't comply; my practical grandmother had pawned the ring to pay for her daughter's first year of college.
Instead, she sent the ring that my great-grandmother had used a hundred years (to the month) before my own wedding. As the years have passed and as their owners have died, I have added my mother's and my aunt's wedding rings, and a signet ring that belonged to my godmother.
I never remove my rings; my hands feel naked without them. They are powerful reminders of the strength and spirit of the women who passed them on to me, and I hope that I can pass them on in turn.

In sports, losing can be a victory

Texto completo: I hope they lose.
Oh, not every game. Not even most of them. But as my wife and I prepare for another season of coaching grade-school basketball — this year it's fifth grade — I hope our boys lose. Occasionally.
That probably sounds unusual coming from a coach. It probably sounds unusual coming from anybody in any endeavor in our society, when a promise that we “are going to be so sick and tired of winning” is regarded as virtue.
Be it sports or business or politics, it seems the emphasis on winning has increased since my childhood. We live, after all, in an era when “Second place is first loser” and “Nobody remembers who finished second” are considered T-shirt-worthy mantras.
Why, a quick Google search of “sports slogans” comes up with purported gems such as “Winning is a habit, success is a choice” and “Practice winning every day” and “Dedication + Motivation = Success.” Not that there is anything wrong with those. It's just that, when it comes to fifth-grade basketball, I prefer, “Success is a journey, not a destination.”
We're talking about 10-year-olds, after all, and there is something inherently self-defeating about measuring yourself in wins and losses at a young age. As Winston Churchill once said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts.”
Well, Churchill gets credit for saying it; according to QuoteInvestigator.com, he never made the remark. But regardless of who came up with them, the words should be embraced. There is value in losing, and there are lessons that cannot be learned from winning all the time.
Losing once in a while in sports — instead of something that truly matters — can be particularly valuable. Failure leads to self-reflection and self-motivation while providing the roadmap to eventual success.
As a recovering sports editor (and the husband of a coach), I can attest that many people have little understanding of that fact. I have seen far too many parents choose a high school for their children because of its athletic program; or try to get a high school coach fired; or demand media coverage because “they're trying to earn a scholarship.” All of which tend to bastardize the inherent value of sports.
Oh, it's not that this mentality is limited to athletics. We all know that parent who will email the teacher to complain about their 9-year-old's grade on a test; and if you don't know them, you are them. Don't be like that.
But when it comes to sports, the lessons can be particularly impactful. Athletics are inherently competitive and provide resolution at the end of the day — the scoreboard tells you who scored more points, and then you go out for ice cream. Winning is more fun; but losing can be more instructive.
That is what I hope our fifth graders learn this season. Well, that and the fact that merely showing up does not warrant a trophy — another lesson that seems lost these days. As author Ashley Merryman wrote for The New York Times a while back: “The science is clear. Awards can be powerful motivators, but nonstop recognition does not inspire children to succeed. Instead, it can cause them to underachieve.”
Yet one of the more depressing traits of youth sports is that everybody gets a trophy or a medal for participating. Years later, they enter the real world and are surprised to learn it doesn't work that way. I have been in journalism for 30 years, and not once has my editor given me a trophy for showing up at work.
All of which brings us to the point of coaching fifth-grade basketball: Winning is not defined by the scoreboard. Sometimes, I am guessing, we will play teams more talented than we are. But if we play well and improve, that is a victory. If we meet a lesser team and win despite playing poorly, that is not something to celebrate. The point of practice or games is to get a little better than you were the day before and to learn something about yourself.
And sometimes, losing provides the best p

Room to glow; Kusama exhibit begins 5-month run at Toledo Museum

Texto completo: Northwest Ohio residents have a chance over the next five months to see an art installation by Yayoi Kusama, a wildly popular contemporary artist who entered her ninth decade of life at the forefront of an art-relevant, social media-driven, visual world.

Yayoi Kusama: Fireflies on the Water, an interactive and immersive art installation and one of almost two dozen infinity mirror rooms by the prolific creator, opened Saturday in the Toledo Museum of Art's Canaday gallery.

"It's a unique opportunity for Toledoans to see one of Kusama's infinity mirror rooms. These have been incredibly popular and have traveled around the country, and I think it's a great opportunity for people to finally see one without traveling," said Lauren Applebaum, Brian P. Kennedy Leadership Fellow, of the show's installation.

Film: The museum will screen the documentary film Kusama: Infinity (2018), at 7 p.m., Jan. 10, in the Little Theater. Tickets are $5 for museum members, $7 for nonmembers, and $4 for students and military.

Kusama, 90, whose installations in 2020 will also make their way to places like New York City, Boston, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh for planned exhibitions, continues to offer artwork to the world from her studio in Japan. She was commissioned this year by Blue Sky Gallery to design a float for the Macy's Day Parade in New York. Love Flies Up to the Sky was covered in 300 of the artist's signature polka dots and required 20 people to maneuver it through the streets.

The installations, which play off her study of infinite space through light and repetition and are a culmination of hallucinations that started in childhood, are so popular that most places either require advance ticket purchases or result in inevitable wait times. Toledo, also an event selling tickets in advance, is no exception.

The New York Times reported a minimum two-hour wait to view one of Kusama's infinity mirrored rooms that opened there last month in the David Zwirner Gallery in Chelsea.

During an installation of her work at the Cleveland Museum of Art in 2018, more than 120,000 visitors from all 50 states and 23 countries showed up at the institution to view a traveling exhibition of Kusama's work, an event that the museum reported gave them the highest summer attendance in history at 305,692 visitors.

Kusama has been creating for more than seven decades, but experienced a slow surge to respect and recognition in the art world.

Toledo's piece

Toledo's installation is a loan from the Whitney Museum of American Art. Fireflies, created in 2002 by Kusama, is a full-room experience that uses mirrors, plexiglass, lights, and water to create the illusion of endless expanse. It was first shown as a new installation at a major retrospective of her work at the Whitney in 2012.

Each ticket holder will enter the room alone, closing the door behind them and stepping onto a bridge that extends over a pool of water that fills the bottom half of the room, which in reality is 12-by-12-by-9 feet. The 150 tiny LED lights that hang from the ceiling are reflected not only in the mirrors, but also in the water below, both creating the effect of infinity, Applebaum said.

I think each experience will be different and viewers have the ability to experience it in solitude, on their own, for 60 seconds, she said. It's very immersive and kaleidoscopic and dazzling. It's a unique experience, and we have never really had a work like this.

Those interested in entering the installation can buy tickets online or by phone, which are being sold in 15-minute time slots every Monday for that week, through the remainder of the show.

Of the 38,000 tickets available, 7,000 were snatched up during presales, according to museum spokesman Stephanie Elton.

The days with the most availability currently, are weekdays, especially Wednesdays, she said. The first two weekends of the show - this weekend and Dec. 21-22 - are sold out.

Kusama

Yayoi Kusama was born in Matsumoto, Japan, on March 22, 1929, into a family of seed farmers. Her parents were both abusive and strict, and she was discouraged from pursuing art, an obstacle she ostensibly ignored. She was fascinated with the use of polka dots, and created drawings, watercolors, pastels and oils, some which she sent to renowned artist Georgia O'Keeffe for advice when she was young.

When she moved to New York in the 1950s, she garnered national attention when she staged impromptu live performances to protest the Vietnam War that involved nude individuals painted in large, brightly colored polka dots. She is famous for writing in a letter to President Richard Nixon that anatomic explosions are better than atomic explosions.

She began using mirrors in the 1960s to create her effect of repetitive space. Her depression, lifelong hallucinations, and fear of sex, steered by the psychological effects of being forced by an abusive mother at a young age to spy on her philandering father, all affect her work, which included soft accumulation sculptures of phallic symbols.

I think her biography is an important, crucial part of her art and is visible in many ways, as is the mental illness she has been struggling with since she was a child, said Reto Thuring, former curator of contemporary art for the Cleveland Museum of Art, in an interview with The Blade during a showing of Kusama's work there in 2018. I think that is one lens to look through at her art. I think it isn't the only lens, but it has a presence.

Kusama was all but forgotten as an artist in the 1970s, after moving back to Japan and checking herself into a mental institution, which became her permanent residence. She wrote books and anthologies, including the award-winning novel The Hustlers Grotto of Christopher Street in 1983.

Her artwork took on a gentler tone later in her life, picking up steam again in the late 1980s and 1990s, when she began creating open air sculptures and murals on commission, and designing more of her mirrored infinity rooms, most marked with imminent darkness filled with mirrors, lights, brightly colored balls, and even pumpkins in her 2016 piece All the Eternal Love I Have for the Pumpkins.

The effect of infinite, constant repetition leads us to finding our ever-expanding hope. I spread that hope across the ground and with the intention of walking through my life, I threw my body over it, the artist says in Japanese in a video created for the Cleveland show.

In the late 1980s, Kusama celebrated solo exhibitions at the Musee Municipal, Dole and the Musee des Beaux-Arts de Calais, France, the Center for International Contemporary Arts, New York, and the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, England. In 1993, she participated in the 45th Venice Biennale in Italy and began to show her work in New York galleries shortly after that.

Kusama was 83 years old when the Whitney hosted its retrospective of her work.

The popularity of the photo app Instagram propelled Kusama's career forward even further, leaving no doubt about her slow but inevitable surge in the world of art and virtual reality, a concept she massaged decades before it surfaced on social media.

She dresses in polka dots, garnering her the title of Polka Dot Princess, and was named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2016.

In 2017, Kusama opened the Yayoi Kusama Museum opened in Tokyo, an institution run by the Yayoi Kusama Foundation.

Kusama's work has been exhibited in many of the major museums, Biennales and Triennales all over the world. However, we believe that a private museum, whose concept originated with the artist herself, is an important, unprecedented opportunity for a deeper understanding of her unique trajectory, writes museum director Akira Tatehata.

A dedicated museum will give visitors a chance to learn about the courageous battles that Kusama has fought as an avant-garde artist, allowing them to experience and feel the sincerity of her ideas, namely of saving the world through love.

Texto completo: Lazily, we often think of tradition as a legacy that never changes. That’s only partly true; what doesn’t evolve will die.
The weekend before Thanksgiving, at the dream factory at the corner of Market and Main in Wailuku, the truth of this proposition emerged in subtle ways as a melee of parents and their children (some by blood, some by quirks of casting) rehearsed the Maui Academy of Performing Arts production of “The Nutcracker.” The curtain rises this week at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center’s Castle Theater.
Since the Russian choreographer George Balanchine transplanted it from his native St. Petersburg to the New York City Ballet in 1954, “The Nutcracker” has taken hold all over America. Borne aloft on Tchaikovsky’s bewitching score, alternate stagings are legion.
What usually remains is the general storyline: In Act 1, a little girl named Clara receives a nutcracker. That night, in a nightmare, a wicked Mouse King attacks her, but the Nutcracker comes to the rescue and is transformed into a fairy-tale prince. In Act 2, Clara and her Prince visit the Kingdom of the Sweets, where the Sugar Plum Fairy regales them with bonbons and good things to drink. Ballet being ballet, all the refreshments are represented by dancers. It’s eye candy all the way.
On Maui, MAPA has been presenting its homegrown “Nutcracker” since 2010, never quite the same way twice. This year, for the first time, Kathleen Schulz, MAPA’s dance director, is receiving an assist from David C. Johnston, MAPA’s executive and artistic director, who was the mastermind behind juggernauts like “Les Miz” and “Into the Woods.” At a rehearsal in late November, Schulz was on her feet, rousing her troops and calling out corrections, as Johnston watched silently from front and center.
“This year we’re taking the next big step,” Schulz said during a break. “The grown-ups at the Christmas party in the first act are diplomats of different countries. It’s a friendly occasion, but there’s discord among them — arguing, pushing each other accidentally on purpose. In the second act we show people of the different nations sharing their talent, their art and their resources. It’s a vision of world peace.”
For the moment, Johnston was still taking everything in. “Mostly,” he said, “I’m here to see how we can sharpen the storytelling, to help place accents that will get our points across.”
The rehearsal resumed. Dancers from 6 to 63 paraded through festive chaos with a commendable sense of purpose and no collisions. But here and there hints of aggression and strife showed through. Off to one side, a lumberjack type in a black T-shirt and green shorts was brandishing a sword. A half-step away a little boy in a white A-shirt, black yoga pants and cherry-red sneakers flexed his biceps like a junior Arthur Schwarzenegger.
AS IN DANCE studios across the world, the dress code ranged from shabby-chic to just plain shabby. For finery the place to look was the costume shop, a walk-in closet crammed with rainbow velvets, brocades and veritable bushels of tulle.
At her worktable, wardrobe mistress Lynda Timm was putting the finishing touches on a tailored robin’s egg blue swallowtail coat with extra-special fancy buttons for a boy named Roman.
“I’m a perfectionist,” Timm said. “If a sleeve is a quarter-inch off, I see it from the top balcony.”
Luckily, given budget realities, she’s also a blue-ribbon penny-pincher.
“I work with scraps,” she said, showing off thoughtfully combined shades of blues in the lining. “The material cost of this coat might have been $ 3.”
Most of the stats on “Nutcracker” involve numbers that are huge. The tech crew backstage, for example, comes in at 21 bodies, while the onstage ensemble numbers 133, playing figures like angels, snowflakes, mice and sprightly buffoons known as “polichinelles,” not to mention those mysterious mirlitons.
Well known to Maui audiences, the talented MAPA alumnus and Seabury Hall 2016 graduate Kaimana Neal returns from the mainland as the Nutcracker/Prince, a dual role he has played here before, as young ladies in the cast are quick to tell you. Audiences who caught his polished work in productions ranging from “Twelfth Night” and “Dancing at Lughnasa” to “Pippin” and the Kander & Ebb revue “And the World Goes ’Round” will not have forgotten.
In the meantime he has been honing his chops in dance and musical theater at the Chicago College of Performing Arts, Roosevelt University, while picking up professional credits on the side. With the right breaks, Neal promises to go far, and before we know it we’ll be bragging that we saw him when.
MIA UTRILLO plays Clara, who at the climax of the battle turns the tables and saves the hero who has come to save her. Other standouts to watch for include the budding ballerinas Logan Tsukiyama (Dew Drop), Kassidy Rambaud (Snow Queen) and Randi Lonzaga (in the glamour role of Sugar Plum). They are the only three onstage to dance on toe. In the hip-hop cameo of the Soldier, Harold Barerro could bring down the house.
A more delicate responsibility will rest on the elegant shoulders of Logan Jacob Heller as Herr Drosselmeyer, the family friend who brings Clara the nutcracker. A professionally trained actor whose day job is teaching storytelling at MAPA, Logan stepped out of character for a moment to recall an epiphany the first time his mother took him to a ballet.
“I thought to myself, ‘Why aren’t they talking?’ But then I saw! There are so many different ways of performing! You can tell so much without speaking. You can say so much with a single movement.”
In traditional stagings going back to St. Petersburg, Drosselmeyer comes across as a Gothic, even sinister presence. Here on Maui he breathes the spirit of aloha, ushering Clara and the Prince to the Land of Peace.
“So often we’re caught in the rat race,” Heller said. “We keep our heads down and forget to look up, smell the flowers and be grateful for our family, our love ones and togetherness. Drosselmeyer reminds us of all that. To me he represents holiday magic.”

Texto completo: "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" (Henry Holt and Co., 416 pp., ) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi's West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Orïsha. Famously, "Children of Blood and Bone" netted the now-26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, "Children of Blood and Bone" has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance." Where "Blood and Bone" explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, "Virtue and Vengeance" places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.
The first book follows Zélie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Orïsha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases the trio as well as Amari's brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Zélie. Unlike Zélie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as "maggots."
At the end of "Blood and Bone," Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Orïsha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Orïsha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband's place on the throne after he is killed by his daughter Amari at the end of "Blood and Bone."
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds among the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.
Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone." (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

NFL WEEK 15; ON THE NFL; Cowboys' rallying cry: At least we're in the East; Even after seven losses in 10 games, Dallas is staggering to the finish line in a much better position to make the playoffs than the Rams

Texto completo: The Dallas Cowboys can't take away the football. Nor can they give away the football season.
The NFC East is so lousy, the 6-7 Cowboys couldn't be irrelevant if they tried.
Even though they have lost seven of their last 10 games, the Cowboys are in better position to make the playoffs than the Rams, who face them Sunday at AT&T Stadium.

"Obviously thankful to still be in position to control our destiny," said Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott, whose team can clinch the division by beating the Rams or Washington, coupled with a victory over Philadelphia next week. "But definitely hungry."
After three consecutive losses, the Cowboys are closer to starving.
"It's really about us coming together as a unit, as leaders, as a team, and getting this thing rolling," said defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, part of a unit with 14 takeaways, tied for the worst in the NFC.
Sunday's showdown is a Los Angeles team versus a Hollywood team, because the Cowboys are football's answer to a two-dimensional movie set.
On paper, they have the No. 1 offense and No. 9 defense. But those gaudy numbers don't tell the true story.
They have compiled more than their share of meaningless yards, and can't make a defensive stop when they need to. They have only five interceptions, tied with Detroit for fewest in the league, and consequently start their average drive deeper than anyone.
The Cowboys and Rams both won their first three games, then lost their next three. Both were 6-5 two weeks ago, but since have headed in opposite directions. The Rams posted lopsided victories over Arizona and Seattle, whereas the Cowboys lost to Buffalo and Chicago.
After a 13-9 loss by the Cowboys at New England last month, owner Jerry Jones vented.
"This is very frustrating," he told reporters. "It's frustrating just to be reminded that some of the fundamentals of football and coaching were what beat us out there today. ... With the makeup of this team, I shouldn't be this frustrated."
All signs point to the team parting ways with coach Jason Garrett after this, his ninth, season, even though the futility of the Cowboys vastly predates him. It has been 23 years since Dallas last won a Lombardi Trophy, and the Cowboys are 3-9 in playoff games during that span.
Dallas has yet to qualify for the playoffs this season, yet its players aren't gripped with an obvious sense of urgency.
"We know what we need to do," running back Ezekiel Elliott said. "We know what's at stake. Just focus on this week and handling business this weekend."
The Rams have won five of seven but face imposing odds of reaching the playoffs for a third consecutive season. Their best hope is to run the table -- they play the Cowboys, San Francisco and Arizona -- and keep their fingers crossed that Minnesota stumbles in its bid for a wild-card spot.
"We do know the urgency is there and the value of each game at this point," Rams quarterback Jared Goff said. "You do treat every game the same with the same approach, but we do know we are coming down the stretch here and need to make some things happen."
The New York Times has crunched the numbers and puts the Rams' chances of reaching the postseason at 41%, and the Cowboys at 57%.
"This has been a streaky team, and, yes, you've got to get that first one to get the second one," Prescott said. "That's just the mind-set: Let's focus on today, let's focus on the now, let's focus on this week and not worry about the rest. We'll worry about that when it comes."
It's mathematically possible that either the Cowboys or Eagles could reach the postseason at 7-9. If you throw out the strike-shortened 1982 season, only two teams have made the playoffs with a losing record -- 7-9 Seattle in 2010 and 7-8-1 Carolina in 2014. What's more, the Seahawks and Panthers won their first-round games.

Texto completo: In early September 1957, Jack Kerouac achieved the dream of every writer. Around midnight he and his girlfriend, Joyce Glassman, left her brownstone apartment in New York City for a nearby newsstand at Broadway and 66th Street. They waited while the nightman cut the twine around the morning edition of the New York Times. Rifling through the paper, they found on Page 27 an expected review of Kerouac's new book, 'On the Road.'
Glassman recalled that she 'felt dizzy reading the first paragraph.'
Kerouac was reading along, too. 'It's good, isn't it?' he asked.
'Yes, it's very, very good,' Glassman recounted in her 1983 memoir.
That breakthrough review, written by Gilbert Millstein in the 'Books of the Times' column, changed the course of literary history and the career of Kerouac, who died 50 years ago this fall, on Oct. 21, 1969. If not for that review, Kerouac might have remained a minor writer and the Beat Generation so fully associated with his name may never have flourished as it did. After all, seven years earlier, Kerouac had published his first book, 'The Town and the City,' to modest reviews, which were not enough to propel him to fame.
With the first line of his critique of 'On the Road,' Millstein announced a work of transcendent proportions. 'Its publication is a historic occasion,' he proclaimed. In the piece, he probed the depths of Kerouac the writer and explored the breadth of 'On the Road.' Millstein billed the pseudo-philosophic road novel as an 'authentic work of art.' After examining the sociological and psychological dimensions of the book, he rhapsodized over its style, declaring, 'The writing is of a beauty almost breathtaking.' And he quoted what would become the canonical lines from the novel: 'The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles.'
Looking back at this culture-shifting review, we might wonder whether such a moment can be replicated in our modern literary and journalistic landscape. The persuasive power of an individual review today is vastly diluted by the fragmentation of the media and the frantic chirping of cable channels, Facebook posts, Twitter feeds and text messaging at all hours. Abbreviated attention moves on at an almost mindless speed. A trend rises and vanishes, all but forgotten before it ever sticks. A book and a book review " even if capturing a cultural turning point " today can't help losing the competition for eyes to Twitter bursts and viral videos. One might wonder what social transitions are never noticed these days in all the noise.
While the more bookish culture and narrower media landscape of the 1950s played its part in catapulting Kerouac to success, serendipity also had a role. Millstein, a Times staffer, was the right reviewer at the right time. He was a connoisseur of the '50s bohemian counterculture of Greenwich Village and had reviewed a 1952 avant-garde novel titled 'Go' by John Clellon Holmes, now touted as the first Beat Generation novel. He later arranged for Holmes to write an essay for the Times on the meaning of 'beat.'
Five years later, the opportunity to review 'On the Road' fell to Millstein by a chance series of events. The Times' daily reviewer, Orville Prescott, was on vacation, which meant that weekday book reviews were selected and written by others, such as the conservative critic Charles Poore, the original intended reviewer of 'On the Road.' But Poore didn't take up the book, and it came to Millstein. Years later Millstein recalled that he 'wasn't looking for Kerouac's novel beforehand. I didn't even know it was coming out.' But trouble was coming. When Prescott read the draft of his review, 'he was enraged,' Millstein said. 'He hated the book. He even hated to look at it.' In the end, Prescott yielded: He allowed the review to appear in the Sept. 5, 1957, edition. But 'that was the end of me in daily book reviewing for the Times,' Millstein said in Dan Wakefield's 'New York in the 50s.' Millstein, however, did get some assignments for the Sunday book review.
Kerouac and the Beat Generation benefited not only from the cultural rhythms of another era but also from the nature of Millstein's review: It was exceptionally well thought-out and superbly written " and happened to be fortuitously timed to coincide with a youth culture's openness to change. Millstein's prose was as elegant and profound as Kerouac's " his insights defined an era. The sweep of his review encompassed disparate literary eras, yet found their common ground. 'The fact is,' he wrote in his review, 'that 'On the Road' is the most beautifully executed, the clearest and the most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 'beat,' and whose principal avatar he is. Just as, more than any other novel of the Twenties, 'The Sun Also Rises' came to be regarded as the testament of the 'Lost Generation,' so it seems certain that 'On the Road' will come to be known as that of the 'Beat Generation.' There is, otherwise, no similarity between the two: technically and philosophically, Hemingway and Kerouac are, at the very least, a depression and a world war apart.'
For any of today's authors hoping to break out and shine in a similar glow, perhaps it might happen despite our chaotic media " but it will take a rare alignment of fate and the originality of a Kerouac and a Millstein.

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
It’s not easy being McKinsey & Company these days.
For most of its 90-odd-year existence, the prestigious management consultancy prided itself on remaining above the fray. McKinsey consultants plied the executive suites of Fortune 500 companies, counseling chief executives with discretion and quietly building a business that, with $10 billion in annual revenues, is now bigger than many of the entities it serves. The substance of the company’s work, and even the identities of its clients, lie concealed under an institutional code of silence. That reticence, enforced by a nondisclosure agreement, bedeviled Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign until last Monday, when McKinsey granted him a rare dispensation to reveal the names of his former clients.
On the occasions when McKinsey’s work has been scrutinized of late, it hasn’t reflected well on the firm. Reporting by The New York Times, ProPublica and others over the past 18 months has raised serious questions about how it does business at home and abroad: corruption allegations against companies McKinsey partnered with in South Africa and Mongolia; a federal criminal investigation into the firm’s bankruptcy practice in the United States; attempts to deny that it helped put into effect controversial Trump administration immigration policies; and evidence that McKinsey cherry-picked nonviolent inmates for a pilot project and made it seem that an attempt to curb violence at New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex was working (it wasn’t). McKinsey has denied wrongdoing in each of these instances.
These and other examples of McKinsey’s recent conduct reveal a common dynamic. An examination of these episodes, including thousands of pages of documents and interviews with dozens of current and former McKinsey consultants and clients from multiple projects, suggests McKinsey behaves as if it believes the rules should bend to its way of doing things, not the other way around.
McKinsey’s self-regard has long been uncommonly high. In the firm’s 2010 internal history, a copy of which ProPublica obtained, partners compare the firm to the Marine Corps, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Jesuits: “analytically rigorous, deeply principled seekers of knowledge and truth,” the history’s authors write. One McKinsey partner went a step further, declaring without a hint of irony that the firm’s trait of shared values is more than “even the Catholic Church can promise.”
This attitude works for the firm in corporate consulting, an unregulated field where McKinsey’s reputation leaves it largely free to do things its own way and where its insistence on not being publicly credited has also shielded it from blame for its failures. But as McKinsey has expanded its consulting empire in recent years, it has taken on a growing book of work for government entities, as well as for corporate clients in areas subject to government oversight, such as advising bankrupt companies on restructuring.
In that field, consulting firms confront a web of contracting, disclosure and ethics rules that are designed to dictate and limit their behavior. These rules exist to prevent governments from wasting taxpayer money on underqualified or overpriced contractors and to protect government integrity and avoid conflicts of interests. In recent years, as McKinsey has burrowed deeper into this world, interviews and records show, it has developed a habit of disregarding inconvenient rules and norms to secure, retain and profit from government work.
Consider McKinsey’s imbroglios in South Africa and Mongolia. The firm did not follow the due diligence protocols commonly deployed to avoid running afoul of anti-corruption laws. The result: Its consultants found themselves working alongside dubious local companies that got them entangled in corruption investigations. Only after McKinsey became embroiled in the South Africa corruption scandal did the firm decide it needed to put more stringent safeguards in place.
In the United States, a damning but largely overlooked report issued in July by the Office of Inspector General for the General Services Administration, the hub for federal contracting, depicted McKinsey as ignoring rules and refusing to take no for an answer. The report examined McKinsey’s attempts to renew a major long-running contract in 2016. The firm was asked to provide additional pricing information to satisfy federal contracting rules. Rather than comply, McKinsey went over the contracting officer’s head, lodging complaints with top GSA officials, who refused to exempt the firm from the rules.
Eventually, the firm found a friendly GSA manager who was willing to not only award the contract, but also manipulated the GSA’s pricing tools to increase the value of the contract by tens of millions of dollars. The report concluded the manager “violated requirements governing ethical conduct.”
The pattern repeated itself when McKinsey failed in multiple attempts to win a separate contract around the same time. Stymied, according to the report, McKinsey browbeat the contracting officer, threatening to resubmit the proposal until it got its way. The GSA manager again intervened — for reasons left unexplained by the report — and McKinsey got its contract.
The report’s assessment of McKinsey’s behavior was withering, and it revealed that the firm subsequently used the same friendly manager to help secure contracts at three other federal agencies in 2017 and 2018. “Multiple contracting officers,” the inspector general wrote, told investigators that McKinsey’s requests were “inappropriate” and “a conflict of interest.”
The report recommended that the GSA cancel the contracts, which as of earlier this year had earned McKinsey nearly $1 billion over a 13-year span. In a response to the report, the GSA stated that it would ask McKinsey to renegotiate the contracts to lower the price. “If McKinsey declines” or “renegotiations do not yield a result in the government’s best interest,” the agency wrote, it would cancel them. Neither has happened to date, according to federal contracting records. A McKinsey spokesman said: “We have reviewed the report and the relevant facts, and have found no evidence of any improper conduct by our firm. We are in negotiations with GSA and look forward to completing them soon.” A GSA spokesperson said it is negotiating for “better pricing” and will not award McKinsey any further work under the contracts until those negotiations are concluded.
McKinsey has also taken steps to evade public accountability. As ProPublica reported, a senior partner leading McKinsey’s work at Rikers asked top corrections officials and members of the consulting team to restrict their communications to Wickr, an encrypted messaging app that deletes messages automatically after a few hours or days. That insulated some of McKinsey’s work from government oversight and public records requests. (“Our policies require colleagues to adhere to all relevant laws and regulations,” a McKinsey spokesman said. He neither confirmed nor denied the use of Wickr.)

To the Editor:
Re "Fearing Injustice in Hong Kong, Droves of Protesters Escape to Taiwan" (news article, Dec. 7):
Once again The New York Times chooses to gloss over the violence of protesters and portray them as victims.
Arson, criminal damage, attacks on the police, attacks on bystanders with different views, throwing petrol bombs, trashing businesses, damaging railway stations: This has nothing to do with the democracy these runaways profess to be fighting for and is more akin to anarchy.
Claims by a lawyer that the legal system is not fair or that punishments will not be proportionate are completely unfounded and an affront to the criminal justice system in Hong Kong.
Offenders facing serious charges are routinely bailed. Sentences are based on the evidence and the sentencing guidelines. That is how a common law system works.
Any futures that have been ruined; any dreams that have been shattered; any pining for home or mother gets down to the fact that these fugitives have themselves chosen to run away because they do not want to face the serious consequences of their violence and vandalism.

Insider's View Of a Long Day

Texto completo: Some of the most intriguing moments in the impeachment fight on Capitol Hill take place in private, away from the hearing rooms and news conferences that throngs of cameras can scrupulously document.
Democratic and Republican representatives alike granted The New York Times unusual access to photograph their preparations for the Judiciary Committee hearing this week and the drafting of articles of impeachment.
The photos yield a rare behind-the-scenes look at how Congress really operates -- long days fueled by adrenaline, a sense of history and takeout food -- and the interludes of quiet from the impeachment pressure cooker.
Weekend Strategy Sessions
Last weekend, Republicans held a meeting to prepare for the hearings. The Capitol was largely empty save for a few buzzing conference rooms and hallways littered with pizza boxes.
Early Morning Preparations Before Showtime
On Monday morning, before convening a hearing to lay out the case for impeaching President Trump, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, along with his staff, grappled with last-minute details as his caucus prepared to take the stage.
Representative Lucy McBath of Georgia stole a private moment, while Representative Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania helped Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida with her member pin.
Private Moments on the Sidelines
Impeachment is not just witnesses facing hours of questioning from lawmakers, but it is also House members conferring in anterooms, catching news coverage in the privacy of their offices or taking a minute to assess the latest developments.
Long Hours and Late Nights Drafting the Articles of Impeachment
The atmosphere in the Capitol can take on a less formal feel as evening fades into night and drained lawmakers and staff members focus on the next steps. Shirts are untucked, takeout boxes are cracked open and a glass of wine is not unheard-of.
Reading the Articles One Last Time Before Their Release
Drafting the articles of impeachment was a group project with comments from staff lawyers, members and, most especially, the party leadership as Democrats decided how to proceed based on the evidence they had compiled and the views of their colleagues.
On Tuesday morning, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee reviewed the articles one last time and Mr. Nadler affirmed them with his signature.
Meeting With the Speaker
The House floor is the ultimate playing field, but much of the real work of Congress unfolds in the warren of committee and leadership offices. It is where the sausage is made and the public doesn't often get a peek behind the scenes.
Before a nationally televised news conference announcing the articles of impeachment Tuesday morning, Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a private meeting with the leaders of key House committees in her office, with a portrait of Abraham Lincoln watching over them.
Preparing for the Vote
After the articles of impeachment were formally announced, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee conducted mock hearings and Ms. Pelosi continued to regularly meet with Mr. Nadler and committee leaders.
The committee rooms were filled with stacks of binders, books and papers -- including transcripts of witness testimony and Representative Jamie Raskin's copy of "The Federalist Papers." Seeking a quiet place to work, Norman Eisen, a lawyer for the Democrats, drafted a speech for Mr. Nadler, alone in a cavernous committee room.

Texto completo: Douglas Miguel Rodríguez, trabajador inmigrante de Guayaquil (Ecuador) que murió en la masacre del martes en un supermercado judío en Jersey City, ha sido proclamado un “héroe” porque aún herido ayudó a una persona a escapar por la puerta trasera del establecimiento.
La Fiscalía de Nueva Jersey confirmó ayer que el tiroteo que culminó con la muerte de seis personas -4 víctimas y 2 novios pistoleros fanáticos religiosos- se investiga como “potencial acto de terrorismo doméstico”, alimentado por el antisemitismo y el odio a los agentes del orden.
Anoche se realizó una vigilia emocional en Jersey City. Parientes, amigos y completos extraños se unieron en memoria de las cuatro vidas inocentes que se perdieron en un instante, reseñó CBS2.
El rabino David Niederman dijo que Rodríguez murió como un héroe. “Después de recibir un disparo, abrió la puerta trasera para que rescataran a un cliente”, dijo a la prensa. “Desafortunadamente, murió al pisar esa puerta”.
Su esposa contuvo las lágrimas mientras agradecía al mercado que empleaba a su esposo por aceptarlo. “La comunidad judía aprendió a amar a mi esposo y estuvo allí para él y lo recibió”, dijo.
Otro doliente dijo que Rodríguez era como un hermano para él. “Lo amamos, lo extrañamos, pero sabemos que estará bien porque creía en Jesús”, dijo.
Su servicio conmemorativo se llevará a cabo de 5 a 9 p.m. mañana sábado en el Michigan Memorial en Paterson, Nueva Jersey.

ALICJA KWADE:
In Between Glances
At the MIT List Visual Arts Center, 20 Ames St., Cambridge, through Jan. 5. 617-253-4680, listart.mit.edu
At the MIT List Visual Arts Center, a cluster of unremarkable objects — a vase, a chair, a bowl, an urn — sit ceremoniously under glass, most on leggy golden stands. Their titles make you look, then look again: The chair is called “Bicycle," the bowl “Lamp." One appears to transcend the apparent semantic silliness for some levity about belief, 21st-century style: A small, dark chalice — like an offering cup, the kind you might use to burn incense — is called “iPhone." In 2019, there's no more ceremonial an object than that.
It all has a vaguely Duchampian air — everyday stuff, arbitrarily assigned significance as art — but that's just Alicja Kwade building an expectation to deflate. The Berlin-based, Polish-born artist's reputation has been booming lately on the strength of her playfully puzzling double-take pieces. This cluster — collectively (and literally) called “Reconstituted Objects" — falls right in line. They're exactly what they say they are, ground down to fine dust and rebuilt from a resin compound into something new. You have to reach to make connections, former to latter (bicycle to chair, dynamic to static?) though that seems the least of Kwade's concerns. Helpful wall text explains that each of these objects is an exact match, volumetrically, to its progenitor — matter neither created nor destroyed, the cosmic order maintained. For Kwade, an ­iPhone is not just an iPhone. It's an unending continuum of things.
If that feels like a lot to wrap your mind around, then Kwade has you right where she wants you. For her, instability is key, and even the most solid-seeming of things has no right to claim the privilege of permanence. The universe is vast, and time unending. Re-situating her viewer in that vastness, buried as we are in our mountains of the throwaway and everyday, is a big part of Kwade's project. At first glance, her work can have an antiseptic-feeling, a formal agnosticism. But that's a setup for her to subvert. (“Tunnel Teller," her big public sculpture at the Crane Estate in Ipswich, is as playful a bunker of stone, concrete, and steel as you'll ever find).
Kwade was awarded the commission for the Metropolitan Museum's rooftop garden this year (it closed Oct. 27). Her piece, “ParaPivot," towered with impenetrable, icy-cool formalism: Rigid steel armatures, perfect spheres of marble positioned just so. Look a little closer, though, and you found that Kwade isn't as agnostic as she might appear. Each of the work's nine spheres were sourced at quarries in Europe, Asia, and South America, a sliding scale of first-versus-third world resource economies; her right-angled supports framed views of the city's most coveted residential towers.
In an interview this month with The New York Times, Kwade remarked on how, when viewed from certain angles, it could look as though her stone spheres were teetering atop the towers, creating “a fantastic and somewhat anxious illusion of instability, echoing the ways in which these buildings, and the vast sums of money they represent, precariously uphold the global economy." Link that to “Linienland II" on the wall at MIT, an abacus — the ancient world's key tool for accounting trade and wealth — with all but ten of its lapis beads scattered on the floor, and Kwade suddenly seems more political than not.
Granted, this all demands a closer read than the work prompts on its own. That can give the sense of a great one-liner and not much more. I walked around and around “Trans-For-Men 11 (Fibonacci)," a collection of 11 slowly morphing boulders lined up single-file with mirrors in-between, and I marveled at the lack of sense my mind could make of what my eyes took in. It's irreverent and cheeky, like a conceptual funhouse: At the center, a granite boulder evolves through shimmering alloy and smooth synthetic stone to become a perfect sphere on the right and a cube on the left. The mirrors make the transformation appear to dead-end in an infinite procession of sameness. Look past it, and the boulder is plodding, step by step, to its conclusion.
Kwade's visual friskiness only hints at the deep thinking behind it. She made a 3-D scan of the original boulder and used an algorithm based on the “golden ratio" of the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding it. She used the results to produce new forms incrementally different from the original while matching its exact volume.
Need to read that again? Go ahead. It took me a few times, too. Truly, you don't need to know the mechanics to enjoy looking at the piece. And as much as I love Kwade's demand for rigorous process, the algorithmic sequences can be a little over the top. But Kwade's work is about nothing so much as the futile joy of trying to make sense of the incomprehensible, of struggling with the forces that govern reality at cosmic scale. The basic enterprise of human civilization has always been to make the unknown a little more knowable. The limits of that enterprise — which are severe, in the face of the unfathomably vast — is the meat of Kwade's work.
Speaking of unknowable, that brings us to the exhibition's natural conclusion: Kwade's installation “Light Touch of Totality." (The title itself is a paradox — get it?) Five huge steel rings link and overlap in a cascading rhythm of elemental purity. It feels mathematically primal, a dance with the infinite. But it's also a reference to latitude and longitude, the globe-encircling meridians we carved into the planet's virtual skin.
This should feel familiar by now: Order from chaos, a desire to control. From the steely curves dangle curtains of beads, white and wooden, occasionally punctuated with bursts of blue lapis. They are, quite literally, hangers-on; the wooden beads have faded letters or numbers, like lost crumbs of data clinging desperately to the incalculable. They muddy up the slickly primal surface to which nothing, ultimately, sticks. There's no bringing down to earth the mysteries of the universe. Kwade offers a glimpse, and then releases us to the cosmos.

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies .
LEE GRANT. ACTOR. FILMMAKER at Film Forum (through Feb. 12). Although Grant is probably best known as an actress -- she won an Oscar for "Shampoo" -- this retrospective mixes her onscreen work with documentaries that she directed, one of which, "Down and Out in America," a portrait of poverty, won an Oscar itself. Grant will appear at the screening on Monday for a Q. and A. with the documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple. She will also be at Film Forum on Saturday with the drag artist Charles Busch for a showing of "What Sex Am I?," a 1985 documentary about transgender life in the United States.
212-727-8110, filmforum.org
ON THE PROCESS at the Metrograph (through Dec. 20). This week is your last chance to catch this theater's series on artists at work. Peter Watkins's "Edvard Munch" (on Sunday) uses a variety of devices to probe the mind of the Norwegian painter, including commentary from actors playing Munch's associates. Maurice Pialat's "Van Gogh" (on Friday and Saturday) is a "good, quiet, rigorous film, made with intelligence and acted with earnest conviction," Vincent Canby wrote in his 1992 review in The New York Times, adding that the film "never makes the mistake of equating a real-life view with what finally appears on Vincent's canvas."

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
PUBLIC IMAGINATIONS: A SURVEY OF DOCUMENTARY FORM at the Museum of Modern Art (Dec. 12-30). Exactly what constitutes proper documentary filmmaking -- When does narration become intrusive? Are sit-down interviews essential or a crutch? -- is open to debate. MoMA's series highlights examples that have challenged perceptions of the form. Errol Morris's 1988 film, "The Thin Blue Line" (on Friday and Dec. 26), whose making led to the exoneration of a man originally convicted of killing a Dallas police officer, used re-enactments to help viewers understand the circumstances of the crime. The more recent "Leviathan" (on Thursday and Dec. 28) comes from the Harvard Sensory Ethnography Lab, a laboratory that promotes aesthetic innovation in nonfiction art. This experimental feature used waterproof cameras to conjure an abstract, tactile sense of the work of a fishing trawler.

Texto completo: MERRY CHRISTMAS, MR. PRESIDENT: The bipartisan $738 billion defense policy bill that passed the House yesterday on a rare 377-to-48 lopsided vote gives President Trump practically everything he wanted, and nothing he didn’t.
“Wow! All of our priorities have made it into the final NDAA: Pay Raise for our Troops, Rebuilding our Military, Paid Parental Leave, Border Security, and Space Force! Congress,” Trump tweeted after the vote. “Don’t delay this anymore! I will sign this historic defense legislation immediately!”
The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act now goes to the Senate, with a vote expected by early next week.
EVERYONE CLAIMS A WIN: The compromise bill is more than 4,000 pages long, and contains 1,249 individual provisions, a veritable Christmas tree of gifts that unleashed a snowstorm of press releases from members of Congress lauding the benefits accruing their particular districts.
And while Republicans complained that the bill was delayed by Democrats playing politics and holding out over non-defense measures, in the end both sides embraced a provision to give 12 weeks of paid parental leave to all federal workers. While technically not a national security issue, it does apply to more than 755,000 civilian employees of the Defense Department.
WHAT THE BILL DOESN’T DO: Several Democrat-backed proposals that would have tied the president's hand or limited his power did not make it in the final version of the bill. Among the things the bill doesn’t do:

NATO FEARS: The bill does express strong support for NATO, among bipartisan fears that President Trump may decide to withdraw or cut back U.S. support for the alliance, and includes this language:
“No funds may be obligated, expended, or otherwise made available during the period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act and ending on December 31, 2020, to take any action to suspend, terminate, or provide notice of denunciation of the North Atlantic Treaty, done at Washington, D.C. on April 4, 1949.”
Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, said the provision had its genesis in discussions he had with the late Sen. John McCain before he died. “We were so worried that all the president's bashing of NATO suggested that he might leave, and that he clearly believed he could do it on its own.”
“The only benefactor if the U.S. pulled out of NATO would be Vladimir Putin and Russia, and we want to make clear to our allies and to the president and especially to Russia that the Congress supports the U.S. staying in NATO and we're not going to let a president back out of it on his own,” Kaine said on MSNBC last night.
IT’S A TRADITION: “Today, we remind the country that despite our many policy disagreements, the House can still legislate and deliver for the American people,” said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Smith in a statement. “We disagreed on a few key provisions, but we found compromise on hundreds of others. That’s what makes the House Armed Services Committee different: Our bipartisan commitment to put country ahead of party.”
“This was a challenging year, starting with two different bills that were far apart. But, for the 59th consecutive year, we were able to come to an agreement for our men and women in uniform and their families,” said Republican ranking member Rep. Mac Thornberry. “It is important for the men and women who serve to know that, despite differences on other issues, we can come together to support them.”

NOTE TO READERS: Daily on Defense will go on holiday hiatus beginning Dec. 20 and will return to your inbox Jan. 3, 2020.
HAPPENING TODAY: Defense Secretary Mark Esper welcomes Czech Republic Defense Minister Lubomír Metnar to the Pentagon at 2 p.m.
SO LONG HUEY, HELLO …? At a ceremony one week from today at Duke Field at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, the Air Force will accept the first delivery of its new Boeing MH-139A helicopter, a replacement for the venable Vietnam-era UH-1 “Huey.”
At the same time, the Air Force will announce the name of the new chopper. For decades, U.S. military helicopters have been named for native American tribes, although the official name of the Huey never stuck. The UH-1 was named the Iroquois, but because UH-1 designation couldn’t be said as a word, Huey it became.
“The MH-139A is the first service-unique helicopter acquired by the Air Force and the first major acquisition in Air Force Global Strike Command’s 10-year history,” said the Air Force, noting it’s also the command’s first commercial “off-the-shelf” purchase.
The MH-139 is new military variant of a civilian helicopter AW139 manufactured by Leonardo subsidiary AgustaWestland, which partnered with Boeing. The Air Force plans to buy 84 aircraft at a cost of $2.38 billion, and says it saved saved taxpayers $1.7 billion by buying a militarized version of an existing commercial helicopter.
ESPER REBUFFED: When U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper called on American allies in the Gulf to help counter Iran’s attacks on shipping earlier this year,most said “no thanks,” writes Russ Read in the Washington Examiner.
The rejections came in response to the Pentagon’s creation of a maritime coalition after Iran attacked foreign ships and Saudi oil fields earlier this year.
“I personally made calls to many allies in both Asia and Europe and asked for assets and was told either ‘not possible’ or ‘we’ll think about it.’ And you can see how many are there right now,” Esper told Democratic Rep. Bill Keating during a House Armed Services Committee hearing.
“I can see how many who aren’t there too, that usually are there. And that’s a concern I have,” Keating said.
So far, only six partners have signed on to the maritime coalition, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Australia.
IT’S NOT ABOUT THE OIL: At that same hearing Esper said that since Turkey’s incursion into Syria in October, the situation has stabilized and the U.S. has resumed counter ISIS operations with its Syrian Kurdish partners.
“My current assessment is that the situation up there is generally stabilized,” Esper testfied, quickly adding a caveat. “You know no cease fire is perfect if you will. I think the wild card is always these Turkish surrogate forces,” referring to some of the troops accused of war crimes.
“These things take a while to unfold,” added Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, noting the roughy 20 mile wide buffer zone along Turkey’s southern border with Syria was divided into three sections with Turkey controlling the middle, and Russia and Syria controlling the ends.
“We're watching it all very closely. With respect to what will happen with the SDF. The SDF has already made adjustments in that particular area,” Milley said, “We're still working with them in the eastern portion of northeast Syria and then they're working with Russian, Syrian regime in other parts of Syria.”
Asked about President Trump’s assertion that U.S. troops are staying in Syria to guard the oil the U.S. is keeping, Esper pushed back.
“We are there to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS. So a subtask of that is we've directed to our commander on the ground to deny ISIS access to that oil because whoever controls that oil controls a resource that allows them to buy weapons, equipment,” he said.
GETTING TURKEY BACK: “My biggest concern with Syrian and Turkey is actually Turkey-Russia,” Esper said. “The concern is that Turkey is moving out of the NATO orbit as I've said publicly on several occasions. I think our challenge is to figure out how we can get them back, closer into the NATO alliance because I think they're a critical and longstanding nearly 70-year partner of ours.”
Meanwhile the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday advanced bipartisan sanctions bill to punish Turkey for its purchase of Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles, and Turkey threatened to retaliate.
“If the U.S. imposes sanctions against Turkey, then the issue of the Incirlik and Kurecik bases may come on the agenda,” said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, according to the Wall Street Journal.
GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE: In response to another line of questioning, Milley vigorously defended President Trump’s pardons of three accused, and in one case convicted, war criminals, insisting it will not degrade the ability of the military to maintain good order and disciple amount the troops.
“Good order and discipline is maintained in a lot of different ways, but one of them is to maintain adherence to the process,” Milley said. “And the president of the United States is part of the process, and we are maintaining good order and discipline within our military.”
“He has the legal authorities to do what he did and he weighed the conditions in the situation as he saw fit, but he is part of the process,” Milley said at another point. “We do maintain and we will maintain good order and discipline. We will not turn into a gang of raping, burning and pillaging … that is not going to happen.”
CALL FOR HEARINGS: California Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna expressed outrage at the revelations contained in the so-called “Afghanistan Papers” published this week by the Washington Post.
“The bottom line is the top military officials and civilian officials have known that the Afghan war has been unwinnable and have been misleading the American public for 20 years,” Khanna said. “I would request that this committee hold hearings on the Afghan papers and call before Congress, with subpoena, every person who has misled this country and just like in the Pentagon papers, I think that should be one of our highest priorities and examining what has come out in that bombshell report.”
Chairman Smith immediately pushed back on the idea of subpoenaing every one of the 400 people who are referenced in more than 2,000 documents. “I think it's appropriate to have hearings,” Smith said. “I will tell you right up front just to set expectations correctly, I'm not going to call every single witness who has anything to do with this.

Texto completo: “Wait,” my father said, incredulously. “Are you crying ?”
It was early December, probably around 1984. My father and I were watching the classic Rankin/Bass stop-motion production of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.” On television, three characters from the Island of Misfit Toys sat around a campfire: the Charlie-in-the-Box, the Spotted Elephant and the Dolly for Sue, the seemingly typical doll whose problems were many years later revealed to be psychiatric.
“Looks like we’re forgotten again,” Spotted Elephant said, beaten down by the merciless cruelty of the world.
“Might just as well go to bed and start dreaming about next year,” Charlie lamented, retracting into his box.
In the dark winter sky, a single light shone from the clouds. Distant sleigh bells rang through the cold stop-motion night.
“I haven’t any dreams left to dream!” Dolly said.
The sound of approaching sleigh bells grew louder.
“Wait a minute,” Spotted Elephant said. “What’s that? Is it —? Is it—?”
This version of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” had been around for 20 years in 1984. But it wasn’t nostalgia for my ’60s childhood that caused tears of recognition to shimmer in my eyes.
No, it was the fact that then, as now, the subtext of this ridiculous story was the truth of my own improbable life. A fabulously blond elf who doesn’t like to make toys? A reindeer who is cast out by those who are supposed to love him, on account of an accident of birth? A whole island populated by outcasts?
Welcome to “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” the queerest holiday special ever.
I’m sure that conservatives who love this old holiday chestnut will be infuriated by this suggestion. But if you watch the show without understanding that its central conflict is the way people who are different are constantly shunned and humiliated — well, I don’t know what show you’re watching. It’s not “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” I can tell you that, a show in which, at the climax, “even Santa realizes that maybe he was wrong.”
Conservatives seem to miss the point of a lot of things having to do with Christmas, actually. Is it really possible that anyone can watch (or read) Charles Dickens’s “A Christmas Carol” without understanding its fundamental critique of capitalism? (Say this in your best Laura Ingraham voice: “Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?”) What do they suppose is meant in “Good King Wenceslas” by the line, “Ye who now shall bless the poor shall yourselves find blessing”?
But please. Do enjoy your $60 Keep America Great hat tree ornament finished in 24-karat gold.
As for “Rudolph,” the whole movie feels as L.G.B.T.Q. friendly to me as any episode of “Queer Eye” or “Steven Universe” or “The L Word.” (In fact, the theme song from the Island of Misfit Toys, “The Most Wonderful Day of the Year,” once made it into the “Glee” Christmas special.)
There’s plenty of queer code in Christmastown. After Rudolph’s red nose shines in his father Donner’s cave, for instance, causing Donner a curiously profound mortification, the old man comes up with a fake nose for his boy to wear. You know: so as not to offend The Straights.
“It’s not very comfortable,” Rudolph says.
“You’ll wear it and like it!” his father replies. “There are more important things than comfort — self-respect!”
Maybe it goes without saying that this is exactly how I felt, putting on a coat and tie to go to my right-wing, all-boys high school, before coming out as trans years later. Is it worth adding that the character of the misfit male reindeer Rudolph in the special was voiced by Billie Mae Richards, a 40-something woman?
Prospector Yukon Cornelius’s sexuality doesn’t enter into the plot, of course. But in a scene that was deleted from the 1964 original, we learn that even though he claimed to be searching for silver or gold, in fact, Yukon C. was looking for a peppermint mine. No further questions, your honor.
And then, there’s Hermey the Elf. Beautiful and blond where all the other elves resemble bulbous-nosed Vulcans, all he wants is to be able to be himself (a dentist, in fact), instead of being forced to toil in Santa’s soul-crushing toy factory. “What’s eatin’ ya, boy?” his boss asks. “Oh, nothing,” Hermey explains, “I just don’t like to make toys.”
His boss roars with disapproval, and the other elves cluck and go tsk-tsk. “Not happy in my work, I guess,” he says. Oh, Hermey. Tell me about it.
Sometimes I dream of seeing an elderly, grown-up Hermey making one of those “It Gets Better” videos, sending a message back to a younger generation of closeted elves that with luck, things can turn out all right, if only you can gain agency over your own life.
As for me, I was able in time to do just that. As of this Christmas, I’ve spent more than a third of my life as a happily out member of the L.G.B.T. community.
My father died when I was in my 20s, though, and never knew me as his daughter. At this time of year, I think about him, as well as the millions of L.G.B.T. people still unable to come out. The holidays can be hard for everyone — but they can be especially hard for queer people sundered from their families. So many Charlies, stuck inside their boxes. So many Spotted Elephants.
Back in 1984, my father looked over at his inexplicably weeping child with love. “There’s nothing to be ashamed of,” he said.
“I’m not crying.” I said, and wiped my eyes. “I’m fine.”

Texto completo: It’s not every night two rock icons take the stage for intimate acoustic performances.
Eighties singer-songwriters Rick Springfield and Richard Marx will each offer a solo acoustic set on Sunday, Dec. 15, at F.M. Kirby Center for the Performing Arts, 71 Public Square, Wilkes-Barre. The show begins at 7 p.m., and tickets start at $39.50. They can be purchased at the box office, kirbycenter.org or 570-826-1100.
During a phone interview from his home in Malibu, California, Springfield assured crowds can expect his hits like “Jessie’s Girl” and “I’ve Done Everything for You” but also storytelling songs.
After Springfield’s autobiography, “Late, Late at Night: A Memoir,” came out in 2010, the musician found an outpouring of requests for a storytelling show. During these performances, Springfield feels he can connect with fans personally. While he’ll playfully call out audience members who are getting up for drinks, he also feels the connection between himself and those in the room. The atmosphere allows for more communication and emotion, which means everything to him as an artist.
“It’s telling stories, some jokes and sort of one-on-one,” he said. “I can actually talk to the audience. It’s low-key, laid-back and completely different from a full-band show. ”
As for Marx, the musician released a string of hits during the late ’80s and early ’90s including “Endless Summer Nights,” “Hold On to the Nights” and “Right Here Waiting.” Springfield said he and Marx have been friends since 1985 and decided to join together to go out on the road. Each will perform his own songs in separate acoustic sets before coming together for the encore. It’s a special night for the musicians and fans alike.
“You get to really hear the lyrics of the songs and the stories behind the music,” Springfield said. “You’re all together, sharing those moments.”
An Australia native, Springfield’s first U.S. No. 1 hit, “Jessie’s Girl,” earned him a Grammy award and solidified his place in pop culture. He followed its success with four more top 10 hits, including “Don’t Talk to Strangers” and “Love Somebody,” and has released more than a dozen albums during his career. He also wrote a novel, “Magnificent Vibration,” which made The New York Times Best Sellers list.
Springfield also has kept busy with acting. He starred in the film “Ricki and the Flash” opposite Meryl Streep as well as on TV, including more sinister roles as Dr. Pitlor in HBO’s “True Detective,” Lucifer on “Supernatural” and, most recently, Pastor Charles on “American Horror Story: Cult.”
“Doing stuff against type is always fun for an actor,” he said. “Showing that dark side.”
Springfield promised fans will see him in more acting roles in 2020, and he plans to release a second novel, a new record and a greatest hits album next year. Springfield also will hit the road with Chicago during the band’s summer tour around North America.
“There’s a lot in store over the next year,” he said.

Texto completo: A romantic comedy with Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen airs on HBO. And a documentary about Caroll Spinney is streaming on Topic.
What's on TV
LONG SHOT (2019) 10:10 p.m. on HBO. Love blooms in the din of an underground bomb shelter in this romantic comedy, which stars Charlize Theron as a United States secretary of state running for president and Seth Rogen as a journalist who becomes her beau. The "long shot" in the title refers to both the presidential bid and the unlikely romance that the pair develops: Charlotte (Theron) used to babysit Fred (Rogen). Their meet-cute adult reunion happens at a lavish charity event, where Fred (the only neon windbreaker in a sea of suits) manages to trip down a staircase in front of an assembly of distinguished guests. The rest of the story involves Charlotte hiring Fred as a speechwriter and a journey abroad that lands the pair in that snug bomb shelter. "Much of what happens isn't surprising," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, "but Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah's script is consistently, genially funny, filled with patter and nonsense, and spiked with sincerity and a few gross-out flourishes." The movie was directed by Jonathan Levine, who also directed Rogen in "50/50" and "The Night Before."
MLB NETWORK PRESENTS: THE COBRA AT TWILIGHT 8 p.m. on MLB Network. "All this attention," the baseball player Dave Parker told The Times in 1979, "it's interfering with my work. But what can you do?" At the time, Parker was a star right fielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates -- he was named the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1978. The latest entry in the sports documentary series "MLB Network Presents" revisits Parker's career, which subsequently involved more highs (World Series victories, All-Star games) and lows (a cocaine scandal). The documentary, narrated by the rapper Chuck D, also covers Parker's ongoing fight against Parkinson's disease.
OLAF'S FROZEN ADVENTURE (2017) 8 p.m. on ABC. The comic-relief snowman voiced by Josh Gad in the "Frozen" movies got his own wintry tale in this animated short, which also includes appearances from the rest of the full-length movies' main characters. Some families who went to see "Frozen 2" may find this a fitting digestif. Families who have had enough of Olaf and the gang may opt instead for the Disney-Pixar short TOY STORY THAT TIME FORGOT (2014), which will air at 8:30 p.m. on ABC.
What's Streaming
I AM BIG BIRD (2015) Stream on Topic; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Caroll Spinney, the puppeteer who for decades gave life to Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch on "Sesame Street," died on Sunday. This documentary delves into the performer's career largely through his own words, telling the story of how a childhood passion for puppeteering ultimately landed an adult Spinney in the big yellow suit. The movie "gets a little syrupy at times," Neil Genzlinger wrote in his review for The Times, but Genzlinger added that Spinney is "forthright and engaging throughout," and that the film ultimately "reminds us that even the most omnipresent cultural phenomena were created by someone, usually through a combination of hard work and happenstance."

Texto completo: Edward O'Callaghan worked closely with Rod J. Rosenstein to oversee the Russia investigation.
WASHINGTON -- The primary liaison between the Justice Department and the special counsel's office is set to step down at the end of the month, after helping oversee the department's most consequential and controversial investigation in a generation.
Edward O'Callaghan, who served as the deputy attorney general's right-hand man, worked closely with the deputy attorney general at the time, Rod J. Rosenstein, to oversee the Russia investigation. He had primary supervisory responsibilities over the special counsel's office, which was led by Robert S. Mueller III.
Mr. O'Callaghan, who is the top adviser to Jeffrey A. Rosen, who succeeded Mr. Rosenstein as deputy attorney general, also advised Mr. Rosenstein and Attorney General William P. Barr on how best to release the Mueller report this spring. Mr. O'Callaghan, who plans to return to private practice, played a direct role in the decision not to accuse President Trump of obstruction of justice in the report and worked directly on the process to review the report so much of it could be made public.
The Justice Department confirmed Mr. O'Callaghan's move.
Mr. O'Callaghan "is one of the most highly regarded lawyers at the Department of Justice," Mr. Barr said in a statement. "His dedication and tireless commitment to the work of the department is second to none."
A veteran of the federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan, Mr. O'Callaghan was part of a team that investigated the terrorists behind the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
He left the government in 2008 to become a defense lawyer and went on to work on John McCain's presidential campaign that year. Mr. O'Callaghan was dispatched to Alaska, where he led a team that defended Sarah Palin, Mr. McCain's running mate, from accusations that she had pushed an Alaskan official to fire a state trooper who was involved in a bitter divorce from her sister.
Mr. O'Callaghan returned to the Justice Department in 2017 as the head of the national security division, and in April 2018, he moved to the deputy attorney general's office, which essentially runs the department's day-to-day functions and oversees all United States attorneys' offices. He worked behind the scenes, holding one of the department's most powerful positions and advising the deputy attorney general on the department's biggest investigations and most delicate policy matters.
Mr. O'Callaghan began working closely with Mr. Rosenstein nearly a year after Mr. Mueller took over the Russia inquiry into whether the Trump campaign had conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. The sensitivities around that inquiry became even more heightened as Mr. Mueller's team began to consider whether Mr. Trump himself had tried to obstruct the investigation.
Mr. Mueller ultimately said that he had "insufficient evidence" to determine whether the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, even though the campaign expected to benefit from the sabotage. The special counsel did not draw any conclusions about whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, leaving room for Mr. Barr to clear the president of that crime.
Senior Justice Department officials had considered making Mr. O'Callaghan the United States attorney in Manhattan. But that plan petered out in recent months, in part because the current United States attorney, Geoffrey S. Berman, had no plans to leave his post, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
This year, Mr. O'Callaghan had been in line to replace Jessie K. Liu as the United States attorney in Washington after Ms. Liu was nominated to join the Justice Department as its No. 3 official, the associate attorney general. But that plan fell through after the Senate declined to approve Ms. Liu's nomination, according to three people who had been briefed on those negotiations.

Texto completo: “Me cansé de cazar personas negras e hispanas debido a las cuotas de arresto”, dijo el ex oficial Christopher LaForce, en su declaración jurada, explicando su decisión de retirarse en 2015.
Su declaración siguió a una demanda por discriminación presentada contra el Departamento de Policía de Nueva York (NYPD), en la que varios oficiales recientemente dieron declaraciones juradas diciendo que el comandante Constantin Tsachas , que ayuda a supervisar gran parte del sistema en Brooklyn, instó a los oficiales a atacar a los pasajeros negros e hispanos por delitos de bajo nivel, como la evasión de tarifas. Y los desalentó de hacer lo mismo con los blancos o asiáticos.
Las tensiones han aumentado en el Metro en las últimas semanas, con viajeros denunciando y filmando con su teléfono lo que consideran la vigilancia excesivamente agresiva a pasajeros negros e hispanos.
Desde noviembre, algunos neoyorquinos han brincado torniquetes en protesta por los arrestos de jóvenes negros y de una hispana vendedora de churros.
El comandante en cuestión, Constantin Tsachas, estuvo a cargo de más de 100 oficiales entre 2011 y 2015. El distrito que dirigió abarca gran parte del sur de Brooklyn, incluidos diversos vecindarios de Sunset Park, Flatbush y Brighton Beach. Ahora es inspector adjunto.
Las declaraciones juradas firmadas se reunieron en los últimos meses como parte de la demanda, detalló The New York Times.
El inspector Tsachas y el Departamento de Policía se negaron a comentar, pero su representante sindical dijo que el inspector negó las acusaciones de mala conducta.
La aplicación de la ley en el Metro aumentó en el último año . Los oficiales de policía emitieron 22 mil boletos más por evasión de tarifas este año en comparación con 2018.
Cientos de oficiales más también se han desplegado en el sistema de tránsito en los últimos meses, lo que provocó un debate sobre el exceso de vigilancia y la criminalización de la pobreza.
El gobernador Andrew Cuomo ha sido severamente criticado por el despliegue ampliado, mientras la Autoridad Metropolitana de Transporte (MTA) se enfrenta a una inminente crisis financiera e intenta por proporcionar un servicio confiable en el Metro, evitando a los polizones e indigentes.
Tensions over aggressive subway policing have been rising in New York City. Last month, protesters marched through downtown Brooklyn chanting, “How do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D.”https://t.co/DzHyej3pTD

Texto completo: Miguel Jason Rodríguez (39), trabajador emigrante de Ecuador, fue identificado como uno de los seis muertos ayer en un balacera en un supermercado judío en Jersey City.
En el lugar funciona el negocio “Jersey City Kosher Supermarket”, el único negocio kosher en la zona, informó The Fayetteville Observer.
También murieron la dueña del local, Leah Minda Ferencz (33), y su primo Moshe Hirsch Deutsh (24), miembros de la comunidad judía ortodoxa; el detective Joseph Seals (40), considerado un héroe local; y los atacantes, el hombre David Anderson (47) y la mujer Francine Graham (50), que se cree están vinculados al grupo religioso “Israelitas Negros” (Black Hebrew Israelites), según The New York Times.
Desde anoche, el alcalde de Jersey City, Steven Fulop confirmó que los dos atacantes armados que provocaron el caos en Greenville, un barrio residencial, “apuntaron” a una tienda judía cuando intercambiaron disparos con la policía en un tiroteo de una hora.
Fulop, quien es judío, dijo que las autoridades llegaron a esa conclusión sobre la base de la investigación en curso, “después de una extensa revisión de nuestro sistema de circuito cerrado de televisión”.
Williams Machazek, pastor de la Iglesia “Nueva Vida” en Newark, identificó a como víctima Rodríguez, un miembro de su templo que emigró de Ecuador hace tres años.
Rodríguez, dijo Machazek, había estado trabajando en la tienda de comestibles en Jersey City durante más de un año para mantener a su familia, que incluye una esposa y una hija de 11 años.
Moshe Hirsch Deutch estaba de visita desde Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Desde NYC, el alcalde Bill de Blasio condenó el ataque y criticó el antisemitismo en varios mensajes en Twitter después de la declaración de Fulop.
“Esto confirma trágicamente que un patrón creciente de antisemitismo violento se ha convertido en una crisis para nuestra nación. Y ahora esta amenaza ha llegado a las puertas de la ciudad de Nueva York”, escribió De Blasio.
En declaraciones a NBC News agregó que el ataque “fue claramente un crimen de odio”, y que NYPD está “en alerta alta”.

Meat Industry Launches Counter Offensive Vs. Plant-based Foods, But Who’s Right?

Texto completo: The meat industry has a warning for consumers: Beware of plant-based meat.
That is the message behind a marketing campaign by the Center for Consumer Freedom, a public relations firm whose financial supporters have included meat producers and others in the food industry. In recent weeks the group has placed full-page ads in The New York Times and other newspapers raising health concerns about plant-based meat substitutes like the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger, which are designed to look, taste and even appear to bleed like real meat.
The ads call them “ultra-processed imitations” with numerous ingredients. “What’s hiding in your plant-based meat?” asks one ad featuring a sad face made of two patties and sausage. Another directs readers to a site that compares plant-based burgers to dog food. In November, the group’s managing director, Will Coggin, wrote an opinion piece in USA Today that labeled fake meats as ultra-processed foods that can spur weight gain, although the research on processed foods has not included plant-based meats. A few days later, the center’s executive director, Rick Berman, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal criticizing plant-based meats as highly processed and no healthier than meat. Its headline: “ ‘Plant-Based Meat’ Is All Hat and No Cattle.”
Kind of an endorsement
Impossible Foods, which makes a popular plant-based burger, said the campaign was misleading and fearmongering. The company says plant-based meat alternatives are better for consumers and better for the planet, requiring less land and water and producing fewer greenhouse gas emissions than meat from cattle. The new “disinformation” campaign, they say, is a sign that Impossible Foods’ mission - to disrupt the meat industry and replace animals in the food system - is working. “It’s a point of pride to have that organization come after us,” said Pat Brown, the company’s chief executive. “It’s hard to imagine a stronger endorsement.” (The Center for Consumer Freedom did not respond to requests for an interview.)
Unlike other vegetarian meat substitutes, the new plant-based burgers are winning over meat lovers. Market research firm NPD Group says that 90% of the customers purchasing them are meat eaters who believe the products are more healthful and better for the environment, said Darren Seifer, an analyst at NPD, which recently predicted that plant-based meats will have staying power because of their popularity with millennials.
“The two big brands, Beyond and Impossible, have replicated the burger experience without having to sacrifice the taste of the burger,” he said. “So now a lot of consumers feel like they have a healthier option, they are reducing the amount of meat they consume, and they just feel better about that.”
But are plant-based meats really better for you than meat? It depends on how you eat them, said Dr. Frank Hu, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Replacing a hamburger with a plant burger is not an improvement in diet quality if you chase it with french fries and a sugar-laden soda, Hu said.
For consumers trying to choose the healthiest option, Hu said studies comparing the metabolic effects of eating beef burgers versus plant burgers are currently underway. In the meantime, he considers the meat substitutes “transitional foods” for people who are trying to adopt more healthful diets.
Room for study
In August, Hu, along with a group of health and climate experts, published a report in JAMA that explored whether plant-based meats can be part of a “healthy low-carbon diet.” Studies show that replacing red meat with nuts, legumes and other plant foods can lower mortality and chronic disease risk, but it’s not possible to extrapolate that processed burgers made with purified soy or pea protein will have the same health benefits, Hu said.
Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat say the building blocks of their burgers are plants. The Beyond Burger has about 18 ingredients, including purified pea protein, coconut and canola oils, rice protein, potato starch and beet juice extract for coloring. Beyond Meat says it uses no genetically modified or artificially produced ingredients.
The Impossible Burger is made with similar basic ingredients, but it gets its protein largely from soy and potato, and it uses an iron-containing compound from soy called heme to enhance the burger’s meaty flavor. Both products use methylcellulose, a plant derivative commonly used in sauces and ice cream, as a binder.
Compared to a beef patty, the Impossible and Beyond burgers have similar amounts of protein and calories, with less saturated fat and no cholesterol. They also contain fiber; real meat does not. But compared to real beef, the two plant-based burgers are considerably higher in sodium, containing about 16% of the recommended daily value. An uncooked 4-ounce beef patty has about 75 milligrams of sodium, compared to 370 milligrams of sodium in the Impossible Burger and 390 milligrams in the Beyond Burger.
This fall, Burger King said it had its most successful quarter in four years, driven by sales of its plant-based Impossible Whopper. Dunkin’ Donuts announced it was rolling out a breakfast sandwich made with Beyond Meat sausages in 9,000 of its stores after a successful trial run in New York City. More than 50,000 grocery stores and restaurants, including fast-food chains like Subway, White Castle, KFC and Carl’s Jr., carry products from Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods.
Despite the popularity of plant-based burgers, beef burgers are still overwhelmingly the more popular choice at restaurants. Americans purchased 6.4 billion beef burgers at quick-service restaurants during the 12 months that ended in May, compared to 228 million plant-based burgers in the same period.
While meat consumption in America is at an all-time high, many Americans have shifted from eating beef to poultry. In the past three decades, beef intake has fallen by about a third, while chicken intake has more than doubled, and pork intake has remained fairly steady. Studies show that cost, convenience and health concerns are among the top reasons Americans have cut back on beef.
Mixed messages
But the health messages about red meat have been confusing. Earlier this year, a group of scientists challenged decades of nutrition advice, saying that warnings linking red meat consumption to heart disease and cancer are not backed by strong scientific evidence, though it was later revealed that the study’s lead author had past research ties to an industry group whose members include fast-food companies and a beef processor.
Meat producers are taking the fight against fake meat to lawmakers. At least 25 states have introduced bills making it illegal to use the words “beef” or “meat” on products made from plant ingredients or cultured meat that is grown in a lab. Missouri became the first state to pass such a law last year, which was initially proposed by the Missouri Cattlemen’s Association.
In October, Rep. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., the top recipient of livestock industry donations in the House, introduced a federal bill that would require companies to put the word “imitation” on their plant-based meat products. The bill calls for the products to carry a statement on their packages “that clearly indicates the product is not derived from or does not contain meat.”
Marshall, an obstetrician, said he introduced the bill after hearing from constituents. Patients of his told him they were confused about the health benefits of plant-based beef substitutes, and beef producers told him they were frustrated that the products are sold in grocery stores next to ground beef. “Kansas has a very large beef industry, and they said, ‘Why are we allowing this fake meat in the meat department?’ ” he said.

Texto completo: The list is the latest in a series of disclosures his campaign has made after it was criticized for lacking transparency.
WASHINGTON -- Pete Buttigieg on Tuesday released the names of nine clients, ranging from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan to the retail giant Best Buy, that he advised while employed as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company, a period of his life that has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks.
Mr. Buttigieg's client list also included some nonprofits, like the Natural Resources Defense Council, as well as several federal agencies.
Mr. Buttigieg was responding to pressure that had built in recent days over his work in his post-college years, which had begun to dominate the discussion surrounding his campaign and become fodder for opponents, notably Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who questioned why he had kept his client list secret.
Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., put out the client list one day after the firm announced that it would release him from a nondisclosure agreement he signed while working at McKinsey during his first three years after finishing his education.
The client list includes:

-
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan
- Best Buy
-
The Natural Resources Defense Council
- The Environmental Protection Agency
-
The United States Department of Energy
- The United States Postal Service
-
The United States Department of Defense
- The Energy Foundation
-
Loblaws, a Canadian supermarket chain

The Energy Foundation
Loblaws, a Canadian supermarket chain
"There's nothing particularly sizzling about the list of clients that I served," Mr. Buttigieg said during an MSNBC interview Tuesday night.
The variety of clients on the list shows Mr. Buttigieg worked on projects in the health care and retail industries, along with federal government projects relating to the environment and the economies in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as nonprofit environmental groups.
The list is likely to provide ammunition to those in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party who have sought to tag Mr. Buttigieg with the pejorative "Wall Street Pete" and argued that his "Medicare for all who want it" health care proposal, which would preserve private health insurance, is a sop to the insurance companies.
While Mr. Buttigieg has for years spoken about his efforts while working at McKinsey to foster economic opportunity in Iraq and Afghanistan, and wrote in his memoir this year about a project on Canadian cereal prices, the most politically troubling element of his client list might be his tenure working for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, a health care firm that at the time was in the process of reducing its work force.
Last week Mr. Buttigieg's campaign said his time in Michigan included "analytical work as part of a team identifying savings in administration and overhead costs." While it was not yet clear exactly what Mr. Buttigieg did at Blue Cross, his work appeared to come at about the same time the insurer announced that it would cut up to 1,000 jobs -- or nearly 10 percent of its work force -- and request rate increases.
The decision, announced in January 2009, came after the health insurance provider reported a loss of about $ 140 million primarily related to health care plans purchased by individuals. The company also announced that it was freezing pay for nonunion workers and cutting discretionary spending by 25 percent. In an interview published Tuesday by The Atlantic, Mr. Buttigieg said he was taken off the Blue Cross project in 2007, well before the layoffs were announced.
But when he was running for mayor of South Bend in 2011, Mr. Buttigieg seemed to refer to his tenure at Blue Cross as evidence that he had the skills necessary "to reimagine our budget from the bottom up."
"One of the things I did for a living was just that," Mr. Buttigieg said during a candidate forum. "So I remember one client organization that was a large insurance firm that had grown in such a way that there was a great deal of duplication and some people didn't even know what the people working for them were doing."
On MSNBC Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg said his work with Blue Cross had "nothing to do with claims or what they do with patients." Asked by host Rachel Maddow if his work led to layoffs, Mr. Buttigieg replied: "I doubt it. I don't know what happened after the time that I left, in 2007, when they decided to shrink in 2009."
The list of Buttigieg clients also included the United States Postal Service, which had called in McKinsey in an effort to stem growing losses in its revenues as use of the mail declined.
A report prepared by McKinsey in 2010 suggested that the Postal Service cut costs by replacing career employees with other workers and reduce benefits to bring them more in line with the private sector.
Mr. Buttigieg's Afghanistan work was done as the United States was spending millions in an effort to boost the country's economy. Much of that work focused on looking for ways to extract and market Afghanistan's rich natural resources, including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold and industrial metals like lithium.
But the overall project drew heavy criticism, and a former Pentagon official quipped during a Senate hearing in 2016 that at least part of McKinsey's work had been lost.
"In my experience with McKinsey, it is a 10-page slide deck, so I am not sure it is going to answer many questions anyway," said Brian McKeon, a deputy under secretary of defense.
The push for Mr. Buttigieg to release his client list, which aides to his presidential campaign rivals have whispered about for months, became amplified in the media in the last week following revelations that McKinsey has worked to help the Trump administration put in place its immigration policy, which is loathed by Democrats.
The disclosure comes as Mr. Buttigieg has surged ahead in some of the latest public polls of Iowa Democrats, whose caucuses will kick off the presidential nominating calendar on Feb. 3. It is the latest in a dizzying series of disclosures his campaign has made in the name of transparency.
Under pressure from Ms. Warren, who is weeks into a rhetorical battle with Mr. Buttigieg in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg on Monday agreed to allow reporters into his high-dollar fund-raising events and to disclose a list of his campaign's financial bundlers. The first of those open-to-the-press fund-raising events was scheduled for Tuesday night in New York.
Ms. Warren, who does not hold closed-door fund-raising events, had criticized Mr. Buttigieg for being part of a system that "creates conflicts every single day when candidates for president sell access to their time to the highest bidder."
Mr. Buttigieg had previously accused Ms. Warren of being "evasive" about her health care proposal and of hiding income she earned representing corporate law clients while she was a professor at Harvard University and other schools.
Ms. Warren ultimately did release a detailed health care proposal and said Sunday that she had earned $ 1.9 million over 30 years representing corporate clients, a fraction of what she could have made as a professor at elite law schools.
Mr. Buttigieg, 37, said last week that he had asked McKinsey to free him from a nondisclosure agreement he signed while a firm employee. On Monday, McKinsey announced that it would allow Mr. Buttigieg to reveal his clients, though he remains forbidden from discussing "confidential, proprietary or classified information obtained during the course of that work."
"We recognize the unique circumstances presented by a presidential campaign," a McKinsey spokesman said.

Texto completo: Readers urge a broader inquiry not just focused on Ukraine and express fear and hopelessness about what is happening in America.
To the Editor:
Re "House Democrats Unveil Articles of Impeachment Against Trump" (nytimes.com, Dec. 10):
As the Democrats make their case for impeachment, it is crystal clear that President Trump put his personal political interests above the security needs of our nation. This is indeed appalling. However, what I find most disturbing is the president's continual pronouncements that he's done nothing wrong.
If he does not understand that what he did was wrong, then I fear what he could do next and how a foolish or immoral act could put our country in jeopardy. Mr. Trump is a danger to all Americans (and beyond), and therefore must be removed from office.
Shoshana Silberman

To the Editor:
It is disappointing that the articles of impeachment against President Trump are limited solely to the Ukraine matter and exclude the uncontested acts of obstruction of justice documented in the Mueller report.
Overlooking Mr. Trump's blatant and repeated efforts to interfere with the Mueller investigation sets a dangerous precedent, encouraging lawlessness by future presidents and weakness by future Congresses.
The Constitutional Accountability Center has drafted three clear and well-documented articles of impeachment that tightly connect Mr. Trump's obstruction of the investigation into foreign interference in the 2016 election to his solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 election.
If Mitch McConnell secures blind loyalty from Senate Republicans to acquit Mr. Trump, it is all the more important that the articles of impeachment for all time document the full and sweeping extent of Mr. Trump's violation of his constitutional oath to preserve and protect the Constitution.

To the Editor:
Tears began rolling out of my eyes as I was sitting in my recliner on Monday watching the impeachment hearings in the Judiciary Committee. As I wiped them away, I realized they were coming from a place of hopelessness and sadness about what is happening in this country right now.
I am a 69-year-old retired woman who has lived through three impeachment inquiries now, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Kennedy brothers. I have lived in Africa for 12 years fighting for reproductive health rights, AIDS prevention and treatment, family planning, malaria prevention.
But through all of that I have never felt such hopelessness as I feel now in light of the vitriol, the divisiveness, the disrespect and the lies that we are now facing. How can we turn around from this path we are heading down?
For the G.O.P. to strategize about how to diminish what they know is the truth, how to twist facts to intentionally mislead the viewers -- how can one fight that? I cry as I have never cried before for the future of our country, and for democracy as a whole.

Texto completo: Legislation was introduced on Tuesday that would hold tech companies more responsible for an explosion in online child sexual abuse material and give law enforcement agencies more opportunity to gather evidence of crimes.
The bill, proposed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate, would require companies to retain information about illegal photos and videos found on their platforms for a longer period of time. Its sponsors said the bill was in response to a New York Times investigation, part of a continuing series, revealing that cases often went cold after businesses deleted the data.
Under the current law, tech companies are required to report the imagery to a federally designated clearinghouse and retain related information for 90 days. The bill would double that period and let companies hold on to the material even longer, provided it's for the purpose of combating further harm. Explicit photos and videos of minors, often referred to as "child pornography," are illegal to possess and must be reported to the authorities immediately.
Representative Anthony Gonzalez, an Ohio Republican who sponsored the bill, said it aimed to give chronically under-resourced investigators more time to gather evidence.
"The problem is that there's just too much in the system," he said. "There's too big of a backlog for everybody to process and effectively prosecute and go after the criminals."
The bill was simultaneously introduced in the Senate, where it was sponsored by Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, and Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat.
The Times reported that over 45 million images and videos were flagged by tech companies last year, more than double than in the previous year, exposing a system at a breaking point under the stress of so many reports. Interviews and a review of documents showed that the federal government had not fulfilled significant aspects of legislation passed over a decade ago that called, in part, for increased study of the problem and significant funding to fight it.
Many of the images portray horrific instances of abuse, including rape and torture of infants and toddlers. The material can stay online for years afterward, continuing to cause victims psychological harm and, in some cases, fear for their safety as online offenders stalk them in real life.
Because these cases sometimes cross state lines, reports can bounce between multiple law enforcement agencies before reaching the right jurisdiction. Technology companies can also be slow to respond to requests for information. When this process takes longer than the current 90-day retention period, investigators may be left with few clues to follow.
In one example from Polk County, Wis., an image of a child being violently sexually abused was discovered on a popular social networking site. The investigation stalled for over a year and the investigator retired before the company responded to repeated requests for information.
The new bill is part of a larger effort in Congress to tackle the problem of abuse, prompted by The Times's series. Lawmakers in both houses called for increased funding this fall, and a bipartisan group of senators sent questions last month to 36 online companies, asking them to describe in detail how they were combating child exploitation.
"These children cannot defend themselves," Mr. Gonzalez said. "These are enormous platforms. I believe inherently they have responsibility that sometimes they shirk."

Trump quietly working with Democrats even as they seek to oust him

Texto completo: President Trump and Republicans are quietly working closely and productively on legislation with Democrats even as the impeachment storm rages and the two sides hurl searing invective at each other.
“He has more relationships than anybody would care to confess with Democrats,” a source knowledgeable about Trump’s activities told the Washington Examiner, describing the president as “a very willing partner” when it comes to negotiating his priorities with Congress.
On issues where Democrats and Republicans share a common interest, they are finding the opportunity to create common cause — despite the political consequence for Democrats of helping a president running for reelection and for Trump of aiding a Congress looking for achievements, according to the source. The president “has found great partners and sustained partners in Congress,” particularly on trade, health policy, education, and employment.
Highlighting the cooperation is the steady work on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. Both parties have been meeting regularly with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Capitol Hill to ensure the deal is finished by the end of 2019. "Letting it slip to a presidential election year is a flirtation with danger when it comes to presidential politics," said Michael Zona, communications director for Sen. Chuck Grassley, who, as Finance Committee chairman, has taken a lead in the negotiations. A final agreement appears close at hand.
Lighthizer has “been working with us in good faith — we've been enjoying working with him,” a House Democratic said. The bill will “absolutely” make it to the floor by the end of the year, “it is 95% there.”
“We are so close,” the aide said. “Whatever Pelosi and [lawmakers] agree on in the House and the Senate” will go forward, “and then the president will sign.”
On Monday, Trump told reporters: “I'm hearing very good things. I hope they put it up to a vote. If they put it up to a vote, it's going to pass. A lot of Democrats want to pass it, too.”
Other items on the president’s wish list include legislation on prescription drug pricing, the creation of a Space Force as the sixth branch of the military, and finalizing a budget deal.
“I’m not quite sure what their thought process currently is,” said one source on the Democrats’ choice to impeach as bills and a looming budget crisis beckon. “There are a lot of potential legislative accomplishments that could be achieved in the next few weeks. Whether there is a calibration they need to go through and whether or not they do so, and what sort of conclusions they draw, we’ll have to wait and see.”
Motivating the left side of the aisle is that, for several weeks, failure to pass bills while pressing full-court on the president's impeachment has made Democrats in Trump-leaning districts vulnerable to criticism that they are privileging their party’s disdain for the president over legislative action.
November saw swing-state House Democrats Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Mikie Sherrill, Josh Gottheimer and Andy Kim of New Jersey, Xochitl Torres of New Mexico, Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Anthony Brindisi and Max Rose of New York, Cynthia Axne of Iowa, and Elaine Luria of Virginia in the crossfire of attack ads. And at the encouragement of Trump surrogates on the Virginia-based John Fredericks Radio Network, voters have confronted them on their impeachment stance by voters during Thanksgiving town halls.
Still, in the current heated climate, acknowledging a willingness to cooperate does not come easy. House Democrats have all but ignored USMCA publicly, according to an analysis conducted by a Republican congressional office that counted 468 remarks by Democratic lawmakers on the agreement, compared to 5,123 by Republicans, between January and December 2019. The deal is one of Trump's signature campaign promises.

Lori Loughlin spends holidays prepping for next big role: Testifying at her own trial

Texto completo: When her daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, were younger, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli loved to give them a white Christmas by packing the family up and flying — presumably by private jet — to Colorado so they could all play in the snow and ski.
More recently, though, the Giannulli family has stayed in Los Angeles in their Bel Air mansion, as the former Hallmark Channel star told Parade magazine in 2017. But Loughlin said they still enjoyed other holiday traditions: picking out a tree and decorating it. She said she and her fashion-savvy, social media influencer daughters also loved to go shopping.
“It’s really about getting together with family,” Loughlin said.
This year, the former “Full House” star and her family again will be in Los Angeles, but things will be far less jolly. That’s because Loughlin, 55, is facing the possibility of years in prison for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal and has been hunkering down in rooms with lawyers to prepare her defense, Us Weekly is reporting in its new issue.
The actress best known as wholesome Aunt Becky is participating in “grueling” mock trials, essentially rehearsals for what could be the biggest, most consequential performance of her life: defending herself in federal court against bribery, fraud and money laundering charges.
According to Us Weekly, Loughlin, 55, is “adamant” that she wants to testify, even though it’s never a requirement for defendants to take the stand and defense attorneys often advise against it.
“Lori has no choice at this point but to take this to trial and hope for an acquittal or a hung jury,” a source told Us Weekly.
Loughlin apparently believes she can convince a jury that she’s a sympathetic figure, another insider said. She and her husband are charged with paying $500,000 in bribes to get Olivia Jade, 20, and Isabella, 21, fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California.
Perhaps the veteran TV actress and media personality hopes she can use her star power and comfort in the spotlight to present herself as a loving mom who thought she was doing right by her daughters. Loughlin and her fashion designer husband also are expected to argue that they were duped into engaging in a bribery scheme concocted by college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer.
“She feels they’ll believe that the accusations against her don’t merit criminal prosecution, that she truly thought she was making a legal contribution to charity,” the insider told Us Weekly.
Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly will argue that they believed the money they paid to Singer and to his alleged accomplices at USC were legitimate donations to Singer’s education nonprofit and to the school’s athletic programs.
“Mossimo strongly believes they were victims of a con and did nothing wrong,” an insider previously told Us Weekly.
But as much as Loughlin and Giannulli agree on some issues related to their “united front” defense, they disagree on others. That includes Loughlin’s reported earlier desire to strike a plea deal with prosecutors. Now, Loughlin wants to testify, and her husband doesn’t think it’s a good idea at all, Us Weekly reported.
“Mossimo doesn’t want to testify, but will be forced to if Lori does,” the insider told the outlet.
Another worry for the couple is that Olivia Jade and Isabella may be called as prosecution witnesses to testify against their parents. The indictment alleges that Olivia Jade and Isabella participated in the bribery scheme by posing for photos on rowing machines. The photos were used for fake athletic profiles that Singer and his accomplices created in order to present the sisters to admissions officers as crew team recruits.
The prospect of Olivia Jade and Isabella testifying terrifies Loughlin, Us Weekly reported.
“Lori’s bereft when she talks about the girls being forced to testify at their trial,” the insider said. “She doesn’t understand how it got to this point.”
Legal experts say that the decision to testify is always up to a defendant. Juries are instructed to not hold it against defendants when they don’t take the stand.
“There are so many risks to testifying that every attorney worth his salt thinks long and hard about recommending it,” according to a post on AbovetheLaw.com. “No matter what the prosecutor’s evidence, if a defendant testifies that is what will determine the verdict.”
When a defendant testifies, she loses her right to remain silent. It also shifts the burden of proof, which normally is on the prosecution, the legal site said in its post. After a defendant testifies, juries must now look at two “stories” of the case.
“Whether the prosecution made its case or not, if they don’t like how the defendant came off, either because they don’t believe him or just don’t like him, they’ll generally convict,” the post said.
Defense attorneys may see an advantage to putting certain defendants on the stand, notably professional, educated defendants in white-collar cases who have no prior criminal history, the New York Times said. Attorneys may believe they can adequately prepare these defendants to put their cases in the best light.
“The problem in calling the defendant to testify is the second act: cross-examination,” the New York Times said. “Prosecutors often can hardly contain themselves at the thought of getting a shot at the defendant.”
The prosecutor’s strategy usually involves making the defendant uncomfortable and forcing her to respond to questions she may not want to answer, which puts her credibility on the line, the Times added.
For an attorney to decide whether to put a client on the stand, “it comes down to figuring out how well the defendant can perform on the witness stand, particularly cross-examination, as measured against the strength of the government’s case.”
If it’s a matter of “performing,” Loughlin may have an advantage, since performing in TV and in films has been her livelihood for several decades.
In that sense, Loughlin has begun to treat her trial preparation like a “full-time job,” doing the mock trials, meeting with her lawyers or discussing strategy over email,” Us Weekly reported.
Still, the actress also realizes that this could be her last Christmas at home, if the trial doesn’t go her way. For that reason, Loughlin also is trying to spend as much time with her husband and daughters as possible, Us Weekly said. After all, she also once said, “It’s important to make the effort to see your family around the holidays.”

Texto completo: In a bombshell report yesterday, the Justice Department Inspector General found that the Federal Bureau of Investigation made “fundamental errors” and persistently deceived a secret court to authorize surveilling a 2016 Trump presidential campaign official. Inspector General Michael Horowitz did not find that the FBI’s actions were spurred by political bias but that conclusion is not necessarily shared by Attorney General William Barr. Unfortunately, this is only the latest episode of decades of FBI misconduct before America’s most powerful secret court.
Perhaps the most jolting revelations in the IG report detail the FBI’s efforts to secure a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) search warrant to use against the Trump campaign after suspicions were raised of Russian collusion. A FISA warrant is the nuclear bomb of searches, authorizing the FBI “to conduct, simultaneous telephone, microphone, cell phone, e-mail and computer surveillance of the U. S. person target’s home, workplace and vehicles,” as well as “physical searches of the target’s residence, office, vehicles, computer, safe deposit box and U. S. mails,” as a FISA court decision noted. The FISA court is extremely deferential, approving 99% of all search warrant requests.
A litany of missteps by the FBI
The IG report concluded FBI officials made 17 “significant inaccuracies and omissions” in its submissions to the FISA court to secure warrants to target former Trump advisor Carter Page: “FBI personnel fell far short of the requirement in FBI policy that they ensure that all factual statements in a FISA application are ‘scrupulously accurate. ’ We identified multiple instances in which factual assertions relied upon in the first FISA application were inaccurate, incomplete, or unsupported by appropriate documentation, based upon information the FBI had in its possession at the time the application was filed. ”
The FBI refrained from launching a FISA warrant request until it came into possession of a dossier from Christopher Steele, a former British intelligent agent. The Steele dossier played "a central and essential role in the decision by FBI [Office of General Counsel] to support the request for FISA surveillance targeting Carter Page, as well as the FBI's ultimate decision to seek the FISA order," the IG report concluded. The FBI "drew almost entirely" from the Steele dossier to prove a “well-developed conspiracy” between Russians and the Trump campaign. The IG found that FBI agents were “unable to corroborate any of the specific substantive allegations against Carter Page” in the Steele dossier but the FBI relied on Steele’s allegations regardless.
The FBI withheld from the FISA court key details that would have undercut the dossier’s credibility, including a warning from a top Justice Department official that “Steele may have been hired by someone associated with presidential candidate Clinton or the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. ” The FBI also deceived the FISA court by wrongly claiming that Steele’s prior informant work had been “used in criminal proceedings” by the Justice Department. The CIA disdained the Steele dossier as “an internet rumor,” one FBI official told IG investigators. The IG report obliterated the credibility of the Steele dossier.
It's about time Peter Strzok sued: Firing him from the FBI was abusive Trump hypocrisy.
Inspector General Horowitz’s conclusion that FBI abuses and failures were not the result of political bias has not swayed some officials. Attorney General William Barr commented, "The Inspector General’s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U. S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken. " Barr complained that though the “the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory. . . surveillance was pushed forward for the duration of the campaign and deep into President Trump’s administration. " U. S. Attorney John Durham, who is leading a criminal investigation into the origins of the Russian probe, also issued a stunning dissent, noting that “we advised the IG that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened. ”
Instances of the FBI's abuse of power
Yesterday’s IG report was only the latest in a long series of revelations about FBI misconduct at the FISA court:
*In 2002, the FISA court revealed that FBI agents had false or misleading claims in 75 cases and a top FBI counterterrorism official was prohibited from ever appearing before the court again.
*In 2005, FISA chief judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly proposed requiring FBI agents to swear to the accuracy of the information they presented; that never happened because it could have “slowed such investigations drastically,” the Washington Post reported. So FBI agents continued to have a license to exploit FISA secrecy to lie to the judges.
*In 2017, a FISA court decision included a 10-page litany of FBI violations, which “ranged from illegally sharing raw intelligence with unauthorized third parties to accessing intercepted attorney-client privileged communications without proper oversight. ”
* In October, a secret FISA court ruling was released documenting the FBI’s illegal conducted warrantless searches of vast numbers of Americans’ emails despite congressional legislation seeking to curb FBI data roundups.
Everything else is noise and spin: The FBI properly, legally investigated 2016 Trump campaign
FBI machinations at the FISA court are especially perilous to American democracy because that court is extremely docile to federal agencies. The FISA court “created a secret body of law giving the National Security Agency the power to amass vast collections of data on Americans,” the New York Times reported in 2013 after Edward Snowden leaked court decisions. FISA decisions have “quietly become almost a parallel Supreme Court. . . regularly assessing broad constitutional questions and establishing important judicial precedents, with almost no public scrutiny. ” The court’s servility can boggle the imagination, such as its rubber-stamping FBI requests that bizarrely claimed that the telephone records of all Americans were “relevant” to a terrorism investigation under the Patriot Act, thereby enabling N. S. A. data seizures later denounced by a federal judge as “almost Orwellian. ”
Ironically, the FISA court was created in 1978 to prevent Nixon-style political spying. Unfortunately, it took three years for Americans to learn that the FBI relied on bogus claims to snare a FISA warrant targeting a presidential campaign. The power of the FBI and the secrecy of the FISA court are both dangers to our democracy unless there are radical reforms at both the FBI and the FISA court, future elections may be plagued by similar travesties.

If this sounds like something a grandpa you know could get into, consider giving him Audible Plus—for one month, three months, six months or a year—which offers unlimited access to Audible's streaming catalog and one credit each month to purchase an audiobook to hold onto forever.

2. For the grandpa who wants to find his roots: AncestryDNA kit

Well now’s the time to find out for sure. Help him figure his family roots once and for all with an AncestryDNA kit. We tried AncestryDNA and loved how detailed the ethnicity breakdowns were, which can help provide context for those old family tales.
Get the AncestryDNA Kit from $59.99
3. For the grandpa who likes to sleep in his chair: Our favorite weighted blankets
Weighted blankets make great gifts, and our favorite is the Gravity Blanket. This cozy blanket is perfect for the grandpa who loves sitting on his favorite chair and watching his shows (or, perhaps, dozing off).
For a less pricey option, we also love the YnM weighted blanket. It conforms to the body nicely without feeling suffocating and is thinner than other weighted blankets—though no less effective—so it's easy to store when not in use.
Get the Gravity Blanket for $215
Get the YnM Weighted Blanket on Amazon for $50.91
4. For the grandpa who loves to hit the links: Personalized golf balls
Technically, you don’t have to love golf because you’re a grandfather, but we’re pretty sure a lot of them do. If you know one who visits a course whenever he can, he’ll get a kick out of this set of golf balls, available in a three- or 12-pack, which can be personalized with any photo, text, or logo. Whether you deck it out with a photo of the grandkids or a simple “best grandfather by par” (which is what at least one reviewer ended up doing), it’ll be a worthy addition to his golf game—though it might end up becoming more of a keepsake than his other balls.
Get personalized golf balls from Etsy from $11.99
5. For the grandpa who wants to walk comfortably: A pair of reliable Crocs
Crocs remain popular for many reasons. They’re comfy and they make great shoes for both indoor and outdoor use.

Plus, there are a bunch of different styles and colors of Crocs, which means you can customize based on your grandfather’s tastes.

6. For the grandpa who can’t get enough ‘Star Wars’: A Disney+ subscription
Grandpa doesn’t need to dust off his VHS copies of the original trilogy to enjoy “Star Wars” in his own home. With a Disney+ subscription, he can not only watch “Star Wars” with the click of a button, but he can stream just about every Disney movie under the sun. It’s great for him and great for the grandkids—watch him light up as he claims the title of “Best Grandparent of the Year” for turning on “Frozen.”
Give a subscription to Disney+ for $79.99 a year
7. For the grandpa who's missing his masseuse: Foot massager
A foot massage is one of the best holiday gifts a person can give if your grandpa and he'll love our favorite, the Renpho Foot Massager. This machine allows for an ideal amount of customization with options to choose between heated and non-heated massages, a 15- or 30-minute timer and “low” “medium” and “heavy” knead and pressure intensity.
For a less expensive option, consider the Theraflow foot massager. This one is manual—using it requires rolling the feet over it to stimulate circulation instead of just plugging it in and pressing a button—but reviewers say it delivers an effective, soothing massage with minimal effort. Whichever option you go for, Grandpa will love the opportunity to relax with a massage at the end (or beginning, or middle) of the day.
Get the Renpho Foot Massager from Amazon for $139.99
Get the Theraflow Foot Massager from Amazon for $11.95
8. For the grandpa who needs a wallet upgrade: Bellroy Slim Sleeve Wallet
You know that Seinfeld joke about how dads basically stop updating their wardrobe right after they have kids? Well, in the time since transitioning from “father” to “grandfather,” Grandpa may have gotten a few new items of clothing—but his wallet could still be a relic of his pre-fatherhood days.
If he needs an update, one great option is the Bellroy Slim Sleeve wallet. This classic-looking leather wallet is sleek and unobtrusive but carries up to eight cards and some bills without getting bulky. It also has quick-access pockets for cards that are used daily and a pull tab system to store everything else.
Get the Bellroy Slim Sleeve Wallet from Amazon for $79
9. For the grandpa who’s always misplacing his keys: Tile Mate
Among wallets, keys, phones and more, there’s a lot of stuff that people might lose track of around the house. Help Grandpa make finding his things easier with a Tile Mate tracker. To use it, attach the small device to whatever it is that's always getting lost. When it’s misplaced, go into the Tile app on a smartphone or a desktop and signal an alarm to find anything within 200 feet of the device. If it’s the phone that can’t be found, just press a button on the tile and it will make the phone ring, even if it’s on silent.
If Grandpa doesn’t feel like fiddling with his phone or buttons when things go missing, he’ll be happy to know that Tile is also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Home—if he has an assistant and his keys go missing, all he has to do is say, “Where are my keys?”
Get the Tile Mate 2020 from Amazon for $24.99
10. For the grandpa who values coziness: A comfortable new robe
It’s hard to go wrong with giving a robe. They make timeless presents, especially if you spring for a more high-end option that will last a long time, like this flannel-lined option from L.L. Bean. The robe has the heft and style of a sweatshirt—including a hood—and offers a comforting, velvety-soft feel that reviewers say is perfectly suited to an armchair lounge or even taking the dog out or grabbing the paper early in the morning. Can you think of anything Grandpa would love more?
Get the Rugby Robe from L.L. Bean for $99
11. For the grandpa who’s the main grill master: Kabob baskets
If Grandpa’s a force to be reckoned with at the grill, he’ll get a lot of use out of these kabob baskets. This device—which comes in a set of four—has a cage-like contraption that allows you to fill it with meat and veggies to grill without the fussiness of skewers. The rosewood handles and stainless steel wiring allow for easy gripping and flipping, which should make preparing bite-sized meals on the grill a breeze.
Get the set of four kabob baskets from Uncommon Goods for $20
12. For the grandpa who wants a library at his fingertips: Our favorite Amazon Kindle
If he loves to read, Grandpa needs a Kindle. Our favorite Kindle is the Paperwhite, which mimics the experience of reading a real book as closely as any tablet can. This lightweight Kindle is water-resistant, plays Audible books and allows the reader to adjust the font size and screen brightness based on their reading styles. If you pair it with Kindle Unlimited, you can give Grandpa a host of free ebooks, too. And, if he has a library card, he can also use it to check out any books and read them on his Kindle for free by using a partner app like Libby.
Get the Kindle Paperwhite from Amazon for $89.99
13. For the grandpa who's serious about fitness: Fitbit Charge 5
If your grandfather enjoys being active, a fitness tracker makes a great gift, whether he likes biking or walking the dog every day. The Fitbit Charge 5 is one of our favorite fitness trackers—it's easy to set up and pair with smartphones, automatically detects sustained movement in workouts so the wearer always gets "credit" for doing them and has a built-in GPS that tracks location without having to bring along a phone.
Get the Fitbit Charge 5 from Amazon for $178.95
14. For the grandpa who needs to organize his memorabilia: Legacy Box
Whether stuffed under a bed, in a shoe box or somewhere in the basement, chances are pretty good that Grandpa has oodles of old photos, video tapes, audio tapes and who-knows-what else strewn about the house. It’s nice to know that they’re there—but they’re probably not getting too much attention in their current state.
Rectify this with Legacy Box, a service that digitizes tapes, photos, reels and audiotapes. All you have to do is box everything up, send it to Legacy Box with a pre-paid shipping label. After a short waiting period, you’ll receive a thumb drive, labeled DVD or access to a cloud file with everything on it, plus the original media that was sent in. This is a great way to preserve memories and make sure that everyone who should see them gets a chance to do just that.
Get Legacy Box from $59.98
15. For the grandpa with a sweet tooth: Cuisinart Vertical Waffle Maker
Treat your Grandpa to unlimited sweet treats with the Cuisinart Vertical Waffle Maker, our favorite waffle maker we've ever tested. Trust us: As odd as the vertical waffle maker may look, make no mistake that it makes exceptional waffles. The maker itself is easy to fill, doesn't allow waffle batter to overflow (making the clean-up easy) and is small enough to store on a counter or in a cabinet.
Get the Cuisinart Vertical Waffle Maker from Bed Bath & Beyond for $59.99
16. For the grandpa who’s proud of his fireplace: A log rack
Tending to a roaring fire is one of the best ways to stay cozy as the temperature drops, and there’s a lot more motivation to do it with a dedicated place to store wood and kindling. If you know a grandpa who loves making fires, he’ll appreciate this distinguished-looking log rack, which has one sloping shelf to hold wood in a sensible, stylish way.
Get the Logborough Log Rack from Wayfair for $54.99

Happy Socks sells a variety of gift boxes for all types of personalities, so comb through their inventory and find the box that most screams “grandpa” to you.
Get a gift box at Happy Socks from $19.60
21. For the grandpa who can get up to some mischief: A “Partner in Crime” tee
One of the perks of becoming a grandparent is that you don’t have to be quite as strict with the grandkids as you were with your own children—in fact, you can get in on some of the shenanigans yourself, should you feel so inclined. Any grandpa who’s taken this mindset seriously needs a new uniform for plotting pranks. May we suggest this t-shirt, which reads, “They Call Me Grandpa Because Partner In Crime Sounds Like A Bad Influence.”
You can also customize the name on the shirt by sending the makers a message, in case he’d rather be known as “Pop,” “Grandad” or anything else. The shirt comes in eight colors and unisex or male and female sizes from XS to 4X.
Get the Partner In Crime T-Shirt from Etsy from $9.99
22. For the grandpa who loves smart tech: Google Nest Hub Max
The Google Nest Hub Max makes an incredible gift for the grandpa who lives far away. This smart home device allows Grandpa to make video calls—with a smart display that auto zooms and pans to allow him to stay in focus if he's moving around during the call—as well as ask questions to Google, play YouTube videos, display the weather and watch the news. He can proudly set it on his bedside table, in the kitchen or wherever else he wants.
Get the Google Nest Hub Max at Bed Bath & Beyond for $229
23. For the grandpa with barking dogs: Compression socks
Whether he spends a lot of time sitting, standing, running or just has sometimes-sore feet, a pair of compression socks—which provide gentle pressure to the feet and may improve circulation and comfort—can be a great gift. We tested many pairs of compression socks and landed on two pairs that can make worthy gifts: Physix Gear (our pick for best value, which offer strong athlete-level compression) and Sockwell, our pick for best moderate compression, which offer lighter pressure and come in a winter-appropriate blend of merino wool, nylon and spandex.
Get Physix Gear Compression Socks from Amazon from $14.50
Get Sockwell Compression Socks from Amazon from $24.29
24. For the grandpa who doesn’t have the patience to vacuum: Eufy Robot Vac
Vacuuming can be a boring and arduous chore—but with a robot vacuum to do the work, it doesn’t have to be. We love the Eufy Robovac 11S, which we named our best value choice for robot vacuums. It has a slim design that allows it to get into tough-to-reach spots while still picking up a lot of dust, dirt and grime and it runs quietly enough that it doesn’t interfere with conversations or TV watching. All in all, it’s a great time-saver and a welcome gift for a grandpa who’s sure he’s done enough vacuuming to last a lifetime.

25. For the grandpa who lives for the ball game: An MLB used-bat bottle opener
If you have a grandpa in your life who never misses a game, consider giving him this unique bottle opener. It’s made of a repurposed bat from an MLB game with an insignia that displays the team name that played with it, from the Nationals to the Mets to the Dodgers. It also has a hologram number that you can look up to see which game exactly the bat was used in. Now, if you can figure out how to replicate that ball game hot dog, you’ll have the perfect present.
Get the MLB used bat bottle opener from Uncommon Goods from $115
26. For the grandpa who knows how to savor a good wine: A wine club membership
A grandpa with a discerning nose for cabernets and merlots probably just wants one thing: some interesting new wine to try. Help him do just that with a subscription to Winc, a service that delivers four bottles of wine a month, tailored to the customer's tastes.
We tried Winc and thought that it went above and beyond what you'd get from a simple wine delivery service. We loved its impeccable taste-matching and the extra information provided with each bottle. This includes details about its origin, alcohol and sulfur contents and what other Winc customers had to say about it, as well as recipes for delicious food pairings to serve with it.
Some states may be excluded from Winc's shipping areas, so make sure they can receive their wine before you sign them up for the service.
Give a Winc subscription from $29.95
27. For the grandpa who likes to have a cold one close by: A mini fridge
One of life’s greatest luxuries is having a chilled beer—or seltzer, or bottle of water, or soda or wine—right there when you need it. Help a grandpa achieve this milestone by giving him a mini fridge, such as this one from RCA that has three shelves and slots specifically designed for holding cans.
Reviewers say they use it for beverages, snacks, coffee creamer and anything else that needs to be chilled and kept handy.
Get the RCA Mini Fridge from Amazon for $189.99
28. For the grandpa who's always cold: A Patagonia fleece jacket
Patagonia makes great cozy sweaters for both men and women, but this fleece jacket is the perfect gift for grandpa in colder regions.

Plus, you can get it in eight different colors, so pick the one that best suits your grandfather.

29. For the grandpa who loves his morning reading time: The cult-favorite Squatty Potty
You may wonder how the Squatty Potty skyrocketed to fame. The simple answer? The toilet footrest works. And it could make an incredible gift for the grandfather who cherishes his … morning reading time. We tested the Squatty Potty and found that it really does make a difference when they need to 'go', so if you know this is something Grandpa would love and appreciate, we highly recommend it.
Get the Squatty Potty from Amazon for $24.99
30. For the grandpa with a lot of stories to tell: My Life Story So Far journal
If this grandpa has seen it all, he probably needs a good way to record those memories—and pass them down. The “My Life Story So Far” journal could fill the bill. It contains nine sections for different parts of life, from “The Early Years” to “What I Hope To Accomplish Next” with prompts that should conjure cherished memories of school days, first friendships and more. With it, he can reflect on what made them the person he is today and pass these memories along to his kids and grandkids.
Get the My Life Story So Far journal from Uncommon Goods for $30
31. For the grandpa who loves his house shoes: A cozy set of moccasins
Moccasins double as slippers and quick-errand shoes, meaning Grandpa may never actually take these shoes off. This sturdy pair from L.L. Bean comes highly recommended by reviewers, who say they fit true to size and are comfortable to wear at any time of year.

Texto completo: It's cold. It's dark. And spring is months away. No wonder you're exhausted. Here are four expert strategies to feeling revitalized, even in the most wintry of days.
I grew up in New England, so you'd think I'd be used to winter by now. But after wearing dozens of puffy coats thin over my lifetime, that's not the case: I hate the relentless chill, the heavy boots, the darkness. It's enough to make anyone want to curl up under a blanket and snooze until March.
But as Wirecutter's sleep writer, I also know that many sleep-promoting products don't actually do much. Winter tiredness is as mental as it is physical, and you need to consider things both in and out of the bedroom to reawaken your fun-loving self. To help make your seven to eight hours of sleep feel exactly that, here are four expert-approved strategies.
Manage your lighting
Shorter days are largely to blame for the blahs. Light controls our circadian rhythm. Its presence suppresses the flow of the sleep hormone melatonin; its absence encourages it. When sunlight takes its own sweet time to arrive in the morning and slinks away before dinner, that sleepy feeling prevails, even if we've just slept.
To mimic the refreshing effects of a bright spring morning -- but in the darkness of 6 a.m. in winter -- a sunrise alarm clock might help. We recommend the Philips Wake-Up Light HF3520. Its light gradually fills the room and peaks at the designated time. There's a backup alarm too, which I set to the sound of birds chirping so I can pretend it's actually May.
A more integrated strategy: Outfit your home with smart bulbs instead, which you can program to brighten just as you would a sunrise alarm clock. If the thought of entering a dark home after work makes you want to ditch all household obligations, you can also arrange lights to turn on before you walk through your door. Philips Hue, Wirecutter's smart-bulb pick, offers lighting "formulas" such as brighter intensities in the morning and warmer glows in the evening. (While you're at it, why not program your smart speaker to play whatever song fires you up?)
For an extra kick, light therapy lamps -- like our pick, the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus Lamp -- might help. Doctors often recommend these for seasonal affective disorder (S.A.D.), a type of depression triggered by certain seasons. (Talk to yours about whether the device is appropriate for you and how best to use it.)
Chris Winter, M.D., author of "The Sleep Solution," keeps a lamp in his office in the winter and turns it on for 10 minutes in the morning (and, if he's dragging, also in the afternoon). "Your brain feels as if the sun came out and you feel more awake," he said.
Choose good food over bad takeout
Fruits and vegetables are appealing in summer, but when it feels like Siberia out there, comfort foods, preferably takeout, hit the spot. But you don't have to be a dietitian to know they leave you feeling sluggish.
Making meals at home a few times a week can help curb the damage. A colorful range of produce -- "at least three different colors per meal," said Sean Casey, a registered dietitian and sports performance nutritionist -- supplies the vitamins and minerals that fuel your body's so you feel less tired.
Prep food with low-effort, fast-working appliances. Trading my decades-old jalopy of a blender for a more efficient model (I got our budget pick, the KitchenAid 5-Speed Classic Blender) made it easier to jump-start the day with a smoothie instead of a bagel. I can make soups and salad dressings in it, too. The Instant Pot, the Internet-famous electric pressure cooker (it's also our favorite), cooks up energy-sustaining proteins and high-quality carbohydrates faster than food delivery could hope to be.
Hack your exercise and your caffeine
Making the most out of both requires you to accept a couple of counterintuitive truths.
First, exercise: To increase feelings of energy, you have to expend more energy through physical activity, said Deborah Riebe, Ph.D., associate dean of the College of Health Sciences at the University of Rhode Island. There's no need to overexert yourself; you'll sense an immediate shot of energy after 20 minutes or more of low- to moderate-intensity exercise. Even shorter bursts might help.
In a small University of Georgia study, subjects felt more energized after using stairs for 10 minutes than they did after taking a 50-milligram caffeine pill or placebo. This can-do feeling lasted for about 20 minutes -- less than if you exercised longer, but still notable. Regular exercisers generally feel more energetic than non-exercisers, so fit in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise (where you breathe hard but can still talk) five days a week.

Now, about that caffeine: To maximize the effects of coffee, drink less of it and drink it less often (limit yourself to a cup a day, or try decaf or tea); reserve it for the times you really need it, said Sergi Ferré, M.D., Ph.D., a National Institute on Drug Abuse senior investigator and chief of the Integrative Neurobiology Section. For a one-two punch, go for a brisk walk or head to the stairs, then add a chaser of coffee, the effects of which will kick in after the exercise effects wear off, said Patrick O'Connor, Ph.D., the stair study's co-author.
Get the sleep tools that matter
With so many energy sappers in winter, getting enough sleep is crucial. Avoid alcohol and heavy meals before sleep and don't let holiday festivities derail your regularly scheduled bedtime. Put away the laptop and tablet an hour before you turn in (or diminish blue light with an app like f.lux).
If you're tired but can't fall or stay asleep, give your bedroom a once-over. Don't overheat the space (around 68 degrees Farenheit is best). If rowdy neighbors or a loud radiator keeps you up, consider ear plugs (we think the Mack's Slim Fit is best for sleep) or a white noise machine (Wirecutter's pick is the LectroFan). If your neighbor's aggressive holiday lighting penetrates your curtains, install temporary blackout shades (our budget pick, Redi Shade, is a good quick fix) or invest in a sleep mask (we like the Nidra Deep Rest).
Finally, don't let the stresses of the season get to you. Taking deep breaths can help. For guidance, find free preview sessions on Headspace, Wirecutter's favorite meditation app. They've made it much easier for me to fall asleep -- if only so I can curse the winter with far more vigor the next day.

Documents reveal misleading public statements on war in Afghanistan

Texto completo: Washington • Thousands of pages of documents detailing the war in Afghanistan released by The Washington Post on Monday paint a stark picture of missteps and failures — and those assessments were delivered by prominent U.S. officials, many of whom had publicly said the mission was succeeding.
The U.S. military achieved a quick but short-term victory over the Taliban and al-Qaida in early 2002, and the Pentagon’s focus then shifted toward Iraq. The Afghan conflict became a secondary effort, a hazy spectacle of nation building, with intermittent troop increases to conduct high-intensity counterinsurgency offensives — but, overall, with a small number of troops carrying out an unclear mission.
Even as the Taliban returned in greater numbers and troops on the ground voiced concerns about the U.S. strategy’s growing shortcomings, senior U.S. officials almost always said that progress was being made.
The documents obtained by The Post show otherwise.
“We were devoid of a fundamental understanding of Afghanistan — we didn’t know what we were doing,” said Douglas Lute, a retired three-star Army general who helped the White House oversee the war in Afghanistan in both the Bush and Obama administrations.
“What are we trying to do here?” he told government interviewers in 2015. “We didn’t have the foggiest notion of what we were undertaking.”
The 2,000 pages of interviews were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request and years of legal back-and-forth with the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, according to The Post. Formed in 2008, the office has served as a government watchdog for the war in Afghanistan, releasing reports quarterly on the conflict’s progress, many of which publicly depicted the shortcomings of the effort.
In one interview obtained by The Post, a person identified only as a senior National Security Council official said that the Obama White House, along with the Pentagon, pushed for data that showed President Barack Obama’s announced surge in 2009 was succeeding.
“It was impossible to create good metrics. We tried using troop numbers trained, violence levels, control of territory and none of it painted an accurate picture,” the official told interviewers in 2016, according to The Post. “The metrics were always manipulated for the duration of the war.”

Jane Fonda: The climate emergency is a political emergency

Texto completo: It should come as no surprise that I believe in the power of protest. That’s why I moved to Washington to start what I call Fire Drill Fridays, joining the millions of young people around the world who turned out in the fall for protests to demand that our leaders act to save their futures.
We must all face the harsh reality that our planet is rapidly approaching an irreversible tipping point, beyond which the unraveling of our ecosystems will be beyond our control. Scientists have made clear that we now have less than 11 years to reduce fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions roughly by half, and 20 years after that to cut them to net zero, to stabilize the rise in temperatures by the end of the century and meet the goal of the Paris agreement on climate change.
Last summer — as the wildfires wreaked havoc on my home state, California, and young people like Greta Thunberg so powerfully reminded us that we are the last generation that can prevent an unthinkable global catastrophe — I decided it was time for me to do more.
There are many things we can all do. We can join protests, engage in civil disobedience and risk arrest, but we must also see this as the uniquely critical political moment it is.
Despite widespread agreement among the world’s scientists that we are living through a climate emergency requiring profound economic and social change, the United States government is failing to act. It’s not that the American public doesn’t want an end to wars over oil, or a stable climate, clean oceans, safe and abundant water and healthy air.
No. Let’s be clear: Over decades the fossil fuel industry has hijacked our political system, and we have failed to elect enough leaders who are not beholden to the industry’s interests. The Center for Responsive Politics has documented that the oil and gas industry alone has spent some $218 million on lobbying in 2018 and 2019. In addition, oil and gas interests have contributed about $27 million to Senate and House candidates and party committees in the 2020 election cycle. Fossil fuel interests are subverting our democracy.
In just the past year, the United States has experienced deadly wildfires, devastating flooding and the hottest month ever recorded, all driven, at least in part, by climate change. What is President Trump’s response? He’s pulling the United States out of the Paris agreement and rolling back 85 environmental safeguards, including important and consequential climate initiatives. This should not be surprising; he once called climate change a “hoax.” The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is also blocking efforts to deal with the climate crisis.
We have reached a time in this fight when the only way forward is to organize, mobilize and vote politicians who won’t act out of office. We must overcome the power of the fossil fuel industry and elect an environmental champion for president and a congressional leadership ready to move forward aggressively with a Green New Deal to save us and the planet, starting the day they take office.
Winning at the ballot box is how we will succeed in building a more just and equitable economy, one thriving from good clean energy jobs. It’s how we will secure a habitable planet for future generations. It’s how we will protect our cherished public lands and species, and ensure all Americans have safe water and clean air — especially low-income communities and communities of color who for too long have borne the brunt of inaction.
The good news is that a growing number of voters understand the urgency of the challenge we face. Two-thirds of Americans say the government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change, including 90 percent of Democrats and 39 percent of Republicans, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. Some Democratic presidential candidates have released climate plans that match the urgency of the crisis. We must pressure others to do the same. We must not vote for any candidate who accepts money from the fossil fuel industry.
Greenpeace is ranking the candidates based on their support for the Green New Deal and ending new fossil fuel extraction immediately. Through the Change the Climate 2020 program, the League of Conservation Voters is tracking what every candidate is saying about climate change. The group’s political committee, the LCV Victory Fund, is scaling up campaigns in battleground states. I’ve seen the details of the strategy and I’m telling you we can win on climate.
We must start to live our lives as if this is an emergency, because it is. Each of us one day will have to answer this question: What did I do to protect the planet for our children, grandchildren and so many precious species while we still had time?
I’ve still got a lot of fight left in me. I will not look back on Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the election, and wonder what more I could have done.

Anne Hathaway on 'heartbreaking' eco-drama 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013.
DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."
After roles in "Serenity" and "The Hustle" earlier this year, Anne Hathaway is back on the big screen this fall with "Dark Waters," pictured, which tackles industrial pollution.

Texto completo: Impeachment Week 12: House Judiciary Committee to receive briefing on Ukraine
Intelligence and Judiciary Committee staffers will brief the Judiciary Committee, the panel now leading the inquiry, about the lengthy report released by Democratic lawmakers last week. The report, referencing President Donald Trump's involvement with Ukraine, determined the president solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election. After learning more about the Ukraine report and the legal basis for impeachment, Judiciary members must then decide whether to pursue other accusations. Rank-and-file lawmakers have said the committee could begin drafting articles as early as this week, in order to meet an informal deadline to have a House vote this month.

Justice watchdog set to release report on FBI surveillance of Trump campaign
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Monday is expected to release his long-awaited report into potential surveillance abuses by the FBI, focusing on the monitoring of Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. The review centered on the FBI's surveillance of Page during the early stages of its investigation into Russian election interference and possible ties to the Trump campaign. Among the most politically charged areas of the review is whether the FBI abused its surveillance authority due to bias against the president. While the report is expected to be sharply critical of the bureau, The New York Times has reported that the inspector general is not expected to conclude that top FBI leaders acted out of bias.

Trump's profits from private businesses to get hard look from federal appeals courts
An obscure provision of the Constitution that Donald Trump ridiculed as "this phony Emoluments Clause" will be debated in two federal appeals courts this week, representing yet another legal threat to the embattled president. Courts in the District of Columbia and Richmond, Va. , will hear arguments that the president routinely receives gifts from foreign and U. S. government officials. The question: Does that violate the Constitution? Democrats in Congress, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, and some of Trump's competitors in New York City say the answer is yes. The Justice Department says the answer is no. On Monday, that debate will come before a three-judge panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
And the 2020 Golden Globes nominees are . . .
We'll find out Monday as the 77th Golden Globe Awards nominees are revealed. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which honors achievements in film and television, announced last month that Ricky Gervais will host the show for a fifth time. Among the favorites to grab film nominations include Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman," racing film "Ford v Ferrari" and Quentin Tarantino's 1960s fantasy "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. " The three-hour award show is set to air live Jan. 5, 2020 on NBC.

This iconic Maine candy is named for a colorful, 19th-century preacher who isn't from Maine

Texto completo: Why is Maine's favorite holiday candy an odd combination of potato, coconut and chocolate, and why is it named for a colorful evangelical preacher who wasn't even from Maine?
Right now, parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles across Maine are whipping up Needhams -- essentially, shredded coconut, powdered sugar and mashed potatoes (and butter in some recipes), which is shaped into a square or rectangle and dipped into semi-sweet melted chocolate.
Though they're good any time of year, Needhams are a particular favorite around the holidays, as they keep for several weeks (if they last that long before being gobbled up) and can be made in big batches and given out as gifts, often alongside other homemade sweet treats, such as peanut butter balls, peanut brittle and fudge.
So why, exactly, are they called Needhams? The answer to that seems a bit out of left field, in terms of why on earth such a candy was named after a guy like George C. Needham, an Irish immigrant and evangelical Protestant preacher who rose to fame in New England and the mid-Atlantic in the early 1870s.
In his obituary in The New York Times in February 1902 -- among the only sources of information on the man, aside from his voluminous writings on spiritual matters -- it states that he was born in Ireland in 1846. His obituary claims that when he was 10 years old he was put on a ship bound for South America, and was tortured by the captain and tattooed against his will during the long journey. Eventually Needham was taken ashore in Patagonia, where he claimed he was taken captive by "cannibal Indians" who were going to "make a feast of him," but they stopped when they saw his tattoos.
(Given that there is absolutely no historical record of the Tehuelche people of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego ever practicing cannibalism in any form, this seems a particularly dubious and, unsurprisingly, racist claim.)
[iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hDNFmINaWQc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen height="315" width="560"]
As an adult, Needham became a preacher, first in England and Ireland, and then eventually in New England. It's there that he became famous (or infamous) for his fervent preaching of the gospel in tent revivals across the Northeast, promoting faith healing, predicting the imminent second coming of Jesus Christ and railing against Catholics. He became a famous name in New England, publishing six books and going on preaching tours of Japan and China. He eventually settled on Boston's North Shore, where he died in 1902 at age 56.
So why is a Maine candy named after this colorful traveling proselytizer? According to a 1986 story in the Christian Science Monitor, a Portland confectionary company called Seavey's supposedly came up with the odd combo of potato, coconut and chocolate in 1872. According to the newspaper, the owner of the company said something along the lines of "Let's call 'em needhams, after the popular preacher!" And, well, that was that. The Needham was born.
Though Needhams were initially sold commercially, the recipe was easy enough for home cooks to make in their own kitchens. The candy truly became popular during the Great Depression, as potatoes were a cheap and plentiful ingredient that thrifty cooks put to use in lots of recipes.
Seavey's continued to make the candy until sometime in the mid-20th century, when the candy began to be produced and distributed by Lou-Rod Candy in Lewiston. That company closed in the mid-2000s, but today, lots of other small candy makers continue to produce the iconic treat, including Bixby & Co. in Rockland, Maine Needhams in Saco and Wilbur's Chocolate in Freeport.
For many Mainers, however, the best makers of these odd little candies are the generations of folks who spend an afternoon or two each December dipping little squares of potato and coconut into chocolate to give to loved ones for the holidays.
Though there are variations on the recipe that call for butter in the potatoes or shortening added to the chocolate, beloved former Bangor Daily News columnist Brownie Schrumpf's recipe for Needhams likely hews as close to the original recipe as possible.Maine Needhams
3/4 cup boiled and mashed potatoes (no seasoning or milk)
4 cups powdered sugar
4 cups shredded coconut
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 squares baking chocolate
1. Mix mashed potatoes and powdered sugar. Stir in coconut, vanilla and salt, and blend well.
2. Press into a buttered pan so that the candy is about 1/2 inch in depth.
3. Melt chocolate over warm, but not hot, water. (Too hot water causes melted chocolate to have white streaks when it hardens.)
4. Slice mixture into squares and dip each square with a fork into the chocolate, letting each square cool on wax paper. Or pour chocolate over candy, then cool and cut in squares. Serve.
Do you have a favorite twist on Needhams? Leave a note in the comments.

Anne Hathaway on 'heartbreaking' eco-drama 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.

So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."

Remembering the stories, lessons of the late Larry Brown

Texto completo: Fans of the late Oxford author Larry Brown need wait no longer to own a collection of his career short works in one volume, with the release of Algonquin's "Tiny Love: The Complete Stories of Larry Brown."
It was fitting that writer Jonathan Miles, (author of the novels "Anatomy of a Miracle," "Want Not" and "Dear America Airlines," and who considered Brown to be both close friend and mentor since they met in Oxford in the early '90s) would be the one to contribute the foreword to the book.
"Larry published six novels, a memoir, a book of essays, and all the stories (in this new book), carving his name, indelibly, onto the thick tree trunk of American literature," Miles states in the foreword. "He strained and he faltered, yes, but he never lost his faith."
Without any training in writing or previous publication of a single piece, Brown literally taught himself to write – and he persevered through seven years of rejections until the publication of his first collection of short stories, "Facing the Music," in 1988. After his first novel, "Dirty Work," was published, he would quit his job as a firefighter in Oxford to devote his efforts fulltime to writing.
Among other recognitions, Brown would go on to win the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters Award for Fiction, the Mississippi Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts, and the Southern Book Award for Fiction – twice.
He died of an apparent heart attack at his home near Oxford in 2004.
Miles, a former columnist for the New York Times, served as a contributing editor to several national magazines, and his journalistic work appeared in the annual Best American Sports Writing and Best American Crime writing anthologies. A former longtime resident of Oxford, he now lives in rural New Jersey.
Miles shares his thoughts and memories about his friendship with Brown below.
How did the idea come about to publish all of Larry Brown's work in one volume, and how were you chosen to write the foreword to this book?
The idea had been bouncing around, among Larry's family and friends, for the last decade or more. The links between his two story collections – "Facing the Music" in 1988 and "Big Bad Love" in 1990 – are so strong that combining them felt like a natural and graceful merger. The greater desire, however, was to finally corral all the stray stories that Larry published in magazines and anthologies, so as to gather the entirety of his short fiction into one definitive volume. Those includes his wild masterpiece, "A Roadside Resurrection," which appeared in the Paris Review, as well as "Tiny Love," the prickly, lovelorn title story, which Larry published in a charity anthology, as well as the early stories he published in biker and horror magazines. I'd been shepherding the idea along, over the years, and was honored when Algonquin, Larry's longtime publisher, asked me to write the foreword.
Tell me about your friendship with Brown. How did you meet him, and what did you learn from him as a writer?
I met Larry in 1992, a very memorable meeting that I wrote about in the foreword. It involves dancing on a table! Despite a 21-year age difference, we were instant pals. The Brown family adopted me, in just about every way, and neither Larry's passing nor my move up north ever changed that – when I'm with them, I'm home.
As for writing, I've often said that my writing classroom was Larry's pickup, and my classes were the hours Larry and I spent riding Lafayette County backroads.
He often traced the origins of stories and scenes on those drives, pointing out the location of some real-life event and then explaining how he'd worked it into fiction, how he'd transformed it into art. Sharing the recipe with me, in a sense.
But the greatest lesson Larry gave me, and gave every artist, was the example of his persistence. Despite years of rejection, he never stopped writing. The only failure in art, he taught me, is not making art. You must always keep working.
What do you admire about his work, and what drew you to it?
Larry Brown wrote about human frailties, about people in dire straits – emotional, romantic, financial, existential. The setting was almost always the rougher corners of north Mississippi, but the frailties were universal. Good people doing bad things, bad people doing good things.
With limitless compassion, Larry sought to reconcile such human mysteries.
From the first page he liked to load his characters with trouble – he called this "sandbagging" – and then chronicle their struggles to cast off this load, like the Old Testament's God lobbing ordeals at Job. Yet by gauging what they could endure Larry showed what all of us can endure. There was a lot of darkness in Larry's work but tremendous light, too.
Why was it important to finally publish all of Brown's short work into one volume?
The hope is that this big new volume will draw a new generation to Larry Brown's work and will reboot appreciation for one of the most singular voices in American literature. The people Larry wrote about don't often appear in literary fiction, or, when they do, are rarely afforded the breadth of humanity that Larry gave them, the full bandwidth of their existence.
A young novelist from Alabama recently wrote me to say that he'd never met folks like himself and his family in books until reading his first Larry Brown book. Tim McGraw, a huge Larry fan, once told me that, unlike with most books he reads, he "recognized" the people in Larry's work.
I hope this volume kindles more moments like that. I hope it leads more readers into Larry Brown's north Mississippi, down those windy backroads. And I hope it helps to further cement his legacy as one of this state's – and for that matter this nation's – greatest writers.
What are some of your favorites among Brown's work, and why?
In putting this collection together, I was struck, anew, by his story "Samaritans," which appeared in "Facing the Music."
The setup for the story sounds like a joke setup: a little kid walks into a bar. But the story veers into dark, unsettling directions, and ultimately just claws at your heart.
I've probably read it dozens of times but each time I do it feels slightly different – tonally, morally, the works. Certain paintings are like that; there's always something new to see. Likewise, certain songs. That's a hallmark of great art: it feels inexhaustibly alive.

Texto completo: Before issuing his own condolences, the president channeled the Saudi king's, and avoided any discussion of the hard questions about why the U.S. is training Saudi officers.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- When a Saudi Air Force officer opened fire on his classmates at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla., on Friday, he killed three, wounded eight and exposed anew the strange dynamic between President Trump and the Saudi leadership: The president's first instinct was to tamp down any suggestion that the Saudi government needed to be held to account.
Hours later, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that he had received a condolence call from King Salman of Saudi Arabia, who clearly sought to ensure that the episode did not further fracture their relationship. On Saturday, leaving the White House for a trip here for a Republican fund-raiser and a speech on Israeli-American relations, Mr. Trump told reporters that "they are devastated in Saudi Arabia," noting that "the king will be involved in taking care of families and loved ones." He never used the word "terrorism."
What was missing was any assurance that the Saudis would aid in the investigation, help identify the suspect's motives, or answer the many questions about the vetting process for a coveted slot at one of the country's premier schools for training allied officers. Or, more broadly, why the United States continues to train members of the Saudi military even as that same military faces credible accusations of repeated human rights abuses in Yemen, including the dropping of munitions that maximize civilian casualties.
"The attack is a disaster for an already deeply strained relationship," Bruce Riedel, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and a former C.I.A. officer who has dealt with generations of Saudi leaders, said on Saturday. It "focuses attention on Americans training Saudi Air Force officers who are engaged in numerous bombings of innocents in Yemen, which is the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world," he said, noting that the Trump administration had long been fighting Congress as it seeks to end American support for that war.
But even stranger, said Mr. Riedel, was "the president's parroting of the Saudi line" before learning the results of an investigation into whether the gunman acted alone, or had allegiances to Al Qaeda or terrorist groups.
For the White House, the calculus is simple: Saudi Arabia is not only critical to world oil supplies -- though no longer critical to the United States' -- it is the only regional power able to counter Iran. The result, former members of the Trump administration say, has been a dismissal of any critiques that could weaken that bond.
Mr. Trump was so quick and so eager to assure the Saudis that the relationship would continue before anyone knew how to categorize the shooting that it raised questions about how the administration would have responded if the suspect had been an Iranian, or an immigrant from Mexico. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump often cited the killing of a young woman in California by an undocumented immigrant as a reason to crack down on immigration and build a wall along the southern border.
"Had an attack been carried out by any country on his Muslim ban, his reaction would have been very different," said Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East negotiator and now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
"But when it comes to Saudi, the default position is to defend," he said, "Driven by oil, money, weapons sales, a good deal of Saudi feting and flattery, Trump has created a virtually impenetrable zone of immunity for Saudi Arabia."
It was hardly the first time Mr. Trump had shown such tendencies. After the brutal killing in Istanbul of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and a legal American resident, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo played down American intelligence findings that closely tied Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to the matter. The findings suggested he had connections to the members of the hit team sent to Turkey -- and almost certainly played a role in ordering them to bring Mr. Khashoggi back to the country by force.
Mr. Trump's and Mr. Pompeo's initial promises to follow the evidence wherever it led dissipated. Over the past year, Mr. Pompeo has expressed deep annoyance whenever the topic is raised. The United States was awaiting the results of a Saudi investigation, he often said, as if he expected that to offer a full accounting. And he told members of Congress that no matter the truth of what unfolded, the relationship between the kingdom and Washington was too important to be held hostage to one vicious, ill-thought-out act.
No American assessment of what the Saudi leadership knew has ever been made public.
Before the shooting on Friday, the White House was already fighting efforts in Congress to cut military aid to the Saudis, a reflection of anger over the Khashoggi murder and continuing war in Yemen. But the Pensacola attack underlined the continuing instinct to protect the relationship.
"If Trump wants to convey condolences from Saudi King Salman, fine," Mr. Miller wrote on Twitter after the shooting. "But you don't do it on day -- Americans are killed -- untethered from a message of ironclad assurances from King to provide" whatever cooperation is necessary to understand the gunman and his motives. "Otherwise Trump sounds like what he has become -- a Saudi apologist."
After Mr. Pompeo announced that he had spoken with the Saudi foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud, about the shooting, Martin Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel and longtime Middle East negotiator, tweeted: "Isn't it interesting how quick Trump and Pompeo are to broadcast Saudi government condolences for the murder of three Americans and how slow they were to criticize the Saudi government's murder" of Mr. Khashoggi.
Still, the bond between the countries is weakening, as the erosion of support in Congress shows. A negotiation over providing nuclear technology to the Saudis, a huge push early in the administration, has stalled. The chances that the military support will remain at current levels appear slim.
"The U.S.-Saudi relationship is on life support," Mr. Riedel said, noting that it would be in jeopardy if a Democrat were to win the 2020 election. "Even Joe Biden is calling the Kingdom a 'pariah' that needs to be punished," he said, referring to the former vice president, who had for decades supported a strong relationship with the Saudis.

THE IMPEACHMENT IMPASSE TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR HAS JUSTIFIED THE PROCESS, BUT IT MAY STILL COST THE DEMOCRATS DEARLY IN 2020

Texto completo: The irony the Democratic impeachers are courting in the latest phase of their drive to remove Donald Trump from the White House is that their efforts may have the effect of helping him win a second term in the White House.
The inaugural hearing in the Judiciary Committee included political maneuvers worthy of the Cirque du Soleil. But while the Montreal troupe was based on the artistry of street performers, the Washington hearings put on display the tactics of street fighters.
Each side - the Democrats eager to impeach Mr. Trump, the Republicans just as eager to defend him - followed its prescribed choreography. No improvisation, no deviation from the scripts established by the ballet masters of each side, in fact no new facts.
That is because of the danger the Democrats implanted in the Judiciary Committee proceedings: The first hearing - a legal seminar spiced up with the pas de deux of politics - was designed as a predicate to impeachment. But the way the Democrats are proceeding could not have been better suited to rally - indeed to inflame - the Trump base.
There are, to be sure, huge legal, political, logical and strategic flaws in both sides' positions.
The Democrats are trying to remove Mr. Trump from office on the basis of one troubling episode among many, the congressional equivalent of charging Al Capone with tax evasion when his record included bribery, gang warfare, conspiracy and probably murder. By proceeding this way, the Democrats may be nudging future historians to concentrate on the president's actions involving Ukraine rather than on a multitude of other actions they find distasteful if not unlawful.
For their part, the Republicans are willfully turning a blind eye to Mr. Trump's activities, in Ukraine and elsewhere, and doing so in direct contravention of GOP comments about the offenses of Bill Clinton as an earlier House Judiciary Committee prepared articles of impeachment 21 years ago.
The greater vulnerability may lie with the Democrats, no matter how ardently they feel their course is justified.
In the run-up to the 2020 election as in their work on Capitol Hill, they are battling the perception that they have evolved beyond their blue-collar New Deal roots and have become a party of elitists, or at least do the bidding of their party elites. In that context, in the most consequential confrontation of their political lives, they then summoned a panel of experts with two Harvard degrees, four Yale degrees and degrees from the London School of Economics and Oxford.
Their chairman, Jerrold Nader of New York, began his audition for history by setting out a persuasive case for impeachment, but followed that with a statement that the hearings were an examination of whether there was a case at all against the president. The contradiction was too obvious to ignore.
The Republicans repeatedly interrupted the proceedings; this was no GOP display of the good manners that marked generations of 20th-century Republicans, even partisans such as Sen. Bob Dole, who as the 1976 vice presidential nominee committed the sin of describing American 20th-century military conflicts as "Democrat wars" but who was uber-courtly in the Capitol.
But it may be the way these unruly and often unreasonable Republicans were shut down - rather than the merits of their interruptions - that will be remembered by the Trump base. The first interruption came within Mr. Nadler's first sentence. The chairman's dismissal of the GOP inquiry came just as swiftly.
And if the Trump base were looking for evidence that this was a partisan undertaking, the series of partisan votes, each one shutting down the Republicans, provided ample evidence.
Of course, the partisan votes did the Republicans no favor either. In the effort to impeach President Richard M. Nixon, six of the 17 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee joined all 21 Democrats in voting to send the matter to a Senate trial. GOP Rep. William Cohen of Maine criticized Mr. Nixon for withholding information. No Republican member of the Judiciary Committee 45 years later made a similar remark despite the Trump administration's refusal to appear before the committee.
That vacuum left the GOP vulnerable to the argument of Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina Law School, who said Mr. Trump's comportment qualified for all three of the articles of impeachment the Judiciary Committee approved for Mr. Nixon, including the failure to comply with congressional subpoenas.
Facing certain conviction in the Senate, Mr. Nixon resigned following appeals to leave office from Republican stalwarts such as Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who preceded Mr. Nixon as the party's presidential nominee, and Sen. Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, the Senate minority leader and, as such, the most powerful member of the president's party in the chamber.
Overall, ironies abound in the current episode. The richest may have been the spectacle of the Democrats portraying Mr. Nixon as a respecter of the Constitution and of congressional prerogatives.
And one of those ironies was that perhaps the shrewdest move came from the side of the aisle with the least power. It was giving a microphone to George Washington Law School's Jonathan Turley, who argued that he was "concerned about lowering impeachment's standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger."
But that wasn't the most powerful sentence of his testimony. It was his statement that he voted against Mr. Trump and his assertion that he deplored many of the president's actions, including those in the Ukraine matter.
Each side found much to like in its pugilists. Mr. Nadler was forceful and contemptuous of the Republicans his supporters consider political lemmings. Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the panel, nurtured the notion that impeachment was simply the Democrats' effort to overturn an election won by a figure they loathe.
This was, he said, "the same sad story," an effort to repel Mr. Trump from office "because you just don't like the guy." He called the hearing "a waste of time."
But it wasn't entirely a waste of time.
Careful viewers learned a lot about the historical antecedents of impeachment, and about what the Founders thought were impeachable crimes. They were reminded that Washington, Jefferson and Hamilton were fearful of tyranny and rebelled against it in the form of the British crown. They were told about the triumph of the rule of law. Both sides agree that that is what is at stake this month.

Texto completo: Mike Bloomberg kicked off his run for president by apologizing for the stop, question and frisk policies his police department oversaw, patting down young black and Latino men by the hundreds of thousands in search of illegal guns. Some people replied by saying "apology not accepted"; others said better late than never. We at the Daily News editorial board, having reversed our own position back in 2016, were in the latter group.
Bloomberg has just made the benefit-of-the-doubt camp look awfully foolish by claiming that stop-and-frisk never became a real issue until now. "Well, nobody asked me about it till I started running for president," he said on "CBS This Morning." "So, c'mon."
The idiotic comment makes Bloomberg's tin ear - we forget about this, but it's long been a real liability - look freshly dented. The self-inflicted wound could well forfeit any gains he thought he had made with black voters with his initial apology.
Some history: Early February 2008, a man named David Floyd sued the city for its stop-and-frisk policy, a case that by 2013 ballooned into a class action lawsuit against Bloomberg, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and members of the NYPD. In August 2013, federal Judge Shira Scheindlin handed down her rulings in favor of the plaintiffs, holding the policy to be unconstitutional.
This was the highest-stakes legal fight of the mayor's 12-year tenure. He was asked about it over and over and over again, including in 2010 when a bill limiting a police database became law. It was legislation that Kelly, in the pages of the Daily News, argued would imperil effective policing (it didn't). Presumably, Bloomberg read that piece. More likely, his communications staff helped craft it.
Those were the early days of a running debate that roiled the city. We at the Daily News ran many pieces challenging the policy, and probably almost as many defending it.
All throughout 2013, when candidates were jockeying to replace Bloomberg, stop-and-frisk took center stage, which meant reporters relayed questions raised by Bill de Blasio and others to the incumbent mayor.
Now maybe what Bloomberg meant to say, if we're taking him seriously but not literally, is that nobody asked about stop-and-frisk in his post-mayoral life until he started running for president. That's untrue too.
He was asked about it last September by The New York Times, which characterized his response this way: "He also defended his mayoral administration's policy of stopping people on the street to search them for guns."
He was confronted on the policy this January when, at the Naval Academy, a midshipman said "What would you say to those in the two communities that have been negatively affected by the policy that you supported in the past?" Bloomberg defended the policy.
Can Bloomberg's young campaign accommodate a second mea culpa on the same topic?

Texto completo: The report on possible abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act will be released Monday, setting up a possible conflict between Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz and Attorney General William Barr.

Reports suggest Horowitz, who headed the investigation, and Barr diverge on whether the FBI was justified in launching its 2016 counterintelligence inquiry into possible ties between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, later wrapped into special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Mueller concluded Russia interfered but did not establish a criminal conspiracy between President Trump and Russia.

Barr disagrees with Horowitz’s supposed conclusion that the FBI had sufficient information to justify launching its Trump-Russia investigation, according to the Washington Post, and Barr isn’t persuaded by Horowitz’s findings and believes agencies outside of the DOJ, such as the CIA, might be able to reveal details that could change Horowitz’s mind. The investigation conducted by Barr’s right-hand man, U.S. Attorney John Durham, uncovered information that could buttress Barr’s doubts, according to a lawyer associated with Durham's team.

DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec stepped in Monday evening but didn’t dispel the notion that Horowitz and Barr disagreed.
“The Inspector General’s investigation is a credit to the Department of Justice, and his excellent work has uncovered significant information that the American people will soon be able to read for themselves,” Kupec said in a statement. “Rather than speculating, people should read the report for themselves next week, watch the Inspector General’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and draw their own conclusions about these important matters.”
Horowitz launched his investigation in March 2018, looking into allegations that the DOJ and bureau abused the FISA process by seeking surveillance warrants beginning in October 2016 against former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, as they relied upon British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s salacious and unverified dossier in filings to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Horowitz’s report is due Monday, and he’ll testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee two days later. Separate from Horowitz’s inquiry, Trump this May gave Barr full declassification authority to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation itself and to determine whether the inquiry was properly predicated. Barr selected Durham to lead that inquiry.

Barr and Durham have not said when they will release their conclusions, but Trump weighed in Tuesday when asked if he’d heard about the disagreement between Horowitz and Barr.
“If what I read is correct, that would be a little disappointing, but it was just one aspect of the report, so we’ll see what happens,” Trump said.
Trump said he heard from the news that Horowitz’s report would be “very powerful” and “devastating” and also raised expectations for what Barr and Durham might uncover.
“I do think the big report to wait for is the Durham report,” Trump said. “That’s the one that people are really waiting for. And he’s highly respected, and he’s worked very hard and he’s worked long hours, I can tell you, and gone all over the world. So we’ll see.”

Barr has long signaled skepticism about whether the Trump-Russia investigation was launched on sound legal footing.

“I think spying did occur. But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated," Barr told the Senate in April. "I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated, but I need to explore that.”
Barr also said he wanted to pull together all the information from the investigations, including those on the Hill and within the department, to evaluate what, if any, remaining questions need to be addressed.

Barr and Durham have reached out to foreign governments including Australia, Italy, and the United Kingdom and have made multiple overseas trips to speak with intelligence officials and review evidence as they look into how the Trump-Russia investigation began.

Australian diplomat Alexander Downer met George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, at London's Kensington Wine Rooms in May 2016. At this meeting, Papadopoulos said the Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Two months later, when WikiLeaks published stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, the Australians informed the United States about what Papadopoulos told Downer, prompting the FBI’s inquiry.
Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, said the man who informed him about the Russian dirt on Clinton was Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, who Mueller said had ties to the Russian government and former FBI Director James Comey claimed was a "Russian agent," but whom some Republicans claim had ties to Western intelligence.
A draft of Horowitz's report shows Durham told the inspector general he hadn't found evidence Mifsud was a U.S. intelligence asset, according to sources cited by the Washington Post. Italy’s prime minister denied Mifsud worked for them.
The FBI rules ensuring investigations are launched properly will likely feature in both the Horowitz and Durham reports. Guidelines define “predicated investigations” and state the FBI has authority to investigate national security threats, including issues of intelligence operations or espionage by foreign powers. The guidelines require “the least intrusive means or method be considered” when investigating and states all investigations must be conducted for an “authorized purpose” that must be “well-founded and well-documented.”
Full investigations may be opened if there is an “articulable factual basis” of possible criminal activity or a threat to national security, with such an investigation allowing for surveillance, subpoenas, searches and seizures, undercover operations, electronic surveillance, FISA orders, and more.
The bureau says “the predication to open a full investigation must be documented in the opening electronic communication.” The Trump-Russia investigation's initial launch document, which remains classified, is believed to have been authored by since-fired special agent Peter Strzok. DOJ's leadership is considering guidelines requiring the bureau to get approval from the department before opening investigations into people such as presidential candidates, according to a source cited by the New York Times.

FISA documents released in 2018 show the DOJ and FBI made extensive use of Steele’s dossier in 2016. The Clinton campaign and DNC used the Perkins Coie law firm to hire Fusion GPS, which then hired the former MI6 agent, whose Democratic funding, strong desire for Trump to lose, and possible flaws with his dossier weren’t revealed to the FISA court. Clinton’s campaign manager said they received briefings from Perkins Coie about Fusion GPS's findings during the campaign. The FISA applications targeting Page required the approval of top members of the FBI and DOJ, as well as the FISA court.
Barr told the Senate in May he was “concerned about” possible Russian disinformation in the dossier, though Steele said there’s no way he was duped by the Kremlin.

Texto completo: Krulwich, known for taking on big ideas in his reporting, has co-hosted the nationally syndicated WNYC program since 2005.
Robert Krulwich, the longtime journalist and one of the hosts of "Radiolab," the immensely popular audio program known for its offbeat investigations of big ideas, will retire from the show in January, New York Public Radio announced on Thursday.
Krulwich, 72, has hosted the show, which is produced by WNYC, with Jad Abumrad since 2005.
"There comes a time -- and I think it has come -- when you get out of the way and let the future come flooding in," Krulwich wrote in a letter posted online.
Abumrad created an earlier rendition of "Radiolab" in 2002, the same year Krulwich and Abumrad met. When Krulwich came aboard a revamped version, the show was a small, seasonal venture; now it airs weekly across 589 public radio stations.
Each episode poses a scientific or philosophical quandary at the top that Krulwich and Abumrad probe over the course of the show, often leading to surprising conclusions. One recent broadcast began by asking where eels come from; another explored the secret history of square dancing.
Before "Radiolab," Krulwich covered a wide variety of beats for more than two decades as a correspondent at ABC and CBS News, including science, technology and economics.
In 2011, Krulwich told The New York Times Magazine he had dreamed of a career in broadcasting as a boy. He would pretend to sleep when his parents peeked in at night -- but really, he was listening to the transistor radio tucked under his pillow.
The Magazine described Krulwich's "Radiolab" persona as "your favorite college professor, full-blown and voluble, unable to go more than four minutes without making everyone in the room laugh."
In a statement, Abumrad said of Krulwich: "We've shared so many late-night edits, three-hour tracking sessions, pre-live show jitters, and greasy diner meals that got a little too confessional and sometimes a little too argumentative."
"And in the process," Abumrad added, "we built a show together."
In his letter, Krulwich said he plans to focus on new projects like a documentary, a "global warming interactive" and "grandpa duty" -- which includes, he said, blowing bubbles at pigeons with his grandchildren.
"Radiolab" will produce a tribute episode for Krulwich in January.

Hathaway on 'heartbreaking' eco-drama 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
After roles in "Serenity" and "The Hustle" earlier this year, Anne Hathaway is back on the big screen this fall with "Dark Waters," pictured, which tackles industrial pollution.

Texto completo: "We are not anti-Semites," said the former supervisor of Chester, N.Y., responding to a suit filed by New York's attorney general.
For the past two years, the residents of a small town 60 miles north of New York City have openly fretted about a proposed housing development that they fear will be filled with Hasidic Jews.
Officials in Chester, N.Y., according to a lawsuit filed against it, have passed ordinances, denied building permits and imposed costly requirements on the developer in a concerted effort to slow or even stop the project.
"We're doing what we can to alleviate 432 Hasidic houses in the town of Chester," Alexander Jamieson, who was then the town supervisor, said at a heated public meeting in 2018 that was posted on YouTube. "There's nobody on the board, nobody who wants the development to go through."
Now the town of Chester has something else to worry about: A proposed lawsuit and investigation by Letitia James, the state attorney general.
The attorney general on Thursday jumped into the dispute, accusing local officials in Chester and Orange County of violating fair housing laws and discriminating against the Hasidic community, and petitioning a judge to join a lawsuit filed earlier this year by the Greens at Chester, the developer.
The filing is Ms. James's first major effort to intervene in the heated housing disputes that have roiled suburban counties north of New York City, as Hasidic Jews seek to build new developments to accommodate their expanding numbers. The growth of the Hasidic population has sparked fears among non-Hasidic residents that the newcomers will change the character of existing towns.
The motion is a prelude to Ms. James's office filing a separate lawsuit against the town and Orange County if officials do not settle with the developer and allow the project to proceed, she said.
In an interview, Ms. James said she decided to intervene because the discriminatory actions and statements of town officials struck her as particularly egregious.
"It is critically important that I send a strong message to communities that would engage in discrimination on its face that it will not be tolerated either in Chester, or on Long Island, or in any community in the State of New York," she said.
Mr. Jamieson, the former town supervisor who is named in the lawsuit, denied that anti-Semitism and discrimination were at the root of the town's opposition to the development. He said the concern is about housing size and density.
The proposed project encompasses over 430 homes on 117 acres, potentially adding thousands of new residents to the town of 12,000. This could stretch public resources, and shift the town's political balance: In the town's elections this November, for example, town supervisor Robert Valentine, who is also named in the lawsuit, won re-election by just 12 votes.
"We are not full of bigots, we are not anti-Semites," Mr. Jamieson said of the town's residents. "This is just about the size of the houses. The other stuff is just smoke and mirrors. It's just a distraction."
Mr. Valentine did not respond to a request for comment, but in an interview earlier this year defended his handling of the project.
The attorney general's motion also names Orange County and the county executive, Steven M. Neuhaus, as among those violating fair housing laws by seeking to block the project. It quotes Mr. Neuhaus, who is a Chester resident, suggesting ways to stop the housing development at a 2018 town meeting.
"We can pressure the developer," Mr. Neuhaus had said at the meeting, according to the complaint. "I don't know when the water was tested ... There's a lot of stuff to revisit."
"We are going to work together to do what's right for this town," he said.
At another meeting, Mr. Neuhaus "defiantly stated that he would not authorize sewer permits at the Greens," according to the attorney general's motion. Subsequently, the county asked the state Department of Health to redo its water testing at the site.
The county said the attorney general's motion was without merit.
"The attorney general has not identified a single permit being withheld by the county," Langdon Chapman, the Orange County attorney, said in a statement on Thursday. "Asking the state to do its job and review constituent concerns about water quality is perfectly reasonable."
The saga over the development is a lengthy one. The town has fought proposed development at the site since 1985, when Wilbur Fried, a non-Hasidic developer, first sought to build houses there. Mr. Fried eventually sued in federal court, and in 2010, the town settled, granting him the right to build the homes on its hilly acres.
In 2017, Mr. Fried sold the still undeveloped lot to the Greens at Chester, which is owned, at least in part, by Hasidic Jews from Kiryas Joel, a nearby community made up mostly of ultra-Orthodox Satmar Hasidic Jews. Once the town got wind of the new owners, it created roadblock after roadblock to try to stop construction, according to the complaint.
In January 2018, the town introduced a Floor-to-Area Ratio law that would force the developer to build extremely small and unmarketable units, the complaint says. It also proposed levying an extra tax on the property, and mandated that the sewer line be rerouted.
To this day, no building permits for houses have been granted, although roads and other infrastructure have been completed. "Defendants have succeeded in effectively halting development of the Greens," the attorney general's complaint states.
In its own lawsuit, filed in July, the Greens at Chester asked for $ 100 million in damages for breach of contract and purported violations of fair housing and other anti-discrimination laws, as well as permits for the project to proceed.
"Every step of the way, we felt like this development was being used as a vessel to advance bias and discrimination," said Livy Schwartz, one of the developers. "So in the end it became less about a housing development, and more about the existence of the Jewish people in this part of the state."
Last week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo vetoed a bill that would have allowed Chester to collect a real-estate transfer tax and use those funds to purchase land or development rights within the town. The governor cited the litigation involving the development as the reason.
For her part, Ms. James said she wants a judge to immediately declare that the town has violated the Fair Housing Act, which would stop it from enforcing local laws that are intended to discriminate against the Hasidic community. Her motion also suggests that a judge take additional actions, such as assigning a court-ordered monitor and requiring training to make sure that no further such discrimination occurs.
"This campaign to deny housing to members of the Jewish community is not only a clear violation of our laws, but is antithetical to our basic values and blatantly anti-Semitic," she said in a statement.

Texto completo: The commission took aim last month at the Chinese tech giant's sales to telecom carriers in rural America.
SHENZHEN, China -- Huawei, the Chinese technology powerhouse, is suing the Federal Communications Commission for choking off its sales in the United States, the latest in the besieged company's widening efforts to hit back at regulators and critics across the globe.
The F.C.C. voted last month to bar American telecommunications companies from using federal subsidies to buy equipment from Huawei and another Chinese supplier, ZTE. Washington considers both firms to be national security risks.
Large wireless providers such as Verizon and AT&T have long shunned the companies' gear. But carriers in remote, rural parts of the United States have depended on it for years. The F.C.C. rule could force them to find pricier replacements.
"The F.C.C. claims that Huawei is a security threat, but F.C.C. Chairman Ajit Pai has not provided any evidence," Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal officer, said during a news conference on Thursday at the company's headquarters in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.
"This is a common trend in Washington these days," Mr. Song said. "The F.C.C.'s order violates the Constitution, and we have no choice but to seek legal remedy."
The Trump administration has led an all-out effort to keep Huawei, the world's largest supplier of telecom equipment, out of wireless networks in the United States and globally. American officials believe the Chinese government could use the company for espionage, an accusation the firm denies. Washington's clampdown on Huawei has become a sticking point in trade talks with Beijing, which is demanding clemency for one of China's leading corporate champions.
Huawei already sued the United States government this year, challenging a spending law that blocked federal agencies from doing business with it. The company has also increased its lobbying activities in Washington and filed defamation complaints in France against a researcher who suggested that the company was state controlled.
Suing the F.C.C. lends heft to Huawei's protestations that Washington is treating it unfairly, said Julian Ku, a professor of law at Hofstra University.
"They want to show their customers in the U.S. that they're a serious company, that they're not an outlaw," he said. "Even a small victory in the case, one that makes the F.C.C. go and start the process over again, would be a huge victory for them."
Still, courts generally give federal agencies wide leeway to interpret the law, Mr. Ku said. "There's usually a tremendous amount of deference."
Huawei filed its petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which covers the region that includes Huawei's American headquarters in Plano, Texas. The company asked the court to hold the F.C.C.'s order unlawful because the commission did not offer it due process protections before designating it a security threat.
"Carriers across rural America -- in small towns in Montana, Kentucky, and farmers in Wyoming -- they choose to work with Huawei because they respect the quality and integrity of our equipment," Mr. Song said.
Huawei is embarking upon this new legal battle as the company's fortunes, despite the onslaught from Washington and apprehension in other world capitals, appear to be looking up.
The Commerce Department has begun allowing some American suppliers to resume selling parts and other technology to Huawei. Earlier this year the department had barred such sales without prior approval. Huawei's business has remained steady over all, thanks to brisk sales of its smartphones and telecom equipment in China.
Throughout the rest of the world, the company has been supercharging its efforts to court the sympathies of the public and of governments. Hundreds of journalists have been invited to visit Huawei's campuses. The company's founder and chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, has given interview after interview in which he assures the world that neither he nor his firm has anything to hide.
In Washington, Huawei has spent $ 1.9 million on lobbying this year, according to federal disclosures, dwarfing its past totals.
But the company has also lashed out against people who sully its image. In August, a Huawei lawyer sent The Wall Street Journal a letter saying that an article about the company's activities in Africa contained "false and defamatory statements." A Journal spokeswoman said the paper stood by its reporting.
Huawei has also filed libel complaints in France against a researcher, Valérie Niquet of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a think tank in Paris. On a television talk show in February, Ms. Niquet said Huawei was ultimately controlled by the Chinese government.
In China, she said, "there is no company that is truly capitalist in the sense that we understand it."
After Huawei's complaint against Ms. Niquet came to light last month, the Foundation for Strategic Research said it supported its researchers' right to free expression. French officials said recently that the nation would not follow the United States in barring Huawei from its telecom networks.
In a telephone interview this week, Ms. Niquet said she was surprised when she received notice, in September, of the company's legal complaints against her. "There is such a disproportion between a researcher and a mighty company such as Huawei," she said.
Since then, she has avoided traveling to China, she said. But, she added, "I will go on working on China, as I have for decades now."

Texto completo: Eun Sun Kim will be the first woman to hold the music director post at an American company of major size and stature.
The fast-rising conductor Eun Sun Kim was named the next music director of the San Francisco Opera on Thursday, which will make her the first woman to hold the post at an American opera company of major size and stature.
When asked in an interview about the pathbreaking nature of her appointment, Ms. Kim, 39, who was born in Seoul, South Korea, said that it made her think of how her grandmother, a pioneering doctor who was born in 1912, was described for years as a "female doctor" -- but lived to see the day when women who practiced medicine were called, simply, "doctors."
"So I'm grateful to be the first 'female music director,"' Ms. Kim said. "But I also look forward to a future where the next generation will be called just 'conductor."'
Ms. Kim, whose conducting career has boomed in recent years, regularly conducts in Europe, including at the Staatsoper in Berlin, where Daniel Barenboim invited her to make her debut in 2015. She made her American debut in 2017 under the most trying circumstances: conducting "La Traviata" at the Houston Grand Opera in an improvised theater in a convention center, shortly after Hurricane Harvey flooded the company's regular home.
She was called "a major star" of that "Traviata" by James R. Oestreich in The New York Times, and the company was so impressed that it named her principal guest conductor.
Her appointment in San Francisco comes fast on the heels of her successful debut there in June, when she led a highly praised new production of Dvorak's "Rusalka." Joshua Kosman wrote in The San Francisco Chronicle that Ms. Kim "drew glorious playing from the Opera Orchestra and paced every scene freely but precisely" and described the production overall as "the kind of collaborative offering that shows the company at its finest."
Matthew Shilvock, the company's general director, was so interested in Ms. Kim that he watched one of her performances from inside the orchestra pit.
"From the very first encounter that she had with the orchestra, it was clear that there was something really special emerging there, a special kind of energy I have not seen before with this company," Mr. Shilvock said in an interview. "She's a conductor who really opens her arms and invites the people around her in to make the very best music she can."
Ms. Kim will officially begin as music director in San Francisco in 2021, but, as music director designate, she will conduct a new production of Beethoven's "Fidelio" there next season.
San Francisco tapped her just as her American career is taking off: She made her Washington National Opera debut last month with "The Magic Flute," and has debuts coming up with Los Angeles Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Metropolitan Opera, where she is scheduled to conduct "La Bohème" in the 2021-22 season.
She is succeeding in a field where women still rarely get opportunities. Karen Kamensek, who is currently conducting "Akhnaten" at the Met, is only the fifth woman to conduct there. Marin Alsop remains the only female music director of a major American orchestra, the Baltimore Symphony.
There have been pioneers in leadership positions at opera companies, including Sarah Caldwell, who founded the Opera Company of Boston and made it a force through innovative programming and big stars; Eve Queler, the music director of the Opera Orchestra of New York; Simone Young, who was artistic director of the Hamburg State Opera; and Lidiya Yankovskaya, who is the music director of Chicago Opera Theater. But no woman has been music director of an American company as large and important as San Francisco.
Marc A. Scorca, the president and chief executive officer of Opera America, a service organization, said that a recent survey of the biggest American companies found that only 10 percent of their conductors were women, and none had women as music directors.
"We haven't even reached anything close to parity among conductors," he said, "let alone music directors."
Ms. Kim's path to the podium began in Seoul, where, while studying composition, one of her teachers encouraged her to conduct. After going on to complete her studies in Stuttgart, Germany, she began working her way up through the opera world, first as an assistant.
In 2011 she assisted the conductor Kirill Petrenko, now the chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, on Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde" at the Opéra National de Lyon. The next year, she made her professional debut, with "La Bohème" in Frankfurt.
Ms. Kim said a turning point came when she went to Madrid in 2008 for a competition, after which she landed her first job as an assistant conductor at the Teatro Real there.
"I walked in the room for a first round with the orchestra and didn't even know how to say 'hello' in Spanish," she recalled. "And I just walked in and conducted, and it worked. It really sounded as I wanted to hear it. I really felt, then, that music could be my language."

Texto completo: Not many people think of the Ten Commandments these days, unless some group is trying to fight a legal battle to place them on public property.
Still, these laws of God, which may be familiar to some only through the Cecil B. DeMille classic film starring Charlton Heston as Moses, contain worthy guidelines that are applicable to today.
When considering the “wealth tax” proposed by presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the 10th Commandment is particularly relevant: “Thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor’s.”
One definition of “covet” is: “to desire wrongfully, inordinately, or without due regard for the rights of others: to covet another’s property.”
Warren, Sanders and others intent on soaking the rich might argue their proposals to massively increase government power and reach is not wrong, or inordinate, or without due regard for the rights of others, because they believe health care for all is a right. But at the heart of their health care and other plans they claim would be paid for by additional taxes on the wealthy and successful is a failure to understand basic economic principles.
One principle is that money is not a limited resource. If billionaires were depriving others of earning money, then these politicians would have a credible argument, but the money pot is bottomless. There was a time when my income was so low that by today’s standards, I would have been considered poor. But I graduated from college, started in journalism at entry level and worked my way up (or down, depending on your view of journalists).
A Survey Monkey poll for The New York Times shows that Sen. Warren’s plan to tax wealthy individuals “continues to draw broad support from voters, across party, gender and educational lines.” Sure, everyone likes “free stuff” until they realize that nothing is free and that someone must pay for it. Several analyses of Warren’s plan say it is impossible to achieve without tax increases on the middle class. There simply isn’t enough money that can be taken from earners to underwrite the left’s multi-trillion-dollar spending plans.
Then there’s the notion that government will run health care better than the private sector. All one has to do is look at the often inferior “care” offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs to see this as a bogus argument.
Perhaps the best line I have heard on the subject is from our 30th president, Calvin Coolidge: “Don’t expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong.”
Much of this is driven by our modern education system, in which some professors teach theories of economics, along with envy, greed and entitlement, that are the opposite of what once was called the Puritan ethic, an ethic of personal responsibility and accountability, with government as last resort. This belief helped build and sustain America through many economic and societal challenges.
Instead of celebrating and promoting the greatness of America, liberals and socialists spend their time denigrating the country and apologizing for its success. Instead of encouraging the poor and middle class to make decisions and adopt attitudes that will enhance their chances for success, they promote the belief that the rich and successful achieved by robbing others.
If America becomes a socialist nation, it will be difficult to go back, even when the mistake is realized. The time to stop it is now, or, more precisely, with a decisive defeat of socialism in the next election.

FORGET ‘100 BY ‘50.’ GOP PLUGS ‘12 IN ‘20’ SHORT-TERM CLIMATE PLAN: House Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans are needling their Democratic counterparts for their efforts to develop a plan to reach net-zero emissions across the economy by 2050.
Committee Republicans released a blog post Wednesday launching a campaign laying out a dozen short-term bills meant to promote innovation and get passed quickly, called “12 in ‘20,’” a play on words on Democrats’ “100 by ’50” plan.
“We have a dozen bipartisan measures that we could turn into law that would help reduce emissions and spur jobs and innovation. Hopefully, we’ll get to work on passing those measures,” said Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, the committee’s top Republican, who was speaking at a Thursday hearing focused on Democrats’ 100 by ’50 agenda.
The highlighted bills include: The USE It Act to boost carbon capture and utilization, the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act to promote advanced nuclear technology, and the BEST Act to enhance R&D for grid-scale energy storage.
Other bills would encourage the continued use of fossil fuels and benefit industry, such as the Small Scale LNG Access Act and New Source Review Permitting Reform.
Democrats argue these types of bills wouldn't be enough to decarbonize the country, which would require an economy-wide solution like a carbon tax. They don’t oppose those bills individually, but rather contend that pricing carbon will incentivize and deepen the creation of innovations that Republicans want the private sector to create.
“A carbon tax offers the most effective lever to reduce emissions at the scale and speed necessary,” said Democrat Scott Peters of California at the hearing.
The gulf isn’t closing: The Republican provoking continued at the hearing, which focused on economy-wide approaches to decarbonization.
“This is a tough issue. The majority has tried to wrap its arms around it and tried to address it, and we [Republicans] are trying to not be in their way,” said Republican John Shimkus of Illinois.
Democrats on the committee have hosted six previous hearings dedicated to generating ideas on how to reduce emissions in different sectors of the economy, such as power generation and transportation, culminating in Thursday’s economy-wide focus.
Yet Republicans appear no closer to embracing Democratic proposals.
“The majority’s preferred approach [is] to impose costly, carbon taxes and old, cap and trade regulations and schemes,” Walden said. “Not only do these policies severely disrupt the American consumer, but they have no chance of becoming law.”

TRUCK RULE REPEAL MAY NOT GLIDE THROUGH: The Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Inspector General said the agency failed to meet requirements to examine the costs, benefits, and health impacts of air pollution limits for rebuilt trucks with old engines.
“The lack of analyses caused the public not to be informed” about the proposal’s true impacts, the independent watchdog office finds in a report Thursday on the EPA’s plans to repeal restrictions on glider kits.
Glider kits are new truck bodies that can be fitted with used engines. Trucks that use glider kits could have engines that pre-date the EPA’s air pollution controls. The EPA’s own data has found glider trucks emit dozens of times more pollution than new trucks.
“According to EPA managers and officials, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt directed that the Glider Repeal Rule be promulgated as quickly as possible,” the EPA inspector general wrote in a one-pager on the report.
The EPA inspector general’s findings could be another nail in the coffin: It could now be much harder for the EPA to move forward with a repeal.

Senate Democrats had requested the EPA watchdog take up the audit, suggesting the EPA had made last-second changes to its proposal “purposefully designed to avoid legally required economic and health analyses.” They and other critics have accused the EPA of not wanting to do a cost-benefit review because agency officials knew it wouldn’t look favorably on repealing the Obama-era limits.
The agency’s repeal proposal has sat dormant for more than two years now. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s first act as head of the agency was to walk back a move from Pruitt to temporarily relieve glider kit makers from the requirements.
Even if the EPA does move forward, it isn’t clear it would scrap the requirements altogether. The agency’s latest regulatory agenda lists the glider kit rule as a long-term action, but notes it is “proposing to revise” — not repeal — the cap.
WHEN THEY GO LOW: The Solar Energy Industries Association had a polite but pointed response to President Trump’s trade and manufacturing adviser, who called their latest report on damages from solar panel tariffs “classic fake news.”
“We’d be thrilled if Mr. Navarro would come to one of our conferences and meet some of the 240,000 Americans who work in this great industry, including the tens of thousands people who are manufacturing solar products,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’s CEO and president, in a statement to Abby and Josh.
If you remember: Peter Navarro didn’t have very nice things to say about SEIA.
SEIA is “a loose confederation of Chinese solar companies seeking to destroy American solar manufacturing jobs and U.S. solar installers that want cheap Chinese panels and don’t care how many American jobs are destroyed by China’s heavily subsidized industry,” Navarro said Tuesday, comments relayed in yesterday’s newsletter.
Tariff showdown officially begins: The spat between SEIA and Navarro comes as a mid-term review kicks off to determine whether Trump’s section 201 tariffs on imported solar panels are working.
The International Trade Commission hears testimony Thursday from SEIA and its allies, as well as supporters of the tariffs. The trade commissioners will make a recommendation, but Trump will make the final call.
SEIA wants Trump to eliminate the tariffs altogether, saying they’re costing tens of thousands of jobs. But even the solar trade group has admitted they’re worried Trump could decide to make the tariffs harsher instead.
A climate and jobs appeal? Hopper, in her statement, said she was “heartened” by Trump’s recent comments that climate change is “very important” to him. (Josh has a good rundown of those remarks — and why Trump might be talking climate more — here).
“I think we are all in agreement that greater use of solar energy and a strong solar manufacturing presence is one way we can meet our collective goals of continuing American economic growth and addressing climate change in a meaningful way,” Hopper said.
SEIA SCORES A WIN: The solar industry group got some good news as trade commissioners weigh the fate of the tariffs.
The U.S. Court of International Trade is temporarily barring the Trump administration from withdrawing an exclusion for bifacial solar panels from the tariffs. The administration had granted the exclusion earlier this year, but then abruptly withdrew it four months later without notice and comment.
Trade court Judge Gary S. Katzmann said in a Thursday order the Trump administration couldn’t withdraw the exclusion without properly taking public input first.
SEIA has argued the administration’s abrupt withdrawal of the bifacial exclusion shows Trump thinks he has widespread discretion on tariff policy. It’s unclear, though, whether the trade court’s ruling will give the White House any pause.
TRUMP TIP TOES AROUND NORD STREAM 2 SANCTIONS: Trump is demurring on whether his administration plans to sanction Russia’s Nord Stream II natural gas pipeline to Germany.
“We haven’t really determined that yet,” the president said Wednesday before a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “I do think it's a problem, but it's a problem that Germany is going to have to work out for themselves. And maybe for Germany it won’t be a problem. I hope it's not, actually.” His comments come after Republicans in Congress, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have criticized the administration for not applying sanctions to the pipeline, which is expected to be completed within months.
The Energy Department, however, has signaled the administration has moved on from the idea of sanctions, and is instead focused on expanding U.S. LNG into Europe to give countries other options instead of relying chiefly on Russian energy.
RUBIO WON’T LET GO ON OFFSHORE DRILLING: Marco Rubio is blocking Trump’s deputy Interior secretary nominee from being confirmed over her work on the administration’s plan to expand offshore drilling.
The Florida Republican’s office told Josh that the senator met with Interior Secretary David Bernhardt on Wednesday to discuss his hold on Katherine MacGregor to be second-in-command at the agency. MacGregor’s nomination passed out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee two weeks ago.
Rubio, however, won’t let MacGregor’s nomination proceed with a vote on the Senate floor until she meets with him to discuss his concerns about expanding offshore drilling.
Interior’s in-flux offshore drilling plan: The department had once prepared to dramatically expand offshore oil and gas drilling, releasing a five-year plan in January 2018 to open nearly all federal waters on every coast, including in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico near Florida. MacGregor, who has already worked at Interior in several positions since 2017, helped with the plan.
Bernhardt, though, has postponed finalizing the plan due to a court ruling that cast doubt over the legality of opening new areas to drilling.
Rubio wants assurances that Interior in its final plan will extend a Congressionally-imposed moratorium that ends in 2022 against drilling in the Eastern Gulf. The House this year passed legislation led by Republican Francis Rooney of Florida establishing a permanent moratorium.

Texto completo: Una aerolínea con sede en Oklahoma que realiza vuelos chárter es la única dispuesta a deportar a inmigrantes considerados por la Oficina de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas ( ICE ) como “ de alto riesgo “.
Y lo hace cobrando precios exorbitantes.
Se trata de Omni Air International , la cual tiene contrato con el Departamento de Defensa de los Estados Unidos para el traslado de soldados y con el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) para concretar deportaciones que ICE califica como “ misiones especiales de alto riesgo ”.
Un documento sobre el presupuesto de ICE obtenido por el sitio de noticias Quartz revela que se ha tenido que pagar prácticamente lo que la empresa pide por sus servicios aéreos, ya que es la única dispuesta a realizar esos vuelos especiales.
Un agente de viajes habría advertido a ICE que muchos operadores aéreos no quieren participar en el proceso de deportación ante una posible reacción negativa del público y el impacto en los medios de comunicación.
“Como resultado, nuestro grupo de selección de operadores se ha reducido a uno solo, Omni”, indica el documento de ICE.
El pasado 18 de noviembre ICE pagó $33,500 dólares por hora para trasladar a 166 inmigrantes que fueron deportados de Arizona a Bangladesh, India y Vietnam. Lo que cobró Omni es el doble del precio en el mercado, reconocen las autoridades.
Los inmigrantes detenidos que puedan ser perjudiciales durante un vuelo o que físicamente se rehúsen a ser deportados, serán enviados a su país en un vuelo chárter especial de alto riesgo, establece la unidad de Operaciones Aéreas de ICE .
Omni Air International es la encargada de esos vuelos especiales y también de los casos de deportación de alto perfil , como quienes son considerados una amenaza a la seguridad nacional, violadores de derechos humanos y detenidos con órdenes de arresto en el extranjero o que son buscados en su país de origen.
Esa misma aerolínea tiene operaciones comerciales en los aeropuertos de Las Vegas, Dallas, Seattle, Hawaii y Baltimore.
Otras compañías aéreas que han colaborado en la deportación de inmigrantes, en vuelos que no son de alto riesgo, son Xtra Airways , con sede en Florida y que ha realizado traslados a México y Centroamérica, al igual que Swift Air , que de acuerdo con el New York Times esta empresa estaría recibiendo $15 millones de dólares al año por el contrato que tiene con ICE.
En declaraciones públicas, algunas aerolíneas como American , Frontier y United han dejado en claro su rechazo a participar en la política de deportación del presidente Donald Trump .

Texto completo: WEST LAFAYETTE – With campus groups and faculty pressuring Mitch Daniels to atone for his choice of words when he called an African American scholar a "one of the rarest creatures in America" and the "rarest phenomenon," Purdue's president apologized in a letter sent to members of five organizations on campus.
"I retract and apologize for a figure of speech I used in a recent impromptu dialogue with students," Daniels wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to members of the Purdue chapter of the NAACP, Purdue's Black Caucus of Faculty and Staff, Purdue's Latino Faculty/Staff Association, the Black Student Union and the Latino Student Union.
"My reference was in praise of a specific individual and the unique and exciting possibility of bringing that particular individual to Purdue," Daniels wrote. "The word in question was ill chosen and imprecise and, in retrospect, too capable of being misunderstood. I accept accountability for the poor judgment involved."
Daniels' comment was made Nov. 20 after a meeting with Purdue Student Government leaders. Student greeted Daniels and asked him to follow up on his thoughts about what Purdue was doing to promote diversity on campus and to make underrepresented minority students feel welcome.
That night, Daniels had been pressed by students about his administration's response after a Purdue student had been denied the sale of cold medicine because a clerk and a manager at an off-campus CVS Pharmacy across from Mackey Arena had rejected his Puerto Rican driver's license as sufficient ID. The incident led to student rallies calling on a response from Daniels, which he'd been reluctant to offer.
During the conversation outside an auditorium at Pfendler Hall, Daniels talked about recruiting minority faculty.
"At the end of this week, I'll be recruiting one of the rarest creatures in America – a leading, I mean a really leading, African-American scholar," Daniels said that night, according to a recording made by reporters at the Purdue Exponent newspaper.
When students challenged him on the use of the term "rarest creatures" – "Creatures? Come on," said D'yan Berry, president of the Black Student Union, said – Daniels followed up: "It's a figure of speech. You must have taken some, you know, literature. Let me say, rarest birds. Rarest phenomenon."
The backlash was swift on social media and among faculty on the University Senate's Equity and Diversity Committee, which issued a statement calling Daniels' phrasing "problematic." The Purdue student chapter of the NAACP on Monday called for an apology in a letter to the J&C.
And on Wednesday, two weeks later, Daniels' statements were dissected in a New York Times op-ed by G. Gabrielle Starr, president of Pomona College, a private liberal arts college in Claremont, California. In it, Starr wrote that she was breaking from the "standard etiquette for college presidents," which "is to let the remarks of another leader pass on by."
"In just a few sentences, Mr. Daniels seemed to question the possibility of sustained black excellence," Starr wrote in the New York Times op-ed. "It's true that the number of black scholars is smaller than one would like. But they're also suppressed by the fiction that black leadership is an impossible dream — a rare bird."
Daniels told the J&C two days after his comments: "I've never felt so misunderstood before."
Two weeks later, he issued this apology.
"To be clear, I sincerely believe that individuals of every race and ethnicity are capable of and demonstrate academic excellence and achieve top recognition in all of the academic disciplines," Daniels said. "I also recognize that more needs to be done to recruit, support and encourage individuals from groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education. My word choice, as clumsy as it was, was an expression of my excitement with the progress of one such effort."
Berry said she received the apology via email Wednesday afternoon. Berry said the excitement she felt faded when she saw it had gone to a small collection of people, rather than a public statement sent to the entire campus. Berry called it a half-step for something she said she believed Daniels should have done when she pointed out his language to him that night.
"At this point, it is a public matter," Berry, a senior, said. "There are other African American scholars all over the world, and people who are not African American scholars, who have taken offense to the statement. At this point, it's not just a list of 10 people you can apologize to just to put a Band-Aid on the situation."
Berry said the murmurs first heard in Pfendler Hall haven't gone away on campus.
"The campus is very upset, especially in the black community, I can say for sure," Berry said. "It's a big issue for people right now, because when you're paying a lot of money to a university that looks at you like a creature, it kind of rubs you the wrong way."
Jorge Perez de Jesus, a Ph.D. student in Latin American literature at Purdue, said he'd been emailing Daniels regularly since Jose Guzman Payano, a Purdue junior from Puerto Rico, had been turned away when he tried to buy cold medicine at the CVS across from Purdue's Mackey Arena. CVS apologized and promised to investigate. Perez de Jesus helped organize a protest that urged Daniels stand with students, including on off-campus matters.
In his letter to students, Daniels said that "while I am reviewing past judgment calls," he regretted not addressing the CVS situation sooner, given that it "precipitated the impromptu dialogue and therefore the misunderstanding."
"It would have been possible to express the genuine concern we all felt without condemning prematurely any individual or local business establishment before the facts were known," Daniels said. "That was a misjudgment on my part and a lesson for the future."
"I am glad that he's finally acknowledge that his words, as our university leader, matter," Perez de Jesus said Wednesday. "The president's statement lacks specificity. If he were a student in my class I would point this out. However, it is a step forward, and there is a possibility for further dialogue."
Carey Walls, a Purdue student and Indiana NAACP Youth and College president, said he wanted to meet with other member of Purdue's NAACP chapter after receiving Daniels email, two days after the group called for a public apology. He said he would reserve comment until then.
Audrey Ruple, chair of the University Senate's Equity and Diversity Committee, said she was "grateful to President Daniels for his statement."
"I am sure this will have a positive impact on our efforts to address the issues surrounding diversity and inclusion at Purdue University and in our greater community," Ruple said.

Texto completo: The Northwest Cultural Council is excited to announce its current exhibit that honors one of America’s outstanding modern poets, Mary Oliver.
The exhibit at Arlington Green Executive Center is comprised of single works by 17 of the council’s artists. Each artist has selected one of Oliver’s poems as inspiration for their piece. The poem is displayed adjacent to each work and will be read aloud during a reception for the artists Dec. 7.
In addition to Oliver’s work, two original poems by council artists are on display. The exhibit will run through Jan. 4.
Mary Oliver was born in Ohio in 1935 and spent her adult life in New England, then in Florida, where she died in January of this year.
From a young age, she immersed herself in nature and was quoted as saying, "When it’s over, I want to say: ‘All my life/I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.’" Her first collection of poems was published in 1963, when she was 28. Oliver received numerous awards and recognition throughout her life. In 2007, The New York Times described her as "far and away, this country’s best-selling poet."
This exhibit contains photography, stained glass, watercolor, oil and acrylic painting, as well as bas-relief sculpture. Participating artists include Mary Blinn, Steve Bogaerts, Joe Burlini, Cheryl Calderon, Dean Caminiti, Robert R. Cobb, Roger Gates, John Green, James Hojnacki, Karen Meadows, Moon Ja Park, Linda Nye, Lynnea Semasko, Gary Swiontek, Tom Warnke, Nancy Wedow and Tiffany Whisler.
Through the generosity of one of the council’s ongoing sponsors, RF Wittmeyer, Ltd., the public is invited to a reception with refreshments from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 7. Some of the artists will have gift items for sale.
There is ample free parking at Arlington Green Executive Center, 2101 S. Arlington Heights Road, Arlington Heights.

From tarot cards to deep-dish cookies

Texto completo: It’s time to deck the halls with updated kitchen gear, fresh cookbooks and new food products. The biggest food gifts this holiday season will undoubtedly be Instant Pots and air fryers, but the smaller stuff — a meat thermometer, a Microplane, matching mixing bowls — also would be appreciated by the cook in your life.
Here are some ideas to show those foodies that you love them and want them to eat well — or at least have fun while they are eating. Don’t forget that Faraday’s Kitchen Store and Sur La Table have gift certificates for both kitchen gear and cooking classes.
Meal kits seem like a dime a dozen these days, but an Austin-based meal kit called Lettuce (lettuce.fm) started in 2016 and features locally grown ingredients, including some from a network of backyard gardens around the city. Unlike those meal kit boxes that arrive by mail, these are delivered in zero-waste packaging; All the ingredients come in reusable plastic and glass containers, and the company picks up your food scraps when they deliver the next set of meals. Founder Yogesh Sharma has more than 1,000 recipes that are divided up by dietary preference, so you can order gluten-free, vegan, omnivore and more. The kits start at $49 for three two-serving meals, including delivery, which could be just the right gift for someone who is trying to get back into cooking at home.
CatSpring Yaupon is now selling a holiday-inspired tea blend made with locally harvested yaupon, America’s only native source of caffeine. The lightly spiced Deck the Hills yaupon tea ($12.95 for 2 ounces) has hints of both apple and pumpkin and is available online and at Central Market. (Founder Abianne Miller Falla has also written a children’s book about a raccoon called “Ralph’s Christmas Gift” that is available on their website, catspringtea.com.)
Srsly Chocolate, which is known for roasting and grinding its own cacao beans at its store in Taylor, has a holiday pop-up
store in December at 4402 S. Congress Ave. At that location and a number of retailers across Austin, you can buy Srsly’s signature bean-to-bar chocolates, as well as a new product, a brownie mix ($15) that uses single-origin cacao and Barton Springs Mill grains. The pop-up is open from noon to 6 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays in December.
Joel Mitter and Abbey Ciolek are two entrepreneurs who are taking advantage of a new cottage law that went into effect this year that allows food companies to sell and market their products to customers online. Their company, Sweet Bean, makes deep-dish cookies that are both vegan and gluten-free, thanks to their creative use of chickpeas. The square, Detroit-style treats ($2) are dense on the inside and crispy on the outside and come in five flavors: chocolate chip, lemon poppyseed, golden mylk, pumpkin chip and snickerdoodle. You can order them for delivery on sweetbeanatx.com.
For someone who really likes to cook but hates standing on their feet, a GelPro mat might be in order. The Austin-based company has a new line of comfort mats with a washable accent rug on top. (The rug stays in place with slip-resistant grippers in each corner.) The Ergo Comfort Rug ($59.95 to $119.95) is designed for the kitchen or bathroom, and you can browse rug patterns on gelpro.com, but the mats are also available at retailers, including Bed Bath and Beyond.
Whataburger has seriously upped its online store in the past few years. From funny kids’ shirts and baby onesies or a holiday sweater to an orange-and-white Yeti tumbler and a set of Whataburger table tents, if you have a Whataburger fan in your life, you’ll find something fun for them at shop.whataburger.com. They even have a Whataburger nutcracker ($39.99).
Salad-lovers will love Austinite Jill Visit’s new invention: Salad Sling, a terry cloth salad spinner that takes up much
less space than a plastic spinner. After a shoutout in the New York Times, Visit’s bright green, four-handled, 30-inch towel ($19.99) is getting a lot of attention, but it’s only available online for now at saladsling.com.
For a limited time, Tiff’s Treats is selling cookie dough for delivery or pickup at more than 30 of its stores in Texas and beyond. Through Christmas Eve, you can buy Take & Bake cookie kits with dough for two dozen chocolate chip cookies ($35) through cookiedelivery.com.
Another local chocolatier is Christina Hedrick, the founder of CruBom Raw Chocolate. She sells both truffles and chocolate bars ($7 and $10, respectively) made with a simple mix of fair-trade cacao, cold-pressed coconut oil and local honey. She sells at local pop-up markets and at crubom.com.
For a kid who loves books and cookies, consider I See Me’s custom baking children’s book called “Baking Cookies Together.” Customers submit a cookie recipe and the names of the characters to be printed in the book, which comes in Hanukkah, Christmas and non-holiday versions. You can find more personalized books at iseeme.com.
We’re all food photographers these days, but if you’re really looking to improve your food styling and photo skills, check out Andrew Scrivani’s new food photography book, “That Photo Makes Me Hungry” ($24.95), a comprehensive how-to for making your food photos worthy of a cookbook (or Instagram).
For anyone in your life who is either indecisive or really into tarot cards, check out Food Fortunes, a deck of tarot-inspired food cards ($13.58) to help you figure out what to make for dinner tonight.
Austin maker Laura Lee Imhoff is selling homemade jams and embroidered kitchen towels ($25) through her website, Made by Laura Lee, madebylauralee.com. The kitchen towel with the state of Texas would make a particularly sweet gift for someone who loves Austin, and some of them come with a spice mix.
Easy Tiger sells a number of holiday breads, and I can’t think of a better host gift than a loaf of David Norman’s stollen ($14), a traditional German Christmas bread that is a cross between bread and cake. It’s not nearly as cloying as fruitcake, and the powdered sugar on the outside sweetens the yeasted dough on the inside.
Even if you don’t think you’re up for brewing beer or wine, Austin Homebrew Supply and SoCo Homebrew have so many fun kits for making yogurt, kombucha and even non-fermented projects, like infused alcohol or canning jam or pickles. Urban Cheesecraft makes a series of cheese-making kits, including a goat cheese kit ($29) and some dairy-free cheese kits, that my kids and I have enjoyed using this year.

Texto completo: Democrats like the "optional" part of the so-called public option. But the very existence of new government insurance could shake up the system.
The single-payer health plans proposed by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are often assailed as being too disruptive. A government plan for everyone, the argument goes, would mean that tens of millions of Americans would have to give up health insurance they like.
Democratic presidential candidates with more moderate brands have their own proposal: a "public option" that would preserve the current private insurance market, while giving people the opportunity to choose government insurance.
Joe Biden, the candidate and former vice president, has gone as far as to say that "if you like your private insurance, you can keep it," under his public-option proposal. Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor, has also embraced such a plan, which he calls "Medicare for all who want it." His implication is that, if you don't want it, there will be other choices.
A public option would be less disruptive than a plan that instantly eliminated private insurance. But a public option that is inexpensive and attractive could shake up the private market and also wind up erasing some current insurance arrangements. Conversely, a public option that is expensive and unattractive might not do much good at all.
"The political appeal of the public option is it preserves the choice of private insurance," said Larry Levitt, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "But the better it works, then the less likely it is to actually preserve a private insurance market."
Most Democratic presidential candidates favor public-option plans, not just Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg. Ms. Warren recently released one, too -- part of her "transition plan" to single-payer. (Mr. Sanders has long had a public option tucked into his Medicare for All Act, to expand coverage for the four years before a single-payer system kicks in.) Public opinion surveys show that public-option plans command higher support than single-payer plans, even among Democrats.
The basic idea behind a public option is that it would have certain advantages over private insurance. But most of the public-option plans are a little vague about how strong those would be. The government is able to pay doctors and hospitals lower prices for Medicare patients than most private insurance does because it sets the prices and covers so many people.
A public option, by contrast, would cover a smaller population at first, and might have to negotiate with hospitals for good deals, just as other insurance companies do. In those circumstances, several economists said, the public option might look a lot like existing insurance: pretty expensive, and covering a limited set of doctors and hospitals.
"What would happen?" said Sherry Glied, the dean of New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a former health official in the Obama administration. "Almost nothing." Ms. Glied said that the public nature of the plan, alone, would not do much to distinguish it from private offerings.
If the public option became explicitly linked to Medicare -- requiring all providers that wanted Medicare patients to accept public-option patients, too -- the public option might be able to negotiate low prices for care and include a wide range of doctors and hospitals. In most markets of the country, that might make it far more appealing than the choices that people who buy their own insurance now have.
Insurers would have to adjust. Either they would also have to lower prices, or they would have to offer some sort of special services. Otherwise, they would lose a lot of customers.
"It would push them to demonstrate the value of what they are selling," said Linda Blumberg, a fellow at the Urban Institute. Her research has estimated the effects of several public-option plans, and found that the plans would tend to change remaining private insurance.
There's also the possibility that linking public-option coverage to Medicare could cause some doctors to stop accepting Medicare patients, Ms. Glied said. That would be another form of politically risky disruption.
Plans from the leading presidential candidates would also change rules around employer health plans, allowing workers to leave their work-based coverage to buy the public option. That change could have effects on employer insurance. Some workers, particularly those whose low incomes would qualify them for financial assistance in buying a public plan, might shift over. Ms. Blumberg said that the transition of individuals out of private plans would most likely be slower there, because employer insurance tends to be "sticky." But the existence of a public option might also induce some employers to abandon private coverage altogether.
A public-option plan wouldn't directly affect private insurers. But by changing the rules of the market, it could influence a company's business decisions. And that could affect consumers who want to buy private coverage.
Under Obamacare, new health plans had to follow a set of rules, while many old ones were allowed to stick around under the old rules. Many insurance companies canceled the old plans anyway, setting off a round of recriminations about how the law had caused people to lose coverage that they liked. President Obama had promised Americans they could keep their existing coverage under the Affordable Care Act, a vow that became Politifact's lie of the year in 2013.
A very competitive public option could have a similar effect: If it took a lot of market share from private insurers, some might decide to stop selling certain lines of coverage. Private insurance could disappear from some places, or exist largely to fill certain niches, like high-deductible plans.
The health care industry tends not to like public-option plans for this reason. A competitive public option would probably take business away from private insurers. And it would almost guarantee that doctors and hospitals would be paid less for their work. The effects might be less significant than under "Medicare for all," but they would tilt in the same direction.
Many of the candidates have been vague on key details, like whether the public-option plan would pay health care providers Medicare prices or some other price. They have also been unclear about whether the government itself would offer the public option, or whether it would allow private carriers to operate it.
Just this year Washington State established a public option but, under pressure from doctors, hospitals and insurers, set rates well above what Medicare pays and hired a private plan to run it. A national public-option plan like that would probably be less disruptive than one that's more like Medicare -- but it would also be less popular.

Texto completo: Readers discuss not sending the impeachment charges to the Senate right away, expanding the charges beyond Ukraine, basic civics and Atticus Finch.
To the Editor:
Here's an interesting idea for Democrats to ponder: Suppose President Trump is impeached and then Nancy Pelosi does not immediately send the case to the Senate, but instead declares that it would be wrong to hold a trial in the heat of an election year, and that it could be picked up later.
Of course, Mr. Trump would yell bloody murder about his "right" to a speedy trial, but this is a political not a criminal matter, and no such right exists. Besides, didn't Mitch McConnell invoke the same in the Merrick Garland case?
This would leave Mr. Trump twisting in the wind while the Dems pursued their winning kitchen table agenda. Of course, a Democratic victory would make the case moot, while a Democratic defeat would leave the option open to try to remove him.
Jay Schleifer

To the Editor:
Those of us who believe that it is essential to hold President Trump accountable must hope that the leadership of the House of Representatives does not limit the articles of impeachment against President Trump to the current Ukraine issues. Although the acts of the president with respect to Ukraine are sufficient to warrant his removal from office, limiting the scope of removal proceedings to those issues ignores his egregious behavior in many other areas.
During his presidential campaign he bribed two women who have said he had affairs with them; his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, went to prison for this. He attempted to use his powers as president to fire the independent counsel, Robert Mueller, and halt his investigations into Trump campaign contacts with people associated with Russian intelligence.
If the public is ever to fully appreciate the damage done by Mr. Trump's treasonous and demented behavior, all these issues must be included in the Senate trial.

To the Editor:
I've been following the impeachment inquiry and news closely, and I've realized that there's something drastically important that has been largely ignored. Last week the "PBS NewsHour" reported that surveys show that three-quarters of Americans can't name the three branches of government, while a full one-third can't name even one of these branches!
So when the Democrats talk about the Constitution and abuse of power, they really need simultaneously to be giving basic civics lessons. Clearly many of the more than 40 percent of Americans who think what President Trump's been doing is O.K. just don't know what he's supposed to be doing and not doing.
The Democrats need to talk about this openly, in understandable words and often.

To the Editor:
Many have remarked that impeaching the president is a vain exercise given the unlikelihood of conviction in the Senate. An effective argument to the contrary is offered by Atticus Finch, the small-town Alabama lawyer in Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird," when he explains to his daughter, Scout, why he has agreed to defend a black man wrongly accused of rape -- by all accounts a hopeless cause: "If I didn't I couldn't hold up my head in town, I couldn't represent this county in the legislature, I couldn't even tell you or Jem not to do something again."

Texto completo: The actress was reportedly fired from "America's Got Talent" after she complained about racially insensitive and other problematic behavior on set.
The ouster of Gabrielle Union as a judge on "America's Got Talent" unleashed a storm of criticism in recent days after reports that before she was let go she had experienced racially insensitive behavior on set.
Now, the biggest actors' union is investigating the show, helmed by Simon Cowell, and the leader of the anti-harassment group Time's Up is taking aim at the network, NBC, for "protecting the careers of powerful men at the expense of women who speak out."
"Not only did Union reportedly endure and witness racist and inappropriate behavior -- including racially insensitive comments and excessive criticism about her physical appearance -- but it also appears she was punished for speaking out: The company labeled her as 'difficult' before ousting her from the show altogether," Tina Tchen, the chief executive of Time's Up, said in a statement Monday.
On Nov. 22, the news broke that Union and Julianne Hough, who had joined Cowell, Howie Mandel and Terry Crews as hosts for the 14th season of "America's Got Talent" this year, would not be returning. In the days that followed, Variety reported that Union had been let go after tense incidents that included her being repeatedly told that her hairstyles were "too black," and her urging producers to report to human resources a joke Jay Leno made during a guest appearance in which he alluded to Koreans' eating dog meat. (The joke was edited out before broadcast.)
According to Vulture, Union was also frustrated that producers had discouraged judges from supporting a 10-year-old black rapper (Vulture reported that she was told they needed an act "that America can get behind") and that Union was further deemed problematic to work with after she complained about Cowell's smoking indoors and asked several performers what their preferred pronouns were.
Representatives for Union and Leno did not return requests for comment. Union, 47, a Hollywood star known for roles in movies including "Bring It On" and "10 Things I Hate About You" and the BET drama series "Being Mary Jane," has not spoken publicly about her complaints. But she took to Twitter over the holiday weekend to thank supporters, and on Sunday she retweeted a message about how to apologize.
Among her public supporters were Kerry Washington, Ariana Grande, Ellen Pompeo, Sophia Bush and Union's husband, the retired basketball star Dwyane Wade, who tweeted " I am even more proud of her standing up for what she stands for and that's US."
On his SiriusXM radio show on Monday, Howard Stern, a former "America's Got Talent" judge himself, called Cowell's show "the ultimate example of a boys' club."
In a joint statement, NBC, Syco, which is Cowell's company, and the company Fremantle, which also produces the show, said they had reached out to Union to hear more about her concerns and would take appropriate next steps.
"We remain committed to ensuring a respectful workplace for all employees and take very seriously any questions about workplace culture," the statement read. A spokesperson said the companies had retained outside counsel and expected to speak with Union and her representatives this week.
A longtime music executive unafraid of sharing lacerating opinions onscreen, Cowell became a reality-talent-show powerhouse following his turn as a judge on the first season of "American Idol" in 2002, and went on to produce the "X Factor" and "Got Talent" franchises. "America's Got Talent" is now holding auditions for its 15th season.
NBC came under renewed scrutiny in recent months after the journalist Ronan Farrow reported in his book "Catch and Kill" that the network shut down his investigation of Harvey Weinstein. Farrow went on to publish his findings in The New Yorker, winning a Pulitzer for public service that he shared with The New York Times. NBC has said that Farrow distorted how the network handled his reporting.
The book also included an account of a woman who said she had been raped by Matt Lauer, who was fired from the network for sexual harassment in 2017; Lauer denied the accusation.
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing over 100,000 actors, journalists and other performers, said in a statement that it had taken steps to investigate Union's departure from "America's Got Talent" but so far had nothing to report.

'Wow': A 1643 Deal on Vellum

Texto completo: The Brooklyn Historical Society acquires the deed giving 200 acres near Coney Island to Anthony van Salee, the first known person of Muslim origin to settle in America.
Anthony Jansen van Salee, better known as "Anthony the Turk," was one of the most colorful characters in New Amsterdam, the Dutch colony that later became New York City.
The son of a Dutch pirate and a Moorish woman, he fought constant legal battles with his neighbors, one of whom denounced him as "a rascal and a horned beast." In 1639, after an ill-advised feud with the religious leader of the fledgling settlement at the tip of Manhattan, he and his wife -- a reputed prostitute known for her salty tongue (and her habit of measuring clients' endowments with a broomstick) -- were banished.
Like others pushed out of Manhattan in later centuries, Anthony -- considered the first known person of Muslim descent to settle in America -- just moved across the East River, and before long had secured a grant of nearly 200 acres of farmland near the wilds of Coney Island. And one afternoon last month, the recently rediscovered deed for the mother of all Brooklyn real-estate scores came home.
It arrived at the Brooklyn Historical Society's stately headquarters in Brooklyn Heights in an unassuming brown package, fresh from Christie's, where the historical society bought it in October for $ 27,500. Upstairs in the library, a small group gathered as Maggie Schreiner, the manager of archives and special collections, placed the package on a low shelf used to store fire-insurance atlases and gently sliced it open.
"There it is!" Deborah Schwartz, the historical society's president, said in an awed whisper, as the document -- deeply creased from repeated folding, its ink slightly faded to brown -- came into view. "Wow."
The deed, which will be on view at the historical society from Dec. 11 to 15, is "far and away" the most important item it has acquired recently, Ms. Schwartz said. It's also one that arrived at a fortuitous moment.
When the auction listing popped up, the historical society had just completed a three-year oral history project and exhibition documenting Muslims in Brooklyn -- a community that has deep roots in the borough but was all but invisible in the society's archives.
"This is an amazing document," said Julie Golia, the historical society's vice president for curatorial affairs and collections. "It's not only unbelievably significant to the way we understand the 17th century, but it's also a direct tie to the kinds of themes and questions we are digging into about the 20th and 21st centuries."
While Anthony's land acquisition was known from the colony's official records (which have been translated by the New Netherland Project), the fact that his copy of the deed survived was not. When it was brought to Christie's, the owner, whom the auction house is not identifying, thought it was notable mainly for its early date of 1643 and an endorsement on the back by Peter Stuyvesant.
The roughly 7-by-13-inch piece of vellum, purchased with a grant from the B.H. Breslauer Foundation, may not look like much compared with treasures like the ultrarare 1770 map of Manhattan by the master cartographer Bernard Ratzer that was discovered among the society's uncataloged holdings a few years ago. But its details suggest a tantalizing story.
In the library, the three women leaned close to read the dense, neat script, picking out words like "Nieuw Amsterdam" and "Conyne Eylandt," and the signature of Willem Kieft, the colonial governor who issued the deed. On the reverse, the endorsement of Stuyvesant -- who became governor in 1647, and presumably signed it to recertify its legality -- was faded almost to invisibility.
"Some of the most powerful documents, the ones that let you tell the most powerful stories once you dig in with research and read between the lines, are often the most innocuous," Ms. Golia said.
The story of Anthony Jansen van Salee, or "Anthony the Turk," who was born in 1607, certainly provides plenty to think about. His father, Jan Jansen, a Dutch privateer, was captured by one of the Moorish states in 1618. He reportedly converted to Islam, possibly by force, and became one of the famed Barbary pirates. (Van Salee was a reference to the Moroccan port of Salee, where the family lived for a time; "Turk" was a derogatory term used at the time for Muslims of any ethnicity.)
Anthony set sail for New Amsterdam in 1629, and before long acquired a large farm just north of the city stockade at Wall Street, along with a reputation as one of the most quarrelsome characters in a town full of them.
Within five years, he had been hauled into court for offenses including "stealing wood, paying wages he owed with a dead goat, allowing his dog to kill a neighbor's hog, pointing a loaded pistol at the overseer of the West India Company's slaves, threatening a debt collector with bloodshed if he insisted on the money owed and slandering any number of people," according to a biographical entry posted online by the New Netherland Institute.
The last straw came in 1639, when his wife, Grietje Reyniers, was accused of insinuating that the wife of the colony's religious leader had herself solicited prostitution. When Anthony refused to back down, he and Grietje were ordered to leave New Amsterdam for good.
Anthony sold his farm near Wall Street, but somehow secured the deed for 100 morgens of land, or about 200 acres, near Coney Island. At the time, the area now known as Brooklyn -- outside New Amsterdam, but claimed by the broader New Netherland colony -- was the frontier, occupied by Native Americans and, near Wallabout Bay and a few other spots, a smattering of colonists.
"It was the Wild West, or the Wild East," Ms. Golia said.
It remains unclear how Anthony was able to get the grant. (Also unclear, Ms. Golia noted, was exactly how the Dutch gained control of that land from the Canarsee, the tribe of the Lenape nation who inhabited the area.) But within a few decades, he was one of the most prosperous landowners in Kings County, whose illustrious descendants include Cornelius Vanderbilt.
His story is usually offered as illustrative of the fractious nature of the motley Dutch colony, long seen as "a collection of losers and scalawags," as the historian Russell Shorto once put it. But peel back the salacious particulars, Ms. Golia said, and it reveals deep questions about race and gender, identity and self-identity, that resonate in our time.
Anthony's own religious observance is unknown. But historical sources indicate that a Quran said to have belonged to him was auctioned in the mid-20th century, suggesting that his Muslim heritage was meaningful to him, Ms. Golia said.
"In our oral histories, we have people who practice and who don't," she said. "Now we have an opportunity to think about how that might have worked in the 17th century."
The relationship between Anthony's perceived race and his legal troubles, Ms. Golia said, bears pondering. So, she said, does the frequent identification of Grietje (the heroine of Michael Pye's 1996 novel "The Drowning Room") as a prostitute, which may itself be a slander.
In 2011, after The New York Times ran an article referring to her as "a lady of the night," one of her 10th great-granddaughters wrote a riposte defending her honor, pointing out that the testimony calling her a "whore" came from a clergyman who was himself "a belligerent liar and drunkard."
"This woman is a troublemaker, this man is of mixed race," Ms. Golia said. "What role did that play in their exile? There are so many things to investigate here."

Meet Noah Feldman, the Harvard professor testifying before the Judiciary Committee

Texto completo: Noah Feldman literally wrote the book on constitutional law.
The Harvard Law School professor, who will be one of four academics testifying Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee as it probes the legal grounds for impeaching President Trump, coauthored the textbook “Constitutional Law."
But that is only the tip of the iceberg of the prolific writing of the prominent public intellectual. He coauthored another textbook, on the First Amendment, as well as seven other nonfiction books that covered topics ranging from President James Madison to America's “church-state problem" to the rise and fall of the Islamic State.
The Boston native is also a Bloomberg News opinion columnist and hosts a podcast called “Deep Background." He has contributed to the New York Times magazine and New York Review of Books. And he does not shy away from various media appearances.
“Noah is a brilliant and charismatic professor with a lightning-fast mind and ability to express his vast knowledge in lively and accessible terms," said Kathleen Sullivan, a former dean of Stanford Law School and former Harvard Law professor, who co-authored the textbooks with Feldman.
“He is not only a gifted scholar and adored teacher but also a public intellectual who makes influential comments on the most pressing legal issues of the day," Sullivan, who is now an appellate litigator in private practice, said in an e-mail.
Feldman “specializes in constitutional studies, with a particular emphasis on the relationship between law and religion, free speech, constitutional design, and the history of legal theory," according to the Harvard Law website.
After receiving his bachelor's degree in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University in 1992, he was selected as a Rhodes scholar and earned a doctor of philosophy degree from Oxford University in 1994. He received his law degree from Yale Law School in 1997, according to the Harvard website.
He clerked for a District of Columbia Appeals Court judge as well as for Supreme Court Justice David Souter. Before joining the Harvard faculty, he was a law professor at New York University School of Law.
When he left NYU for Harvard in 2007, Elena Kagan, dean of Harvard Law at the time (she is now a Supreme Court justice), hailed him as one of the “stars of his generation." He had been dubbed “Most Beautiful Brainiac" by New York magazine during his time in that city. Esquire in 2008 called him “a public intellectual for our time."
The New York Times reported at the time that questions were being raised about Feldman's youth — he was 32 at the time — but a consensus was emerging that, because of his studies in Islamic thought at Oxford and in constitutional law, he was a good choice.
Feldman grew up in Boston as an Orthodox Jew. He learned Hebrew and Aramaic to read the ancient and medieval texts taught at the Maimonides School, a private Jewish school in Brookline. He then started studying Arabic at 15 in summer school, the Times reported.
His interest in the law came after his interest in Islam. His expertise in the two fields suddenly became especially valuable after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the Times reported.
In 2003, he brought his legal skills to bear in a turbulent situation, serving as senior constitutional adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, and subsequently advising members of the Iraqi Governing Council on the drafting of the Transitional Administrative Law, or interim constitution, according to the Harvard Law website.
So, what might Feldman say to the committee Wednesday?
In a PBS-TV interview in late October with Walter Isaacson, Feldman may have given some clues. He said he felt President Trump's pressuring Ukraine for a political benefit was an impeachable offense.
“To me, the abuse of power is the thing that the Constitution says that the president should be impeached for," he said. “And you define 'abuse of power' by the idea that the president is doing something that's within his constitutional authority, it's within his power, like putting pressure on a foreign government, but he's doing it not to serve the interests of the United States but to serve his personal interest and the interest of getting reelected. And that's, to my mind, very clearly what's going on."
“What matters is the president is overtly saying to Ukraine, 'Do these investigations,' and the only party who can benefit from those investigations is Donald Trump," Feldman said.
He said he felt it was also an impeachable offense when Trump later issued a similar call publicly to China.
“That's also openly calling on a foreign state to help the president get reelected not to serve the interests of the United States as a republic. That's the textbook definition of an abuse of power," he said.
The other expert witnesses are Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School, Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of Law, and Jonathan Turley of the George Washington University Law School.
Feldman, Karlan, and Gerhardt are being called to testify by Democrats, while Turley was selected by the committee's Republican members.

Graham: 'Be wary' of rumors about a rift between Barr and DOJ inspector general ahead of FISA report

Texto completo: Sen. Lindsey Graham said to beware of reports claiming there is a rift between Attorney General William Barr and the Justice Department inspector general.
The Washington Post reported on Monday that Barr has told associates that he disagrees with Inspector General Michael Horowitz's determination that the FBI had sufficient information to launch a counterintelligence investigation into members of the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016.
Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, responded to that report in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, warning that the findings in the watchdog investigation into alleged surveillance abuses against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page are being minimized by the media outlets getting the leaks.
"Be wary of the Washington Post and the New York Times reporting on what is coming up with Horowitz. They have been trying overtime to spin this thing to diminish its effect, to downplay it," the South Carolina Republican said.
"I can tell you without any hesitation Attorney General Barr has every confidence in the world in Mr. Horowitz," Graham added. "He believes that he has done a good job, a professional job, and he appreciates the work and the effort he has put into disclosing abuse at the Department of Justice."

Before Graham's warning about alleged media spin regarding the DOJ, Hannity claimed there was discord between Barr and Horowitz.
Earlier in the program, Hannity said his sources told him Horowitz will confirm "a ton of damning information, devastating information on the DOJ, the FBI, the FISA applications" but there is "apparently" some unwillingness by the inspector general to "take the needed steps ... to bluntly say what it is."
Hannity, who noted Horowitz was appointed to inspector general by President Barack Obama, said he was told of a “brutal back-and-forth" behind the scenes between Barr and Horowitz.
Horowitz's report is due to be released on Dec. 9, and the inspector general is scheduled to testify before Graham's panel two days later.
DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec released a statement Monday evening praising Horowitz’s work and urging people to avoid speculation about his report before it is released.
Tweet
Leaks about a draft report show Horowitz found missteps and lapses in judgment by the FBI but no political bias by top officials tainting the Russia investigation, as Trump and his allies have claimed. Early reports have also asserted that investigators found no evidence of spying on the Trump campaign, although they acknowledge informants and electronic surveillance methods were used by the FBI to collect information about members of the team.
Barr said earlier this year he believed "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign and the key question on his mind was whether it was justified. At least one FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, is now reportedly the subject of a criminal investigation for allegedly altering a record related to the secret surveillance of Page.
U.S. Attorney John Durham is also conducting a criminal inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation. The inquiry recently shifted from an administrative review.

Barry is a Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist; Mansbach is a New York Times bestselling author; and Zweibel a five-time Emmy award winner.
Each event will be in the Orlove Auditorium, 5850 S. Pine Island Road, Davie. Contact 954-434-0499, ext. 336, or dpjcc.org/culturalarts.org.
Brunch with Library Foundation
The Broward County Public Library Foundation's biggest event of the year is the Literary Feast, but the organization plans book events year-round. The popular Book With Brunch continues with historian and novelist Les Standiford discussing "Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, and the Rise of America's Xanadu" (Atlantic Monthly Press) at 10:30 a.m. Dec. 5 at ArtServe, 1350 E.

In his latest book, Standiford tells the history of Palm Beach beginning with Henry Flagler's arrival to Mar-a-Lago, which he calls the island's most significant building. Standiford is the author of 21 books, including "Bringing Adam Home: The Abduction That Changed America," several acclaimed works of nonfiction, the John Deal mysteries and two works adapted into feature films.
Literary events
at the Levis JCC
Literary events continue at the Adolph & Rose Levis Jewish Community Center's Sandler Center, 21050 95th Avenue S., Boca Raton. For information or register for both events, contact 561-558-2520 or levisjcc.org/sandler.
Ralph Nurnberger discusses his "Life in A Jar: How Irena Sendler Saved the Children of the Warsaw Ghetto," the story of social worker Irena Sendler, who saved children's lives by convincing their parents to give them up. She then had them adopted into Polish families or hid them in convents and orphanages. The children's real names were placed in jars that were buried in the garden to eventually be dug up so the children could learn their true identities. Nurnberger's presentation is at 7:30 p.m. Dec. 10. Cost is $25.
The JCC's "Literary Afternoon Series" includes appearances by authors discussing their works and creative process. Thelma Adams discusses her novel "Bittersweet Brooklyn," in which a young woman struggles with her devotion to her mobster brother in turn-of-the century New York, at 2:30 p.m. Dec. 3 at the Sandler Center. Cost is $25 for individual programs or $110 for the entire series that continues through March.
Cooking with character
Cookbooks written by mystery writers are gaining in popularity, especially with the success of "Goldy's Kitchen Cookbook: Cooking, Writing, Family, Life" by Diane Mott Davidson; "The Cozy Cookbook: More than 100 Recipes from Today's Bestselling Mystery Authors" edited by Julie Hyzy, Laura Childs and Cleo Coyle; and "The Mystery Writers of America Cookbook: Wickedly Good Meals and Desserts to Die For" edited by Kate White.
Plantation author Nancy Cohen joins that group with her "A Bad Hair Day Cookbook." But Cohen says she didn't write the cookbook - her character Marla Shores did and Cohen just helped. Well, Cohen did more than help.
"I've collected so many recipes over the years and kept making my favorite dishes that I would post pictures on Facebook and recipes on my website," Cohen wrote in an email. "I like dining out, talking about food, and taking cooking classes. So, I decided to compile my recipes into a cookbook. As a tribute to my fans, I added commentary and tips from Marla's viewpoint. A special entry was written by my mother (now deceased)." Cohen has written 17 novels featuring Marla, her hairstylist sleuth. She said the cookbook also is a legacy to her children and new grandson.
Cohen will discuss "A Bad Hair Day Cookbook," joined by Florida author Alyssa Maxwell talking about her novel "Murder at Crossways," at 1 p.m. Dec. 8 at Murder on the Beach Mystery Bookstore, 104 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach, 561-279-7790, murderonthebeach.com. Light refreshments including an appetizer and a "spirited" cake will be served, Cohen said.
Poetry workshops, readings
"Hermit crab poetry" was coined in the late 1990s to mean borrowing forms from other disciplines, such as dictionary entries, instruction manuals and tarot cards as containers for content. The Palm Beach Poetry Festival holds its workshop "Playing the Shell Game: Hermit Crab Poetry" at 1 p.m. Dec. 7 at Old School Square Crest Theatre, 51 N. Swinton Ave., Delray Beach, 561-243-7922. Cost is $10 per person. Poet and FIU creative writing professor Julie Marie Wade will lead the workshop.
"Bards of a Feather," an open-mic round robin poetry reading, begins at 1 p.m. Dec. 12 at the Hagen Ranch Library Meeting Room, 14350 Hagen Ranch Road, Delray Beach, 561-894-7000. Participants should bring up to four poems, original or not, to share during this free event. The festival's Senior Poetry Project wraps up the year reading holiday poems and singing at 10:30 a.m. Dec. 17 at the Sunrise Assisted Living, Brighton Gardens, 6341 Via De Sonrisa Del Sur, Boca Raton. Volunteers are welcome.
Meanwhile, the 16th annual Palm Beach Poetry Festival will be held Jan. 20-25 at Old School Square in Delray Beach. The festival will feature top poets at numerous ticketed public events, including readings, talks, interviews, panel discussions and workshops. For more information about any of these events, visit www.palmbeachpoetryfestival.org.
Memories
of Paris
Mamta Chaudhry's novel "Haunting Paris" is the story of a grief-stricken woman who finds a letter revealing that her deceased lover was searching for his niece he believed escaped the Holocaust. Chaudhry discusses her critically acclaimed novel at noon Dec. 18 at Temple Israel, 137 NE 19th St., Miami. Chaudhry's presentation continues the Brickell Avenue Literary Society's monthly luncheons, which brings in top authors to discuss their work. The series continues through March. Annual memberships start at $250 for an individual and $95 for young professionals, and are fully tax-deductible. Non-members are welcome to attend up to two literary events per season and are only required to pay the event fee, which is $50 per person; $30 for young professionals 35 and under. For memberships, event tickets and more information, visit www.brickellliterary.org.
How not to write
Barbara Flores, a designer and cookbook author, gives a humorous look at marriage in "Separated, Acting Badly: A Bi-Cultural Memoir," which she says shows "how not to write a memoir." When her husband left her for a younger woman, Flores geared up to save her 30-year marriage. Of course, everyone she knew, both friends and relatives, had different advice for her, including luring him back with homemade enchiladas, rosary petitions and even witchcraft. Flores will discuss her book at 4 p.m. Dec. 7 at Murder on the Beach Mystery Bookstore, 104 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach, 561-279-7790, murderonthebeach.com.
Deadline is Dec. 20 for the January events roundup. Email olinecog@aol.com.

Texto completo: Her previous book, the best-selling memoir "Brain on Fire," told how former New York Post investigative reporter Susannah Cahalan struggled after being misdiagnosed with mental illness. Cahalan will discuss her experience and her new book, "The Great Pretender: The Undercover Mission That Changed Our Understanding of Madness," at a Mark My Words talk on Dec. 3 from 7 to 9 p.m. at The Mark Twain House & Museum, 351 Farmington Ave., Hartford. Tickets are $20.
The book tells how a 1973 experiment by a Stanford psychologist and his associates who went undercover as asylum patients led to the closing of institutions and changes in diagnoses. But, the book says, what really happened is at odds with the real story. Cahalan will discuss her books with Harold I. (Hank) Schwartz, M.D., psychiatrist-in-chief emeritus at the Institute of Living/Hartford Hospital. Information and tickets: marktwainhouse.org.

Texto completo: Danielle Stella, a Republican, suggested on Twitter that Ms. Omar be tried for treason and hanged.
Twitter suspended the accounts of Danielle Stella, a Republican candidate hoping to challenge Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota next year, after she suggested the congresswoman should be tried for treason and hanged.
Ms. Stella's campaign account said on Tuesday, "If it is proven @IlhanMN passed sensitive info to Iran, she should be tried for #treason and hanged," according to screenshots of the tweet. She later added a photo of a stick figure hanging from the gallows, The Washington Times reported.
The tweet referred to unsupported stories that Ms. Omar was recruited as a "Qatari asset" who gave information to Qatar that was given to Iran, something she denied to The Jerusalem Post. The office for the congresswoman called the stories "outlandishly absurd."
The personal and campaign Twitter accounts for Ms. Stella, who is running for Minnesota's Fifth Congressional District, which elected Ms. Omar in 2018, were permanently suspended for "repeated violations" of the platform's rules, Twitter said in a statement on Saturday.
Twitter's hateful conduct policy says users may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people based on a number of factors.
Ms. Stella's campaign website describes her as a special education needs professional who has dedicated her life to caring for children with autism and who "firmly" supports the president. She is one of at least five Republican candidates seeking the party's nomination in an August primary.
"My suspension for advocating for the enforcement of federal code proves Twitter will always side with and fight to protect terrorists, traitors, pedophiles and rapists," Ms. Stella said in a statement on Saturday.
In a statement on Facebook on Friday, Ms. Stella said she had not threatened anyone.
"If you are calling it a threat -- you believe that individual is guilty, and therefore it is not a threat, it's treason," she wrote, adding that traitors to the United States should be tried for their crimes.
Ms. Stella said critics were making her post about race, religion and "about anything but the truth." She has since been the target of death threats from the "angry liberal mob where facts don't matter, only emotion," she wrote.
Ms. Omar, who is one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress and is no stranger to threats, responded on Twitter.
"This is the natural result of a political environment where anti-Muslim dogwhistles and dehumanization are normalized by an entire political party and its media outlets," she wrote on Friday. "Violent rhetoric inevitably leads to violent threats, and ultimately, violent acts."
Ms. Omar's office did not return requests for comment on Saturday.
The suspension this week raised eyebrows, as President Trump has repeatedly used Twitter to attack others and stoke outrage without facing consequences from the platform. Amid calls to terminate the president's account, Twitter said in October that it would be lenient with world leaders who violate the rules, saying there was a clear public interest value to keeping their tweets.
Twitter's suspension of Ms. Stella's accounts may cause politicians to pay close attention to what they're posting, one expert said.
"Twitter's trying to send a message that, like, there's a line you can cross in terms of violating our terms of services, and even though it's politically uncomfortable for us to have to enforce these bans, we are going to do this," Joshua A. Tucker, a professor of politics and co-director of the New York University Center for Social Media and Politics, said on Saturday.
Politicians may see this and act accordingly to avoid losing access to Twitter, he said.
Professor Tucker added that it was smart of Twitter to take action against someone who is not an office holder and is in a primary election, so the company could not be accused of interfering with a current public officeholder or affecting the outcome of a general election.
However, the suspension could work in Ms. Stella's favor.
"Of course, this might help her by generating tons of national attention for her, and she may end up getting lots of donations from Republicans around the country who feel they want to take a stance against Twitter interfering," he said.

Learning to Love 'Frozen,' Repeatedly

Texto completo: Once a father took his aversion to "Frozen" and, yes, let it go, he realized that beyond the branded backpacks and Anna and Elsa matching sock sets, the movie is an ingeniously crafted tale.
"Frozen" was released on Nov. 27, 2013, and our daughter was born nearly two months later, so, even before my wife and I had a child, "Frozen" hovered on the fringes of our parental consciousness as something to be avoided and vaguely despised. If the term "Disney princess" evokes, for a certain kind of parent, a distasteful ethos of sparkly dresses, impossible wasp-waists and fables of princely rescue, then "Frozen," which centers on not one but two princesses, seemed, sight unseen, to be doubly odious. Yet one day, years later, when preschool was canceled and the rain was unceasing, my wife sent me a text: She'd done it. In case of emergency, she'd broken glass. She'd rented, and they'd watched, "Frozen."
It's hard for me to say now exactly how many times I've watched "Frozen" from beginning to end -- 10, 12, 20? -- but I can say with confidence that I've watched it more times than any other film in my life. I've watched it more than I've watched "Citizen Kane." I've watched it more than all the "Godfather" films combined. I've definitely listened to the "Frozen" soundtrack well over 100 times, based on a rather conservative estimate of at least once a week for 52 weeks over three years. I could sing the entire soundtrack to you right now from memory. "Born of cold and winter air and mountain rain combining ..."
If those lyrics have no resonance for you, I won't bother recapping the plot, which honestly feels at this point like stopping to explain what "weather" is. I also understand that, relatively speaking, my total number of "Frozen" viewings is modest -- some superfans claim to have watched it over 100 times. But given that there was a moment in my life when I strongly felt I would not watch "Frozen" even once, I'm shocked at how familiar I am with it -- and, more than that, by how much affection I feel for it. I live with someone, a tiny someone, who wants to watch and listen to "Frozen" again and again. (And again.) If familiarity breeds contempt, I should hate "Frozen." A lot. So why am I so excited to take my tiny someone to see "Frozen 2?"
Here's one thing I've learned from watching "Frozen" repeatedly: "Frozen" is good. Very good. Once I took my prejudicial aversion to it and, yes, let it go, I realized that beyond the lunchboxes and branded backpacks and Anna and Elsa matching sock sets, the movie itself is an expertly and even ingeniously crafted tale, a nuanced examination of sisterly devotion that features some of the best voice talent in the world, several very catchy songs and a lot of impressively rendered CGI snow. The dialogue is funny. The physical comedy is inspired. The set pieces, like a wolf chase across a mountainside covered in fresh powder or a final mad dash across a frozen harbor, are imaginatively staged and visually inventive. The entire film is especially enjoyable if you have an affinity for classic musical theater, as the lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez and the composer Robert Lopez clearly do. (Fun fact: Lopez, who also composed the music for "The Book of Mormon" and "Avenue Q," is not only the youngest person ever to win an EGOT -- an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony -- but he's the only person to have won each award more than once.) It's not hard, for example, to imagine the number "In Summer," as sung by Olaf the sentient snowman (voiced by Josh Gad), happily wedged into a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, performed by Donald O'Connor or Danny Kaye.
The other thing I've learned from "Frozen" is this: There is value in watching something over and over. One psychological theory contends that repeating a pleasurable experience is more likely to make you feel happy overall than a restless search for constant novelty -- which seems counterintuitive, particularly in a capitalist culture in which a ceaseless churn of newness is an economic imperative, whether it's trading in for a new car every few years or subscribing to a streaming service for a catalog of "content" you'd need several lifetimes to sit through. But as a Harvard psychologist recently told The New York Times in an article about the value of the familiar, "the process of looking for new insights in any repeat experience is fulfilling in and of itself. It's the essence of mindfulness."
And I can report that it's possible, while listening to "Do You Want to Build a Snowman" for the 80th time, to achieve a kind of meditative transcendence, even bliss. Once you've watched a film or heard a song 20 (or 100) times, you're not only noticing all kinds of new and interesting things, but you start to notice everything -- every note, every chord, every facial twitch, every nuance. With repeated exposure, you gain a new respect for Idina Menzel, who voices Elsa, and her superhuman ability to belt out a ballad unerringly while also imbuing it with complex emotional texture. Personally, I had this revelation on my 30th or 40th listen to the duet "For the First Time in Forever (Reprise)" -- and, yes, maybe I was choking up a little at the time. The ability to repeatedly engage with a work of art to the point where you not only experience the initial emotional impact but start to comprehend the framework of craftsmanship beneath it is the essence of cultural appreciation. And, frankly, it's a thrilling experience, no matter what work of art you're engaging with.
It's also a new experience. Of all the differences between my childhood and my daughter's, the one she finds hardest to fathom, the one that confounds her the most, is that when I was a kid, I could not simply flip on the TV and watch my favorite movie whenever I wanted. I'd like to say this led to a childhood of Masterpiece Theater and rereading Dickens, but what it really meant is that I watched whatever terrible cartoon happened to be on at the time my parents allowed me to watch cartoons. My little sister was of a generation that at least got to wear out her VHS tape of "The Little Mermaid," but I was too early even for that. My parents did sit me down on Saturday afternoons to watch "The Music Man" or "Oklahoma!" when they aired on the classic movies channel, but the exercise had the dusty sensation of homework, and I could still only watch each movie once. (This felt like a blessing at the time). Only later was I able to return to them and see the artistry my parents were hoping I'd discover.
When I was close to my daughter's age (she's nearly 6), the film that I would have wanted to watch over and over (and over) again was "Star Wars." But I only saw it once during its initial run. It was a magical experience and in the weeks and months that followed it lingered in my mind like a half-remembered dream. I eventually persuaded my parents to take me back to see it again, at a repertory theater, a year or two later, even though watching a movie in the theater twice felt, to my parents, like an inconceivable extravagance. I should also confess that during a particularly boring high school data-entry job, I listened to a condensed version of the "Star Wars" story on cassette maybe 300 times, maybe 500, maybe more.
So I'm happy my daughter can watch her favorite film as often as she wants, whenever she wants to, at least until it's not her favorite film anymore. We're both looking forward to "Frozen 2," which I'm sure we'll eventually watch at least 20 times. Lately, she's gotten into the animated films of Hayao Miyazaki, including "Spirited Away" and "My Friend Totoro" (both acknowledged influences on "Frozen") -- we've watched them together about four times each, and counting.
In fact, I can't think of a better foundation for a lifetime of loving culture than the ability to steep yourself in the art that you love right now. Maybe "Frozen" will vault my daughter toward the discovery of other musical-theater classics -- or not. Maybe musicals won't be her thing at all. But I'm excited for her to continue to discover what her thing is and immerse herself in it joyfully. Right now, "Frozen" is her thing. And we're enjoying it together. A lot.

Leon Bridges, Camila Cabello, Lana Del Rey, James Corden and Zooey Deschanel stop by to perform songs from that album and the Christmas canon with Musgraves, while Troye Sivan joins the singer in the debut of a new collaboration called "Glittery." Even Musgraves's grandmother Nana stops by to spread some Christmas cheer.
MIDSOMER MURDERS Stream on Acorn TVand BritBox. Despite the best efforts of Detective Chief Inspector John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) and Detective Sergeant Winter (Nick Hendrix), the murder rate in the fictional English county of Midsomer just keeps climbing. The 21st season of this show takes the detectives into the worlds of beekeeping, competitive dance contests, miniature doll houses and a rivalry between fishermen and mud runners to uncover the villagers' secrets, passions and jealousies that boil over into foul play.
I LOST MY BODY (2019) Stream on Netflix. Part love story, part adventure odyssey, this imaginative animated feature tells the outlandish tale of a young man living in Paris whose hand gets mysteriously severed from his body. In one timeline told through flashbacks, Naoufel, a pizza delivery driver, works to change his life after meeting a librarian named Gabrielle. The more macabre present sees the severed appendage embarking on a journey to reconnect with its owner. The director Jérémy Clapin "shoots the hand as if it could see, frequently animating it scuttling on the ground to emphasize its smallness and its vulnerability in a hostile world," Teo Bugbee wrote in her review for The New York Times. "The hand takes on pigeons, rats and cars in its journey back to Naoufel's body, and the breakneck pace of these scenes contributes to the sensory overload in which every new image presents a fresh reason to recoil."
What's on TV
APOLLO 11 (2019) 9 p.m. on CNN. Sourced almost entirely from rediscovered archival footage and around 11,000 hours of audio recordings, this documentary offers an intimate look behind the scenes of the first successful lunar mission. Additionally, the director, Todd Douglas Miller, "uses simple but effective white-on-black graphics, graphic animations and, occasionally, footage set up in split-screen to highlight particularly harrowing maneuvers, to convey the complications of the actions the Apollo 11 crew had to so precisely execute," A.O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review. "The impact is nearly mind-boggling."

Texto completo: This has been a golden age for brain research. We now have amazing brain scans that show which networks in the brain ramp up during different activities. But this emphasis on the brain has subtly fed the illusion that thinking happens only from the neck up. It's fed the illusion that the advanced parts of our thinking are the "rational" parts up top that try to control the more "primitive" parts down below.
So it's interesting how many scientists are now focusing on the thinking that happens not in your brain but in your gut. You have neurons spread through your innards, and there's increasing attention on the vagus nerve, which emerges from the brain stem and wanders across the heart, lungs, kidney and gut.
The vagus nerve is one of the pathways through which the body and brain talk to each other in an unconscious conversation. Much of this conversation is about how we are relating to others. Human thinking is not primarily about individual calculation, but about social engagement and cooperation.
One of the leaders in this field is Stephen W. Porges of Indiana University. When you enter a new situation, Porges argues, your body reacts. Your heart rate may go up. Your blood pressure may change. Signals go up to the brain, which records the "autonomic state" you are in.
Maybe you walk into a social situation that feels welcoming. Green light. Your brain and body get prepared for a friendly conversation. But maybe the person in front of you feels threatening. Yellow light. You go into fight-or-flight mode. Your body instantly changes. Your ear, for example, adjusts to hear high and low frequencies -- a scream or a growl -- rather than midrange frequencies, human speech. Or maybe the threat feels like a matter of life and death. Red light. Your brain and body begin to shut down.
According to Porges' "Polyvagal Theory," the concept of safety is fundamental to our mental state. People who have experienced trauma have bodies that are highly reactive to perceived threat. They don't like public places with loud noises. They live in fight-or-flight mode, stressed and anxious. Or, if they feel trapped and constrained, they go numb. Their voice and tone go flat. Physical reactions shape our way of seeing and being.
Lisa Feldman Barrett, of Northeastern University, also argues that a main purpose of the brain is to read the body, and to regulate what she calls the body budget. You may see a bully on the playground. Your brain then predicts your next action and speeds your heart rate and breathing to deal with it. You experience these changes as emotion -- oh, this is fear or oh, this is anger -- because your brain has created an emotion concept to make those physical changes meaningful.
"You might think that in everyday life, the things you see and hear influence what you feel, but it's mostly the other way around: What you feel alters your sight and hearing," Barrett writes in "How Emotions Are Made."
When we're really young we know few emotion concepts. Young children say, "Mommy, I hate you!" when they mean "I don't like this" because they haven't learned their culture's concepts for hatred vs. badness. But as we get older we learn more emotional granularity. The emotionally wise person can create distinct experiences of disappointment, anger, spite, resentment, grouchiness and aggravation, whereas for a less emotionally wise person those are all synonyms for "I feel bad."
A wise person may know the foreign words that express emotions we can't name in English: tocka (Russian, roughly, for spiritual anguish) or litost (Czech, roughly, for misery combined with the hunger for revenge). People with high emotional granularity respond flexibly to life, have better mental health outcomes and drink less.
If bodily reactions can drive people apart, they can also heal. Martha G. Welch of Columbia University points to the importance of loving physical touch, especially in the first 1,000 minutes of life, to lay down markers of emotional stability.
Under the old brain-only paradigm, Welch argues, we told people to self-regulate their emotions through conscious self-talk. But real emotional help comes through co-regulation. When a mother and a child physically hold each other, their bodily autonomic states harmonize, connecting on a metabolic level. Together they move from separate distress to mutual calm.
Welch has created something called the Welch Emotional Connection Screen, which measures the emotional connection between mothers and preterm babies. By encouraging this kind of deep visceral connection through 18 months, her therapy can mitigate the effects of autism.
When you step back and see the brain and body thinking together, the old distinction between reason and emotion doesn't seem to make sense. Your very perception of the world is shaped by the predictions your brain is making about your physical autonomic states.
You also see how important it is to teach emotional granularity, something our culture pays almost no attention to.
You also see that we're not separate brains, coolly observing each other. We're physical viscera, deeply interacting with each other. The important communication is happening at a much deeper level.

Texto completo: Polls indicate that a majority of millennials do not know what Auschwitz was. The future might teach them by analogies.
NEW YORK – From the mountains of shoes that were worn by Jews when they were packed into railroad freight cars bound for Auschwitz, the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust displays one: a woman's red dress pump with a three-inch heel. It prompts viewers to wonder: Where did she think she was going?
Perhaps she did not have time to think when she was swept into the vortex of one of Europe's innumerable roundups. She was destined for the unimaginable, where she probably vanished quickly: 900,000 of the 1.3 million people sent there were murdered shortly after their arrival.
The New York Times of January 28, 1945, reported on its front page the Red Army's arrival the day before at Auschwitz, which the story described, in its 16th paragraph, as a place where more than a million "persons" were murdered. Persons. Of them, 1 million were Jews.
A yellowed Times edition from that date is displayed today in the museum, which is located on Manhattan's southern tip, near the spot where, in 1654, 23 Jews who had come from Spain and Portugal, via Brazil, became the first Jews in what was then New Amsterdam.
The museum's six-sided Core building evokes the six-pointed star of David, and the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, which is the subject of a shattering exhibit, "Auschwitz.
Not long ago. Not far away." The eloquence of the artifacts, which were first seen when the exhibit opened in Madrid and will be seen elsewhere in North America, is welcome testimony, in an age obsessed with new media, to the power of an old medium: the museum.
The exhibit includes Reinhard Heydrich's gift for Hermann Goering on his 47th birthday. Before Heydrich was assassinated by Czech partisans in 1942, he was the "architect of the Final Solution." His gift was a piece of parchment: the original 1551 proclamation, signed by the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, requiring Jews to attach to their garments a yellow circle.
The seeds of the Holocaust germinated for centuries in Europe's social soil. They did not, however, have to come to their cataclysmic fruition.
Other artifacts include Heinrich Himmler's handwriting in his annotated first edition of "Mein Kampf." And a photo of Anne Frank's parents' wedding. And a child's shoe with a sock carefully tucked into it, waiting for the child to put it back on after the "shower" to which he had been directed, from which he did not return.
Did you know that eight of the 15 participants in the Jan. 20, 1942, Wannsee Conference, which finalized plans for the industrialization of murder, had doctoral degrees? Education is not necessarily an inoculation against evil. Only two participants were older than 50: Genocide was a project for up-and-comers, idealists who acquired the ideals from socialization under totalitarianism.
The exhibit includes grainy, black-and-white film of a passing freight train shedding notes the way a tree shed leaves in autumn, notes tossed from between the freight cars' slats by the human cargo who were desperate to scatter random traces of themselves before the final darkness. One was tossed from a train leaving Holland by 17-year-old Hertha Aussen: "Most likely this will be the last card you will receive from me." Three days later she was murdered on arrival at Auschwitz.
What also died at Auschwitz is — was — what is known as the Whig theory of history, which holds, or held, that there is an inevitable unfolding of history in the direction of expanding liberty under law. Just as the Holocaust was not inevitable, neither is the triumph of enlightenment: History is not a ratchet that clicks only one way.
Today, in several parts of the world, including on the dark, churned and bloody ground of central Europe, there are various forms of political regression.
These are marked by a recrudescence of the blood-and-soil tribalism of degenerate nationalism, accompanied by thinly veiled, or not at all veiled, antisemitism.
Visitors entering "Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away" immediately walk past these words of Primo Levi, an Auschwitz survivor: "It happened, therefore it can happen again." Today in China's far west, concentration camps hold more than a million people who Beijing says show "symptoms" of being "infected" with the "virus" of "unhealthy thoughts." Similar medical terminology presented the Holocaust as social hygiene.
Polls indicate that a majority of millennials do not know what Auschwitz was. The future might teach them by analogies.

Texto completo: The Globe's reprint of The New York Times obituary of Jack O'Dell missed a priceless opportunity to inform readers about a lesser-known giant in the battle for racial justice (“Jack O'Dell, King aide fired over Communist past; 96," Nov. 22). He was a hugely effective activist and seminal strategic thinker who was the embodiment of generosity and solidarity.
Instead, the obituary dwells on old red-bating smears as if that constituted the most significant O'Dell story. O'Dell never concealed his Communist Party ties in the 1950s, nor that he severed those ties when he went to work for Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in the late 1950s in order to spare them of guilt by association. O'Dell, however, was not immunized from demands by President Kennedy and J. Edgar Hoover to fire him from his post, where he served effectively as an SCLC liaison with movements around the world.
There is a consensus among historians that Communists played a significant role in the fight for racial justice in the South and elsewhere. It is not surprising that O'Dell would have been drawn to the party. Nor is it inexplicable that he might have continued informal contact with an organization experienced in anti-racist battle. O'Dell's political legacy transcends old smears and lives on in the efforts of growing numbers in the fight for justice and equality.

Texto completo: Feral hogs are "exploding" throughout the United States. Could we be next?
Chew on this while you’re waiting for the turkey to come out of the oven: The feral hogs are coming!
Or not. It depends on how much you fret about foreign invasions.
Feral hogs — also known as wild boars, feral swine, razorbacks, Russian or Eurasian boars or, my favorite, piney woods rooters — wandered into the news this week when my hometown Buxton Police Department posted on its Facebook page an alert to be on the lookout for “Free-Ranging Feral Hogs (or) Escaped Domestic Pigs.”
The good news: They’re not here. Yet.
The not-so-good news: They number around 6 million across 38 states and cause an estimated $1.5 billion in property damage each year.
The truly horrific news: On Sunday a passel of feral hogs attacked and killed a 59-year-old Texas woman while she walked from her car to the front door of an older couple for whom she worked as a caretaker.
“We haven’t seen any,” Buxton Police Chief Troy Cline reassured me Wednesday. “I haven’t heard or had any reports of any.”
The Facebook warning was posted by Buxton’s animal control officer, who each year passes on a U.S. Department of Agriculture notice that the feral hog population continues to expand and that it’s up to each and every one of us to sound the alarm should one waddle into our neck of the woods.
A little history: Pigs in the New World go all the way back to the 16th century and Christopher Columbus, who introduced them on his second voyage to the West Indies to ensure a stable food supply for future expeditions.
They haven’t stopped multiplying since.
From domestic hogs that escape their farms and quickly revert to wild behavior, to hunting clubs that import boars from Europe and Asia, to hybrids of the two, the feral hog population in the United States has tripled over the last 20 years. As one expert noted to the New York Times back in 2013, it’s nothing short of a “national explosion of pigs.”
The USDA posts annual distribution maps showing the hogs’ mostly northward migration. And that’s where things get interesting: Since 2004, the maps have shown feral hogs in a small cluster of counties straddling the New Hampshire-Vermont border. More on that in a minute.
Here in Maine, both the USDA and the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife stand guard against feral hogs in search of the way life should be.
Kendall Marden, a regional wildlife biologist with IF&W, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that no feral hogs have yet come to his attention. Still, he said, they are “certainly a concern in portions of the country and we want to be prepared for things, given the impact they can have.”
To that end, Maine has a “memorandum of agreement” with federal agencies and others that spells out the appropriate actions should feral hogs decide to invade. Which, with climate change and all, they might do were Maine to have a winter with little or no snow. (I know, it’s almost December and the ground is still bare. See where I’m going here?)
As for the marauders already at our doorstep, Marden referred me to Corbin Park, a little-known, secretive hunting preserve that covers 25,000 acres in central New Hampshire.
Also known as the Blue Mountain Forest Association, the 40-square-mile hunter’s paradise was founded in the late 19th century by Austin Corbin, a railroad and banking baron. Yearning for a place to hunt exotic species near his boyhood home of Newport, New Hampshire, he bought up some 60 local farms and erected a fence around the entire parcel.
Next, Corbin paid a small fortune to populate his new playground with elk, moose, buffalo, antelope, caribou, reindeer, bighorn sheep, pheasants, Himalayan mountain goats and, last but not least, wild boar.
The uber-exclusive hunting club — scant media coverage it’s attracted over the years puts the membership at just 30 — remains to this day. And while the animals are penned in, the USDA notes on its National Feral Swine Damage Management Program website that “feral swine are strong, clever, and if motivated or agitated can destroy most fences.”
Meaning Maine is cheek-to-jowl with a biological time bomb?
Not quite.
“Pigs don’t naturally disperse a lot,” Marden said. “They tend to stay in their native home ranges.”
Still, assuming they can conquer the White Mountains, those Corbin Park hogs — or any others already out there in the wild — could wreak havoc on Maine if they ever get the urge to go east.
According to the USDA, feral swine carry all sorts of harmful organisms and pathogens that are easily passed on to humans and can cause “leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, brucellosis, tularemia, trichinellosis, swine influenza, salmonella, hepatitis and pathogenic E. coli.”
And while last weekend’s fatal attack was, according to The New York Times, only the fifth in the United States over almost two centuries, the USDA nevertheless warns, “Feral swine have been aggressive towards and even attacked farmers, golfers, hikers, and picnickers. Aggression can be increased when they associate people with food because of handouts and improper waste disposal.”
They can also cause untold damage rooting through crops and gardens and rubbing against small trees — their way of shedding parasites as they pass through someone else’s private property.
Heck, they even “have the potential to destroy artifacts and history which can never be recovered or replaced,” the USDA says.
So, what to do?
In places where feral hogs already roam, the USDA has studied strategies ranging from “harassment” (which only sends them to your neighbors’ back yard) and “ground shooting” (you’ll never get them all) to “aerial gunning” (effective but expensive) and “contraception” (oral or single injection — either way, wear your running shoes).
Meaning, should they move to Maine, there’s a battle plan in place.
Here in Buxton, Chief Cline was at first a little confused as to why I and another reporter called this week to talk about feral hogs. An equally perplexed Animal Control Officer Adele Jones explained to him that it was the Facebook post, which she’s somehow managed to put out each year until now without media detection.
But now that he knows about those dirty, not-so-little pigs, Cline was pleased to hear that the state and federal governments are both on it. In fact, should feral hogs someday march to the sea, Maine even has an action plan.
“Maybe I need to put an action plan together,” the chief said with a chuckle. “Just to be on the safe side. Then Buxton will be all set.”
On to the turkeys.

Texto completo: Chew on this while you're waiting for the turkey to come out of the oven: The feral hogs are coming!
Or not. It depends on how much you fret about foreign invasions.
Feral hogs - also known as wild boars, feral swine, razorbacks, Russian or Eurasian boars or, my favorite, piney woods rooters - wandered into the news this week when my hometown Buxton Police Department posted on its Facebook page an alert to be on the lookout for "Free-Ranging Feral Hogs (or) Escaped Domestic Pigs."
The good news: They're not here. Yet.
The not-so-good news: They number around 6 million across 38 states and cause an estimated $1.5 billion in property damage each year.
The truly horrific news: On Sunday a passel of feral hogs attacked and killed a 59-year-old Texas woman while she walked from her car to the front door of an older couple for whom she worked as a caretaker.
"We haven't seen any," Buxton Police Chief Troy Cline reassured me Wednesday. "I haven't heard or had any reports of any."
The Facebook warning was posted by Buxton's animal control officer, who each year passes on a U.S. Department of Agriculture notice that the feral hog population continues to expand and that it's up to each and every one of us to sound the alarm should one waddle into our neck of the woods.
A little history: Pigs in the New World go all the way back to the 16th century and Christopher Columbus, who introduced them on his second voyage to the West Indies to ensure a stable food supply for future expeditions.
They haven't stopped multiplying since.
From domestic hogs that escape their farms and quickly revert to wild behavior, to hunting clubs that import boars from Europe and Asia, to hybrids of the two, the feral hog population in the United States has tripled over the last 20 years. As one expert noted to the New York Times back in 2013, it's nothing short of a "national explosion of pigs."
The USDA posts annual distribution maps showing the hogs' mostly northward migration. And that's where things get interesting: Since 2004, the maps have shown feral hogs in a small cluster of counties straddling the New Hampshire-Vermont border. More on that in a minute.
Here in Maine, both the USDA and the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife stand guard against feral hogs in search of the way life should be.
Kendall Marden, a regional wildlife biologist with IF&W, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that no feral hogs have yet come to his attention. Still, he said, they are "certainly a concern in portions of the country and we want to be prepared for things, given the impact they can have."
To that end, Maine has a "memorandum of agreement" with federal agencies and others that spells out the appropriate actions should feral hogs decide to invade. Which, with climate change and all, they might do were Maine to have a winter with little or no snow. (I know, it's almost December and the ground is still bare. See where I'm going here?)
As for the marauders already at our doorstep, Marden referred me to Corbin Park, a little-known, secretive hunting preserve that covers 25,000 acres in central New Hampshire.
Also known as the Blue Mountain Forest Association, the 40-square-mile hunter's paradise was founded in the late 19th century by Austin Corbin, a railroad and banking baron. Yearning for a place to hunt exotic species near his boyhood home of Newport, New Hampshire, he bought up some 60 local farms and erected a fence around the entire parcel.
Next, Corbin paid a small fortune to populate his new playground with elk, moose, buffalo, antelope, caribou, reindeer, bighorn sheep, pheasants, Himalayan mountain goats and, last but not least, wild boar.
The uber-exclusive hunting club - scant media coverage it's attracted over the years puts the membership at just 30 - remains to this day. And while the animals are penned in, the USDA notes on its National Feral Swine Damage Management Program website that "feral swine are strong, clever, and if motivated or agitated can destroy most fences."
Meaning Maine is cheek-to-jowl with a biological time bomb?
Not quite.
"Pigs don't naturally disperse a lot," Marden said. "They tend to stay in their native home ranges."
Still, assuming they can conquer the White Mountains, those Corbin Park hogs - or any others already out there in the wild - could wreak havoc on Maine if they ever get the urge to go east.
According to the USDA, feral swine carry all sorts of harmful organisms and pathogens that are easily passed on to humans and can cause "leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, brucellosis, tularemia, trichinellosis, swine influenza, salmonella, hepatitis and pathogenic E. coli."
And while last weekend's fatal attack was, according to The New York Times, only the fifth in the United States over almost two centuries, the USDA nevertheless warns, "Feral swine have been aggressive towards and even attacked farmers, golfers, hikers, and picnickers. Aggression can be increased when they associate people with food because of handouts and improper waste disposal."
They can also cause untold damage rooting through crops and gardens and rubbing against small trees - their way of shedding parasites as they pass through someone else's private property.
Heck, they even "have the potential to destroy artifacts and history which can never be recovered or replaced," the USDA says.
So, what to do?
In places where feral hogs already roam, the USDA has studied strategies ranging from "harassment" (which only sends them to your neighbors' back yard) and "ground shooting" (you'll never get them all) to "aerial gunning" (effective but expensive) and "contraception" (oral or single injection - either way, wear your running shoes).
Meaning, should they move to Maine, there's a battle plan in place.
Here in Buxton, Chief Cline was at first a little confused as to why I and another reporter called this week to talk about feral hogs. An equally perplexed Animal Control Officer Adele Jones explained to him that it was the Facebook post, which she's somehow managed to put out each year until now without media detection.
But now that he knows about those dirty, not-so-little pigs, Cline was pleased to hear that the state and federal governments are both on it. In fact, should feral hogs someday march to the sea, Maine even has an action plan.
"Maybe I need to put an action plan together," the chief said with a chuckle. "Just to be on the safe side. Then Buxton will be all set."
On to the turkeys.

Texto completo: AT&T, Verizon and other wireless carriers agreed to let consumers use a technology that makes it easier to switch carriers, the Justice Department said.
WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said Wednesday that it had ended an investigation into possible coordination among AT&T, Verizon and a standards-setting organization to make it more difficult for people to switch wireless carriers. The agency said the groups had agreed to change their practices, reducing competition concerns.
In its investigation, which began two years ago, the Justice Department looked into whether the two companies and a trade association, known as G.S.M.A., that sets mobile technical standards had worked together to hinder a technology called eSIM. The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device.
The Justice Department dropped its investigation after the parties agreed to change how they determine standards for eSIM, the agency's head of antitrust, Makan Delrahim, said in a letter to the trade group. The change will allow consumers to use the technology to switch carriers, the agency said.
"We applaud G.S.M.A.'s efforts to ensure that its new process provides for an adequate balance of interests," Mr. Delrahim wrote.
The standards group said the investigation had turned up no wrongdoing. The group said it remained "committed to a consensus-driven approach that protects all groups involved in the development of industry specifications."
AT&T referred to the statement from the standards group. Verizon declined to comment.
The decision is an anticlimactic end to an investigation that included demands for millions of pages of internal documents from the companies. The investigation came to light during the Justice Department's lawsuit to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner, a case Mr. Delrahim's antitrust division lost.
At the heart of the investigation was whether the nation's biggest wireless carriers, working with the standards body, used the eSIM technology to unfairly maintain their dominance. A device maker and one rival wireless carrier filed formal complaints to the Justice Department that the organizations had hurt competition and consumers and hindered innovation in the mobile industry.
AT&T and Verizon together control about 70 percent of all wireless subscriptions in the United States. A technology that made it easy to switch carriers could lead to more turnover and fewer subscribers for them.
The eSIM technology has become more common in mobile devices, replacing the fingernail-size SIM cards, which freed up space in the phone for other features.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
"Venezuelan Kids Are Dying. Are We to Blame?," by Nicholas Kristof (column, Nov. 24), describes my country's very sad reality.
Sanctions have not worked (and will not). But they give the government an excuse to blame someone other than itself.
If sanctions are here to stay, they need to be restructured in a way that will not cause suffering among ordinary citizens, like malnutrition and other medical conditions.
As Mr. Kristof reports, "the suffering is incalculable." The humanitarian catastrophe that started in Venezuela many years ago may well spread to the rest of our continent if the proper measures are not taken.

Texto completo: Southern California has always had a special place in the heart of Trevor Noah. The 35-year-old South African writer, producer, comedian, political commentator, actor and current host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” first cut his teeth in some of the area’s smaller comedy clubs and theaters.
After starting out in 100 to 300-capacity rooms, Noah graduated to 1,000 to 3,000-capacity theaters and eventually worked his way up to selling out the 8,000-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa in 2018. His latest stand-up outing, dubbed The Loud & Clear Tour, is now playing out in arenas across the country and Noah will return to Southern California to headline Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles Friday, Dec. 6.
“I’ve been lucky that California has been one of the places where I’ve had a lot of support from the days of having like a really tiny following,” Noah said during a recent interview as he was also in the midst of taping “The Daily Show” back in New York. “It has been a really wonderful, sort of gradual celebration that just keeps growing. That’s the only way I can look at this show (at Staples Center) because otherwise it becomes overwhelming and you start worrying too much about the size of the show as opposed to the quality of the show.”
Despite hosting a television show where the primary topic is to analyze and report on politics, Noah said that’s not what his comedy show is. He’s said in previous interviews that he doesn’t talk about those things, including the President of the United States, so specifically but speaks rather generally when it comes to getting political.
“The live comedy audience has always been more diverse and also more broad in their taste,” he said. “‘The Daily Show’ is obviously a show based around politics and news and not everybody wants to live in that world, which I completely understand. But when it comes to stand-up, I’ve been really lucky. I have Republicans come to my shows and they’ll say ‘Hey, I love your stand-up … I don’t like your political views, but I love coming to your stand-up shows.’ That’s fine with me. I don’t think we have to agree with each other on everything, but I like that we can still all laugh together as people. I’ve always enjoyed that people of all ages, all religions, ethnicities and politics affiliations come to the shows. I want you to have fun whether you come with your mom and dad, boyfriend or girlfriend, your siblings, your friends … I just want you to have a good time. It’s not a show designed for one specific person, it’s designed for everybody.”
Doing the stand-up tour gives Noah a break from the 24/7 news cycle and all the commotion and breaking news that comes with ongoing impeachment hearings and the ramping up of yet another election year.
“It is a nice break and I think people should take that break in life, too,” he said. “People always ask me, ‘How do you cope with Trump all the time?’ It’s not healthy and I only deal with it during the day while making a show that’s 30 minutes long. If you engage in politics for 30 minutes a day, that’s more than enough to get all of the information you need since most of it is repetitive anyway. You don’t have to live in it and I try not to. I understand how important it is to our world and I give it the attention it deserves, but I also make sure to go live my life as a human being, too.”
On top of working on his stand-up material, Noah said he also listens to a lot of music. Nothing specific at the moment, but he said he’s a sucker for a good playlist on Spotify or Tidal. He picked up and is currently reading the new Prince biography, “The Beautiful Ones,” which was released in late October. He also said that if he had to choose between either being on “The Masked Singer” or “Dancing With the Stars,” he’d pick “The Masked Singer.”
“Because I’d be covered the entire time and my embarrassment is limited to when I have to take my mask off,” he said with a laugh. “I don’t think people would know it was me based on how badly or how well I could sing, which is nice.”
Noah has already accomplished a lot in his lifetime. He’s obviously got a successful stand-up career and daily TV show, but his book “Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood,” became a New York Times Bestseller and his “Son of Patricia” special and album is nominated in the best comedy category at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Jan. 26 at Staples Center.
“I live a very strange life in that I’ve never been too worried about the distant future,” Noah said. “I just try to focus on what I’m doing now and try to do it to the best of my ability and I found that serves me well. Right now, all I’m focused on is the Loud & Clear Tour and ‘The Daily Show,’ just making sure I put together a great show on TV every night and making sure that the stand-up is a world-class comedy experience. Once that’s all done, I’ll focus on the next thing. The last thing I want to do is start focusing too far into the future and tripping on the thing that’s right in front of me.”

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." Pete Buttigieg chimed in to explain that "systemic racism" will "be with us" no matter who is in the White House. Sen. Cory Booker called for "attacking systemic racism" in the "racially biased" criminal justice system.
Let’s follow up by examining Booker’s concern about a "racially biased" criminal justice system. To do that, we can turn to a recent article by Heather Mac Donald, who is a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute. She is a contributing editor of City Journal, and a New York Times bestselling author. Her most recent article, "A Platform of Urban Decline," which appeared in Manhattan Institute’s publication Eye On The News, addresses race and crime. She reveals government statistics you’ve never read before.
According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. Mac Donald says that may have once been true, but it is no longer so today. To make her case, she uses the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 survey of criminal victimization. Mac Donald writes: "According to the study, there were 593,598 interracial violent victimizations (excluding homicide) between blacks and whites last year, including white-on-black and black-on-white attacks. Blacks committed 537,204 of those interracial felonies, or 90 percent, and whites committed 56,394 of them, or less than 10 percent. That ratio is becoming more skewed, despite the Democratic claim of Trump-inspired white violence. In 2012-13, blacks committed 85 percent of all interracial victimizations between blacks and whites; whites committed 15 percent. From 2015 to 2018, the total number of white victims and the incidence of white victimization have grown as well."
There are other stark figures not talked about often. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races. In cases where the race of the offender was known, 54.9% were black, 42.4% were white, and 2.7% were of other races.
White and black liberals, who claim that blacks face a "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House" are perpetuating a cruel hoax. The primary victims of that hoax are black people. We face the difficult, and sometimes embarrassing, task of confronting reality.
Mac Donald says that Barack Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech in Chicago would be seen today as an "unforgivable outburst of white supremacy." Here’s what Obama told his predominantly black audience in a South Side church: "If we are honest with ourselves," too many fathers are "missing — missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men." Then-Sen. Obama went on to say, "Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."
White liberals deem that any speaker’s references to personal responsibility brands the speaker as bigoted. Black people cannot afford to buy into the white liberal agenda. White liberals don’t pay the same price. They don’t live in neighborhoods where their children can get shot simply sitting on their porches. White liberals don’t go to bed with the sounds of gunshots. White liberals don’t live in neighborhoods that have become economic wastelands. Their children don’t attend violent schools where they have to enter through metal detectors. White liberals help the Democratic Party maintain political control over cities, where many black residents live in despair, such as Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago.
Black people cannot afford to remain fodder for the liberal agenda. With that in mind, we should not be a one-party people in a two-party system.

Texto completo: Like many wayward millennials, I have spent the lion's share of my early 20s living in apartments without a dishwasher. Dishwashers may be more energy-, water- and soap-efficient than hand washing dishes, but in big cities, they're as much of a luxury as walk-in closets or rooftop patios. When I lived in the Bay Area, I could go through a bottle or two of dish soap a week -- and nearly as much lotion to ease my dry, cracked fingers. With homemade dish soap, I could have spared myself the cost and agony.
Many commercial dish soaps contain substances that can not only irritate your skin, but agitate respiratory health, exhibit developmental and reproductive toxicity and harm water sources and aquatic life as they make their way down the drain.
The Environmental Working Group, an activist group that grades products based on the ingredients' impact on factors like environmental health, asthma and respiratory health and skin irritation, gave 51 of the 297 "hand washing detergents" listed the lowest possible grade of F. A whopping 134 fared little better, scoring a D.
Some of the ingredients of highest concern include formaldehyde, sodium borate, sulfuric acid and triclosan, which have been linked to vision damage, cancer and "acute aquatic toxicity."
For those of you running to check the ingredients on your household dish soap, know that there is no requirement for companies to list the ingredients in household cleaning products. In fact, companies can choose to use vague catchall terms for highly toxic chemicals, such as "surfactant," "colorant," "cleaning agent," "fragrance" or "preservative" (the environmental group automatically gives these ingredients an F rating).
Here's a personal example: the commercial dish soap I have been using up until now, which I purchased haphazardly at the grocery store because it was advertised as "pure" and "clear" (for a premium, I might add) was one such product that didn't list any of its ingredients. I checked the group's website: F. Watch out for greenwashing, folks. Even your friendly neighborhood homesteading and sustainability columnist is susceptible.
When commercial dish soap formulas are adjusted, though, there are some concerns about compromising effectiveness. The New York Times reported a public outcry in 2010 when popular commercial dish soaps and detergents reduced the amount of algal bloom-causing phosphates in their products. Customers complained about unclean dishes and dusty white residue left behind on glasses.
Though my current apartment is (thankfully) dishwasher-equipped, Thanksgiving is right around the corner, and despite my best efforts to Tetris dishes, I am sure I will have plenty to hand wash. I figured there must be a happy medium: a homemade dish soap that will cut through grease and leave my glasses shiny and fresh without doing undue damage to me or the environment.
Learning to try
I found a set of instructions from Kitchn that combined the instructions from two other DIY bloggers: Kristin at Live Simply and Christine at The Hippy Homemaker. The recipe was tested and comprehensive, so I figured it was my best bet to find a homemade dish soap that worked.
[image id="2902133" size="full" pos="center" /]
Most recipes have something in common: Sal Suds from Dr. Bronners, an all-purpose cleaner (not a soap, the website insists -- that is the purview of their castile soap) made with plant-based detergents and pine-scented essential oils without synthetic dyes, fragrances or preservatives. Apparently, Sal Suds Liquid Cleaner is equally effective in hard or soft water, cruelty-free and biodegradable. The working group awarded Sal Suds an A rating, one of only 49 hand washing detergents on the listing to do so.
I couldn't find Sal Suds in the aisles of any of my area big box stores (though it is carried online), but it was stocked in the cleaning aisle of the local health food store, the Natural Living Center in Bangor. Per usual, I should have checked there first.
I already had the other materials required, except for a dispenser for my dish soap. Lacking any empty decanters, I took a used (cleaned) spaghetti jar and a reusable, screw-on top that turns mason jars into drinking cups. Eat your heart out, MacGyver.
The final step -- compiling dirty dishes to test my homemade dish soap's efficacy -- was perhaps the easiest part of prep. Between the mess I always make when I cook and the Friendsgiving festivities I just attended, my sink was filled to the brim with greasy, crusty cookware, ready to be cleaned.
A trying experience
Preparing homemade dish soap is easy: just mix equal parts warm water, white distilled vinegar and Sal Suds with a dollop of essential oil and some salt for thickening. Between the scent of the Sal Suds and the generous helping of lavender essential oil (the instructions called for a tablespoon, which is more than I have used in any other DIY), the mixture smelled stronger than I expected.
I transferred the solution to my creative decanter and poured some onto the sponge (not, I admit, an especially eco-friendly or biodegradable sponge -- sorry, folks, I will be better). The homemade dish soap is considerable more liquidy and less viscous than commercial products, and it poured out of my thrifty "nozzle" much faster than I expected, but I figured a few extra suds wouldn't hurt.
[image id="2902132" size="full" pos="center" /]
My homemade dish soap worked remarkably well. The grease on my crockpot didn't stand a chance. My glasses emerged sparkling from the soapy morass. Even my sink, which does not have a garbage disposal and usually suffers from a chronic, lingering stinkiness, looked and smelled fresher.
My homemade dish soap was not able to remove the cranberry sauce stain from my wooden cutting board, but I do not think a commercial dish soap would have fared any better. My old cutting board is irreparably scratched and stained, and I honestly need a new one (and find a different use for my old cutting board). Plus, cranberries can create a potent dye that can even be used to color clothes (perhaps that will be my next column).
Satisfied with my handwashing experience, I left my squeaky clean dishes in the sink-side rack to dry. My even hands felt soft afterward: no pruning, and no lotion necessary. Plus, I felt much better watching my environmentally-friendly suds go down the drain.

My tried-and-true takeaways
Not only is homemade dish soap inexpensive, easy to make and good for the environment, but between my soft hands and sweet-smelling sink, I actually found it to be a superior cleaner to my store-bought soap. I highly recommend preparing some for yourself, even if it means you don't have an excuse to get out of Thanksgiving dish duty this year.

Texto completo: To wash or not to wash the bird? That's a question home cooks ask experts at the USDA Meat and Poultry hotline a lot around the holidays.
Or they don't ask — and end up dispersing food pathogens all over their kitchens, increasing the very risk of foodborne illness they are trying to avoid.
Consumers should rinse their fresh fruits and vegetables with cold water, but not raw poultry, meat or eggs, according to the experts.
Rinsing chicken or turkey before cooking it is an ingrained step for many home cooks — passed down through generations and reinforced by cookbooks. Recipes like the "Perfect Roast Chicken" in 1999's "The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook" advise cooks to "Rinse the chicken inside and out." But that doesn't reflect the science.
For decades, the Department of Agriculture has been advising against washing raw poultry and meat.
"People are still shocked when we tell them" not to wash poultry, said Marianne Gravely, one of USDA's food safety educators. "Back in the early '90s we were saying that."
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, foodborne pathogens sicken an estimated 48 million Americans every year, putting 128,000 in the hospital and killing 3,000.
Washing chicken won't remove many bacteria, said Benjamin Chapman, an associate professor in North Carolina State University's agricultural and human sciences department. But it can spread germs to hands, work surfaces, clothing and nearby utensils or food — a process called cross-contamination.
"That washing process can really only increase risk," he said. "All I really can do is control it through cooking."
Cooking is the only way to kill pathogens like salmonella and campylobacter. Consumers should use a food thermometer to ensure meat and poultry reach a safe minimal temperature: 165 degrees for poultry; 160 degrees for ground meats; 145 degrees for steaks, chops, roasts, fresh or smoked ham, fish and shellfish.
Don't rely on your cookbook for temperature settings. A 2017 study co-authored by Chapman found that of nearly 1,500 recipes in New York Times Bestseller cookbooks, only 8 percent included an endpoint temperature and a third of those gave an incorrect one based on USDA guidelines.
Two other steps in safe food handling — separation and cleaning — help prevent cross-contamination.
Keeping raw meat and poultry separate from fresh produce in your grocery bag, in your refrigerator and during food preparation also minimizes cross-contamination.
Food safety experts recommend washing anything used in food preparation, including counters, cutting boards and utensils in hot, soapy water. And washing your hands properly — with soap for 20 seconds — before and after preparing food "can really prevent the contamination of other things," Gravely said.
Chapman and his colleagues at NC State are collaborating with the USDA and RTI International, a nonprofit research institute, to investigate how pathogens are transferred around kitchens. Preliminary results from the first of a multiyear study showed that participants spread bacteria from raw meat to spice containers, refrigerator handles and even salads.
Shelley Feist, executive director of the Partnership for Food Safety Education, said her organization plans to work with cookbook writers and editors to incorporate more guidance for safe food handling.
The Food and Drug Administration recommends rinsing fresh fruits and vegetables with cold running water. Washing can remove more bacteria from fruits and vegetables than from meat, but there's still a limit to how much.
"Pathogens are just so small and the surface of produce is so creviced," Chapman said, "that the pathogens do a really good job attaching and hiding where water can't even get to."
Some produce, such as bagged lettuce and spinach, is clearly labeled as already washed and does not need to be washed again, the FDA says. Washing those vegetables or fruits again won't reduce the number of pathogens any further and could spread bacteria around the kitchen.
The FDA advises consumers to avoid detergents or soaps when washing food because they can leave behind a residue and can affect taste. There are no FDA-approved food cleaners on the market, and the agency hasn't found anything to be more effective at removing bacteria than cold running water.
"There are a lot of myths out there that if I wash, I can wash the pathogens off," Chapman said. "You can wash a little bit off, but not enough to significantly reduce your risk."
Because consumers eat a lot of fruits and vegetables raw, the risk of contracting a foodborne illness from contaminated lettuce or cantaloupe is greater than from properly cooked chicken.

Texto completo: She accomplished both feats in her 70s, after deciding as a retired nurse that she wanted a little adventure in her life.
Barbara Hillary, the first black woman on record to reach the North Pole, which she did at the age of 75, and the first to reach the South Pole, at the age of 79, died on Saturday in a hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens. She was 88.
Her death was announced on her website. A post on her Twitter account said her health had been declining in recent months. She had breast cancer in her 20s and lung cancer in her 60s.
It was not until 1986 that any woman had reached the top of the world, with Ann Bancroft, a physical education teacher and explorer from Minnesota, becoming the first. The first black man there was Matthew Henson, who, along with Robert E. Peary, set foot on the North Pole in 1909.
Ms. Hillary had retired from a 55-year career as a nurse when, seeking adventure, she went dog-sledding in Quebec and photographed polar bears in Manitoba. She then learned that no African-American woman had ever made it to the North Pole and challenged herself to become the first, though she had no funding and no organization behind her and had lost 25 percent of her breathing capacity from surgery for her lung cancer.
The expedition would require her to ski, which she had also never done before. "It wasn't a popular sport in Harlem," where she had grown up, she told The Seattle Times in 2007.
In preparation for the trek, she took cross-country skiing lessons and hired a personal trainer. She started eating more vegetables, increased her vitamin intake and worked out with weights. And she raised the necessary $ 25,000, mostly through donations, for equipment and transportation.
There are a limited number of ways to reach the North Pole, which is in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, where the waters are almost permanently covered with shifting sea ice. Ms. Hillary signed on for an expedition with Eagles Cry Adventures, an outfitter, and was deposited by helicopter at a Norwegian base camp about 30 miles from the North Pole.
On April 23, 2007, another helicopter took her to a point on the ice that was "within skiing distance of the North Pole," Ms. Hillary told The New Yorker magazine later that year, and she set off with a guide.
The Seattle Times reported: "As the sunlight glinted off the ice, distorting her vision, Hillary struggled beneath a load of gear and pressed on. In her euphoria at reaching the Pole, she forgot the cold and removed her gloves, causing her fingers to become frostbitten."
Ms. Hillary told The New Yorker: "I have never experienced such sheer joy and excitement. I was screaming, jumping up and down, for the first few minutes."
The expedition only whetted her appetite for more. Four years later, on Jan. 6, 2011, she stood at the South Pole.
Ms. Hillary initially took these treks for the thrill of it, and to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, but she came to understand that climate change was wreaking havoc on the planet, not least its polar extremities, and began lecturing on the topic. She also became a motivational speaker.
This year, at 87, she ventured to Outer Mongolia, where she visited a nomadic tribe whose rural way of life was disappearing because of climate change and the desertification of the steppes.
These expeditions were not without their creature comforts. At the South Pole, for example, she indulged -- perhaps overindulged -- her love of milk chocolate. As she told The New York Times in 2011, "If I had frozen to death down there, wouldn't it be sad if I'd gone to hell without getting what I want?"
Barbara Hillary was born on June 12, 1931, in Manhattan. Her father died when she was 2. Her mother, Viola Jones Hillary, had migrated to New York in the 1930s from South Carolina to give Barbara and her sister, Dorothy, the chance for a good education. Earning her living by cleaning houses, she raised her daughters by herself in Harlem.
Barbara loved to read and was drawn to books about surviving in extreme circumstances. "Robinson Crusoe" was one of her favorites.
"We were poor," Ms. Hillary said in 2017, when she gave the commencement address at the New School (formerly the New School for Social Research), her alma mater. "We were Depression-poor, but there was no such thing as mental poverty in our home."
As a New School student Ms. Hillary majored in gerontology and earned both her bachelor's and master's degrees in the subject before becoming a nurse.
In Far Rockaway she founded the Arverne Action Association, which sought to improve life in that neighborhood. She also founded The Peninsula Magazine, which covered the Rockaways, and was its editor in chief.
In addition to working as a nurse, Ms. Hillary sometimes drove a taxi, Deborah Bogosian, a friend, told 1010 WINS radio in New York. She also had an appreciation for "archery, guns and knives, big trucks and big dogs," Ms. Bogosian said, and grew roses and tomatoes.
In 2007 Ms. Hillary shared with The New Yorker some of her tips for living a good life: "One, mind your own business; two, maintain a sense of humor; and three, tell an individual to go to hell when it's needed."
And she had this bit of advice for New School graduates when she spoke at their commencement: "At every phase in your life, look at your options. Please, do not select boring ones."

Texto completo: Ambassador John R. Bass says the Afghan spy agency used "Soviet-style tactics."
KABUL, Afghanistan -- In what the American ambassador to Afghanistan called "Soviet-style tactics," the country's intelligence agency released a video Tuesday in which a detained human rights activist retracted allegations that 165 boys had been raped by educators at three rural schools.
The activist, Mohammad Musa, was quoted in a New York Times article on Monday that also quoted four boys and local school officials who said schoolboys had been raped by educators in Logar Province in central Afghanistan.
The video showed Mr. Musa appearing to be speaking under duress during his fifth day in the custody of the National Directorate of Security, an agency with a reputation for treating detainees harshly.
"It's appalling to coerce confessions from civil society activists whose goal is to protect Afghan children," John R. Bass, the American ambassador, said in a Twitter post. He said he was "deeply disturbed" by the government's actions.
President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, saying "I disagree with the approach" of the intelligence agency, ordered it to deliver Mr. Musa and a fellow detained activist to the Ministry of Interior for what he said was their own protection.
In a Twitter posting, Mr. Ghani also ordered the Ministry of Education, which had said it was investigating the allegations, to promptly send him a "thorough report."
The video, and the forceful response from the country's top Afghan and American officials, capped a remarkable day for a country already shaken by allegations that scores of schoolboys had been sexually assaulted by their own teachers. The public rebuke of the government by Mr. Bass was a jarring break from diplomatic norms, and the upbraiding by Mr. Ghani of his own intelligence agency was equally noteworthy.
Mr. Ghani was faced with the spectacle of shadowy government operatives rounding up two human rights activists without charge in a nominally democratic country supported by billions of dollars in American and Western aid and military assistance.
In the Twitter posting, Mr. Ghani said he was "deeply disturbed" by the rape allegations.
In photos and videos briefly posted anonymously to a Facebook page in May, some of the boys had been shown in sexual positions with men. Several boys were sexually assaulted by the police after having given statements about the school rapes, Mr. Musa told The Times. He said several others had been killed, in some cases by family members shamed by the Facebook posts or the boys' reporting of rapes.
Mr. Musa told The Times that he had taken statements from 165 boys who described being sexually assaulted by educators.
In a Twitter post of support for Mr. Bass's position, Germany's ambassador to Afghanistan, Peter Prügel, called the actions by the intelligence agency "just shameful and embarrassing."
On Tuesday, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan called for Afghanistan's attorney general's office to investigate the rape allegations. In a Twitter posting, the United Nations mission also urged the release of the two activists, who represent the Logar Youth, Social and Civil Institution.
The rape accusations brought out in the open a deeply embedded practice by powerful male figures who keep boys as sexual slaves. The Afghan authorities are reluctant to acknowledge or discuss the rampant sexual abuse of boys, which is a crime in Afghanistan as it is around the world. But it also is a practice that dates back centuries in the country.
On the video, the National Directorate of Security said Mr. Musa's allegations were "baseless, without proof and without evidence." The agency said the accusations had caused "public unrest" and "could even deprive our children of their education."
Looking drawn and anxious, Mr. Musa said on the video that his allegations were untrue and his investigation "incomplete."
"It was a mistake," he said, speaking with his head down. "I apologize to the people and the government."
The other detained Logar activist, Ehsanullah Hamidi, also spoke briefly on the video. The two men were detained one week after Mr. Musa was interviewed by the Tolo news channel in Afghanistan on Nov. 14. Besides The Times, the Guardian newspaper of Britain also has reported on Mr. Musa's allegations.
A friend and a relative of Mr. Musa's who said they had spoken with him shortly before he was detained last Thursday said he had gone to speak to officials at the American Embassy in Kabul. They said he was detained shortly after leaving the embassy, while en route to meet with the European Union's ambassador in the capital.
Amnesty International warned Monday that the two detained activists were at risk of torture "and other ill-treatment" as long as they remained in custody.
On Tuesday, Amnesty released what the organization said was the final text message sent by Mr. Musa before he was detained.
"ANDS is now trying to arrest me," Mr. Musa's message read, according to an Amnesty Twitter posting. "And accuse me for everything . . . blame me for everything."
Shaharzad Akbar, chairwoman of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, said Tuesday she was concerned that Mr. Musa had been required to issue "a confession" and that he had not been allowed to see a lawyer.
Mr. Ghani, who is from Logar Province, said the allegations of sexual assault should have been investigated by the human rights commission and the attorney general's office. He said protecting the rights of human rights activists was the responsibility of the Interior Ministry, not the intelligence agency.
The harsh treatment of the activists, whom the Interior Ministry said had not been charged with a crime, contrasted sharply with the leniency shown by Mr. Ghani's government toward the former head of Afghanistan's soccer federation, Karamuddin Keram. Afghan authorities issued an arrest warrant in June for Mr. Keram on criminal charges of sexually assaulting female players, but he has not been arrested.
The government, and the United States military, has grappled for years with the practice of bacha bazi, or "boy play," in which powerful militia or military commanders keep boys as sex slaves. The boys are typically forced to dress as girls and dance for men before being raped.
An investigation by The New York Times in 2015 found widespread sexual assault of boys by Afghan security forces and others in power, and determined that the American military was reluctant to intervene. The article led to a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction on the American military's reluctance to confront the abuse.

Texto completo: There’s a local angle to everything, even the impeachment hearings. David Holmes, a U.S. Embassy diplomat in Ukraine who testified Nov. 21, went to college in the Inland Valley, as reader Ray Escoto alerted me.
“I’m a graduate of Pomona College in Claremont, California,” Holmes told the House Intelligence Committee in his opening statement. No one interrupted to ask why Pomona College isn’t in Pomona.
Holmes is the witness who said he was eating lunch at a restaurant in Ukraine with Gordon Sondland, the ambassador, when Sondland placed a call to President Donald Trump on an unsecured line. Trump spoke so loudly, Holmes said, that Sondland pulled the phone away from his ear and both sides of the conversation were audible.
(We’ve all taken calls like that. Perhaps I’ll get one after this item runs.)
According to Holmes, when Trump asked if the Ukrainian president was on board with investigating the Bidens, Sondland assured the president, “He loves your ass.”
“There’s just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly,” Holmes testified.
In response, Trump tweeted that his hearing is “great” and that he’s never been able to overhear the other side of a phone conversation, statements that may cancel each other out.
“Who is David Holmes?,” the New York Times asked in a headline the next day. Answering its own question, the paper said Holmes joined the State Department under President George W. Bush and has been stationed in Russia, Afghanistan and India.
He won a State Department award in 2014 for “constructive dissent” for expressing concerns about President Barack Obama’s policy toward Afghanistan. The Washington Post described him as “a rising star in the Foreign Service.”
Closer to home, the 1997 alumnus won Pomona College’s Inspirational Young Alumni Award in 2004. Still, be careful what you say around him. He must have good ears.
Grandfatherly advice
A newspaper colleague in Upland told me last week: “My grandson had to attend a council meeting for his government class so I suggested he go to Ontario, rather than Upland meetings which go on forever. Great idea — tonight’s Ontario meeting lasted 12 minutes.”
I’ve rarely seen any high school students at Ontario meetings, but they’re worth the drive if you want to spare yourself a late night. And also if your grade isn’t dependent on excitement.
Stone wall (cont’d)
Remember the topic of the stone wall on Claremont’s Foothill Boulevard, newly revealed after vegetation was removed? Its origins are somewhat mysterious, although it’s believed to date to the 1920s or ’30s, when the land behind it was first subdivided for housing.
But now we know who built it: Clarence Stover.
Paula Pitzer, into whose family Stover married, told me: “His idea was he would make a form and drop in cement, rebar and these rocks. After he got in enough layers, he would shake the form. The idea is the rocks would slide over the surfaces and it would make it a good look.”
Stover’s company built houses, college buildings and commercial buildings in the Village. Stover “contributed to the look of Claremont more than any other builder,” John Neiuber wrote in the Courier in 2018.
Stover graduated from Pomona College in 1921, later served as a trustee and has the campus’ Stover Memorial Walk near Bridges Auditorium named for him. He died in 1955.
“He never did another wall,” Pitzer said. Apparently building it was more labor-intensive than he’d expected. But the one wall he did certainly contributed to the look of Claremont.
Thanksgiving!
Thanksgiving almost couldn’t fall any later, but here it comes Nov. 28 — not even a month shy of Christmas.
Whenever the date lands, it’s an opportunity to reflect on what we’re thankful for. Reasons I’m thankful include a stimulating job in an ever-changing valley, one that generates a steady flow of column ideas. Another reason is you attentive readers, who let me know you’re reading, correct me when I flub something and give me the occasional knock to keep me honest.
Thanks for reading, enjoy your holiday and I’ll see you here Friday — with a column I’ll be cobbling together on Wednesday, pre-turkey.
Valley Vignette
The TGI Friday’s restaurant in Ontario at 3351 N. Centre Lake Drive is closing Dec. 8. Reader Jeff Butler told me he and his wife have been regulars for 15 years and got the bad news from the manager recently. “There are a lot of memories from that place, as we had many birthday dinners and dinners with good friends there,” Butler said. The restaurant is planning a “Go out with a bang” farewell party Dec. 5 from 6 to 10 p.m. for regulars. “So come early,” an announcement board in the restaurant urges, “and let’s talk about how we all made this place like home.”

David Leonhardt: Turn off your phone for Thanksgiving

Texto completo: This week, Americans will endure flight delays, traffic jams and other logistical miseries to spend time with family and friends. And when the holiday weekend is ending, many will lament that they don’t get to spend enough time with those relatives and friends.
But during the weekend itself, these same lamenters will spend a lot of time ignoring the people around them and distractedly staring into their phones. They will get a notification and disappear down a digital rabbit hole of Facebook posts, text messages and fantasy-football updates. They will monitor the comments on the photos they just posted, instead of engaging with the human beings in those photos.
Many of us have a complicated relationship with our phones. We enjoy them in the moment. Yet when we reflect on all the time we spend looking at a tiny screen, we feel lousy about it. We pine for a less addictive relationship with the online world.
So let me make a suggestion for this Thanksgiving weekend: Turn off your phone, and keep it off for a full 24 hours. I predict you’ll be surprised by how much you’ll like it.
About a month ago, my wife and I decided that our family would spend a Saturday without the internet, a practice known as a Tech Shabbat (a reference to the Jewish day of rest). I wasn’t sure whether I’d like it, I’ll admit, and our kids were even less sure.
But it was wonderful. We hung out with friends, without distraction. We never had to ask, guiltily, “Sorry, what’d you say?” because we had been only semi-listening. In between scheduled activities, we took a walk and played a board game, Settlers of Catan. I spent time thinking about long-term projects instead of replying to unimportant emails. It felt productive, rejuvenating and, yes, fun.
Tiffany Shlain, a filmmaker who popularized the idea of a Tech Shabbat, says that on her day without screens, she laughs more, sleeps better and feels healthier. As she writes in her recent book, “24/6”: “Having one day off each week shocks you anew into the realization of how bizarre it is that everyone is head-down, looking at screens all the time. That should never feel normal.”
My family liked it so much that we did it again a week ago. This coming Saturday, we will put away the phones for a third time, while we are with my extended family.
You should try it, too. In between the material gluttony of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, enjoy a Phone-Free Saturday or Sunday (or, for that matter, Thanksgiving Day).
You’ll have company if you do. When I mentioned my first Tech Shabbat in the email newsletter that I write for The Times, I heard from dozens of readers who have done their own version. Some were Christians who put away phones on Sunday. Some were Jews who observe a full day of rest. Many were secular. Nearly all were trying to find a better balance in our digitally addled world.
“At first, it does feel awkward, not having screen time,” Barbara Mutezdi said. “But with time, it becomes a habit you crave.” Chantel Hanks said her three young boys make crepes with her husband or build Lego robot vehicles, rather than playing video games.
Arlaana Black, a high-school teacher, has assigned her students to put away their phones for an entire weekend and write a report about it. “Although it was difficult (like any addict weaning from addiction), most reported considerable less stress,” Black wrote to me, “and a few said that they actually sat down for dinner with their parent or parents and had meaningful dialogue for the first time in months.”
To have a successful Tech Shabbat, you should choose ground rules that work for you. We turn off our cellphones, tablets and laptops and stick them in a cabinet. We’re willing to watch sports on television, if more than one person is doing so. We rely on our landline to reach other people.
You may prefer stricter or looser rules. But I recommend against half measures, like keeping your cellphone in your pocket and claiming you’ll look at it only if it rings. Out of sight, out of mind.
There are certainly parts of Tech Shabbat that I find uncomfortable. Making a last-minute plan is tricky, and looking up the answer to an intriguing question is nearly impossible. That’s part of the point, though — to slow down and stop obsessing about the immediate. Many people come up with their freshest ideas when they’re not occupied.
You can also minimize the downsides with a little advance planning. Print out your family’s schedule, as well as anything you need for a looming work project. (I wrote part of this column with a pen.) Print out directions. If you’re smarter than I am, you’ll remember to print directions both to and from where you’re going. Following them in reverse doesn’t always work.
Part of an advance plan is telling friends and colleagues that you’re unplugging for 24 hours. They will probably respect you for it. Margaret Diddams, the provost of Wheaton College in Illinois, doesn’t check her email on Sundays. Her colleagues know to reach her on her phone if an urgent problem comes up. Most problems, of course, are not urgent.
I recognize this approach will be harder for teenagers, who have grown up with texting. But they may need a break more than anyone.
Perhaps most important, make sure that your Tech Shabbat includes a big dose of joy. Shlain’s family starts its 24 tech-free hours by eating a rollicking Friday dinner with friends. If you’re taking your first Tech Shabbat and need to win over a skeptic in the family, you could go out to a favorite restaurant for a meal.
The beauty of turning off your phone this holiday weekend is that there are so many joyful alternatives. Take a hike or play touch football with relatives or friends. Go with them to a museum or local bookstore. Cook an ambitious recipe.
And take a few minutes to give thanks, which is a whole lot easier when you aren’t staring into a screen.

Google fires 4 workers active in labor organizing

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO — Google on Monday fired four employees who had been active in labor organizing at the company, according to a memo that was seen by The New York Times.
The memo, sent by Google’s security and investigations team, told employees that the company had dismissed four employees “for clear and repeated violations of our data security policies.” Jenn Kaiser, a Google spokeswoman, confirmed the firings but declined to elaborate.
The dismissals are expected to exacerbate rocky relations between Google’s management and a vocal contingent of workers who have protested the company’s handling of sexual harassment, its treatment of contract employees, and its work with the Defense Department, federal border agencies and the Chinese government.
Tensions have increased as Google has cracked down on what had long been a freewheeling work culture that encouraged employees to speak out. Google recently canceled a regular series of companywide meetings that allowed workers to pose questions to senior executives and began working with a consulting firm that has helped companies quell unionization efforts.
The changes are a remarkable turn for a company that has been considered a standard for the modern workplace. Google introduced many of the office perks that are now common across Silicon Valley, and its embrace of transparent relations between workers and management has influenced a generation of startups.
This month, Google placed two employees, Laurence Berland and Rebecca Rivers, on administrative leave, saying they had gotten into confidential documents that were not relevant to their work. They were among the four workers who were fired, according to two people familiar with the dismissals.
Rivers confirmed her firing on Twitter on Monday. The identities of the other two employees were not clear Monday evening.
Berland and Rivers could not be reached for comment. The memo announcing the firings was first reported by Bloomberg News.
On Friday, Berland and Rivers spoke about their suspensions at a rally attended by more than 100 Google workers outside the company’s San Francisco offices. Both said that they had raised objections internally over Google’s work with Customs and Border Protection but that they had not gotten access to documents they were not authorized to view.
In the memo, Google said the fired employees had repeatedly searched for, looked through and distributed information “outside the scope of their jobs.” One of the workers set up notifications to receive emails detailing the work and whereabouts of other employees without their knowledge or consent, the memo said.
“This is not how Google’s open culture works or was ever intended to work,” the memo said.
When asked last week by The Times, Google could not point to a specific rule that forbade setting up these notifications but said it was investigating to determine if this and other behavior violated the company’s code of conduct.
The Tech Workers Coalition, an advocacy group, said on Twitter on Monday that the four employees had been fired for “organizing at work” and encouraged workers at Google to “speak out against this draconian act.”
“This is meant to scare workers, don’t let it,” the tweet said.
Veena Dubal, an associate professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, said, “It does seem like this termination was in direct response to their organizing.”
She added, “I am skeptical that this was about how safe other people felt, and more about how effective these people were in the workplace in terms of organizing their co-workers.”
In August, nearly 1,500 Google workers signed a petition asking the company not to pursue a contract with Customs and Border Protection, which they said was complicit in “human rights abuses.” In September, Google hired a former member of the Department of Homeland Security staff, Miles Taylor, a move that provoked a backlash from workers who objected to the Trump administration’s family separation policy. Google deleted questions about Taylor’s employment from internal systems, BuzzFeed News reported.
At the rally Friday, Rivers said Google security staff had interrogated her about her involvement in the petition. Berland said he had also worked on the petition and raised questions about the company’s decision to hire Taylor.
“If we can’t speak up about these issues that concern us about our work,” Berland said, “how can we ever hold ourselves and each other to the high standard that we need and the world deserves? Silence and secrecy are not the way for us to come together to solve problems.”
Google employees at the rally said they were protesting the suspensions of Berland and Rivers and demanded that they be returned to work.
“Google has suspended them from their jobs and interrogated them for speaking out,” said Stephanie Parker, a Google worker who spoke at the demonstration. “We are here today to show them our support and to demand that Google bring them back to work immediately.”

Texto completo: There is a scene in “Dark Waters,” an excellent thriller ( out of five; rated PG-13; in select theaters now, expanding nationwide Dec. 6) about industrial pollution and industrial-sized cover-up, in which Robert Bilott, an attorney played with grim determination by Mark Ruffalo, stands in a room surrounded by box after box of information related to his case.
Soon he’ll be on his hands and knees sorting it all out. If it seems like it will take years, it did: Todd Haynes’ film is based on a true story, in which Bilott chips away, year after year, at DuPont, the chemical giant Bilott is suing, at first for poisoning cattle with toxic runoff, then much more. (The film is based on a New York Times story by Nathaniel Rich. ) It’s a long and detailed movie, rich in information and damning accusations – a lot of things are going on here.
But it’s this scene, in which a somewhat plodding, methodical lawyer grinds away at a seemingly impossible task, that establishes Bilott as one of the most-effective kinds of characters in movies: the unsung hero.
Characters that simply wake up every day and push the rock a little farther up the hill are always worth rooting for. And Ruffalo is good at embodying one here.

Bilott begins the film as a new partner in a prestigious Cincinnati law firm that, among other things, defends corporations like DuPont (but not DuPont itself, which remains the one big client fish that so far the firm hasn’t been able to reel in, we learn at a corporate dinner).
One day a West Virginia farmer named Wilbur Tennant (the great Bill Camp) shows up in the law offices demanding to see Bilott. He knows Bilott’s grandmother, so he’s calling in a favor. Something is wrong with his herd of cattle; since DuPont began polluting the stream that runs through his farm his cows have gone wrong – really wrong, as Haynes shows in a graphic portrayal. Proud and ornery, Tennant wants answers.
Bilott isn’t thrilled about the prospect. He’s tried to get away from his West Virginia roots. At one point his boss, Tom Terp (Tim Robbins) tells him it’s OK to be from West Virginia, he won’t tell anyone. And going after a corporation like DuPont is basically the opposite of what their firm does.
But a visit with his grandmother and a visit to Tennant’s farm changes his mind. Thus begins a long, largely thankless (it involves four pay cuts) obsession with ferreting out the truth. What’s going on with Tennant’s farm is horrific. What’s going on in the bigger picture is worse. Ever used Teflon? You may want to rethink that.
It’s ultimately the story of a giant corporation behaving in the best interests only of its shareholders and executives, all of whom line their pockets while their customers get sick and die. And there is seemingly little Bilott, or anyone else, can do about it, thanks to a system rigged against anyone without billions at their disposal to skirt regulation, buy up scientists and pay off complainers.
But there Bilott is, literally on his hands and knees, piecing together a case. His wife, Sarah (Anne Hathaway), a former lawyer now raising their sons basically alone while Bilott works, stands by him, but not without cost. (Hathaway’s appearances are brief but occasionally crucial. )
The film isn’t as stylish as what we’re used to from Haynes (“Carol,” “Far from Heaven”), by design. Colors are dulled into blue and gray, like it’s always raining on Bilott’s parade. There’s nothing flashy about his work, something Haynes reminds us of in every aspect of the movie.
The acting is outstanding. Victor Garber is particularly good as an oily DuPont executive friendly with Bilott early on; that relationship will change. Camp brings a surly dignity to Tennant, beneath bug-like eyebrows and a growling West Virgina drawl. Bill Pullman is a much-welcome shot of fun as a folksy, sneaky smart lawyer who teams with Bilott.
Haynes plays up the melodrama, and the film moves along without a lot of surprises. But that gives it a certain momentum – a momentum personified by Bilott in the storage room, sorting through boxes. It’s not flashy, but it’s how you get the job done.

Texto completo: "Why didn't Mr. Epstein have a cellmate at the time that this happened?" a defense lawyer said.
Two jail guards who were on duty when Jeffrey Epstein killed himself browsed the internet and napped during the night before his body was found, instead of checking on him every half-hour as they were required to do, prosecutors have said. The guards then lied, prosecutors said, on official logs, indicating that they had made the rounds when they had not.
Attorney General William P. Barr said last week that Mr. Epstein's death resulted from "a perfect storm of screw-ups."
But lawyers for the guards, who have been criminally charged, suggested in court on Monday that their clients were being made into scapegoats for larger problems in the federal prison system that contributed to Mr. Epstein's death.
The Manhattan jail where Mr. Epstein hanged himself has long been plagued by staff shortages and the two guards, Michael Thomas and Tova Noel, had already done several tours of overtime that week.
In addition, Mr. Epstein was left alone without a cellmate that night and morning, even though he had tried to take his own life about three weeks earlier.
"Unfortunately, the decisions that led to the death of Mr. Epstein were not only because of what my client did or did not do," Montell Figgins, the lawyer for Mr. Thomas, said. "It was because of a system that failed completely."
"Where are the supervisors?" Mr. Figgins added. "Where are the people who make the policy decisions? Why didn't Mr. Epstein have a cellmate at the time that this happened?"
Mr. Figgins made his remarks outside Federal District Court in Manhattan after a hearing at which Judge Analisa Torres set a trial date of April 20 for Mr. Thomas and Ms. Noel, who face charges that include making false records and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Both have pleaded not guilty.
Ms. Noel's lawyer, Jason E. Foy, said that he had not seen the evidence against his client, but he vowed to investigate her case vigorously. He said he believed there were "outside circumstances that are driving this prosecution."
Mr. Foy, who also spoke after the hearing, said the charges did not "sound like your regular false-document case," an apparent reference to the unusual circumstances and high-profile nature of Mr. Epstein's death.
The United States attorney's office in Manhattan and the Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on the lawyers' assertions.
The indictment charging the two guards highlighted lapses in the operation of a high-security unit at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, where Mr. Epstein, a financier, was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges when he died.
The indictment also offered the first official narrative of the events preceding his death. It said that security cameras did not show anyone entering the cell block where Mr. Epstein was housed, suggesting that despite the conjecture and conspiracy theories swirling around Mr. Epstein and his connections to powerful people, his death was a suicide as New York City's chief medical examiner ruled.
At the hearing on Monday, a prosecutor, Rebekah A. Donaleski, told Judge Torres that the discovery materials the government would provide to defense lawyers included hundreds of hours of video recordings from inside the jail.
Although Ms. Donaleski did not elaborate on the recordings' contents, the indictment said that video obtained from the jail's internal video surveillance system confirmed that no one visited the tier where Mr. Epstein was being held after about 10:30 p.m. on August 9.
"This was the last time anyone, including any correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the only entrance to the tier in which Epstein was housed until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10," when his body was found, the indictment said.
The defense lawyers said in court that they wanted prosecutors to provide them with additional evidence that might be used at trial. Mr. Figgins cited an internal investigation by the Justice Department inspector general's office into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Epstein's death. The results of that inquiry will not be made public, officials have said.
Outside the courthouse, Mr. Figgins said that there had been an unfair "rush to judgment" in the case and that the two guards were being made to pay for the problems of an entire system.
"Does anyone think that throughout the United States that these are the only two guards that may have taken a nap overnight on their shift?" he said. "I highly doubt it."
The attention that Mr. Epstein's suicide has brought to prison conditions, inmate supervision and mental health issues around the country was reinforced on Sunday with a letter published by The New York Times by Richard M. Berman, the federal judge in Manhattan who presided in Mr. Epstein's criminal case before his suicide.
Judge Berman wrote that the indictment of the two guards was not the "full accounting" to which Mr. Epstein's alleged victims, the public and his family were entitled.
"We all agree that it is unthinkable that any detainee, let alone a high-profile detainee like Mr. Epstein, would die unnoticed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center," the judge wrote.
He said it would be "a tragic and costly missed opportunity" for the Bureau of Prisons and the attorney general "to fail to undertake -- and to make public -- an in-depth evaluation of prison conditions (not only at the M.C.C.) and to carry out appropriate reforms."

Texto completo: A company memo said they had been dismissed "for clear and repeated violations of our data security policies."
SAN FRANCISCO -- Google on Monday fired four employees who had been active in labor organizing at the company, according to a memo that was seen by The New York Times.
The memo, sent by Google's security and investigations team, told employees that the company had dismissed four employees "for clear and repeated violations of our data security policies." Jenn Kaiser, a Google spokeswoman, confirmed the firings but declined to elaborate.
The dismissals are expected to exacerbate rocky relations between Google's management and a vocal contingent of workers who have protested the company's handling of sexual harassment, its treatment of contract employees, and its work with the Defense Department, federal border agencies and the Chinese government.
Tensions have increased as Google has cracked down on what had long been a freewheeling work culture that encouraged employees to speak out. Google recently canceled a regular series of companywide meetings that allowed workers to pose questions to senior executives and began working with a consulting firm that has helped companies quell unionization efforts.
The changes are a remarkable turn for a company that has been considered a standard for the modern workplace. Google introduced many of the office perks that are now common across Silicon Valley, and its embrace of transparent relations between workers and management has influenced a generation of start-ups.
This month, Google placed two employees, Laurence Berland and Rebecca Rivers, on administrative leave, saying they had gotten into confidential documents that were not relevant to their work. They were among the four workers who were fired, according to two people familiar with the dismissals.
Ms. Rivers confirmed her firing on Twitter on Monday. The identities of the other two employees were not clear Monday evening.
Mr. Berland and Ms. Rivers could not be reached for comment. The memo announcing the firings was first reported by Bloomberg News.
On Friday, Mr. Berland and Ms. Rivers spoke about their suspensions at a rally attended by more than 100 Google workers outside the company's San Francisco offices. Both said that they had raised objections internally over Google's work with Customs and Border Protection but that they had not gotten access to documents they were not authorized to view.
In the memo, Google said the fired employees had repeatedly searched for, looked through and distributed information "outside the scope of their jobs." One of the workers set up notifications to receive emails detailing the work and whereabouts of other employees without their knowledge or consent, the memo said.
"This is not how Google's open culture works or was ever intended to work," the memo said.
When asked last week by The Times, Google could not point to a specific rule that forbade setting up these notifications but said it was investigating to determine if this and other behavior violated the company's code of conduct.
The Tech Workers Coalition, an advocacy group, said on Twitter on Monday that the four employees had been fired for "organizing at work" and encouraged workers at Google to "speak out against this draconian act."
"This is meant to scare workers, don't let it," the tweet said.
Veena Dubal, an associate professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, said, "It does seem like this termination was in direct response to their organizing."
She added, "I am skeptical that this was about how safe other people felt, and more about how effective these people were in the workplace in terms of organizing their co-workers."
In August, nearly 1,500 Google workers signed a petition asking the company not to pursue a contract with Customs and Border Protection, which they said was complicit in "human rights abuses." In September, Google hired a former member of the Department of Homeland Security staff, Miles Taylor, a move that provoked a backlash from workers who objected to the Trump administration's family separation policy. Google deleted questions about Mr. Taylor's employment from internal systems, BuzzFeed News reported.
At the rally on Friday, Ms. Rivers said Google security staff had interrogated her about her involvement in the petition. Mr. Berland said he had also worked on the petition and raised questions about the company's decision to hire Mr. Taylor.
"If we can't speak up about these issues that concern us about our work," Mr. Berland said, "how can we ever hold ourselves and each other to the high standard that we need and the world deserves? Silence and secrecy are not the way for us to come together to solve problems."
Google employees at the rally said they were protesting the suspensions of Mr. Berland and Ms. Rivers and demanded that they be returned to work.
"Google has suspended them from their jobs and interrogated them for speaking out," said Stephanie Parker, a Google worker who spoke at the demonstration. "We are here today to show them our support and to demand that Google bring them back to work immediately."

‘Presidents are not kings’: Judge says ex-White House counsel Donald McGahn must testify before Congress

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Former White House counsel Donald McGahn, a key figure with firsthand knowledge of President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to short-circuit the Mueller investigation, must testify before Congress, a federal judge ruled Monday.
The ruling, which the Justice Department said it will appeal, affirms Congress' role as a check on executive power. If upheld, it could open the door for testimony by some of the president's closest aides, including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
U. S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson rejected the White House's claims of absolute immunity, saying the president "does not have the power" to prevent his aides from responding to congressional subpoenas.
"Today, this Court adds that this conclusion is inescapable precisely because compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct, not a political one, and per the Constitution, no one is above the law," Jackson wrote in a lengthy ruling issued late Monday.
"Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings," Jackson wrote. "This means they do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control. "
McGahn, however, can invoke executive privilege "where appropriate," Jackson said, citing a previous court ruling that concluded former President George W. Bush's White House counsel must testify before Congress. The judge added it is "widely accepted" that the president can assert executive privilege to protect potentially sensitive topics.
The Justice Department on Tuesday asked for the ruling to be postponed until the case is ultimately decided. The department continued to argue "that Mr. McGahn is absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony," and that there is a "significant chance" the appeals court will agree.
Trump tax returns: Supreme Court blocks access to Trump's financial records while more legal papers are filed
The decision comes in the middle of an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump used the presidency to force another country to investigate a potential rival in 2020. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , chairman of the committee that's seeking McGahn's testimony, said the decision confirmed that claims of absolute immunity have no basis in law.
"Don McGahn is a central witness to allegations that President Trump obstructed Special Counsel Mueller's investigation," Nadler, of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a written statement. "Now that the court has ruled, I expect him to follow his legal obligations and promptly appear before the Committee. "
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee that's heading the impeachment probe, said the ruling should encourage more recalcitrant administration witnesses to come forward.
"The witnesses who have defied Congress at the behest of the president will have to decide whether their duty is to the country, or to a president who believes that he is above the law," Schiff said in a written statement.
Witnesses have testified in the impeachment inquiry that the White House dangled a state visit and withheld military aid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into the family of former vice president and 2020 presidential contender Joe Biden.
As Democratic lawmakers investigate Trump and his administration, McGahn and other current and former White House officials have found themselves in the middle of legal battles that could redefine the powers of Congress and the presidency.
Bolton and Mulvaney could be important witnesses in the impeachment probe.
State Department diplomats have testified about Bolton's opposition to the Trump administration's campaign for Ukraine to announce investigations. Bolton called Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who is at the center of these efforts, a "hand grenade," according to testimony from Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia.
The House Intelligence Committee has not subpoenaed Bolton, who has hinted he will not stay quiet.
Impeachment: What have we learned so far in the impeachment public hearings and what comes next?
Last month, his former aide, Charles Kupperman, defied a congressional subpoena to testify and asked the court to decide whether he should comply with it. The committee later withdrew its subpoena and asked a federal judge to dismiss Kupperman's lawsuit.
Charles Cooper, Kupperman's lawyer, said his case remains different from McGahn's because he discussed national security and foreign affairs with the president.
"Accordingly, Dr. Kupperman will continue to pursue his lawsuit seeking an authoritative and binding judicial ruling resolving the question whether he is constitutionally obliged to obey the House’s demand that he testify or the president’s conflicting demand that he decline to do so," Cooper said in a statement.
Democrats also want to hear from Mulvaney, but he too has defied a congressional subpoena. Mulvaney was a key figure in the White House's efforts to justify Trump's decision to withhold aid to Ukraine, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported.
Mulvaney was going to join Kupperman's lawsuit but said he would instead file his own — only to ultimately drop that plan, too.
Democrats' efforts to get McGahn to testify predate the Ukraine controversy. They want him to testify about episodes of potential obstruction of justice detailed in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.
These episodes included Trump's efforts to fire Mueller as he investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 election and its possible ties to the Trump campaign.
In June 2017, Trump called McGahn at home and told him Mueller should be removed because he had conflicts of interest, according to the Mueller report.
McGahn decided he would rather resign than carry out that order. He feared a repeat of the "Saturday Night Massacre," which happened when top Justice Department officials resigned rather than carry out former President Richard Nixon's order to fire the Watergate prosecutor.
Trump met with McGahn in the Oval Office and pressured him again, according to the Mueller report. McGahn refused.
McGahn: Random judge assignment ordered for Don McGahn subpoena case, a victory for Justice Department against House
McGahn later told Trump's then-chief of staff, Reince Priebus, that the president had asked him to "do crazy s---," according to the report.
After news broke in early 2018 about Trump's efforts to have Mueller fired, the president told White House staffers to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to remove Mueller, according to the report.
McGahn, again, refused. He later told Mueller's investigators that the news stories were accurate.
He resigned in October 2018.
In May, McGahn defied a subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee for his documents and testimony.
White House lawyers have argued that the House can't compel McGahn's testimony because his communications as a top aide to the president are protected by executive privilege.
Democrats sued to force McGahn to testify. They called him "the most important witness," other than Trump himself, to the events the committee is investigating.
The House Judiciary Committee won in another court battle last month when a federal judge granted access to grand jury evidence behind Mueller's report.
Another case involving executive power may go to the Supreme Court.
The House Oversight and Reform Committee wants to review several years of Trump's tax returns and financial records. Judges at the district and appellate levels ruled in favor of the House. Trump's attorneys then asked the Supreme Court to intervene.
The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily blocked disclosure of the documents as attorneys for the parties prepare written arguments on whether the high court should hear the case.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Guards Napped by Epstein Cell, Indictment Says" (front page, Nov. 20):
The indictment of two Metropolitan Correctional Center guards for not checking on inmates on the night of Jeffrey Epstein's death is not the full accounting to which Mr. Epstein's family, his alleged victims and the public are entitled.
We all agree that it is unthinkable that any detainee, let alone a high-profile detainee like Mr. Epstein, would die unnoticed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. It is the job of the Bureau of Prisons to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates.
It would be a tragic and costly missed opportunity for the Bureau of Prisons and the United States attorney general to fail to undertake -- and to make public -- an in-depth evaluation of prison conditions (not only at the M.C.C.) and to carry out appropriate reforms.
There is at the very least anecdotal evidence that chronic understaffing, subpar living conditions, violence, gang activity, racial tension and the prevalence of drugs and contraband are the norms in many of our prisons. These conditions are worsened by the absence of necessary services, including meaningful mental health and drug rehabilitation, not to mention adequate heat and hot water.

Texto completo: Black Friday is a money- and time-sucking vortex. Here's what not to do this year.
To make the most of Black Friday, follow the Wirecutter Deals page , where Wirecutter staff members will be constantly updating their list of researched deals that are actually worth your time.
Black Friday is a highly anticipated day for shoppers who can't resist a good deal. For others, it's an overwhelming 24-hour marathon in which the pressure to buy anything (everything?) feels unbearable. For me, watching a timer count down the minutes until the discounts expire causes panic, and most years I end up buying nothing.
But there's no longer a reason to panic on Black Friday, thanks to Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products. Through our obsessive price-tracking and deal-finding for the Wirecutter Deals page and daily deals newsletter, my co-workers and I know that some bargains get posted as early as Nov. 1, turning Black Friday from one high-stress day into an entire month rich with discounts. That counting clock creates a sense of urgency, and sometimes you do have to buy quickly before a deal expires. But more often than not, you can take an extra few minutes to verify details and really think about your needs.
So don't stress this Black Friday. Here are five other things the Wirecutter Deals team recommends you avoid this year while you hunt for the best deals on things you actually need.
Gadget fads
Remember hoverboards and fidget spinners? We've all fallen for culture-consuming fads at one time or another, spending money on something that won't be around by the end of the year. Even if you think you're impervious, stores may tempt you this Black Friday: According to my colleague, the Wirecutter Deals editor Nathan Burrow, this holiday usually offers heavy discounts on trendy items. For example, this year you're likely to see impressive price drops on electric scooters. They've become ubiquitous, popping up in cities alongside short-term rental bikes, but according to our testing, they're unreliable, faulty and, in some cases, dangerous. Resist until you've done your research and you're sure you'll want the gadget a few months from now.
Exercise equipment
Some people think Black Friday is the best time to buy big-ticket items. That's not necessarily the case, especially if you're shopping for expensive exercise equipment. January offers some of the best deals we see on treadmills and ellipticals. Though there are rare instances during Cyber Week where you'll find low prices on home exercise machines that match January's discounts, you're better off waiting. Not only will the items be more steadily available, but there's also a better chance you'll put that treadmill to use immediately. Let's face it: You're likely to put off your workouts until you have a New Year's resolution to work on.

Doorbuster deals
You don't have to rush Walmart to nab great deals. You don't even have to be glued to your phone for website deals before dawn -- we know from years of experience that it's almost never worth it. "The 'doorbusters' are often on items that aren't worth busting doors for," Mr. Burrow said. The 55-inch TVs that drop to $ 200 are often less-familiar brands; the vacuums with price tags that fall a few hundred dollars aren't Dysons. If lining up at midnight is something your family considers a tradition, we won't stop you. But keep in mind that most times, you're better off passing on the meh deals that are thrown your way.
Buying in bulk
Last year, Mr. Burrow snagged a great Black Friday deal on six 75-ounce jugs of laundry detergent. It wasn't until the package arrived on his doorstep that he realized he didn't have the space to store his bounty. Though he hasn't needed to replenish his stock yet, the jugs clutter his basement, blocking the path to the rest of his storage space. This is why buying in bulk is almost always better in theory than in practice. The same goes for buying anything perishable, said Mr. Burrow, who also purchased a 100-pack of Peet's Coffee espresso capsules that he was unable to finish before they expired.
Anything you already have
Mr. Burrow has a weakness for Bluetooth speakers: Though he already has two that are perfectly functional, he still found himself purchasing a third when the price fell to a new low on Black Friday last year. Now that he's spent a few hundred dollars on different versions of the same product, he confidently suggests you avoid buying more of the same thing -- no matter how good the discount may be. "Don't invent a reason to own something just because the price is great," he said. Instead, look for discounts on items that will bring new joy to your life.

How Jake Burton Carpenter built a legacy

Texto completo: Luis Calderin was reflecting Friday on why he was so deeply and profoundly sad about the death of his friend, Jake Burton Carpenter.
"I would describe him as a friend, as a mentor, as a father figure to me, and my boss," Calderin said.
Burton announced the death of its founder on Thursday, news that has reverberated around the world. Carpenter died on Wednesday from complications related to cancer first diagnosed in 2011.
"I'm 45 years old and I have experienced close loss over the years, as one does at this age," Calderin said. "This is different for me."
Different, because Calderin says Carpenter changed his life. Calderin worked for Burton Snowboards from 1999 to 2003, and again from 2012 to 2016, forming a personal relationship with Carpenter. He explained that working for Burton was more than a job. It gave him an identity and a purpose. He was part of both something bigger than himself and something very intimate.
"I worked for Jake and Donna on and off for many years," Calderin said. "They definitely treated us as a global family, and I got to know Jake and work with him closely on special projects."
From snowboarding lessons to a job at Burton The son of Cuban immigrants, and the first in his family to be born in the United States, Calderin moved to Burlington from Miami in 1986 when he was 12 years old. Two years later he connected with two brothers, Andy and Jack Coghlan, who owned a snowboard shop in downtown Burlington called the Boarding House.
Calderin went to work for the brothers, who taught him to snowboard at Bolton Valley Resort.
"When I came down that hill that first time, it changed my view on all of life," Calderin said. "I've been around the world several times and stepped on many a stage fearless because of that one particular night."
Calderin is in his 30th year working as a DJ, in addition to many other hats he has worn, including working in marketing for Burton, working on Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, and owning his own marketing agency.
Calderin credits his diverse career to Burton and to being able to turn a passion into a job and a job into a field of expertise.
"For me, to have worked on a presidential campaign had its roots in working for Burton," Calderin said.
Elevating the Snurfer The vision Jake Burton Carpenter had, of course, was to create a business, a sport and a lifestyle around snowboarding, together with his wife, Donna.
Carpenter's ascendancy to the top of the snowboarding world began with the Snurfer, a board with a string on it for the rider to hold onto while standing up. Brunswick Corp. sold about 1 million Snurfers between 1966 and 1976, but never did anything to make it better. Carpenter saw potential.
Basically, the Snurfer was a toy, Calderin said. Carpenter turned it into a force that changed the world.
"He built upon that design, adding bindings and edges and elevated it completely," he said.
After a years-long struggle to gain acceptance on ski mountains, Jake and Donna saw the possibilities for snowboarding early on, in the early 1980s, according to Calderin. The breakthrough came at Stratton Mountain, the first to allow riders to carve its slopes.
One of Carpenter's legacies, besides a company that still dominates snowboarding, is that worldwide community of snowboarders, which includes its own fashion, its own terminology and its own values.
"We have allowed the room to include all types, from the crack-of-dawn split-board hike up the mountain to get a sunrise run as an individual, to the rebel-rouser, rock-and-roll punk rockers on the other side of the spectrum, all the way to tried-and-true Olympians as bona fide athletes," Calderin said. "Snowboarding makes room for all those archetypes to exist and welcomes them all."
Then there's the perseverance.
The Big P Calderin re-watched a Vice interview of Carpenter from 2012 on Friday morning, when Burton talked about hitting the road in the early days of his company with 48 snowboards and coming back at the end of the day with 50.
"One shop gave him back two boards," Calderin said. "They didn't want them."
As he watched the interview, Calderin said what jumped out at him was Carpenter's refusal to give up.
"He spoke about perseverance, the Big P, we had to have perseverance in those early days," Calderin said. "That was a lesson and value that jumped out at me then and I have often referred to it since then. In this life, when you're trying something new, breaking new ground and you're the underdog, you got to have the Big P."
Carpenter's perseverance was perhaps even more evident in his battle with cancer, and in 2015, with a rare disorder called Miller Fisher Syndrome.
The New York Times interviewed Carpenter after he recovered from a months-long battle with the disease, during which he was "strapped to breathing machines and fed through tubes." The Times story explained that the only part of Carpenter's body that he could move were his hands, which he used to scribble "commands and thoughts on reams of paper."
After his cancer returned, Carpenter wrote a poignant email to the entire company, explaining the same tumor as the first time around "got back into business."
"As much as I dread what is facing me, it's easier to deal with when you know that you have a family that will carry on," Carpenter wrote.
Calderin believes the company, and the family it created, will carry on.
"What happens next I believe is as an organization and as a family, they will regroup and make sure to drive forward, embodying Jake's vision and his values for the organization and the community and culture at large," Calderin said. "We will persevere and make sure we protect what he and so many others built."

Mark Ruffalo talks about new film 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo was shocked.
You see, apart from being an Oscar-nominated actor best known for playing the Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ruffalo is also an environmental activist; he co-founded Water Defense in 2011 to raise awareness about the impact energy extraction has on water and public health.
And "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" had hit him hard. Nathaniel Rich's 2016 piece for the New York Times Magazine chronicled attorney Rob Bilott's fight to expose impact of the DuPont chemical company's release of PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, which it had pumped as powder into the Ohio River near a West Virginia facility for decades, according to Rich's reporting. PFOA is a compound used in the manufacture of Teflon.
"If you are a sentient being reading this article in 2016, you already have PFOA in your blood," Rich wrote. "It is in your parents' blood, your children's blood, your lover's blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water."
Scientists, according to Rich's reporting, found a "probable link" between PFOA and ailments including kidney, testicular and thyroid cancers, as well as high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.
"I was just floored," said Ruffalo. "It's like the biggest corporate criminality, spanning 50 years, no accountability, and no one knew about it."
Ruffalo is working to change that with "Dark Waters." The film — opening in select cinemas Friday, Nov. 22 before expanding on Nov. 29 and playing nationwide on Dec. 6 — was produced by Ruffalo.
He also stars as Bilott, a environmental corporate defense attorney who spent years on the issue of PFOA as the work took its toll on his health and career.
The question of Bilott's motivation compelled Ruffalo, the actor said.
"Was there really a rebellious quality in him? Did he have a chip on his shoulder about something?" Ruffalo wondered. Instead, the actor kept coming back to a much more straightforward answer.
"He believed in people, and he saw the world as a jury of his peers," Ruffalo said of Bilott. "And (he believed that) once he laid out enough evidence and it was compelling enough, that they would decide to do the right thing. That's how he handled everything, and it's that kind of dispassionate, unemotional, empirical sort of one foot in front of the other until we get to where we need to be that was his ethos.
"As an actor, you want the big, dramatic moments. You want the juicy scenes. You want the moment where our hero gets to confront the bad guy and take him down, but that's just not the nature of Rob and that's not the nature of the story."
Oscar-winning actor and activist Tim Robbins co-stars in "Dark Waters" as Tom Terp, Bilott's supervising partner at the Cincinnati law firm of Taft Stettinius and Hollister LLP who provides Bilott with crucial support in contrast to the firm's history of representing chemical companies.
"That's what spoke to me, it was the unexpected nature of it," said Robbins, "the man whose law firm represents chemical companies, to take on a case that is holding a chemical company responsible for polluting the environment. This is not their wheelhouse, right? This is not something they normally do. I find characters like that really inspiring."
DuPont and Chemours, a former DuPont unit that spun off into its own company in 2015, arrived at a $670.7 million settlement to settle 3,550 lawsuits related to the release of PFOA in 2017.
Terp and Bilott could, Robbins said, serve as guides for how more changes could come in the future.
"It's not like they're your liberal reformers or anything, it's people who go outside their own corporate culture to pursue something based on morality, based on right and wrong and not on profit margin," said Robbins. "And quite frankly, it's going to be up to people like Tom Terp to realize that morality in themselves and take risks and perhaps compromise their position of power or their livelihood to do the right thing."
Directed by Oscar nominee Todd Haynes from a screenplay by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, "Dark Waters" is a Focus Features release presented by Participant.
Haynes' film is firmly in the whistleblower cinema tradition that includes "All The President's Men" (1976) and "The Post" (2017), specifically the environmental and legal sub-genre alongside Oscar-winner "Erin Brockovich" (2000) and Oscar nominee "A Civil Action" (1997).
But it also has plenty in common with Ruffalo and Participant's 2015 modern classic "Spotlight," which earned a Best Picture Oscar and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Ruffalo. Both films are non-sensationalist, methodical examination of all of the work — legal in the case of "Dark Waters," journalistic in "Spotlight" — that goes into uncovering the truth.
"Dark Waters," with its exposure of DuPont practices, also serves as an inadvertent companion piece to "Foxcatcher." That 2014 starred an Oscar-nominated Ruffalo as Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz, who was murdered in 1996 by chemical empire heir John du Pont, played by Steve Carrell.
Taken together, "Dark Waters" and "Foxcatcher" chillingly speak to the free reign our society has afforded powerful corporations and families.
"It is a corporate elite in America that basically because of economic reasons are given free hand to pollute, to dominate, to run amok," Ruffalo said. "Whether it's John du Pont in 'Foxcatcher' and his delusions of grandeur that came from a lifetime of privilege and money or it's DuPont as a corporate entity who was a driving economic factor in American business.
"If all we value is the GDP of a country as a value of its health or well-being, then you're going to have a lot more stories like the PFOA story and a lot more companies like DuPont who knowingly and willingly poisoned the world for pure profit and the almighty dollar."
"Dark Waters," 126 minutes, rated PG-13, open in select cinemas before expanding on Friday and playing nationwide on Dec. 6. More info: www.focusfeatures.com/dark-waters.

Texto completo: Eastern Connecticut cross country and track coach Kathy Manizza had her female runners read a book over the summer about nutrition and fitness programs tailored specifically for women athletes.
The book was "Roar: How To Match Your Food and Fitness To Your Unique Female Physiology For Optimum Performance, Great Health and A Strong Lean Body for Life," by Stacy Sims.
"It talks about the importance of energy and Relative Energy Deficiency Syndrome [RED-S], which encompasses men and women," said Manizza, the Little East Conference cross country coach of the year who has coached for over 25 years at Eastern and the University of Hartford. "It means you're not eating enough calories to support your activity. So her book talks about that a lot, [women] losing [their] period, about using your period to your advantage, that you're often stronger in the first couple days of your period and maybe adjusting your training in those few days before that. It was good for them to read because we talked about it a lot during the season."
Earlier this month, running prodigy Mary Cain was featured in a powerful opinion video in the New York Times, alleging that she was "emotionally and physically abused by a system designed by [her former coach] Alberto [Salazar] and endorsed by Nike," who ran the now-shuttered Oregon Project. As one of the top runners in the country as a 17-year-old, Cain opted to skip college and become a professional runner with the Oregon Project. She was allegedly urged by Salazar - who was banned for four years from coaching by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in October - and his all-male coaching team to lose weight. Cain became injured and said she lost her period for three years and broke five bones due to decreased bone mineral density. Her performance dropped off dramatically. She said she began to cut herself and had suicidal thoughts.
The story has lit up social media, with multiple former Oregon Project athletes such as two-time Olympian Kara Goucher corroborating Cain's account of the Oregon Project's culture of demeaning female athletes. Salazar has denied that he encouraged Cain to maintain an unhealthy weight in emails to the Oregonian and Sports Illustrated, however, he wrote to the Oregonian, "Mary at times struggled to find and maintain her ideal performance and training weight." Salazar is also appealing the doping ban and has denied permitting doping within the Oregon Project. But the questions brought up in the Cain story continue to resonate with female runners and coaches. What is an ideal training weight? And how is it best maintained? Is it better to have female coaches coaching females or at least more women involved in athletics?
"It did come as a shock, watching that video, when they're telling her, you'll be faster if you lost weight," said Eastern Connecticut senior cross country and track runner Nina Pasqua, who is from Bristol. "Well, you know, that's not always the case. That's not what we implement here [at Eastern].
"I'm a sport management major and, as a woman, seeing Mary Cain had a team of all men, and a staff of all men, was disheartening. I think it's important to have women in the sports industry, in the athletic department, because men can only understand so much when it comes to training, but at the end of the day, because the anatomy's different, only a woman is going to truly understand another female's anatomy. It was rough to hear and watch Mary Cain talk about no women being on the team and how the men were pushing her to lose weight."
Pasqua, a team captain, is a sports management major. So is her teammate Rachel Osak, a senior from Portland. Osak is a self-admitted stubborn, Type A personality who said she was underweight in high school and was injured.
"I did a paper for my Sports in American Society class on athletes and mental health," Osak said. "I talked about eating disorders and for distance runners, eating disorders are common because we have perfectionist, neurotic-type personalities. We're very precise in how we do things and a lot of times there's a misconception that the smaller you are, the faster you'll be able to run.
"But when a distance runner isn't eating enough, we lose our menstrual cycle, our bone density gets lower, we're more likely to get injured and we're more likely to stay injured if we get overuse injuries. The Mary Cain story broke my heart because she broke five bones."
"We're 21, turning 22," Pasqua said. "[Cain is now] 23. We're still figuring out our bodies. I've learned a lot about my body in the cross country program. I think this school does a pretty good job of offering resources. We have both male and female athletic trainers. We have female and male coaches. Female [athletic] directors. That's really important."
Manizza, whose women's team won the Little East Conference championship this month for the second time in three years, pushes her athletes to refuel their bodies after a hard workout. At UConn, there is a snack area at Greer Field House for athletes, with a sign next to it, urging athletes to "Fuel. Perform. Recover,' and offering suggestions of what to eat before, during and after workouts. UConn also has a nutritionist.
Former Glastonbury star Lindsay Crevoiserat, who ran cross country and track at UConn and Oregon and then New Mexico as a graduate student, is in her first year as the head cross country coach and assistant track coach at UConn. She was on the U.S. team which went to the IAAF Junior World Championships with Cain in 2012.
"I'm glad people are talking about it," Crevoiserat said. "From an athlete standpoint, I've never had an experience with a coach that really pushes weight or anything, it's just that you want to be healthy and feel good. I never had an issue at Oregon or New Mexico or Iowa State [where she coached before UConn].
"You're going to run the best when you're the happiest. It never occurred to me that you have to be a certain weight when you're racing. I never really talk about weight, as a coach."
Mia Nahom, a UConn junior from New Milford, finished fourth at the NCAA New England regionals and qualified for the NCAA cross country championships Saturday in Terre Haute, Indiana.
"In terms of my own experiences, I've been very lucky," Nahom said.

Texto completo: Following the Vogue Champagne Diet, Renée Taylor downed two glasses of bubbly before each meal.
Now, not cheap champagne. Cheap champagne has more calories.
"I lost weight, but I became a $200-a-day Cristal drunk," the legendary comedian said.
Aye, there's the rub.
And there's always a rub.
"The Nanny" star, who is 86, is sharing her story of life, food and what she learned in the hilarious "My Life On A Diet," now through Dec.15 at George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick.
"I just happened to remember my life in terms of what I was eating," Taylor said. "I would say to my friends, 'oh yeah, that's when we were on the Last Chance Diet.' Whenever I met somebody famous, I'd ask them what they were eating because I thought, well if I eat like them, I'll look like them. So it never worked, but that's how I was thinking."
She was forever on a quest to lose weight in search of nailing roles.
"I thought if I looked a certain way, I'd have a certain kind of a career, so I was always losing weight for different parts."
And there were so many diets.
"I was on the amphetamine diet. There was a time where everybody was taking Dexamyls before they had a meal. And I was on the Last Chance Diet, which was a liquid protein. I got off that because people died. I read in The New York Times that you can't live on that little amount of protein a day and so people died."
Ultimately, it was the "The Nanny," the '90s sitcom starring Fran Drescher, that ended that quest. Taylor played Drescher's overbearing Jewish mother, Sylvia.
"I had a lot of success when I was on 'The Nanny' and I was overweight and I really saw it didn't matter what my weight was, people didn't care about whether I was fat or whether I was thin," she said. "But it all had to do with your image of yourself, I came to see that it was really just a way of sidetracking, distracting myself by being on a diet all the time.
In addition to pointing to "The Nanny" as a turning point in her life in regard to her relationship with food, it also was a highlight of her career, she says.
"It was so much fun. We laughed all the time. When I first did it, the costume designer, Brenda Cooper, who won an Emmy for the clothes on the show, I met her in a department store and she said, 'This is what you're gonna wear.' And I said, 'Who would wear something like that?' And she said, 'You!' That was a wonderful introduction to the character because, and I had never won a girdle before, but she said, 'Would you wear a girdle? It makes you walk a certain way, you move a certain way,' and it was true. And when your hair is so high, you move a certain way. So it was really wonderful to explore a character from the physical appearance and then find out who that person was."
She wrote of her experiences in "My Life On A Diet" as a book, and her late husband, actor, playwright and screenwriter Joe Bologna, suggested it would make a great one-woman show.
And he was right. Not only has the comedy been a success, but Taylor says people come up to her after the show and share their stories of the crazy diets they've been on.
Taylor says Bologna did draw a line for the show.
"The pregnant women's urine diet. Well, that's pretty wild. You know, you inject yourself with pregnant women's urine before you eat. Actually it works. I don't really know why, but it does. I lost a lot of weight on it. I did that diet but my husband didn't want to put it in the show. (He) thought it was too gross."
Taylor says ultimately, in addition to learning to accept herself, she learned lifestyle changes are much more important than fad diets.
"They are all pretty crazy. You know if you eat eight bananas a day, you're going to lose weight, whatever kind of restrictions you give yourself, it's going to work for a certain period of time. But then you learn that what's really important is your body feeling good. That's really what's important and it's really your lifestyle, not your diet."
Taylor says her outlook as a comic also has a major impact on her life.
"In my family, everybody was so serious that I just made jokes. I don't like to be serious for too long a period, so I always think of something funny. Everything strikes me as funny. I don't take myself seriously. I really don't. Because you know why? Because life is too serious to take it serious or to take things personally. I just let things go."
She says that sharing her story through comedy allows her to get important messages across, and also serves as a connection to Bologna.
"It's really great to share with people that way and since my husband died two years ago and he directed the show and wrote it with me, doing the show is very healing for me to re-create the humor that we had together. He comes to life every night when I do it on the stage. So that's a wonderful feeling for me."
"My Life On A Diet" is the first full production in the Arthur Laurents Theatre at the new New Brunswick Performing Arts Center.
"That was a real honor," she said.

Navy brass deny threatening to resign; Secretary and others contradict N.Y. Times report after president tries to stop review of court-martialed SEAL.

Texto completo: U.S. Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer denied a New York Times report Saturday that he had threatened to resign or be fired if President Trump intervenes to stop an administrative review of a SEAL at the center of a botched war crimes court-martial.
Spencer delivered the denial from the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada, where he is a keynote speaker: "Contrary to popular belief, I am still here. I did not threaten to resign. We are here to talk about external threats, and Eddie Gallagher is not one of them."
The comment bolstered other denials from Navy officials who told the San Diego Union-Tribune on Saturday that neither Spencer nor Rear Adm. Collin Green had threatened to resign, contrary to what the newspaper had reported hours earlier.

The report was based on comments from unnamed officials in the Trump administration, the New York Times said.
Last week, Green, the commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, said he would begin "trident reviews" of four SEALs involved in a war crimes investigation into the actions of SEAL Team 7's Alpha Platoon during a 2017 deployment to Iraq. A trident review essentially determines whether a SEAL remains in the elite community.
The reviews were announced just days after Trump restored Navy SEAL Edward R. Gallagher to the rank of chief petty officer, overturning the sentence of the military jury in Gallagher's San Diego court-martial this summer.
The decision to hold reviews was criticized as an affront to Trump's authority as commander in chief by Gallagher's media surrogates on Fox News and by his attorneys, Timothy Parlatore and Marc Mukasey.
On Thursday, Trump said in a tweet that the Navy will not be taking Gallagher's SEAL trident pin, the gold insignia of the Navy SEALs.
Navy officials offered conflicting accounts on whether the reviews were suspended or proceeding Thursday.
The New York Times reported that the Navy may not consider Trump's tweet an official order.
On Saturday, Spencer said he would need a formal order to stop a review of Gallagher, who could lose his trident pin and status as a Navy SEAL, according to the Associated Press.
"I need a formal order to act," he said, referring to the tweet. "I don't interpret them as a formal order."
On Friday, Spencer told Reuters at the Halifax International Security Forum that he supports the hearing into whether Gallagher will be allowed to remain a SEAL, saying he believes the process matters for "good order and discipline."
Parlatore, citing misconduct by a Navy lawyer and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service during Gallagher's court-martial, told the Union-Tribune on Saturday that good order and discipline are no reason to disregard a "clear directive" from the commander in chief.
"The secretary should not be supporting [the review boards] when he has failed to ensure good order and discipline is applied across the board by holding [Navy] prosecutors and NCIS agents accountable for their criminal conduct in this case," Parlatore said. "Additionally, [Spencer] should not be making statements like these on foreign soil."
Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, the Navy's chief spokesman, said Saturday that Spencer's comments in Canada were in line with current White House guidance.
Parlatore said he thought Green should resign or be fired.
"At this point," Parlatore said in a text message, "Green has demonstrated such a lack of leadership through his fixation on Eddie Gallagher and defiance of the president that he should resign or be fired."
Gallagher was charged with killing a wounded Islamic State captive and shooting civilians during his time in Iraq in 2017. At the end of his court-martial, a jury acquitted him of the most serious allegations and convicted him of posing for photos with the body of the captive fighter.
A military jury sentenced Gallagher to four months' confinement, which he served before trial, and reduced his rank to petty officer 1st class, or E-6.
Trump tweeted congratulations after Gallagher's acquittal of the most serious charges in July.

WASHINGTON - An FBI lawyer is suspected of altering a document related to surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser, a person familiar with the situation said Friday.
President Donald Trump, who has long attacked as a "hoax" and a "witch hunt" the FBI's investigation into ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign, immediately touted news reports about the accusation to allege that the FBI had tried to "overthrow the presidency."
The allegation is part of a Justice Department inspector general review of the FBI's Russia investigation, one of the most politically sensitive probes in the bureau's history. That election interference probe was ultimately taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller and resulted in charges against six Trump associates and more than two dozen Russians accused of interfering in the election. Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to release his report on Dec. 9.
Witnesses in the last two weeks have been invited in to see draft sections of that document.
The inspector general report is likely to revive debate about an investigation that has shadowed Trump's presidency since the beginning.
Trump and his supporters are likely to seize on any findings of mistakes or bad judgment in the report to support their claims of a biased investigation. Supporters of the FBI, meanwhile, are likely to hold up as vindication any findings that the investigation was done by the book or free of political considerations.
The allegation against the lawyer was first reported by CNN. The Washington Post subsequently reported that the conduct of the FBI employee didn't alter Horowitz's finding that the surveillance application of Page had a proper legal and factual basis, an official told the Post, which said the lawyer was forced out.
"This was spying on my campaign - something that has never been done in the history of our country," Trump told "Fox & Friends" on Friday. "They tried to overthrow the presidency."
A person familiar with the case who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke to AP only on the condition of anonymity confirmed the allegation.
Spokespeople for the FBI and the inspector general declined to comment Friday.
The New York Times and the Post have reported that the investigation is expected to find mistakes by lower-level officials within the FBI but will not accuse senior leaders of being motivated by political bias.
The FBI obtained a secret surveillance warrant in 2016 to monitor the communications of Page, who was never charged in the Russia investigation or accused of wrongdoing. The warrant, which was renewed several times and approved by different judges in 2016 and early 2017, has been one of the most contentious elements of the Russia probe and was the subject of dueling memos last year issued by Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee.
Republicans have long attacked the credibility of the warrant application since it cited information derived from a dossier of opposition research compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy whose work was financed by Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign.
"They got my warrant - a fraudulent warrant, I believe - to spy on myself as a way of getting into the Trump campaign," Page said in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox's "Mornings with Maria." "There has been a continued cover-up to this day. We still don't have the truth, but hopefully, we'll get that soon."
FBI Director Chris Wray has told Congress that he did not consider the FBI surveillance to be "spying" and that he has no evidence the FBI illegally monitored Trump's campaign during the 2016 election. Wray said he would not describe the FBI's surveillance as "spying" if it's following "investigative policies and procedures."
Attorney General William Barr has said he believed "spying" did occur, but he also made clear at a Senate hearing earlier this year that he had no specific evidence that any surveillance was illegal or improper. Barr has appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate how intelligence was collected, and that probe has since become criminal in nature, a person familiar with the matter has said.
But Trump insists that members of the Obama administration "at the highest levels" were spying on his 2016 campaign. "Personally, I think it goes all the way. ... I think this goes to the highest level," he said in the Fox interview. "I hate to say it. I think it's a disgrace. They thought I was going to win and they said, 'How can we stop him?'"

Texto completo: Readers voice frustration that "Republicans seem to be immune to facts" and that the scope of the inquiry was limited to Ukraine.
To the Editor:
Re "Expert Condemns Flow of 'Fictions' on Ukraine's Role" (front page, Nov. 22):
I watched the televised impeachment inquiry hearings trying to keep an open mind. I was heartened and inspired by the quality and integrity of the people working for the State Department and the National Security Council. But it seemed to me that there were two different agendas at play.
The witnesses seemed to be striving to uphold their oaths to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The Republican committee members seemed to be striving to preserve, protect and defend the president of the United States regardless of the cost, both foreign and domestic. This involved casting aspersions on the reputations of the patriots who were, at personal and professional risk, trying to help Congress do its job.
Perhaps all congressional committee meetings should begin with a review of the oath of office so that all committee members can be reminded of where their allegiance belongs.

To the Editor:
As the House Intelligence Committee's inquiry winds down and moves to the Judiciary Committee for final action, the House should consider censure, not impeachment. There is no doubt about the president's wrongful behavior, but there is also no doubt that the Senate will not vote to convict. The Senate's primary reason is likely to be that the wrongful behavior did not rise to the level of an offense warranting removal from office. Furthermore, given that the election is less than a year away, let the people decide.
Censure avoids a messy, expensive and fruitless trial in the Senate, which would further divide the country. It prevents the president from proclaiming his absolute and total innocence of any wrongdoing when the Senate fails to convict. Most important, it requires each of our elected representatives to face their constituents and explain their vote on a motion to censure.

To the Editor:
After the compelling testimony from Fiona Hill on Thursday, we have seen no crack in our partisan politics. As one of the TV pundits said, Republicans seem to be immune to facts. I would ask Republicans how they might act if a Democratic president had asked a foreign political leader to interfere in our presidential elections.
I am not a John Bolton fan. However, I do believe that his beliefs are driven by what he believes is in the best interest of our country. Republicans need one of their own to provide both incentive and cover in order to break the dam and put country before party. It may be the last opportunity to preserve our democratic elections and values.

To the Editor:
Re "Gaps in Witness List Leave Loose Ends" (news analysis, front page, Nov. 22):
As an independent, I was appalled to read that the Democrats' House impeachment presentation was wrapping up without thoroughly investigating President Trump's conflicts of interest, self-dealing, violations of the emoluments clause, and (I fully expect) tax fraud. The Senate will not convict on the Ukrainian extortion scheme alone, even though proven, and now the Democrats have foolishly thrown away their best opportunity to fully investigate and expose our most unworthy president.
The cancerous corruption of the Republicans in Congress is matched only by the uncoordinated incompetence of the congressional Democrats. What will save America from our own leaders' cupidity and stupidity?

Texto completo: Amanda Ramírez fue sentenciada ayer a 6 años de cárcel por haber apuñalado fatalmente a su gemela durante una pelea callejera, en medio de una borrachera en Camden, Nueva Jersey.
La joven de 27 años se había declarado culpable en septiembre de homicidio involuntario.
Aunque inicialmente negó haber apuñalado a Anna Marie en el pecho, más tarde admitió el homicidio, pero afirmó que había actuado en defensa propia después de que su hermana tomase un cuchillo y la atacase primero, la madrugada del 22 del junio.
La acusada dijo que el apuñalamiento ocurrió después de una noche de consumo excesivo de alcohol, y agregó que no podía recordar por qué ella y su hermana habían comenzado a pelear.
Una de las versiones que circuló hablaba de un “triángulo amoroso”, según dijo Blanca Class, tía de ambas, al New York Times. “Fueron a una fiesta, volvieron a casa, estaban bebiendo, discutían sobre un novio”, afirmó en junio.
Cuando llegaron al edificio en los apartamentos de vivienda popular “Centennial Village”, había un hombre con ellos, informó New York Post, citando una vecina menor de edad.
Un obituario de Anna Marie publicado en internet la describe como una enfermera, madre de tres niñas.

St. Pete native to star in Michael Jackson Broadway musical

Texto completo: A St. Petersburg native has just landed what might be next years biggest role on Broadway.

Ephraim Sykes, who honed his chops at the Pinellas County Center for the Arts at Gibbs High School, will star as Michael Jackson in the upcoming bio-musical MJ, slated to open July 6 at the Neil Simon Theatre.

The show will be scripted by two-time Pulitzer winner Lynn Nottage (Ruined, Sweat), with Tony-winning choreographer Christopher Wheeldon directing.

Ive been dying to share this news for months now, Sykes posted on Instagram. My ACTUAL wildest dream is coming true. ... Ill do my best to honor the man who made me wanna sing and dance in the first place. Love you MJ, love yall!

According to the New York Times, the show is supposedly set in 1992, during rehearsals for Jacksons Dangerous Tour, and will feature music from his solo and Jackson 5 careers. Its been in the works for years, although not without controversy. It was supposed to begin pre-Broadway performances in Chicago this fall, though that run was canceled with little explanation other than the show needed more time.

Jackson, who died in 2009, has received largely negative headlines in 2019, following the Sundance debut of the documentary Leaving Neverland, in which two men  including choreographer Wade Robson  revived in harrowing detail fresh allegations that Jackson sexually abused them as children. That has led some organizations and artists to rethink their affiliation with, and celebration of, the singer.

The New York Post reported this summer that the MTV Video Music Awards discussed removing his name from its career achievement trophy, the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. Producers of The Simpsons announced that a classic 1991 episode featuring Jacksons voice would be taken out of rerun circulation. Weird Al Yankovic ditched his hit Michael Jackson parodies, Eat It and Fat, from his latest tour because we didnt want anybody to feel uncomfortable, he told Billboard.

Controversy aside, Sykes is a natural choice to fill the shoes and sequined glove of the King of Pop. Hes danced in projects ranging from Hamilton and Newsies on Broadway to film and TV projects like Hairspray Live! In April, Sykes received his first Tony Award nomination for his role in Aint Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations. A classically trained dancer, he was named Outstanding Male Dancer in a Broadway Show at this years Chita Rivera Awards, honoring choreography in musical theater.

And on Wednesday, Sykes earned his first Grammy nomination, as the Aint Too Proud cast was nominated for Best Musical Theater recording. He and his castmates will go up against the cast recordings from Hadestown, Oklahoma!, Moulin Rouge! and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

Flying Through Fire With a Notepad

Texto completo: When I learned of a scientific mission to study wildfire smoke by flying through fires on a jet plane, I immediately asked to join the trip.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
I am something of a nervous flier. I pray before takeoff, white knuckle through turbulence and, of course, say a few words of gratitude upon safe landing.
But when I heard that NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would be working on a joint mission to better understand the composition and evolution of wildfire smoke -- and that it involved flying a jet plane through wildfires -- I immediately asked my editor if I could tag along on a flight.
As a New York Times reporter who covers climate change with a focus on the science, ranging from how scientists know the climate is changing to its effect on people, I'd first developed an intense interest in wildfires in 2017, when persistent dry, hot weather on the West Coast overlapped with solar eclipse fever. Experts on wild lands, or lands not significantly altered by humans, especially in Oregon, were fearful that eclipse watchers might accidentally trigger a wildfire. If the conditions are suitably dry, it doesn't take much to start a fire -- parking a hot car on grass is enough to do it.
I have written a lot about wildfires in the years since.
According to the National Climate Assessment, much of the United States is vulnerable to fire and becoming more so, because warming temperatures make wildfires more likely. For much of the Western United States, reductions in air pollution, thanks to regulations like the Clean Air Act, have been stymied by increases in air pollution because of wildfire smoke, which makes people sick. A better understanding of wildfire smoke might help save lives.
This flight felt like an opportunity to expand my knowledge of the subject and share some of that with readers.
I knew I was in trouble when I arrived at Gowen Field, the airfield run by the Idaho Air National Guard that served as the mission's base, and every researcher I met asked me if I get air sick.
I did not fully understand that I had signed up for a flight filled with the drops and jarring turbulence that most planes go out of their way to avoid. Part of the goal of the flight was to get samples of wildfire smoke at various heights of the plume, and that meant flying down to elevations and in patterns that make turbulence all but expected.
One researcher, I was told, flew on the mission's inaugural flight from California and decided that the one flight was more than enough. He flew home on a commercial flight. On the other end of the fear spectrum, my seemingly unflappable seatmate, who never showed any anxiety during all of the flight's seven-plus hours, told me that, now, after several flights on this mission, she couldn't imagine being fazed by normal airplane turbulence.
The safety video for the Douglas DC-8 -- the same plane that in previous years flew over the poles to track glacier activity -- included such helpful tidbits as the fact that most of the traditional security exits were covered with scientific research equipment. It also mentioned, repeatedly, that if I saw smoke I should immediately tell the flight crew, because sometimes the research equipment catches fire. When the cabin filled with the smell of smoke after flying through a plume over Montana, it dawned on me that it would be hard to tell if the smoke was from the fire or the equipment.
One member of the crew tried to reassure me that I was in good hands with this plane, manufactured in 1969, because it was built like a tank. I told him those words were less than reassuring because, of course, tanks don't fly.
But in the end, he was right. This tank did fly.
I watched takeoff from a jump seat in the cockpit wearing noise-canceling headphones to filter out the roar of the DC-8, which is much louder than modern jets. Throughout the mission the researchers stared at computer screens relaying information from sensors strapped to the plane, each designed to measure a different aspect of the smoke. The plane is a flying lab, and there were moments of downtime as we flew around looking for wildfires big enough to sample. We ate the lunches we packed, we napped and as we flew over a large fire in Montana -- the biggest of the flight -- some whooped at the richness of the data even as the cabin filled with the smell of smoke reminiscent of a camp fire.

Texto completo: Two career foreign policy experts delivered new details about the inner workings of President Trump's foreign policy on Ukraine as well as some history lessons.
WASHINGTON -- David Holmes, a career diplomat and political counselor to the United States Embassy in Ukraine, and Fiona Hill, a former Europe and Russia expert at the White House, schooled lawmakers on Thursday on the United States' geopolitical relationship with Ukraine and provided some new details about the efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into President Trump's political rivals.
They both highlighted their apolitical and nonpartisan expertise and experience in foreign policy, a direct contrast to the witness a day earlier, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union. Mr. Sondland is a wealthy Republican donor with no diplomatic experience before his 2018 appointment to the plum post in Brussels.
Here are some key points from Thursday's testimony.
Hill differentiated between a 'domestic political errand' and 'national security foreign policy.'
Responding to questions from Republicans, Dr. Hill explained the crux of the issue at the heart of the impeachment inquiry -- the United States had two separate agendas operating in Ukraine, yet those involved in each viewed theirs was the only one.
Dr. Hill said she and other career foreign policy officials were frustrated with what Mr. Sondland was doing outside the normal channels of interagency coordination.
Hill: "What I was angry about was that he wasn't coordinating with us. I've actually realized, having listened to his deposition, that he was absolutely right. That he wasn't coordinating with us because we weren't doing the same thing that he was doing. So I was upset with him, that he wasn't fully telling us about all of the meetings that he was having. And he said to me 'But I'm briefing the president. I'm briefing Chief of Staff Mulvaney. I'm briefing Secretary Pompeo, and I've talked to Ambassador Bolton. Who else do I have to deal with? And the point is that we have a robust interagency process that deals with Ukraine. It includes Mr. Holmes, it includes Ambassador Taylor as the chargé in Ukraine, it includes a whole load of other people. But it struck me when yesterday, when you put up on the screen Ambassador Sondland's emails, and who was on these emails? These were the people that need to know. And he was absolutely right. Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand. And we were being involved in national security foreign policy, and those two things had just diverged."
Dr. Hill thought Mr. Sondland's goal of getting President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Trump's political rivals was trivial and contrary to longstanding efforts regarding Ukraine.
On Wednesday, Mr. Sondland told lawmakers that he did not understand how there could be an irregular back channel when his channel included the president of the United States, members of the president's cabinet and the national security adviser.
"I don't know how they can consider us to be the irregular channel and they to be the regular channel when it's the leadership that makes the decisions," Mr. Sondland said.
During an intense exchange with Mr. Sondland at the time, Dr. Hill said she told him, "This is all going to blow up." She added, "And here we are."
Holmes described in detail an unusual lunch in which he overheard Sondland's phone call with Trump.
Holmes: "This was a very distinctive experience. I've never seen anything like this in my foreign service career, someone at a lunch in a restaurant making a call on a cellphone to the president of the United States, being able to hear his voice, very distinctive personality."
Mr. Holmes provided more details on Thursday about the now infamous lunch he had with Mr. Sondland and two other State Department staffers on July 26 in Kyiv. It was at this lunch that Mr. Holmes overheard a phone call between Mr. Sondland and Mr. Trump -- one in which Mr. Trump asked Mr. Sondland if the Ukrainian president planned "to do the investigation."
Mr. Holmes described a relaxed setting at an outdoor terrace with the weather that day in the upper 70s. Mr. Sondland ordered a bottle of wine, he said, which the four of them shared, and discussed marketing strategies for Mr. Sondland's boutique hotel business.
The additional details add more credibility to Mr. Holmes's recollection, which Republicans have tried to diminish. Mr. Sondland on Wednesday told lawmakers that he did not remember all of the details of that conversation with Mr. Trump, but he agreed that a friendly comment recalled by Mr. Holmes -- Mr. Sondland telling the president that Mr. Zelensky "loves your ass" -- sounded like something he would say.
Mr. Trump on Thursday said that what Mr. Holmes described -- a conversation that was not on speaker phone but could still be overheard -- was virtually impossible.
Things started to change at the American Embassy in Ukraine in March.
Holmes: "Specifically, the three priorities of security, economy, and justice, and our support for Ukrainian democratic resistance to Russian aggression, became overshadowed by a political agenda promoted by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House."
Mr. Holmes described what other witnesses have depicted -- that the sudden involvement of President Trump's private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, in foreign policy involving Ukraine was disruptive and damaging to the American goal of helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia. While Mr. Holmes described how the Giuliani-led campaign evolved starting in March, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the ranking member on the House Intelligence committee, focused on one date -- July 25 -- when Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky spoke to each other by phone. That call was at the center of the whistle-blower complaint that led to the current impeachment inquiry.
Russia was behind the 2016 election interference, not Ukraine.
Hill: "Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country -- and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves."
Hill: "I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests. "
Dr. Hill bluntly stated that Russia was behind the 2016 election interference and theft of Democrats' emails. American intelligence agencies and congressional panels came to the same conclusion years ago. One of the investigations that Mr. Trump has sought Ukraine to initiate was looking into a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.
Russia is the United States' adversary, not Ukraine.
Hill: "I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine -- not Russia -- attacked us in 2016."
One of the Republican defenses for Mr. Trump's decision to place a hold on nearly $ 400 million in military aid is that the president was always suspicious of Ukraine -- and for good reason -- because of its systemic corruption. This, Republicans say, is why he wanted a commitment from Mr. Zelensky to pursue corruption investigations. Dr. Hill, in her opening remarks, attempted to shut down this and other theories, some promoted by the committee's top Republican, Mr. Nunes, who described the impeachment hearings as "bizarre" on Thursday.

Texto completo: The author and public intellectual wrestled with a new medium and a foreign language in her now restored first feature, "Duet for Cannibals," a dry comedy made in Sweden.
The 1969 New York Film Festival was the first to feature four movies directed by women and three made in Swedish. Susan Sontag's "Duet for Cannibals," which she wrote and directed, fit both categories. Given the chance to make her debut film in the land of the reigning cinematic genius Ingmar Bergman, Sontag seized the opportunity to direct in a foreign language while supplying her own English subtitles. In those days her name was synonymous with zeitgeist.
"Duet for Cannibals," digitally restored and revived at Metrograph, was trendy in other ways. While the festival blurb compared the movie to Hitchcock, its premise -- pitting a conspiratorial older couple against a naïve younger pair -- was more suggestive of Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," if not the spouse-swapping comedy, "Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice," that opened the festival.
Sontag once accused Albee of "sensationalism masking as cultural exposé." "Duet for Cannibals," which inspired ambivalent reviews in The New York Times and contentious letters to the editor, is open to the same characterization although it is more of a social critique rendered fashionably lurid. For all its psychosexual shenanigans, the movie -- shot in mid-1968, several months after Sontag returned from a trip to Hanoi -- does have a political point, dramatizing the failure of revolution in the light of the so-called generation gap.
Arthur Bauer (Lars Ekborg, the male lead in Ingmar Bergman's "Summer With Monika"), plays a self-important but now inconsequential political exile who is pitted against the earnest student radical, Tomas (Gosta Ekman). Bauer, an armchair revolutionary whose talisman is an outsized cigarette lighter he claims to be a gift from Bertolt Brecht, hires Tomas to organize his papers. The relationship takes an Oedipal turn when Bauer tasks his assistant with babysitting his beautiful younger wife, Francesca, (the Italian actress Adriana Asti, the star of Bernardo Bertolucci's "Before the Revolution," a movie Sontag admired).
Francesca greets Tomas by hurling a book through the window of her husband's study; after the three sit down to dinner, Bauer begins retching. Some might take these antics as a red light but, much to the displeasure of his girlfriend, Ingrid (Agneta Ekmanner), Tomas moves in with the Bauers. "You can't quit," Bauer tells Tomas after further craziness, "it's all a game." And so it is -- an ensemble film in which the director is cut off from the cast and crew by language.
The humor is dry bordering on arid. Many of the film's twists and turns, with Ingrid arriving to square the triangle, feel intentionally ludicrous. Bauer is a certified lunatic and the other characters are wildly schematic: Ingrid's whiny jealousy is as predictable as Tomas's dogged ambition to supplant Bauer. Francesca is a garden-variety femme fatale, yet the movie's most compelling figure. (A dual portrait of Sontag and Asti, perhaps taken during the production, has them leaning together to stare down the camera like a pair of hippie goddesses.)
Ultimately, there is only one character's psychology that matters. "I don't feel this film is necessary," Sontag told the filmmaker Jonas Mekas who interviewed her for The Village Voice. "This film exists because I always wanted to make films." "Duet for Cannibals" is a triumph for auteurism -- less interesting as a movie than as a movie written and directed by Susan Sontag.

Texto completo: A House committee and prosecutors in Manhattan have subpoenaed the records.
WASHINGTON -- In a pair of filings on Thursday, a House committee and Manhattan prosecutors urged the Supreme Court to clear the way for disclosure of President Trump's financial records.
The filings concerned subpoenas in separate cases to Mr. Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA. Federal appeals courts have refused to block the subpoenas, and the firm has indicated that it will provide the requested records unless the Supreme Court orders it to withhold them.
In one Supreme Court brief, the House Oversight and Reform Committee opposed an emergency application from Mr. Trump to block a subpoena seeking his financial records while the court decides whether to hear his appeal.
"Each day of delay," the brief said, "harms Congress by depriving it of important information it needs to carry out its constitutional responsibilities."
Mr. Trump's application, filed last week, sought a stay of a ruling in October by a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejecting the president's argument that the subpoena was improper because the committee had no valid legislative purpose for seeking the information. "Having considered the weighty interests at stake in this case, we conclude that the subpoena issued by the committee to Mazars is valid and enforceable," Judge David S. Tatel wrote for the majority.
Responding to Mr. Trump's request in Thursday's filing, lawyers for the committee said its inquiries were driven by its legislative and oversight responsibilities.
"Among other issues," the brief said, "the committee is investigating whether senior government officials, including the president, are acting in the country's best interest and not in their own financial interest, whether federal agencies are operating free from financial conflicts and with accurate information, and whether any legislative reforms are needed to ensure that these fundamental principles are respected."
When the subpoena was issued in April, the House had not yet voted to pursue an impeachment inquiry. Now that it has, the brief said, the "rapidly advancing impeachment inquiry also makes it particularly important that Congress not be deprived of the information sought by the subpoena."
"It matters little," the brief said, "that the committee did not originally seek the information in question pursuant to the House's impeachment power. Now that the House is exercising its grave constitutional responsibilities under that power, it should be fully informed with all the information to which it is entitled -- including information it had previously sought for legislative purposes."
On Monday, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued a temporary stay to give the court time to consider Mr. Trump's application for a longer one. Should the Supreme Court deny the application in the case, Trump v. Mazars USA, No. 19A545, the accounting firm would be required to provide the requested records.
If the Supreme Court grants the application and issues a stay, the committee's lawyers wrote, it should require Mr. Trump's lawyers to file a petition seeking review of the appeals court's ruling by Dec. 2. That would allow the court to announce whether it will hear the case in the coming weeks and to render a decision by June.
The second Supreme Court filing on Thursday concerned a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, for eight years of Mr. Trump's personal and business tax returns.
The subpoena sought information concerning the reimbursements made to the president's former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the relationship.
A unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, ruled this month against Mr. Trump. The court, in a focused ruling, said state prosecutors may require third parties to turn over a sitting president's financial records for use in a grand jury investigation.
The New York case is further along at the Supreme Court, and involves more ambitious legal arguments. Mr. Trump's lawyers, in a petition seeking review of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's decision, said he is immune from criminal investigation while he remains in office.
Even if some federal investigations may be proper, the petition went on, the Supreme Court should rule that state and local prosecutors may not seek information about a sitting president's conduct.
"That the Constitution would empower thousands of state and local prosecutors to embroil the president in criminal proceedings is unimaginable," Mr. Trump's lawyers wrote.
In a brief urging the justices to deny review, Mr. Vance said the appeals court's ruling was narrow and "plainly correct." He added that it should make no difference that the subpoena came from state rather than federal authorities.
"If anything," he wrote, "ordinary principles of federalism make this an easier case."
Mr. Vance noted that the Supreme Court unanimously rejected claims of immunity in cases involving President Richard M. Nixon in United States v. Nixon in 1974 and President Bill Clinton in Clinton v. Jones in 1997.
Mr. Trump tweeted about the New York case Thursday morning. "Now the Witch Hunt continues with local New York Democrat prosecutors going over every financial deal I have ever done," he wrote. "This has never happened to a President before. What they are doing is not legal. But I'm clean, and when I release my financial statement (my decision) sometime prior to Election, it will only show one thing -- that I am much richer than people even thought."
The Supreme Court could announce whether it will hear the New York case, Trump v. Vance, No. 19-635, in the coming weeks. If it does, its ruling would probably land in June in the final months of the presidential campaign.

IT WAS AROUND 3:20 P.M. on Dec. 6, 2018. I had been at the New York University Student Life Center since 2:30, anticipating and preparing for a sizable crowd of Jewish students coming to witness the impending student government session.
As I looked around, there were more and more students surrounding me wearing blue and white; we were huddled outside of the room where the vote was about to take place. I was distributing Israel-related stickers to students standing around when I heard them.
"How do you spell justice? BDS! How do you spell racist? NYU!" A scared freshman next to me hesitantly asked what was going on.
"Sounds like they're respelling words," a fellow Jewish student leader answered. It was nice to find some laughter in all of this.
The American Jewish community knows for the most part what has been happening on the front lines on college campuses regarding Israeli politics. The BDS movement - the boycotting, divestment and sanctioning of Israel - is gaining traction on campuses all over the country. But what you might not know is how it feels to see the look of utter shock and contempt from people you thought were friends spotting you out of context across a room and realizing you're "one of them."
This is more than a debate over Israeli politics: This is Jewish politics, and it's personal.
For those who keep up with Israel news on college campuses, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. If you don't: When the student government at NYU or a similar institution proposes a resolution entitled "The Resolution for Palestinian Human Rights," they have a specific agenda with a clear desired outcome.
Although the resolution didn't include BDS in the title, it mentioned BDS more than 10 times. They weren't trying to fool anyone - except the media that published articles sharing the resolution's positive-sounding title, while omitting important details.
Details like the fact that 70-plus Jewish students weren't even allowed to step foot into the voting room to share their voices and that the few students eventually let it in got less than half the amount of speaking time as the student senators who wrote the resolution. Did I mention that those student senators rewrote the rules to ensure that their resolution would pass?
We were able to make enough of a fuss to extend the meeting by more than an hour, but they finally announced the results after counting the votes via secret ballot - the first time the NYU student government ever used a secret ballot because the senators were apparently too scared to publicly share how they felt about the issue.
Fourteen voted against, 14 abstained and 33 voted in favor of the resolution. This was better than we expected, but there was no time to put a positive spin on things.
The Jewish students in the room and the ones waiting outside in solidarity started singing "Od Yavo Shalom Aleinu" and waving Israeli flags. Tears started streaming down my face as we walked, united, out of the room. But I wasn't crying because we had inevitably lost; I was crying because my friends and I were publicly laughed at, stepped on and robbed of our voice.
As we walked out, singing a song about peace and hope for the future, we heard a bullhorn in the background saying, "The revolution still isn't won! The revolution still isn't won!"
I wondered to myself, when will it be enough? Will they ever be satisfied? Despite everything, we persevered, as we always do. We went back to our Hillel and lit Chanukah candles and took pride and comfort in our community - and turned to writing strongly worded op-eds for the New York Times and angry emails to our administration.
In the end, all of this is really a story about Israel, and about the continuous connection the Jewish people have with Israel even amid such hostility.
The large number of Jewish students who showed up are just a small fraction of the Jews that go to NYU, and that is just a small fraction of Jews around the world who care deeply about the right of Israel to exist.
Although many in the Jewish community disagree about Israeli politics, we have stood together in times of need or when faced with an existential threat. Most Jews I know - from all political sides - agree that Israel has the right to exist.
However, with the NYU student government vote and similar incidents elsewhere, this support that we have taken for granted is starting to waver. There are groups of Jewish students who actively support the BDS movement, like the members of JVP, Jewish Voices for Peace. I see signs and posters that put Zionism in the same category as racism or sexism. There's no interest in nuance, and there's no middle ground.
When was the last time you visited Israel? I've been there three times in the past year and a half. I spent the summer there in Tel Aviv, interning in Yafo at an Arab/Israeli day care for babies with developmental disabilities. I witnessed firsthand Arabs and Israelis living and working together, getting along, building families, trying to stay safe and building a better future. How come they can get along, but Jews at NYU can't?
Coming back to campus this year, hearing the various claims about what's going on in Israel right now, I would have thought they were talking about a different country. I can't believe my student government is arguing over the clauses and language of a BDS resolution. It simply doesn't understand the reality of what's actually going on in Israel.
Sadly, I'm starting to see this polarization not just on college campuses, but in society at large. How can we change this conversation? It's important to understand history, and we must pay attention to and care about what's happening today. It's important to be able to criticize Israel when warranted.
Advocacy doesn't mean unconditional love, but given our community's sense of connection, passion for intellectual thought and powerful history, it does mean unconditional support for our Jewish state. *

Ambassador Sondland's slick move

Texto completo: By many accounts, Gordon Sondland delivered the most consequential testimony of the House Democrats' rushed public impeachment proceedings. Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified in the impeachment hearings Wednesday. He grabbed headlines with a carefully worded opening statement that said:
I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a "quid pro quo?" As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.
Media reaction was instantaneous. Here was a key participant confirming a quid pro quo in the Ukraine affair, something President Trump has long denied. Sondland's statement, many reports said, was a "bombshell." A "blockbuster."
Now, with a little hindsight, Sondland's words appear to be something very different: an attention-grabbing and enormously clever gambit to get Sondland out of a jam in which he might have been accused of lying to Congress.
Here's what happened:
Another witness, William Taylor, who is the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, gave a deposition to the committee on Oct. 22 and testified publicly on Nov. 13. At his public testimony, Taylor said he had learned something since his deposition that he believed he needed to tell the committee. On July 26, Taylor said, the day after President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the heart of the impeachment proceedings, a member of Taylor's staff in Kyiv overheard a phone conversation between Sondland and Trump. According to the staffer, Trump asked Sondland about "the investigations," and Sondland replied that the Ukrainians were "ready to move forward."
As Taylor spoke, members of the committee instantly recalled that Sondland had given a deposition to the committee on Oct. 17 and had not said a word about that conversation with the president. On top of that, Sondland had already had to amend his deposition in light of other testimony. At his deposition, Sondland said he "never" thought Trump had attached any precondition to United States aid to Ukraine. Then, after others testified that Sondland had in fact told Ukrainian officials that there was such a precondition, Sondland submitted a long, written revision of his deposition.
By that time, Sondland's credibility was a big question mark. "After today, Mr. Sondland is going to have some explaining to do," Democratic Intelligence Committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi said after the Taylor testimony. "Sondland lied under oath to Congress," said Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego. "He clearly lied to the committee," one anonymous Democratic representative told the Hill. "They should pursue charges against him."
The Los Angeles Times published a story headlined, "Is Gordon Sondland credible enough to be a good impeachment witness for either side?" The New York Times ran a similar story with the headline, "Why Discrepancies in Gordon Sondland's Testimony in the Impeachment Inquiry Loom Large." MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell said, "William Taylor now is essentially saying Gordon Sondland lied under oath to Congress."
So, when Sondland entered the hearing room Wednesday, he had, as Krishnamoorthi said, a lot of explaining to do. So, what did he do? He didn't explain at all. Instead, he produced the biggest, shiniest object he could find: a brand new allegation that there was indeed a quid pro quo at the heart of the Trump-Ukraine affair. "Was there a quid pro quo?" he asked. "Yes."
There was more. "Everyone was in the loop," Sondland said. "It was no secret." Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, they were all involved.
It was great stuff. A bombshell! In an instant, the talk about Sondland lying to Congress vanished. Democrats were absolutely delighted that Sondland, once thought to be a witness friendly to the president, had given them so much good material. The media coverage went along. Sondland's testimony was damning, it was devastating, and, of course, it was a "turning point" in the impeachment proceedings.
Except it wasn't. Less than an hour after Sondland delivered his opening statement, the whole thing began to fall apart. It started with ostensibly friendly questioning from Intelligence Committee Chairman and impeachment leader Adam Schiff.
"You've testified that your understanding, it became a clear understanding, that the military assistance was also being withheld pending Zelensky announcing these investigations, correct?" Schiff said to Sondland.
"That was my presumption," Sondland said. "My personal presumption based on the facts at the time. Nothing was moving."
"And, in fact, you had a discussion, a communication with the secretary of state in which you said that logjam over aid could be lifted if Zelensky announced these investigations, right?" Schiff said.
"I did not recall saying the logjam over aid," Sondland responded. "I recall saying the logjam. I don't know that — "
"That's what you meant, right, ambassador?" Schiff said.
"I — I — I meant that whatever was holding up the meeting, whatever was holding up our deal with Ukraine, I was trying to break," Sondland said. "Again, I was presuming."
Later, Republican lawyer Steve Castor asked Sondland, "I want to turn back to your [inaudible] would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations, correct?"
"Correct," said Sondland.
"And you acknowledge that this is speculation, right?"
"It was a presumption," said Sondland.
As the hearing dragged on, Sondland's admissions of presumption multiplied.
"I made the presumption ... "
"I presumed it ... "
"Again, that was my presumption ... "
"I've been very clear as to when I was presuming, and I was presuming ... "
And more. Much more.
Republicans got the message. "Ambassador Sondland, you honestly have used the words 'presumed,' 'presumption,' 'presuming,' some form of the verb 'to presume' repeatedly today," said GOP Rep. Brad Wenstrup. Referring to an earlier moment when Sondland agreed that he had reached a "two plus two equals four" conclusion, Wenstrup continued: "You see, in mathematics, two plus two does equal four. But in reality, two presumptions plus two presumptions does not equal even one fact."
Finally, another Republican lawmaker, Mike Turner, hammered the message home. "Is that your testimony today ... that you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation to aid?" Turner said. "Because I don't think you're saying that."
"I've said repeatedly, congressman, I was presuming," Sondland said.
"So, no one told you," Turner said. "Not just the president. Giuliani didn't tell you, Mulvaney didn't tell you, nobody — Pompeo didn't tell you, nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations, is that correct ... No one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations. Yes or no?"
"Yes," said Sondland.
"So, you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations?"
"Other than my own presumption," said Sondland.
By that point, Sondland's quid pro quo offering was in tatters. But it didn't really matter, at least from a media standpoint. The notion that Sondland's testimony was a bombshell quickly hardened into conventional wisdom. "There's no question that Gordon Sondland's blockbuster testimony is still sending shock waves through Washington," ABC News reported. Amid all the talk of damning testimony, Democrats seemed to forget their doubts about Sondland's credibility. Ambassador Sondland had delivered, big time.

GOP chairman: Biden fumbling opens door to Buttigieg, who Trump will beat 'big'

Texto completo: On Thursday, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee expressed surprise at former Vice President Joe Biden’s fumbling at the Wednesday Democratic presidential debate and said it shows that he is fading.
“I thought Joe Biden struggled with some questions, continually to fumble,” said Ronna McDaniel.
“I thought some of his answers were troublesome. Just in the delivery, it is interesting to see he really struggles to finish a response, and I think that’s something that — I imagine him next to the president if he ends up being the nominee, and I just think the president is going to come at him,” she said at a media breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.
“Biden doesn’t seem to be very succinct or able to complete his answers and kind of fumbles through,” she added.
Many pundits panned Biden’s performance, the latest in which he failed to land big blows and appeared disinterested at times.
McDaniel, who has led the RNC in historic fundraising and who has strong support from President Trump, also noted that the recent rise of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg suggests that the Democratic field is still in flux.
“It shows that Biden has faded,” she said of Buttigieg’s emergence as the front-runner in Iowa, the state that will hold America's first presidential contest next year.
She added that it also shows Sen. Elizabeth Warren is fading.
But she added that the White House is not afraid of Buttigieg.
“This is not somebody who is a moderate. Just because he comes from South Bend, doesn’t make him that,” she said of the candidate’s effort to appear a middle-of-the-road candidate.
And she predicted a Trump victory over Buttigieg. “I think the president wins. Big. I think he wins big,” said McDaniel.

Texto completo: A recent poll indicates Americans are frustrated with today's multitude of sources of information and the many interpretations put on the facts they find.

The poll, from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts, found that 47 percent of Americans surveyed said they find it somewhat to very difficult to know if the information they are receiving is true or false. About 6 in 10 say they often run into conflicting reports about the same set of facts from different sources.

The most depressing consequence of this state of affairs is the temptation it provides to decide it is or might be impossible to find accurate information about matters we care about and simply give up.

Matt Stanley, a school administrator and registered Democrat from West Virginia, summed up this danger well.

The social media, it muddies up stuff so badly, Mr. Stanley, 50, told the New York Times. There's so much information that's biased, that no one believes anything. There is so much out there and you don't know what to believe, so it's like there's nothing.

The belief that there is no shared set of facts reinforces the direction of our politics toward polarization: Choosing a side and believing whatever interpretation our side is putting on the latest controversy or policy proposal.

This is a dangerous reaction to a situation driven by the realities of an information-rich age. Thanks to the Internet, of course there are now more sources of information than ever before.

Human nature being what it is, naturally some will attempt put spins on the facts or mix facts with assumptions or lies to advance their own agendas. None of that is any excuse for not working to separate fact from fiction and vote and act on the best information we as citizens can find.

As Thomas Jefferson said in a letter to Richard Price, a philosopher of the 18th Century, wherever the people are well informed they can be trusted with their own government.

Our nation's survival and success depend to a great degree on each citizen's success in maneuvering what is an admittedly difficult struggle these days: Figuring out which sources are most informative, which facts matter most, and doing our best to vote and act on what we find.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — As another long day of public impeachment inquiry testimony on Thursday wore on, attention turned to one figure who expounded on the greater importance of the subject matter at hand: protecting American democracy.
Dr. Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, delivered punchy lines of testimony and asserted her position as a witness in the inquiry who would present facts exactly as she knew them to be, persistent in the face of accusations of partisanship.
Hill rebutted the Republican theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U. S. election and answered questions about the pressure campaign President Donald Trump is accused of levying against the nation.
Testifying alongside David Holmes, a State Department official in the U. S. embassy in Ukraine, Hill at times used her platform to explain her ideals of U. S. foreign policy and democracy.
Takeaways from Fiona Hill, David Holmes testimonies: Ukraine viewed White House meeting as 'critical' and other takeaways
She stated that it is in the best interest of both political parties to protect that democracy from the threats of Russian interference.
"Right now Russian security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election," Hill said. "We are running out of time to stop them. "
She expressed the frustration of her role as a nonpartisan State Department official who had observed an unusual process of diplomacy unfold between U. S. officials and Ukraine.
"There was, let's just say, a different channel in operation in relations to Ukraine, one that was domestic and political in nature. . . " Hill said.
Withstanding accusations and threats
Hill told lawmakers about the threats and attacks she has faced and expressed sympathy with GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York whom Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, said had been the subject of "vile" attacks in recent days.
Hill testified that she was the target of false accusations while serving in the Trump administration in 2017. She said she received hateful calls and death threats at her home and was accused of being a "mole" in the White House.
Hill also said over the last couple of days her staff is "constantly having to block Twitter posts" which include her name and address. "I guess, unfortunately, where we are today in America, that's coming with the territory," she said of receiving hateful calls and threats.
Hill said partisan attacks on Americans are exactly what foreign adversaries would like to exploit.
Hill's pigtails on fire
As in her previous closed-door testimony, Hill's wit and humor were on full display Thursday. And her display of resilience did not go unmissed by viewers.
A profile published about Hill in The New York Times and shared widely Thursday recounted the story of when Hill was 11 years old and a boy set fire to her hair in the middle of a test. She confirmed at the hearing that she put the fire out with her hands and resumed her test.
"It had some very unfortunate consequences. Afterwards, my mother gave me a bowl haircut," Hill said to laughter in the room.
"I think it underscores the fact that you speak truth, that you are steely, and I truly respect that," said Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif.
'Fictional narrative': Fiona Hill outlines 'fictional narrative' in impeachment hearing
On foreign policy priorities—and women's anger
In her October closed-door testimony, Hill described European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland's conduct in Ukraine as "comical" but "deeply concerning" because of what she described as haphazard dealings with officials, opening up a counterintelligence risk.
On Thursday, Hill explained her final confrontation with Sondland was a difference over their priorities between domestic and foreign-affairs purposes, under questioning from Republican staff lawyer Steve Castor. As they sat down with two others during her final week in July, Hill said she was upset because of their different priorities.
“I was very much upset,” Hill said. “I, unfortunately, had a bit of a blow-up with Ambassador Sondland. ”
Hill said after listening to Sondland’s testimony Wednesday that she realized why they weren’t cooperating. Sondland was meeting with Trump, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to urge Ukraine to investigate whether energy company Burisma meddled in the 2016 election. But Hill said the National Security Council was working on foreign affairs rather than domestic politics.
“When he wasn’t cooperating, it was because we weren’t doing the same thing that he was doing,” Hill said. “It struck me he was absolutely right because he was being involved in a domestic political errand. And we were involved in national security foreign policy. And those two things had just diverged. "
It was that encounter Hill had with Sondland that led her to give a message that resonated deeply with women listening.
"I was actually, to be honest, angry with him, and you know, I hate to say it, but often when women show anger it's not fully appreciated," Hill said.
"It's often, you know, pushed onto emotional issues, perhaps, or deflected onto other people. "
And after Turner used his allocated questioning time to explain Republicans' defense against the impeachment of Trump and describing Hill's testimony as "hearsay," a Democratic congressman accused him of "mansplaining. "
“Dr. Hill, first of all, I thought that was some epic mansplaining that you were forced to endure by my colleague Mr. Turner, and I want you to know some of us think it was inappropriate,” Rep. Sean Maloney of New York said.
Never Trumper: 'It was a puzzling term'
Democrats asked Hill if she is a "Never Trumper," a term Trump and other Republicans have applied to some officials who have testified in an attempt to undermine the hearings. Hill said she wasn't sure what the definition of that term even is.
"It was a puzzling term to be applied to career or nonpartisan officials," she said.
Hill said that it was her choice to join the Trump administration. "I could easily have said no when I was approached. "
She also said that attacks on officials should not become a new normal.
And she also defended Trump, saying that there should not be an effort to influence elections.
"I think it was unfair for people to already called the election and to make attacks also on candidate Trump and on President Trump," Hill said. "And I know that this has put a huge cloud over this presidency and also over our whole democratic system.
"That's actually why as a nonpartisan person and as an expert on Russia, and an expert on Vladimir Putin and on the Russian security services, I wanted to come in to serve the country to try to see if I could help. "
"I take great pride in the fact that I am a nonpartisan foreign policy expert who has served under three Republican and Democratic presidents," Hill said in her opening statement. "I have no interest in advancing the outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction except toward the truth. "

Texto completo: Back in October, it was rumored that there could be some drastic changes coming to the world of professional baseball when reports surfaced that the MLB proposed to cut ties with 42 of its minor league teams after the 2020 season.
At the time, no minor league teams were named. That changed over the weekend when a New York Times report released the extensive list of teams that are on the chopping block, putting a face to the harsh reality that more than three dozen cities across the United States could lose their minor league team, and thousands of players could end up unemployed.
Three Pennsylvania teams are on that list to possibly lose their MLB affiliation. Those teams are the Eastern League's Erie SeaWolves, a AA affiliate of the Detroit Tigers; the New York-Penn League's State College Spikes, a single-A St. Louis Cardinals affiliate, and the Williamsport Crosscutters, a single-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies.
The MLB believes the cuts are necessary to improve facilities and make the minor leagues more efficient, according to reports from the Times. But the three teams at risk in Pennsylvania arguably shouldn't have problems with their facilities.
The SeaWolves, who play out of UPMC Park in downtown Erie, installed a brand new baseball field last year along with two "state-of-the art" video boards, according to team president Greg Coleman. The stadium is also currently making $12 million worth of renovations this off-season, which includes the installation of climate-controlled batting cages.
The Spikes have played in State College since 2006. They play homes games and are tenants of Penn State's Medlar Field at Lubrano Park, which is owned by the university and shared by the Nittany Lions baseball program. The field is the newest addition to the minor league scene and has a capacity of 5,406.
The team brought in 119,120 fans in 2019 with an average of 3,219 per game, which was fourth among teams in the New York-Penn League.
The Crosscutters' stadium, BB&T Park, has played host to MLB teams for the annual Little League Classic since 2017. The game, held during the Little League World Series in Williamsport and entering its fourth year, will pit the Boston Red Sox against the Baltimore Orioles in 2020.
Is this really a 'death sentence'? The Times reported that cuts could be a "death sentence" for these teams. The loss of major-league affiliation could significantly diminish a team's value in the community and derail players' career-goals or employment opportunities.
Gov. Tom Wolf said he is hopeful that any final decisions made on this proposal will only be made after consulting with local representatives about any impacts to the local economies.
"Pennsylvania's professional baseball affiliates help provide affordable family-friendly entertainment and improve the quality of life in each of their communities," Wolf said in a statement to the York Daily Record Monday night. "I strongly urge the MLB to keep its commitments to local fans, which helps ensure future generations of fans for the sport."
Erie team 'helps keep the downtown vibrant' Erie SeaWolves President Greg Coleman said it's too early to view the proposal as anything more than preliminary conversations between the major and minor leagues.
The team was founded in 1989 and has been playing in Erie since 1995. They were previously an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1995 to 1998, and the Anaheim Angels from 1999 to 2000, but have been reaffiliated with the Tigers for the past 18 years.
Coleman said he doesn't anticipate the news affecting the $12 million in renovations underway at UPMC Park.
"We haven't seen the overall plan. It's a proposal," Coleman said. "We aren't going to stop work on a plan we've been executing for 5 years because of a proposal we heard about a few weeks ago."
Mayor Joe Schember said major league affiliation or not, it's important for the Erie community to have a baseball team.
Having the SeaWolves stadium located in downtown Erie, has been a positive contribution to the local economy — "it helps keep the downtown vibrant," Schember said.
"To use a baseball saying — it's very early in the first inning. And it's been an exciting first inning, but it's the first inning," Coleman said. "We've got a long way to go before it's the bottom of the ninth."
State College Spikes attract residents, visitors Spikes communications director Joe Putnam did not return a phone call seeking comment Monday. He declined comment to multiple media outlets based in State College.
The Spikes previously were an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 2007 to 2012 but have been reaffiliated with the Cardinals for the past seven years.
Minor League Baseball and State College mayor Donald Hahn also did not respond to requests for comment.
Fritz Smith, the president and CEO for Happy Valley Adventure Bureau, said he is "very hopeful that this scenario does not come to pass." Happy Valley Adventure Bureau is a nonprofit that works to develop "economic activity and quality of life" in Centre County and State College.
"The Spikes are an important part of our community," Smith said in an emailed statement. "They offer a family friendly, affordable activity. We believe that Centre County, with a growing resident base, alongside a growing visitor base, merits having a minor league franchise."
Williamsport Crosscutters Thus far, the Williamsport Crosscutters also seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the reports, telling fans "nothing has or will be decided in this process for a very long time" in a statement released on social media.
"Further to that, as MLB has stated publicly, their main concerns are around facility standards and significant distance of some clubs from their affiliates (neither of which apply to the Crosscutters) so this is just a natural process of negotiation on behalf of all 160 Minor League baseball teams," reads the organization's statement.
The Crosscutters also confirmed the club will continue serving as a Phillies affiliate for the 2020 season and says meetings are planned to discuss extending that agreement.

Hagerstown Suns are in danger of elimination

Texto completo: Maryland may lose two longtime minor league baseball franchises if a massive Major League Baseball proposal goes forward.
The Frederick Keys and Hagerstown Suns would be two of 42 teams that would have ties severed with MLB under a new plan to streamline its minor league system for efficiency and to improve conditions for players, according to a New York Times report. Major and Minor League Baseball's current Professional Baseball Agreement is set to expire after the 2020 season, an agreement that assures that there will be 160 minor league teams.
The proposal would drop that number down to 118 teams.
Officials from the Suns and Keys were contacted Monday morning but were unable to comment on the situation. Delmarva Now was referred to MiLB Senior Director of Communications Jeff Lantz.
Lantz said the proposal was the first presented to Minor League Baseball and the sides will meet in upcoming weeks to negotiate a plan that would "save as many teams" as possible.
"From what we gathered from the MLB, they did a poll of which ballparks were better, which needed a lot of work and came up with a mass list," he said. "What exactly it is about Frederick or Hagerstown that got them put on that list, we're not sure."
Overall, among the proposed changes are plans to sever ties with 42 minor league teams, close to a quarter of the minor league teams under the current contract; and to shift the baseball draft from June to August and limit the number of rounds. Under the plan, a new "Dream League" would be operated by MLB at minimal cost and provide undrafted players an opportunity to break into professional baseball.
The Suns are an affiliate of the Washington Nationals while the Keys feeds players into the Baltimore Orioles system.
The SAL could potentially have multiple teams affected by the proposal outside of Hagerstown, including the Lexington Legends and the West Virginia Power. The Legends won the South Atlantic League championship in 2019.
Lantz said an estimated 1,200 players would also lose their jobs should the proposal be approved.
"A lot would be released and have their dreams of being big-league players crushed," Lantz said. "We'll see how things shake out. Both sides want to get a deal done that benefits baseball."
However, the 2020 season is not in jeopardy and is scheduled to be played uninterrupted, he said.
A lot of Maryland baseball history threatened Historic Municipal Stadium, the home of the Suns, is one of the third oldest stadiums in Minor League Baseball. After renewing their contract with the Nationals, the Suns underwent several renovations, which included a new infield, updated outfield wall padding, protective netting around both dugouts, new bathrooms for fans and environmentally-friendly LED lighting throughout Municipal Stadium after the 2016 season.
The Suns have been an affiliate of the Nationals since 2007, also partnering with the Orioles, Detroit Tigers, Toronto Blue Jays, San Francisco Giants and New York Mets throughout their existence. Famous players include the Nationals' Ryan Zimmerman and former NL MVP Bryce Harper.
Founded in 1989, the Keys play in the Carolina League, last won a division title in 2011 and have fielded players over the years such as former Orioles Nick Markakis and Manny Machado.
The organization underwent minor upgrades to Nymeo Field at Harry Grove Stadium last season, which included extended ballpark netting, the addition of a local craft brewery stand and a new warning track.
The Suns, Keys and the Delmarva Shorebirds, which is not part of the proposal, make up half of the minor league baseball franchises in Maryland. The Bowie Baysox and Aberdeen Ironbirds have ties to the Orioles, while the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs play with the non-MiLB connected Independent League.
"This is where people gather in the summer time, and it'd be very unfortunate to lose baseball in any of these communities," Lantz said. "Our communications team is looking to keep baseball in all 160 markets."
Reaction to list of targeted teams Hagerstown is in the process of building an entirely new stadium.
The town has completed a phase one market feasibility and site selection study. It has also funded and is now beginning a phase two study which is a deep look into the geology and geography of the site. So far, it has poured about $36,000 on initial study and phase two study will cost about $300,000.
Dan Speddan, president of Visit Hagerstown, the Hagerstown Visitor Center, said even if the team's facility is not the most updated, the potential impact to the loss of the Suns is major.
"Even at that, they are the number one tourist attraction to the city of Hagerstown," he said. "If we lose the Suns, it's about a $3.5 million to $5 million negative economic impact."
The new proposal threatens not only stadium funding, but the growth of the Washington County town.
"Talk of contraction could be damaging to our stadium effort if we don't come up with good contingency plans ..." Speddan said. "We plan to go forward with this but we're going to make sure we have a contingency plan so if things go bad with minor league baseball we still have a presence, a tenant, you know, and we still have a really good entertainment venue in our downtown."
Speddan also mentioned the jobs that could be lost as well.
"There would be about six career positions lost and probably 45 to 55 summer jobs that would just disappear," he said.
"This was the catalyst project that was going to turn our city's core around," he said. "So you can see what we would lose if this all came to a halt. It's not just baseball and summer jobs and the economy, but entire downtown revitalization depends on this ballpark development."
Fans took to social media on Monday to express their displeasure with the proposal and the potential fate of the Keys and Suns.
A Twitter user with the handle @kjshay44 wrote, "Watching the Frederick Keys and Hagerstown Suns are great experiences. You get closer to the action. You see rising stars. Those towns love these teams. Don't do this (MLB)..."
Another user named Michael Schneider wrote, "The Keys have led the (Carolina League) in attendance 7 out of the last 8 years. Many hard working people will lose their job. Having a minor league team is a big part of Frederick."
"If (the) MLB is successful in its minor league proposal and kills off the Frederick Keys, I will never again watch a MLB game....," wrote Harvey Morrell.
Victoria E. Freile of the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle contributed to this report.

Texto completo: A prominent arts center in Beijing has canceled a ChineseAmerican artist's exhibition of works with strong social and historical themes after the local authorities declined to issue the necessary import permits. The cancellation comes amid a growing clampdown on civil society and rising tensions between China and the United States.
China's censorship review process is notoriously opaque, and there was no official reason given for withholding the permits. In a letter to lenders of the works announcing the cancellation, Philip Tinari, director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, said that after months of back and forth with the local cultural authorities, the gallery was suddenly informed this month that the approvals would not be coming.
"Topics that were once relatively open for discussion are now increasingly scrutinized," Tinari wrote in the letter, which was seen by The New York Times. "An exhibition that might have been greenlighted a few years ago -- such as this one -- must now be canceled."
The show, featuring the artist Hung Liu, was scheduled to open on Dec. 6. Liu, who was born in Changchun in northeast China in 1948 and moved to the United States in 1984, is known for fusing her early artistic training in socialist realism with Western influences to create paintings based on historical photographs.
Her work can be overtly political, like a series of sketches titled "Where Is Mao?" But the 30-plus paintings that had been proposed for the Beijing show focused more on questions of culture, gender, history and memory.
One work in question was "Twelve Hairpins of Jinling," above, a 2011 painting of 12 schoolgirls in uniforms wearing gas masks, which Liu said was based on a historical photograph of a World War II air raid drill.
"The message is antiwar so I thought it was O.K., but when I talked with my Chinese artist friends about it, they just said one word: Hong Kong," Liu said. Images of gas masks -- particularly as worn by students -- have become widely associated with the antigovernment protests that have convulsed Hong Kong since June and angered the authorities in Beijing.
"I was so sad and disappointed," Liu said by telephone from her home in Oakland, Calif. "Of course my work has political dimensions, but my focus is really the human faces, the human struggle, the epic journey."
The show's cancellation, first reported by The Art Newspaper, is a setback for the UCCA, which is coming off the huge success of a major exhibition of works by Pablo Picasso and its recent announcement of plans to open an outpost in Shanghai.
It is also the latest indication of how China's turn toward a more hard-nosed authoritarianism under Xi Jinping has crept into all corners of society. While censorship has been a source of frustration in China's cultural sectors for years, most knew generally where the so-called red lines were. But many now say the red lines have been moving.
Recently, the opening of the Pompidou Center in Shanghai was tainted by the revelation that the esteemed French cultural institution had agreed to censor several works in its inaugural show at the authorities' request. AMY QIN

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, delivered explosive testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday in the latest round of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry.
In his opening statement, Mr. Sondland directly implicated members of the Trump administration -- including President Trump himself -- in a pressure campaign on Ukraine to launch investigations into Mr. Trump's political rivals. Here are some key takeaways from Mr. Sondland's testimony.
Sondland: 'We followed the president's orders.'
Opening statement, Page 4: Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the President of the United States. We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani. Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the President's orders.
Mr. Sondland told the committee that Mr. Trump directed the Ukraine pressure campaign, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signed off, and that Vice President Mike Pence was told about an apparent link between Ukraine's military aid and the investigations the president desired. He confirmed that there was a "clear quid pro quo" for a White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukraine's president.
Trump's priority was that the Ukrainians had to announce that they would start the investigations, Mr. Sondland said.
Questioning by Daniel S. Goldman, the Democrats' lawyer: Q: "Now, for Mr. Giuliani by this point, you understood that in order to get that White House meeting -- that you wanted President Zelensky to have and that President Zelensky desperately wanted to have -- that Ukraine would have to initiate these two investigations. Is that right?"
A: "Well, they would have to announce that they were going to do it."
Q: "Right. Because Giuliani and President Trump didn't actually care if they did them, right?"
A: "I never heard, Mr. Goldman, anyone say that the investigations had to start or had to be completed. The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani or otherwise was that they had to be announced in some form and that form kept changing."
Mr. Sondland explained to the Democrats' chief counsel that Mr. Trump's demand on Ukraine seemed to prioritize the announcement of investigations into his rivals more than it did completing an actual investigation. As far as Mr. Trump was concerned, Ukraine's announcement that it was investigating the Bidens as part of Mr. Zelensky's anti-corruption agenda could be damaging enough.
'Everyone was in the loop': Sondland cast blame on senior administration officials.
Mr. Sondland told lawmakers about interactions with senior administration officials who have tried to keep some distance from the pressure campaign. He mentioned Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the president's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, dragging them further into the circle of people who knew about Mr. Trump's and Mr. Giuliani's Ukraine foreign policy plan.
Opening statement, Page 14-15: Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19 email. This email was sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack, who was Secretary Perry's Chief of Staff at the time, Ms. [Lisa] Kenna, who is the executive secretariat for Secretary Pompeo, Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and Mr. Mulvaney's Senior Advisor Rob Blair. A lot of senior officials. A lot of senior officials. Here is my exact quote from that email:
"I Talked to Zelensky just now... He is prepared to receive Potus' call. Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will 'turn over every stone'. He would greatly appreciate a call prior to Sunday so that he can put out some media about a 'friendly and productive call' (no details) prior to Ukraine election on Sunday." Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney responded: "I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow."
Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19, days before the Presidential call.
He also mentioned Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, testifying that he was surprised that Mr. Bolton had called him in late August to request Mr. Giuliani's contact information before a visit to Kyiv.
For the first time, Sondland described in public a 'quid pro quo' involving investigations desired by Trump.
Mr. Sondland told lawmakers that Mr. Giuliani was asking for a "quid pro quo" -- a visit to the White House for Mr. Zelensky in exchange for a "public statement" announcing corruption investigations into widely debunked theories that could benefit Mr. Trump politically.
Opening statement, Page 5: Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing the investigations of the 2016 election/DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew these investigations were important to the President.
He contradicted other witnesses, saying there was only one channel of foreign policy with Ukraine.
Opening statement, Page 4-5: We made every effort to ensure that the relevant decision makers at the National Security Council and the State Department knew the important details of our efforts. The suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false. I have now identified certain State Department emails and messages that provide contemporaneous support for my view. These emails show that the leadership of the State Department, the NSC, and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts from May 23, 2019, until the security aid was released on September 11, 2019. I will quote from some of those messages with you shortly.
Page 6: Any claim that I somehow "muscled" my way into the Ukraine relationship is simply false.
Contradicting testimonies from other witnesses, Mr. Sondland denied the idea that there was a back channel with Ukraine that was operating in the shadows of the typical foreign policy portfolio.

An Elfin Smile, a Jaunty Demeanor and Blockbuster Testimony

Texto completo: In the explosive impeachment-hearing appearance by Gordon Sondland, drama and farce were never far apart.
The explosions at the House impeachment hearings Wednesday were not the work of a mad bomber. The man deploying the bombshells seemed oddly to be enjoying himself.
The testimony of the ambassador to the European Union, Gordon D. Sondland, was deeply serious in substance: that he and his colleagues "followed the president's orders" in pressuring Ukraine to investigate Donald Trump's political rivals; that there was a "quid pro quo" expected; and that "everyone was in the loop" on the plan, including several high-level officials.
But in the Trump era, drama and farce are often inseparable. Mr. Sondland, a hotel entrepreneur who came into his position after donating a million dollars to the president's inauguration, could have been a minor character in "Succession": a wealthy megadonor anxious to avoid being tainted, yet somehow seeming to relish the spotlight.
In the Watergate hearings, John Dean (now serving as a commentator on CNN) played the part of the heavy-hearted insider testifying against his administration out of grim duty. Mr. Sondland showed up wearing the smirk of a man able to imagine himself the toast of any room -- even if that room was investigating an international scandal that he had a major role in.
Told that Tim Morrison, a national security aide, had referred to his actions as "the Gordon problem," he cringe-joked, "That's what my wife calls me. Maybe they're talking. Should I be worried?" He grinned through rounds of exasperated questioning, through recollections of a cheerfully profane phone call with the president, through the memory of buying a "V.V.I.P." ticket to the inaugural.
Mr. Sondland was the V.V.I.P. on Wednesday. But there were serious stakes, for the country and for him personally. He had already emerged as an offscreen figure in the hearings, described in phone calls and text chains, orchestrating the efforts to muscle political favors out of the Ukrainians.
He showed up in person as the defendant in the legal drama who refuses to be the fall guy. Beyond the bombshell explosions, if you listened closely, you also heard a series of clicks: Mr. Sondland handcuffing himself, one by one, to a list of officials attempting to stay out of the scandal.
More than any statement, the faces on the screen seemed to tell the story on Wednesday. Adam Schiff, given copious material to work with by Mr. Sondland, kept an intent headlight stare throughout. After the first round of Democratic questioning, the ranking minority member, Devin Nunes, appeared to be digesting a bad clam. And Mr. Sondland seemed to take the high-pressure appearance with a look of enjoyment, even impishness:
It all felt disorienting, partly because Mr. Sondland wasn't plainly as friendly or hostile a witness to the opposing parties as his predecessors. On Tuesday, for instance, Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman was hailed by Democrats, while Republicans insinuated that he was disloyal.
Mr. Sondland, on the other hand, came into the session with a statement devastating to the White House, but his answers grew cagier as the day went on.
Democratic representatives praised him as a successful child of immigrants, then pushed him for more clarity. Republicans commended him for his service, then laid into him for relying on his presumptions of the president's motives. Under blistering questioning from Jim Jordan, a Republican, and Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat, his grin melted to a grimace.
Perhaps being the V.V.I.P. was less than entirely fun.
Even President Trump, who has not hesitated to assail others for testifying against him, went back and forth on Mr. Sondland. Early Wednesday, he dismissed him as "not a man I know well." ("Easy come, easy go," the ambassador said when he heard about the remark.)
Then, after the ambassador related a phone call in which a "cranky" Mr. Trump had said "I want nothing" from Ukraine, the president met reporters to give a dramatic, self-exonerating reading of his own secondhand testimony, scrawled in Sharpie:
The president's performance omitted a lot of context: that he had made those comments the day the whistle-blower's complaint came to the intelligence committee's attention; that Mr. Sondland himself had said that the quid pro quo was widely understood among his colleagues; and that, in a hearing earlier this year -- a sort of prequel to today -- Mr. Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen testified that he had a practice of giving orders "in a code."
But Mr. Trump knows the value of a dramatic televised statement. In fact, that value was central to Wednesday's testimony. Mr. Sondland testified how important it was to Mr. Trump that the president of Ukraine publicly announce an investigation involving Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter: "He had to announce the investigations. He didn't actually have to do them."
As we now know, the whistle-blower's charges came out, the aid to Ukraine was released and the Ukrainian president never gave that statement to CNN. Instead, the spectacle is playing out on every news channel.
And by the end of the day, it had even wiped the smile off Mr. Sondland's face.

Texto completo: Fox News is attempting to distance itself from John Yoo, after the lawyer for Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman sent a letter to the network requesting a retraction or correction following a segment in which Yoo appeared to claim that he could be guilty of espionage.
David Pressman, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, sent the letter to the network on Wednesday, according to the New York Times. Aside from the comments in question made by Yoo, the former Bush administration lawyer who authored the "torture memo," Pressman also highlighted remarks that were made by others on the network, including Donald Trump Jr. and Tucker Carlson.
“LTC Vindman and his family have been forced to examine options, including potentially moving onto a military base, in order to ensure their physical security in the face of threats rooted in the falsehood that Fox News originated,” Pressman wrote in the letter. “He wants, as any responsible news organization would want, to see the truth published. And Fox News is in a unique position to correct its falsehoods with truth.”
A Fox News representative told the Washington Examiner, “As a guest on FOX News, John Yoo was responsible for his own sentiments, and he has subsequently done interviews to clarify what he meant.”
Yoo, now a professor at the University of California, appeared on The Ingraham Angle on Oct. 28. Laura Ingraham highlighted one part of a New York Times report, which stated that Vindman was born in Ukraine and that Ukrainian officials sought advice from him on how to deal with the president's personal attorney Rudy Guiliani. He responded to Ingraham, saying, "I find that astounding. Some people might call that espionage."
Fox guest claims White House official testifying in impeachment probe was involved in 'espionage'
Yoo's remarks sparked an outcry until he tried to clarify his remarks a day later.
"I want to clear up a misconception of my remarks on the Laura Ingraham show last night," he previously told the Washington Examiner. "I did not accuse Lt. Col. Vindman of committing the crime of espionage. I have tremendous respect for a decorated officer of the U.S. Army and a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. What I was addressing was a report that Ukrainian officials had sought to contact Vindman for advice on how to handle Rudy Giuliani acting as a presidential envoy."
"I meant to say that this sounded like an espionage operation by the Ukrainians," he added. "I think it deliberately misconstrues my words to say that the separate issue of the phone call between the U.S. and Ukrainian president through the chain of command constitutes espionage by Vindman, or that Vindman is some kind of double agent."
UPDATE:
Yoo said he was unaware of the request and directed the Washington Examiner to an opinion piece he wrote in USA Today days after the initial segment.

Paul Krugman: Warren would be wise to do a health care two-step

Texto completo: Recent state elections — the Democratic landslide in Virginia, followed by Democratic gubernatorial victories in Kentucky and Louisiana — have been bad news for Donald Trump.
Among other things, the election results vindicate polls indicating that Trump is historically unpopular. All of these races were in part referendums on Trump, who put a lot of effort into backing his preferred candidates. And in each case voters gave him a clear thumbs down.
Beyond offering a verdict on Trump, however, I’d argue that the state elections offered some guidance on an issue that has divided Democrats, namely health care. What the results suggested to me was the virtue of medium-size reform: incremental enough to have a good chance of being enacted, big enough to provide tangible benefits that voters don’t want taken away.
Remember, there was a third governor’s race, in Mississippi, in which the GOP held on. True, Mississippi is a very red state, which Trump won by 18 points in 2016. But Louisiana and Kentucky are or were, if anything, even redder, with Trump margins of 20 and 30 points respectively. So what made the difference?
Personalities surely mattered. Louisiana’s reelected John Bel Edwards was widely liked, Kentucky’s defeated Matt Bevin widely disliked. Demography probably also mattered. Urban and especially suburban voters have turned hard against Trump, but rural voters haven’t, at least so far — and Mississippi is one of the few states left with a majority-rural population.
But there’s another difference among the three states. Kentucky and Louisiana took advantage of the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid, leading to steep drops in the number of uninsured residents; Mississippi hasn’t. This meant that voting Democratic in Kentucky and Louisiana meant voting to preserve past policy success, while the same vote in Mississippi was at best about hope for future reform — a much less powerful motivator.
Back in 2010, as Obamacare was about to squeak through Congress, Nancy Pelosi famously declared, “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.” This line was willfully misrepresented by Republicans (and some reporters who should have known better) as an admission that there was something underhanded about the way the legislation was enacted. What she meant, however, was that voters wouldn’t fully appreciate the ACA until they experienced its benefits in real life.
It took years to get there, but in the end Pelosi was proved right, as health care became a winning issue for Democrats. In the 2018 midterms and in subsequent state elections, voters punished politicians whom they suspected of wanting to undermine key achievements like protection for preexisting conditions and, yes, Medicaid expansion.
And this political reality has arguably set the stage for further action. At this point, as far as I can tell, all of the contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination are calling for a significant expansion of the government’s role in health care, although they differ about how far and how fast to go.
Which brings me to the latest development in intra-Democratic policy disputes: Elizabeth Warren’s proposal for a two-step approach to health reform. Her idea is to start with actions — some requiring no legislation at all, others requiring only a simple Senate majority — that would greatly expand health insurance coverage. These actions would, if successful, deliver tangible benefits to millions.
They would not, however, amount to the full Bernie, eliminating private insurance and going full single-payer. Warren still says that this is her eventual intention, and has laid out a plan to pay for such a system. But any legislative push would wait three years, giving time for voters to see the benefits of the initial changes.
Sanders supporters are, predictably, crying betrayal. For them it’s all or nothing: a commitment to single-payer has to be in the legislation from Day 1.
The trouble with such demands, aside from the strong probability that proposing elimination of private insurance would be a liability in the general election, is that such legislation would almost certainly fail to pass even a Democratic Senate. So all or nothing would, in practice, mean nothing.
But is Warren giving up on Medicare for All? After all, what she’s offering isn’t really a transition plan in the usual sense, since there’s no guarantee that Step 2 would ever happen.
The lesson I take from the politics of Obamacare, however, is that successful health reform, even if incomplete, creates the preconditions for further reform. What looks impossible now might look very different once tens of millions of additional people have actual experience with expanded Medicare, and can compare it with private insurance.
Although I’ve long argued against making Medicare for All a purity test, there is a good case for eventually going single-payer. But the only way that’s going to happen is via something like Warren’s approach: initial reforms that deliver concrete benefits, and maybe provide a steppingstone to something even bigger.

WeWork’s Latest Major Hurdle Comes Just in Time to Ruin the Holidays

Texto completo: Getting laid off probably isn’t the company gift that WeWork employees expected to receive this holiday season.
The troubled real estate startup is officially beginning its planned mass firings, courtesy of new parent company SoftBank, with The New York Times reporting at least 4,000 employees are expected to be laid off as early as this week.
SEE ALSO: Here’s How Much Money SoftBank Has Spent on WeWork to Date
Newly-appointed chairman, SoftBank’s chief operating officer Marcelo Claure, sent a note to all employees on Monday informing them of the planned layoffs, which are said to be cost-cutting measures.
“In the areas of the business that do not directly support our core business goals, we have to make some necessary job eliminations,” Claure said in the email. “We are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and responsibilities, which will increase efficiency and also accountability.”
The We Company’s rapid decline and subsequent restructuring over the past two months, including a canceled IPO (which has spurred former employee lawsuits), are sure to have a negative impact on its remaining workforce.
“The recent layoffs at Juul and WeWork are particularly sensitive heading into the holidays, as employees are left knowing their former colleagues no longer have a job,” explained Henry Albrecht, CEO of employee experience startup Limeade. “Though the employees who were not let go may have a sense of relief, the culture is now at risk.”
With the much-publicized $1.7 billion ousting of WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, Albrecht tells Observer that companies have the opportunity to learn from the ill-fated unicorn’s mistakes.
“A lot of employers are missing a huge piece of this new modern workplace puzzle: care,” he said. “In order to thrive in our current environment, CEOs need to understand that what’s good for people is also good for business.”
With Japanese conglomerate SoftBank now at the helm, what WeWork employees need is strong leadership to get them through the remaining hurdles, explained Albrecht. He pointed to the Limeade Institute’s findings, which show that when employees feel cared for , “they are 10 times more likely to recommend their company as a great place to work; nine times more likely to want to stay at their company for three or more years; and twice as likely to be engaged at work.”
It’s unclear who will permanently fill this role, with T-Mobile’s quirky CEO John Legere rumored as being tapped for WeWork’s next chief executive.
As for WeWork’s once cult-like internal atmosphere, SoftBank also has its work cut out there. Albrecht says that in cases like this, defining the company’s new culture “in writing” and threading it through the fabric of the organization is vital to sustaining employees’ tenures.
Then again, there’s also the option of trial and error in overhauling a toxic workplace culture. “Sometimes throwing spaghetti at the wall is the best approach—especially if you can clean it up quickly when it doesn’t stick. In other words, be willing to fail fast and fix faster,” said Albrecht.
For WeWork, rehabilitating not only its public image, but also the remainder of human collateral damage, will greatly shape its business model going forward.

Hart To Heart: You don't have to hit rock bottom to break up with booze

"...my sobriety isn't a limitation. Sobriety isn't even a 'have to' - it's a superpower."
- New York Times bestselling author, researcher and professor Brené Brown
Hot buttered rum. Hot toddies. Mulled wine. Shots of Maker's Mark.
Those traditional holiday cocktails - and the shots - make up many of my memorable Ghosts of Christmas Pasts.
But not any more.
For the past year and a half, I've quietly followed the Sober Curious movement, which has been gaining favor in recent years and focuses on eliminating alcohol for health, sleep and wellness reasons. Sober Curious stems from journalist Ruby Warrington's book "Sober Curious: The Blissful Sleep, Greater Focus, Limitless Presence, and Deep Connection Awaiting Us All on the Other Side of Alcohol." This is not a 12-step process to sobriety. Nor a recovery method for alcoholics. Instead, it's about recognizing the dominating role alcohol plays in our lives, acting on that understanding and destigmatizing sobriety.
In my case, it means going from drinking wine on a regular basis to now having one glass maybe once every two or three months.
"There's this idea that you're either a problem drinker or an alcoholic, or a normal drinker who has no issues with alcohol," Warrington is quoted as saying in the Guardian.
"More and more we're seeing there are shades of grey when it comes to dependence on alcohol.''
Laura McKowen, author of a book coming out in January, "We Are the Luckiest: The Surprising Magic of a Sober Life," writes about her recovery and sobriety at www.lauramckowen.com. When it comes to the question of whether or not to quit booze, McKowen is quoted in media reports as saying, "The normal question is, 'Is this bad enough for me to have to change?' The question we should be asking is, 'Is this good enough for me to stay the same?' And the real question underneath it all is, 'Am I free?'"
If you are someone who thinks your life would be better without alcohol, please know that the decision to not drink at all or to drink significantly less is now being celebrated more and more.
Handcrafted mocktails are becoming more common. Sober social networks (that aren't AA) are growing. Dry January is here to stay. There are alcohol-free bars in cities like New York, Austin, London, with names like Getaway, Listen Bar, Redemption Bar and Sans Bar.
Celebrities like Elizabeth Vargas, Dax Shepard, Samuel L. Jackson and Brené Brown have opened up about their recovery journeys and sobriety. Currently, there are 42,300 posts on Instagram with the hashtag #sobercurious.
That's right, sobriety is becoming more accepted.
Yet here I am, still oddly embarrassed to tell people I am not drinking as I awkwardly decline a host's repeated offers for a glass of sauvignon blanc.
I've even tried to hide the fact that I'm popping open a bottle of Topo Chico when everyone else is downing prosecco at gatherings.
Why? Because all too often there is an uncomfortable silence when you tell an imbibing group that you are not imbibing.
There's still a stigma of saying you're sober that isn't there for other health choices like going gluten- or dairy-free.
People want to know if there was a dramatic turning point or grim blackout story that made me cut way back on drinking. There isn't. You don't have to hit rock bottom to break up with booze. For me, the reason was this: Alcohol's risks far outweighed the buzz.
Maybe during the upcoming spirits-marinated holidays, I'd do better if I answered the ubiquitous "why aren't you drinking?" inquiry by quoting McKowen:
"Each 'no' to drinking is a big 'yes' to life."

Texto completo: The drama, set in a British pub owned by a onetime executioner, won the 2016 Olivier Award for best new play.
"Hangmen," Martin McDonagh's dark drama about a British executioner, will open on Broadway this winter after successful runs in London and Off Broadway.
The show, first produced in 2015 by the Royal Court Theater, transferred to the West End and won the 2016 Olivier Award for best new play, and then was presented in New York last year by the Atlantic Theater Company.
Set in Oldham, England, in 1965, when capital punishment for murder was being banned in Britain, the play takes place largely in a bar run by the executioner and disrupted by a mysterious visitor from London.
McDonagh is an acclaimed playwright, nominated for Tony Awards for "The Lieutenant of Inishmore," "The Pillowman," "The Lonesome West" and "The Beauty Queen of Leenane," and a filmmaker (he wrote and directed the Oscar-nominated "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri").
The play is directed by Matthew Dunster and produced by Robert Fox, Jean Doumanian and Elizabeth I. McCann. It is scheduled to begin previews Feb. 28 and open March 19 at the Golden Theater. Casting has not yet been announced.

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign, struggling to build support among black voters, removed a photo from its website of a Ken­yan woman that was used earlier this year to illustrate his plan to dismantle racism in the United States.
The photo of the woman kneeling and talking to a child, selected from an assortment of stock photos available for public reuse, was first posted over the summer as part of the rollout of Buttigieg's “Douglass Plan," billed as “a comprehensive investment in the empowerment of black America."
The plan includes health care, education, and voting-rights reforms as well as proposals to address discrimination in policing.
Buttigieg has failed to gain traction among black voters — a critical constituency in the path to the Democratic nomination — even as polls show he is building support in largely white Iowa.
A statement released by Buttigieg's campaign apologized for “confusion" and said the photo — which was posted on the website by a contractor working for the campaign — was removed from the Douglass plan Web page in mid-September in a “regular update" to the site. Once the campaign learned the photo was taken in Kenya, it was removed in recent days from other places on the site as well.
The error was first reported by The Intercept after the woman in the photo, shot in Kenya, expressed confusion as to why she had appeared on a website for a US presidential campaign.

Democrats' Southern wins could affect redistricting
The reelection victory by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards over the weekend has assured Democrats of an all-important place at the table when political maps are redrawn after the 2020 Census for future elections to Congress and the state Legislature.
Edwards's narrow triumph on Saturday marked the third significant win in a Southern state in two weeks for Democrats, following their takeover of both legislative houses in Virginia and the defeat in Kentucky of Republican Governor Matt Bevin by Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear.
The recent Southern state elections provided a preview of the battle over redistricting power that is to come next year in many states. Although about one-quarter of the states use independent commissions or nonpartisan staff in their redistricting procedures, state lawmakers, governors, and other elected officials have key roles in redistricting in most other states.
If one party controls all pivotal state offices, that party can draw districts to the advantage of its candidates — a practice known as gerrymandering that can help lock in a party's political power for the next decade.
Republicans who already controlled the Louisiana House and Senate had hoped to consolidate power by defeating Edwards, or else obtain a two-thirds majority in both legislative chambers that would allow them to override his vetoes. Neither occurred.
In Kentucky, Beshear's election also will give the veto pen to a Democrat when the state Legislature draws new districts. The Kentucky House and Senate are controlled by Republicans.
Following the 2010 Census, Republicans who had swept to power in many state houses used their newfound majorities to draw districts that increased their odds of winning future elections. Democrats had done the same thing historically when they had power.
But a backlash has grown against such gerrymandering over the past decade. In 2018, voters in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, and Utah approved ballot measures designed to diminish legislative partisanship in redistricting.

Concerns remain about Trump's visit to doctor
WASHINGTON — President Trump's impromptu weekend visit to a doctor remained shrouded in secrecy Monday, as he stayed away from the public eye and the White House dodged questions about his health.
Trump, 73, made an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda on Saturday, later saying on Twitter he had begun "phase one" of his annual physical exam and the results had been "very good."
It is unusual for a president to do a physical exam in multiple stages months apart, and the circumstances surrounding Trump's visit renewed questions about the status of his health and the White House's handling of his medical information, say several experts.
The White House would not say Monday if Trump planned to release records from his visit or describe which tests he took.
In a statement on Saturday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump had undergone a "quick exam and labs" and that he "remains healthy and energetic without complaints." Grisham also said Trump had taken advantage of a "free weekend" in Washington to "begin portions of his routine annual physical exam."
The White House did not respond to requests for more information Monday. Two people who interacted with Trump late last week said he seemed to be hoarse and have signs of a cold, but nothing serious seemed amiss.

McConnell: Lack of civility is country's biggest problem
Bemoaning the country's lack of civility, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday that both sides of the political spectrum need to defuse the anger surrounding political discourse.
Speaking in his home state of Kentucky, he said the country needs to “learn how to behave better, how to be able to disagree without anger."
McConnell is a key ally of President Trump and has referred to himself as the “Grim Reaper" for his strategy of burying the legislative priorities of House Democrats in the GOP-led Senate.
On Monday, the senator listed incivility as the country's biggest problem.
“We have a behavioral problem," McConnell said in a speech after receiving an award from the Kentucky Electric Cooperatives at the group's annual meeting. “People are acting out and it's not, I don't think, limited to one ideological place or another. You've just got a lot of people engaging in bad behavior."
Kentucky Democratic Party spokeswoman Marisa McNee scoffed at McConnell's words, pointing to the senator's reputation as a hard-hitting political tactician.
“If that's what he believes, that this is such a stain on our politics, the lack of civility, does he regret the way he has allowed his own campaign to behave?" she said Monday.
McConnell didn't mention the House impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine or any other emotionally charged issues for prompting his remarks. The senator later told reporters that his motivation was last year's acrimonious confirmation process for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Asked if Trump, known for his combative tweets, was partly to blame for stoking tensions, McConnell replied: “I think we have a civility problem and I didn't confine it to just liberals. I think it's across the board."
McConnell is seeking a seventh Senate term in 2020.

Texto completo: You know something is really wrong in the news business when the New York Times goes further than even Planned Parenthood to deny the humanity of the unborn.
On Monday, the New York Times published an article titled, “Abortion Is New Litmus Test for Democratic Attorneys General Group.” Its subhead reads, “To win financial backing from Democratic Attorneys General Association, candidates will be required to publicly state their support of abortion rights.”
The report contains a lot of the normal pro-abortion pablum that one would expect from a major left-leaning newsroom. But there is one passage that sticks out in particular for its use of a euphemism so dark that it's funny. The passage, which was flagged first by National Review’s Alexandra DeSanctis, reads (and the emphasis is added): "Gov. John Bel Edwards, of Louisiana, a rare Democratic officeholder in the South, who won re-election on Saturday, after campaigning on his opposition to abortion and support for a state law barring abortion after the pulsing of what becomes the fetus’s heart can be detected.”
The Louisiana law, by the way, bars “the abortion of an unborn human being with a detectable heartbeat." A baby's heartbeat can be detected sometimes as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That is the bill the New York Times is awkwardly trying to refer to, without admitting to any of it.
What the newspaper published represents a concerted effort to avoid admitting that an unborn child as young as six weeks after conception has a heartbeat. But this is actually an improvement. At least the New York Times appears to have moved on from calling the unborn child's heartbeat “embryonic pulsing,” as it did in May 2019.
The really twisted thing here is not that a newspaper is playing fast and loose with the English language for the benefit of abortion, one of its sacred cows. The really twisted thing is that not even Planned Parenthood takes it so far. As journalist Jeryl Bier reminded everyone Monday, "even Planned Parenthood acknowledged a ‘very basic beating heart’ at 5-6 weeks,” he said on social media.
On Planned Parenthood’s website, under the headline, “What happens during week 5 - 6?” the abortion groups lists a few key developments in the unborn child at that stage in life, including “the embryo is less than 1/5 inch (4–5 mm) long,” “buds for arms and legs develop,” and a “very basic beating heart and circulatory system develop.”
A "very basic beating heart." Or should we call it "embryonic pulsing"? At this rate, with organizations such as the New York Times, what use is there for groups such as Planned Parenthood?

Two jail workers are expected to be charged in Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide

Texto completo: New York • Two federal workers who were on duty the night Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail are expected to be charged Tuesday in connection with their alleged failure to check on him every half-hour, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The two Federal Bureau of Prisons employees were expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
The charges would be the first to arise from a criminal investigation into the death of Epstein, the disgraced financier who hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.
Epstein, 66, had been in custody for more than a month when he was found dead on Aug. 10. New York City’s chief medical examiner ruled the death a suicide.
The workers came under scrutiny shortly after Epstein’s death because they were responsible for monitoring the high-security protective housing unit where Epstein, who had only recently been removed from a suicide watch, was being held.
Rather than checking on Epstein every 30 minutes as they were supposed to, the workers fell asleep for hours and falsified records to cover up what they had done, according to several officials with knowledge of the matter.
Jose Rojas, an official in the prison workers’ union and a teacher at the Coleman prison complex in Sumter County, Florida, said that, although he did not condone falsifying records, the two prison staff members were being scapegoated for Epstein’s death.
Rojas said missing rounds and doctoring records was generally treated as a policy violation in the bureau, not as a criminal matter.
Epstein had pleaded not guilty and was set to go on trial next year. If he had been convicted, he would have faced up to 45 years in prison.
By the time of his death, Epstein had been taken off suicide watch but was supposed to have another inmate in his cell. The prison allowed him to be housed alone the day he died, Rojas said.
Additionally, the Manhattan jail had been short staffed for quite some time. On the night when Epstein died, both staff members were working overtime. One had volunteered to work, having already done several tours of overtime that week. The other had been forced to work a 16-hour double shift.

Texto completo: "These suits are so insidious in the way that they discourage people from exercising their rights to free speech. Whether consciously or subconsciously, it makes the person think twice about speaking out."
Jonathan Jones, a free speech attorney in Durham
In 2008, Leslie Richard was sued for $20 million over a blog post.
Richard operated The Oko Box, an eco-friendly fashion business out of her Asheville home. When representatives from Vision Media Television offered to feature The Oko Box for a segment on PBS, Richard was thrilled. After the company asked her to pay more than $20,000 to cover their production costs and airfare, Richard smelled a scam.
Not one for indirect language, Richard posted on Oko's blogspot.com page, warning fellow small business owners to look out for Vision Media's "whole bag of lies to cover their scheme."
These assertions seemed grounded in experiences: first her own, second from other business owners who interacted with Vision Media, and third by PBS, which stated it had no association with Vision Media.
In response to multiple complaints, a Vision Media representative told The New York Times the company distributed its film productions to public television affiliates that could then decide whether or not to air them.
In her original post, Richard accused Vision Media of being a fabricated company. Through litigation, Richard learned the company was very real.
Five months after she published the post, Vision Media sued Richard for $5 million in business loses and $15 million in punitive damages.
"I felt like it was the most ridiculous thing that could possibly be happening," Richard said. "I felt like the whole thing was irrational, but it made me really nervous because I was still getting sued for $20 million."
She wrote her own motion to get the case dismissed or at least moved to North Carolina (Vision Media filed the suit in Florida). Media coverage of Richard's "$20 million blog post" quickly caught the public's attention.
"It kind of freaked everybody out that a blogger could just get sued like that," she said. Hearing of the case, a lawyer agreed to represent Richard pro bono.
The case dragged on: discovery, motions, and a parade of hearing dates. Richard's interactions with Vision Media concluded just under a year after they began with a settlement, the details of which she cannot disclose.
"I felt like I had succeeded in fixing the problem," Richard said. "The case seems even more ridiculous now than it ever did to me."
Two years later, a U.S. District Court cited evidence that Vision Media had "engaged in a longstanding scheme to trick nonprofit companies into hiring Vision Media."
Richard does not discuss the case with anger or fear. She betrays no signs of intimidation when retelling her encounters with a $20 million lawsuit.
Still, near the end of the litigation process, Richard removed the critical blog post.
Freezing speech with a SLAPP According to some judges, attorneys and advocacy groups, the case of Vision Media v. Richard is a classic example of a SLAPP lawsuit.
SLAPP stands for "Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation." Plaintiffs filing SLAPPs do not intend to win cases, but instead aim to discourage the speech of defendants by subjecting them to drawn-out and often costly legal battles.
Defendants facing SLAPPs may feel incentivized to remove critical messages to assuage plaintiffs and end the litigation. After experiencing a SLAPP suit, people may also refrain from criticizing other companies in the future for fear of additional litigation.
"These suits are so insidious in the way that they discourage people from exercising their rights to free speech," said Jonathan Jones, a free speech attorney in Durham. "Whether consciously or subconsciously, it makes the person think twice about speaking out."
Historically, plaintiffs filed SLAPP suits, usually in the form of defamation charges, against companies and traditional journalists. Yet with the advent of social media, everyday activists, bloggers and anyone with a Facebook account are more exposed to SLAPPs.
Supreme Court decisions make defamation cases extremely difficult for plaintiffs to prove, but legal victories are never the actual goals of SLAPPs.
Today, 31 states have anti-SLAPP laws on their books, but North Carolina is not one of them. Florida enacted anti-SLAPP laws in 2015. Georgia and Virginia both strengthened their anti-SLAPP laws in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and Tennessee passed its anti-SLAPP legislation earlier this year.
Anti-SLAPP statutes allow judges to determine the legitimacy of a lawsuit near the onset of the litigation process. Without anti-SLAPP laws, it can cost defendants months and thousands of dollars before judges can dismiss meritless cases.
On Nov. 10, HBO's "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" dedicated the bulk of its show to discussing SLAPP lawsuits and the benefits anti-SLAPP legislation affords. With renewed attention on the legal topic via late-night comedy ("Last Week Tonight's" SLAPP segment drew 4.1 million YouTube views in two days), some North Carolinians are asking why their state hasn't codified anti-SLAPP protections.
So far this year, Jones estimates he has represented six clients against SLAPP lawsuits and says the number of cases across North Carolina is much greater.
"I think these are more common than folks realize," he said. "An anti-SLAPP statute is a powerful tool for ending court cases that are designed to stop someone from speaking."
No anti-SLAPP in NC In some states, statues require plaintiffs to cover defendants' legal fees if cases are deemed meritless, which some argue could further deter the filing of frivolous lawsuits.
"If you're criticizing a corporation, you don't have to worry about getting sued because you leave them a bad review on Facebook," said T. Greg Doucette, another First Amendment attorney in Durham.
One argument against anti-SLAPP laws is that they abridge traditional legal processes.
"You do have less due process," Doucette said. "But that's because the cost of going through discovery is so expensive that most people will just cower in fear and do whatever the plaintiff wants to make the lawsuit go away."
Doucette prices the hourly rate of a typical civil defense attorney in Asheville at between $250 and $400 an hour to defend defamation cases. One Asheville area civil defense firm confirmed this range.
"It's just something that has not been on folks radars high enough to go through the effort and actually getting something through the legislature," Doucette said.
Another possible reason North Carolina does not have anti-SLAPP legislation may come down to how its legal system traditionally approached libel and slander cases.
"North Carolina laws and court cases interpreting those laws historically have been strong enough to provide pretty robust protections and defense to defamation defendants," said Amanda Martin, general counsel to the North Carolina Press Association. "And so I think there has not been a feeling that that was necessarily a need in protecting against abusive litigation."
Martin says things might be changing.
"Certainly, if we look over, say the first 200 years of speech-related lawsuits, defamation lawsuits, the media were the most common targets of those lawsuits," she said.
"Whereas in more recent history, there are a lot more individuals who are being sued. And that just immediately implicates the differential in the power dynamic between an individual posting on Facebook or something like that and a company that may want to shut them down."
'Chipping away' Richard acknowledges her fortune in landing pro bono representation.
"As bad as an experience that it might have been for me, it also taught me humility," she said.

Texto completo: The poet lived on the Florida island for nearly a decade, and her former house will become the headquarters for Key West Literary Seminar.
"The art of losing isn't hard to master," begins Elizabeth Bishop's poem "One Art," followed by a recounting of her losses, which include "three loved houses."
Now Key West Literary Seminar, a literature nonprofit that has championed the writer's work, is paying $ 1.2 million for the first of those houses, which she lived in for nearly a decade. It plans to use the Key West house as its headquarters.
Arlo Haskell, the nonprofit's executive director, called Bishop, who died in 1979, its "guiding spirit." The organization devoted its 1993 seminar entirely to her writing, and more recently it has incorporated her letters, poems and photographs into its programming for young people.
Bishop bought the house, located at 624 White Street, when she moved to Key West in 1938. It has been privately owned since she sold it in 1946, and subsequently became a registered national literary landmark.
Bishop is one of many American writers associated with Key West, Florida's southernmost island. The playwright Tennessee Williams and the novelist Ernest Hemingway, whose former home is now a museum, famously lived there. Ann Beattie, Joy Williams and Judy Blume, who runs a bookstore in the city, live there now.
The opportunity to promote Bishop's work, Haskell said, in part feels like a "feminist response to all the Hemingway energy that goes on here."
Bishop, who was born in Worcester, Mass., in 1911, was deeply influenced by her time in Key West and by the house itself, said Thomas Travisano, whose biography of the poet, "Love Unknown: The Life and Worlds of Elizabeth Bishop," was published by Viking this month.
Bishop was raised by different family members after her father died when she was an infant and her mother was put in a mental institution when Bishop was only 5. Travisano called her early poems "fables of enclosure," based on her somewhat isolated upbringing.
Those poems rarely mentioned the natural world directly, but that changed after she moved to Florida, he said.
"You suddenly have the natural world, and birds are clowning around, and you've got the sun and the sea and the sky," Travisano said. "That quality carried over into all of her later work." It was there that Bishop wrote most of her first poetry collection, "North and South," which came out in 1946.
Bishop liked living near the ocean, a change of scenery from her upbringing in New England and Nova Scotia, where her mother's family was from. She liked the night life and the pace of the city, Travisano said.
He added that it was also significant for Bishop to finally have a house of her own after a childhood of illness and abuse. "This was the first place that she had a home," he said. Bishop later moved to Brazil and then back to Massachusetts, where she lived until her death at 68.
There have not been major renovations to the Florida house since Bishop sold it, Haskell said, so even in its current state, "you can see the history right away."
But the organization plans to restore the house to the one Bishop knew, helped in part by her detailed letters, where she describes the house down to the color of the shutters and the number and types of trees in her yard. Key West Literary Seminar has commissioned a report that will excavate the house's history, focusing on the time when Bishop lived there.
The house was constructed in 1886 in the "eyebrow" style typical of Key West, with the roof line extending to shade the second-floor windows. It has built-in bookshelves and a screened porch that were installed by Bishop. The upstairs bathroom still has the tub Bishop used, and the organization intends to honor the original floor plan.
"When you walk in," Haskell said, "you'll see that this is the house that Bishop loved."

BUSINESS BEAT; A new tack on donations; Chick-fil-A says it will not aid anti-LGBTQ groups in 2020.

Texto completo: Chick-fil-A Inc. said its philanthropic arm will not donate next year to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes or the Salvation Army -- which espouse or have been linked to anti-LGBTQ stances -- as the chain of chicken restaurants continues to face public pressure about its charitable giving.
The Atlanta company said Monday that it will focus its philanthropic efforts on organizations that work on education, homelessness and hunger issues. As part of this new plan, the Chick-fil-A Foundation said it will donate a total of $9 million next year to local food banks, youth financial literacy group Junior Achievement USA and Covenant House International, which helps provide housing and services to young people without homes.
The chain has been working to shed its image as an opponent of LGBTQ rights, and this year the debut of a rival chicken sandwich from Popeyes offered Chick-fil-A's customers a wildly popular alternative.

In 2012, Dan Cathy -- who was then the company president -- kicked a hornet's nest by saying in an interview that Chick-fil-A was "very much supportive of" the "biblical definition of the family unit." Cathy is the founder's son and now serves as chief executive.
"We don't claim to be a Christian business," Cathy told Baptist Press at the time. "But as an organization we can operate on biblical principles."
His remarks sparked an immediate backlash. Protesters gathered at Chick-fil-A restaurants, politicians denounced the chain, and Jim Henson Co. pulled out of a deal to make toys for its kids' meals.
Shortly after, Chick-fil-A said it would no longer donate money to anti-LGBTQ groups.
But it continued to donate to such charities as the Salvation Army, a Christian-aligned group that in the past has said people attracted to members of the same sex should remain celibate.
In 2012, a Salvation Army spokesman told Australian journalists that part of the organization's belief system was that LGBTQ people deserve death. (The larger group said he'd misinterpreted its guidance.) The previous year, a gay rights activist told the New York Times that two decades earlier, when he and his boyfriend were homeless, the Salvation Army had refused to shelter them unless they broke up and attended church services.
The Salvation Army said in a statement Monday that it was "saddened" by Chick-fil-A's decision to halt its donations, adding that its own focus on education, homelessness and hunger is in line with the foundation's stated initiatives.
The charity also said it believes it is the largest provider of poverty relief to "the LGBTQ+ population."
The Fellowship of Christian Athletes did not respond Monday to a request for comment. On its website, it says it believes marriage is "exclusively the union of one man and one woman."
Chick-fil-A left open the possibility of resuming its contributions to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes in the future. Its foundation said Monday that it will evaluate its donations on a yearly basis.
President Tim Tassopoulos said in a statement that no organization would be excluded from future consideration. Chick-fil-A did not respond to follow-up questions about whether it has ruled out future donations to groups that have track records of anti-LGBTQ stances.
LGBTQ advocacy organization GLAAD said investors, employees and customers could greet Monday's news with "cautious optimism" because Chick-fil-A has made similar pledges in the past that "were previously proven to be empty." It did not respond to a follow-up question about whether it has any concerns about the announced recipients.
The controversy has had business implications for the fast-food chain. This year, concessions operator Delaware North decided against adding a Chick-fil-A restaurant to the Buffalo Niagara International Airport in New York state after protests led by a local assemblyman.
On Monday, Delaware North said that although it applauded Chick-fil-A's announcement, the move to abandon the airport Chick-fil-A was a business decision that it is not reconsidering.

New York Times executive editor: Trump has put my reporters’ ‘lives at risk’

Texto completo: The executive editor of the New York Times accused President Trump of putting the lives of the newspaper’s reporters in danger.
Dean Baquet said this week that Trump's singling out reporters by name particularly puts them at risk.
“I think his personal attacks on reporters, including Maggie [Haberman], are pretty awful and pretty unpresidential,” Baquet told the Guardian. “I think personal attacks on journalists, when he calls them names, I think he puts their lives at risk."
He continued, “I think that when he actually calls reporters names, says they’re un-American, says they’re enemies of the people ... that phrase has a deep history. I think when he says that, it is an appalling attack on the press.”
Last year, New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger said he told Trump privately that his “inflammatory language” toward reporters was “contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence.”
More recently, Trump attacked Haberman for reporting that he was annoyed by the lack of cameras when he visited hospitals in Texas and Ohio after two mass shootings. He also said the newspaper’s longtime White House correspondent Peter Baker should not be allowed to write about him.

Last month, the White House canceled its subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post, which Trump called "fake" newspapers.

‘Wolf of Wall St.’ and Section 230 of U.S. Code

Texto completo: Before becoming the subject of Martin Scorsese’s film The Wolf of Wall Street, Stratton Oakmont was a Long Island brokerage house. Its Wikipedia article states: “It defrauded many shareholders leading to the arrest and incarceration of several executives, and the closing of the firm in 1996.” But before it closed, it featured in some epochal anonymous posts on an online bulletin board hosted by Prodigy Communications. (Online bulletin boards were social media before that term was invented, functioning like a primitive Reddit.)
The anonymous posts accurately described Stratton Oakmont’s operations and presciently predicted jailtime for its founder. Stratton Oakmont sued for libel, demanding $200 million not from the unknown person who authored the posts but from Prodigy for permitting them to be posted. The judge who heard the case ruled that because Prodigy employed moderators with editorial authority, therefore it was legally the publisher of the posts, making it potentially liable for any and all defamatory material posted on its websites.
Ron Wyden, now a U.S. Senator from Oregon but then a member of the House of Representatives, learned of the case and introduced a bill to protect Prodigy and other internet start-ups. His bill, enacted as title 47, section 230 of the United States Code, states: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker” of any other person’s posts.
Section 230, as this famous law is known, protected internet companies from the likes of Stratton Oakmont. But it did much more than that, too. By freeing internet companies from the risk of legal liability for material posted on their sites, it made human moderators unnecessary — which is to say, wasteful, from the point of view of corporate profit-maximization. As the novelist Neal Stephenson told PC Magazine, the absence of moderation made social media “scalable.” Companies like Facebook and YouTube could massively increase in size without adding payroll. They could charge into new markets without hiring staff that spoke the language. Editorial decisions are made by computer algorithms created for the sole purpose of keeping users glued to the site. In plain terms, Stephenson says, that “almost always means [the content] is more emotional, it’s less factually based, it’s less rational.”
Section 230’s effects don’t end there. Traditional news providers bear the costs not just of reporting stories but of pre-publication vetting by lawyers, not to mention the ever-present possibility of defending against ruinous lawsuits. Internet companies are spared those costs. Instead, they can distribute work created by others, skimming off advertising dollars at no legal risk to themselves. Section 230 thus functions as a hidden government subsidy to some of the richest companies in the world.
The New York Times recently documented the way child porn remains permanently available online, and not just on the dark web. Well-known companies “have the technical tools to stop the recirculation of abuse imagery by matching newly detected images against databases of the material,” the Times reports, but choose not to “take full advantage of the tools.” A spokesperson for Dropbox explained that scanning for child porn was “not a ‘top priority'” of the company. If its executives faced long prison terms as the publishers of child porn, the company’s priorities just might change.
Section 230 served a valuable purpose in the early days of the internet. But those days are gone, just like Prodigy. In a rational world, the law would long since have been updated to meet changing circumstances, for example by treating platforms as legal “publishers” once they choose to disregard a formal request to delete material. Unfortunately, rational change may no longer be politically possible. The companies whose fortunes are based on Section 230’s exemption from legal consequences — companies that are, in a literal sense, above the law — spread vast sums around Washington D.C. to protect the goose that lays their golden eggs.
Social media companies have other weapons with which to punish would-be regulators, as well. According to a recent investigation by the political newsletter Popular Information, Facebook is curiously selective in its enforcement of policies against “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” including the use of dummy accounts to promote a post, increasing its prominence and expanding its reach. One particular organization that loudly defends Facebook against the threat of regulation seems to get away with actions that cause other accounts to be deleted.
Regardless of the merits of the specific case analyzed by Popular Information, its article reveals the ease with which any social media platform can enforce strict policies against political enemies while making exceptions for friends. Any politician seeking to modify section 230 is liable to find out what “coordinated inauthentic behavior” really means.

Texto completo: Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman who is taking steps to run for president, has launched a $100 million digital ad campaign attacking President Donald Trump in the battleground states expected to determine next year's election.
The effort will provide a significant boost to Democratic efforts -- now totaling at least $325 million in public commitments -- to keep the heat on Trump while Democratic candidates battle each other to win the party's presidential nomination.
"Our thinking is that the general election has already begun," said Jason Schechter, a Bloomberg spokesman.
The outlay, which far exceeds what any Democratic candidate has raised or spent so far in the race, joins several other outside groups who have devoted money to early swing state campaigns.
Priorities USA, an independent Democratic nonprofit and super PAC effort, has already spent about $7 million of a $100 million campaign for swing state anti-Trump advertising during the primaries. American Bridge, a group that typically focuses on opposition research, launched a $3 million campaign last week focused on rural white voters as part of an effort expected to reach $50 million.
A third group, ACRONYM, which is being advised by former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, has announced plans for $75 million in digital ads against Trump.
The money is intended to challenge the significant advantages of incumbency in presidential campaigns. Trump's campaign announced $156 million in cash on hand at the end of September, after raising $125 million in the previous three months.
By contrast, the top fundraising Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has raised less than $75 million through the first three quarters of the year. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has led national nomination polls this year, has raised less than $38 million in the same nine months.
Trump has also dominated Democratic candidates so far on digital spending. On Facebook, the Trump campaign and its affiliates have purchased $14.7 million in ads this year, according to the social network, compared to $5.45 million by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and $4.3 million by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
Much of the early digital spending by candidates is focused on prospecting for more campaign donors, not on persuading swing state voters. An analysis by Priorities USA of recent Trump Facebook ads found that 89% of the messages were focused on acquiring new donors and voter information, including spots that ask people to wish Trump a happy birthday or purchase campaign merchandise.
"Sometimes you spell 'desperation' d-e-m-o-c-r-a-t-s," Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said in response to the news of the new Bloomberg digital effort, which was first reported by The New York Times.
A pro-Trump independent effort, American First, has announced a fundraising goal of $300 million for the 2020 cycle to defend Trump in battleground states. That spending is expected to focus on Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.
In one Bloomberg ad provided to The Washington Post, Trump's Twitter feed is highlighted along with the message: "A tweet shouldn't threaten our country's security."
The digital campaign is scheduled to begin Friday, with plans for spending in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona, according to Bloomberg aides. They said Bloomberg will not appear in the ads, which will nonetheless make clear he paid for them.
"If Mike runs, it is because he believes that Donald Trump is an existential threat, and this demonstrates his commitment to defeating him," said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg.

Texto completo: Now is the time of year when my family starts watching Christmas movies. We watch the classics — "Elf," "Christmas Vacation," "It's a Wonderful Life," and, of course, "Die Hard."
We also watch "Home Alone," and sometimes "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York." The sequel finds Kevin McCallister, played by Macaulay Culkin, alone in the Big Apple while his family goes to Florida. While there, Kevin runs into the Wet Bandits, Harry and Marv, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, while staying in the landmark Plaza Hotel.
The film was released in 1992, when Donald Trump owned the Plaza. In exchange for allowing the production to use his hotel, Trump had a cameo in the movie, telling Kevin how to find the lobby.
Trump was a fixture in New York City, so it was no surprise to see him turn up in the movie. A native New Yorker, he was born in Queens and until he was elected, lived for decades in his Trump Tower in Manhattan. Before he moved into the White House, Trump was almost synonymous with New York City.
That's why it's so surprising that following the McCallisters' lead, Trump is headed to Florida. Or is it?
Last month, Melania and Donald each signed a "declaration of domicile" in Palm Beach County, Florida. In the declaration, they listed Trump Tower as their former home and the Mar-a-Lago Club, Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as their primary residence. The couple listed two other "places of abode" on their forms: Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where the president vacations, and, of course, the White House at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in Washington, D.C.
Ever the shrewd businessman, Trump is presumably moving to Florida because the state has no income or inheritance taxes. New York, on the other hand, has a top state income tax rate of 8.82%, while New York City has a top rate of 3.876%.
In addition, residents of Florida typically pay lower real estate taxes compared to property owners from out of state.
Trump hinted at the tax savings in a series of tweets after the New York Times reported the move, saying that he cherished New York "and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state."
Not surprisingly, Trump couldn't resist taking a jab at his political opponents. Because New Yorkers are not known for turning the other cheek, Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, responded by saying, "Good riddance." He added, "It's not like Mr. Trump paid taxes here anyway. He's all yours, Florida."
Florida is one of a handful of states in the U.S. that has no income tax. Alaska, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming are others.
In addition to the tax savings, political pundits believe the move to Florida is also a strategic one. During the 2016 election, Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in the Sunshine State. He has campaigned there many times and election experts view Florida as a crucial swing state in his bid for re-election in 2020.

Texto completo: An anti-abortion activist recorded the videos to try to show that the group was illegally selling fetal tissue.
Planned Parenthood was awarded as much as $ 2.2 million in damages on Friday, after a federal jury in San Francisco ruled that an anti-abortion activist had broken federal and state laws when he secretly recorded workers for the organization.
The activist, David R. Daleiden, recorded the videos in 2015 in an attempt to show that Planned Parenthood was illegally selling fetal tissue, a claim that created a political uproar and mobilized conservatives against the organization.
Mr. Daleiden, the leader of a group called the Center for Medical Progress, posed as a biotechnology representative to make the recordings. The jury found that he had trespassed on private property and committed fraud, according to court papers. Planned Parenthood said in a statement that the jury had ruled in its favor on each of its claims, including a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
Harmeet Dhillon, one of the lawyers for Mr. Daleiden, said: "We're disappointed with the jury verdict but this is not the last word on the case. We will be appealing numerous aspects of the verdict and the judge's ruling."
She added that "we believe we have excellent grounds for reversal."
The ruling was an important victory for Planned Parenthood, which had been buffeted by the political fallout from the videos, whose release in the summer of 2015 incited widespread outrage.
The videos gave new strength to the conservative drive to defund Planned Parenthood. Missouri called a special legislative session to do so after their release. The organization was forced to apologize for the casual tone that one of its officials had used in a video to discuss a possible transfer of fetal tissue to what she believed was a legitimate medical company. Planned Parenthood said the fees being discussed were to cover costs and were legal.
Abortion opponents claimed that the videos revealed that Planned Parenthood was engaged in the illegal sale of body parts. The organization has denied the charge, which has not been supported in numerous congressional and state investigations prompted by the release of the videos.
Planned Parenthood said in a statement that Mr. Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress had "intentionally waged a multiyear illegal effort to manufacture a malicious campaign." The organization added that "the jury recognized today that those behind the campaign broke the law in order to advance their goals of banning safe, legal abortion in this country."
Mr. Daleiden's supporters argued that the case was about freedom of speech. Mr. Daleiden was working, effectively, as an undercover journalist, they said, and should be protected by the First Amendment.
The Center for Medical Progress said on Twitter that the verdict set "a dangerous precedent for citizen journalism and First Amendment civil rights across the country."
In early 2016, Planned Parenthood sued the center, Mr. Daleiden and other abortion opponents involved in the videos. The suit accused them of engaging in a three-year criminal enterprise to target the group.
Around the same time, a grand jury in Harris County, Tex., indicted Mr. Daleiden and another Center for Medical Progress employee, Sandra S. Merritt. Mr. Daleiden and Ms. Merritt were charged with making and presenting fake California driver's licenses, with the intent to defraud, for their April meeting at a Planned Parenthood location in Houston. Texas authorities later dismissed those charges.

Texto completo: Somewhat lost in the frenzy over impeachment this week was a report from the Southern Poverty Law Center on Stephen Miller, a White House speechwriter and close adviser to the president.
An analysis of more than 900 emails from Miller to editors at Breitbart News, the report shows Miller’s single-minded focus on nonwhite immigration and his immersion in an online ecosystem of virulent, unapologetic racism. The Miller of these emails isn’t just an immigration restrictionist, he’s an ideological white nationalist.
It’s tempting to dismiss this as old news. Miller is, after all, the architect behind the Trump administration’s most draconian border and immigration policies, as well as some of its harshest anti-immigrant rhetoric.
The first travel ban, rolled out within days of President Donald Trump’s inauguration? That was Miller. Family separation at the border? That was Miller too. The relentless effort to limit asylum, deport protected migrants and block refugees from entering the country? Also Miller. The president’s January address from the Oval Office, in which he spun gruesome tales of immigrant crime and violence (“In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history”)? Stephen Miller.
But suspecting Miller’s ideological allegiances is quite different than knowing them. In the absence of proof, there was room for plausible deniability. That’s how a conservative magazine editor could praise Miller as a “wunderkind” for his command of the “details” of immigration policy while dismissing evidence that Miller was once close to Richard Spencer, a prominent neo-Nazi.
With the emails — supplied by Katie McHugh, a former editor at Breitbart — we now know what Miller was reading and thinking about in the year before he joined the Trump campaign. And there’s no denying the nature of the material.
In October 2015, while still an aide to Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Miller sent McHugh a story from VDARE, a white nationalist website named for Virginia Dare, the first English child born in North America. VDARE is preoccupied with “white genocide” — the myth that nonwhites are working to destroy white people through immigration and intermarriage — and Miller cited the website in response to McHugh’s concern that the government would grant temporary protected status to Mexican survivors of Hurricane Patricia.
“This being the worst hurricane ever recorded, what are the chances it wreaks destruction on Mexico and drives a mass migration to the U.S. border?” wrote McHugh, who identified as a white nationalist at the time. Miller replied: “100 percent. And they will all get TPS. And all the ones here will get TPS too. That needs to be the weekend’s BIG story. TPS is everything.” He then sent her a link from VDARE that focused on the prospect of protected status for victims of the hurricane.
McHugh says Miller also directed her to stories from the website American Renaissance, another white nationalist publication, this one focused on eugenics and anti-black racism. Its founder, Jared Taylor, has argued that “When blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western civilization — any kind of civilization — disappears.” In 2013, he argued for a white ethno-state. “We want a homeland where we are a majority,” he said.
There’s more. In June 2015, after Dylann Roof murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, Miller emailed McHugh with an outraged message about retailers pulling Confederate flags from their stores, pointing her toward statistics on Confederate deaths in the Civil War. He then wrote to her about efforts to remove Confederate memorials:
What do the vandals say to the people fighting and dying overseas in uniform right now who are carrying on a seventh or eighth generation of military service in their families, stretching back to our founding?
In a September 2015 email, Miller encouraged McHugh to show “the parallels” between Pope Francis’ pro-refugee statements and “The Camp of the Saints,” a 1973 novel by French author Jean Raspail. In the book, an influx of Indian refugees — described as subhuman and led by a feces-eating demagogue — storm France, killing, stealing and rampaging until they’ve completely occupied the country. Other migrants follow and eventually overrun western Europe, turning white Europeans into a subject class. The book is popular with white nationalists and is mentioned frequently on VDARE and the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website. It is also a favorite of Steve Bannon’s, the other of Trump’s “two Steves.”
The White House has pushed back against the report. “This is clearly a form of anti-Semitism to levy these attacks against a Jewish staffer,” an unnamed official told Axios. But there’s no way to spin these emails into something innocuous. The evidence is overwhelming: Miller was immersed in white power ideology. He was fluent in the language of white nationalism, attuned to its ideas. He was an obvious sympathizer who brought that sympathy to the federal government, where he has a direct hand in making immigration policy and choosing personnel.
For three years, Miller has used his perch to inflict fear and anxiety on refugees, asylum-seekers and unauthorized immigrants. Maybe, if you were charitable to Miller and sympathetic to restricting immigration, you could frame this as a misguided but good faith attempt to pull back from a more liberal status quo. No longer. These emails show that Miller’s views flow from his commitment to racist exclusion and the protection of a white demographic majority.
Breitbart fired Katie McHugh in 2017 for anti-Muslim remarks on Twitter. Since then, she says, she has left the “alt-right” and renounced her white nationalist views.
Miller, on the other hand, is still writing speeches and making policy. And while Democrats have called for his removal in the wake of this report (“Stephen Miller must resign. Now,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter), Republicans have been silent. Perhaps they’re occupied with impeachment, struggling to defend the president’s behavior against clear evidence of his guilt. Perhaps they don’t want to confront the fact that white nationalist ideas have a privileged place in this administration. Or perhaps they just don’t care enough to be alarmed.
If that sounds unfair, consider this: Republicans stuck with Trump in 2017 when he defended the “Unite the Right” protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, and they stuck with him in 2018 when he denounced “shithole” countries. They stuck with him through family separation, and they’re sticking with him as he keeps thousands of children in detention. Now we have proof that one of the president’s key advisers is awash in white nationalism. But to a Republican Party that has stuck with that president, what difference would this actually make?

Texto completo: New Mexico State University's Climate Change Education Seminar Series (NMSUCCESS) continues with a closer look at how art can be used to engage the public about environmental threats in the Rio Grande region. The next lecture is part of the "Species in Peril Along the Rio Grande" schedule of events in November including workshops, presentations and exhibits related to climate change.
NMSU alumnus Subhankar Banerjee, the Lannan chair and professor at the University of New Mexico's art and ecology program, will give a talk titled, "Multispecies Justice in the Age of Biological Annihilation and Climate Breakdown," at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 20 at the Rio Grande Theatre, 211 Main St.
Banerjee is co-curator of "Species in Peril Along the Rio Grande" — an artistic response to what a recent United Nations report called an "unprecedented" threat to biological diversity worldwide caused in part by climate change.
This is the final talk this semester of the continuing NMSUCCESS series of lectures by experts in different fields, which began last year. The series will continue in spring 2020.
NMSU to host panel on educational lawsuit ruling In a landmark court decision, a judge ruled that New Mexico is violating students' constitutional rights to a sufficient education. New Mexico State University will provide the opportunity for the community to join the discussion on Yazzie/Martinez v. State of New Mexico from 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 21 in O'Donnell Hall, Room 111, 1220 Stewart St.
New Mexico ranks 50th in the nation for K-12 public education. This lawsuit has statewide implications as it brings attention to how schools lack the programming, resources and funding needed to enable children to succeed. Changes are necessary to ensure that students graduate ready to continue with post-secondary education or move forward into a viable career.
"This is the first large convening in southern New Mexico around the ruling in Yazzie/Martinez v. State of New Mexico," said Dulcinea Lara, criminal justice associate professor. "This will be informational, sharing a timeline of events and implications resulting from the ruling for all students in New Mexico."
A panel of stakeholders and education experts will speak about how this impacts youth in the region. Attendees are welcome to come with questions about how this will affect local communities and how change can be supported.
"It is reasonable to usher in a culturally-responsive, equity-based and trauma-informed education when multiple studies prove this approach increases attendance, GPA and graduation rates across the board," said Lara. "New Mexico's future will be increasingly bright if we can collaborate across the state to fulfill the legal mandate put forth by this lawsuit."
Appetizers and beverages will be provided in the O'Donnell Hall lobby from 5 to 6 p.m., inviting participants to meet and network prior to the panel.
For information about the event, contact Lara at dulcinea@nmsu.edu.
Anne Hillerman to give presentation, book-signings Best-selling author Anne Hillerman will give a free presentation at 3 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 23, in Las Cruces about her series of mystery novels set on the Navajo Nation, featuring characters created by her father, Tony Hillerman.
Anne Hillerman continued her father's beloved series of books after his death and all of her Joe Leaphorn, Jim Chee, and Bernadette Manuelito books have earned a place on the New York Times Best Seller list. There will be a book sale and signing after the talk as well as a reception with the author.
The talk, presented in part by Las Cruces Press Women, will take place in the Good Samaritan — Las Cruces Village's Stuckey Auditorium, downstairs in the Social Center, at 3011 Buena Vida Circle. The book sales, signing, and reception will be held upstairs in the Creative Arts Room.
The presentation is also a fundraiser for the Josh Dunne Memorial Scholarship, housed at the New Mexico State University Foundation on behalf of the Military and Veterans Program at NMSU.
Book sales will be provided by Barnes & Noble of the Mesilla Valley Mall, where she will also sign books at 6 p.m. Friday, Nov. 22.
For information, email lcpresswomen@gmail.com.
How does Las Cruces be as welcoming as possible? "Welcome!" an interfaith conversation will take place at 2 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 24 at Temple Beth-El, 3980 Sonoma Springs Ave.
This program is open to people of all faiths and backgrounds. Participants are asked to bring with them stories about experiences of welcoming in their lives, whether as hosts or as guests or newcomers. Small groups will converse about these stories that will lead to the creation of guidelines for how the community can we as welcoming as possible.
This event will serve as a community lead-in to the holiday of Thanksgiving. It is sponsored by the Temple Beth-El Social Action/Adult Education Committee and is free and open to the public. Refreshments will be served during the program.
County launches communications survey The Doña Ana County Media and Public Communications Department launched a Community Communications survey to find out more about how residents rate the information they receive from the county and which channels they use most often.
"Each week, we distribute news releases to regional media and share that information on local radio stations and on our social media channels," Kelly Jameson, media and public communications manager, said. "This survey is designed to fine-tune our content and more strategically ensure that people are getting the information they need through the channels residents find most useful."
The survey is available in English and Spanish and takes less than 15 minutes to complete. All answers will remain anonymous.
"We encourage everyone who resides within the county or frequently consumes the information the county provides to take the survey," Jameson said.
To help Doña Ana County guide its communications efforts to the areas you want or need the most, please take this brief survey, available via the following channels:

Texto completo: That didn't take long.
"OK, Boomer" went from a fun, harmless-even-though-it-stings-a-bit phrase to an overthought, hyperanalyzed, "declaration of intergenerational war" (Maureen Dowd's words, not mine) in a week flat.
The saying started out as a clever, if biting, retort delivered by Generation Z in response to the lame directives/opinions/hand wringings of pretty much anyone over 30.
Then the New York Times wrote about it. And NBC News covered it. And Deseret News got defensive about it. ("Generation Z is embracing this new phrase called 'OK, Boomer.' But baby boomers have something to say about that phrase. They don't like it!")
And just like that, the air started leaking out of "OK, Boomer" like a day-old helium balloon.
"Boomers hate it, gen x will mock it, millennials will enthusiastically use it to the point of exhausting it without actually inventing it," New York-based writer Rachel Syme tweeted, "and gen z has already moved on and thinks we are all nobs."
We killed "OK, Boomer."
Killing stuff is supposed to be a millennial thing, but I actually think my generation - the one actively raising kids right now - is pretty adept at it too. In our quest to stay connected and close to our kids, we sometimes forget that they need and deserve space to live their childhoods without us taking every one of their triumphs and travails and quips so personally.
I probably unwittingly contributed to "OK, Boomer's" early demise. Last week I wrote about how I came face-to-face with the saying when my kids and their friends were home during the Chicago Public Schools teacher strike. I thought the phrase was pretty clever - a sign that kids are simultaneously bemused by us and eager to reject our old ways of thinking, confident they'll create a better, healthier, more equitable world than we have. And I believe they will.
But I think something a little bigger is at play here as well.
I think a lot of us, well-intentioned though we may be, fail to keep our own egos in check when we're observing and participating in our kids' childhoods.
Their grades become a measure of our parenting, rather than a measure of how well they grasped the academic material in front of them.
Their colleges become the grand finale of our 18 years of work - the ultimate return on investment - rather than a place for them to build on their 18 years of life so far - and a place from which to launch into the rest of their decades.
Their sports? Oh, man. Their sports. I have watched grown-ups take a child's game and turn it into a high-stakes pressure cooker more times than I care to count. Grown-ups yelling at 15-year-old umpires. Grown-ups yelling at their kids' opponents, who also happen to be kids, of course. Grown-ups yelling at other grown-ups about who was out, what was foul, whether that kid was offside, whether that judge is biased. So very much yelling.
I have watched my son come home from various games and turn to the cold comfort of his Xbox, where he can control the wins and losses on Madden NFL 20 and no one's screaming at his teammates from the sidelines or the bleachers. I have watched, on some days, a video game become more fun than a real game played with real humans.
Are these the same forces that killed "OK, Boomer"? It all sounds a little overwrought, I realize.
But I do think it's worth asking ourselves, in any situation, but particularly in parenting: Is this really about me?
Haven't younger generations always been skeptical of older generations? Isn't "OK, Boomer" just the latest version of the '60s mantra, "Don't trust anyone over 30?" Couldn't we have shrugged this one off?
It's too late for "OK, Boomer," which has officially jumped the shark.
The other stuff though - the bigger stuff, the stuff that takes up more time and space in our kids' hearts and schedules and futures - I think that stuff is worth pausing and thinking hard about.
It's their childhood. We had ours. We can and should be there for as much of it as we possibly can. That's a gift and an honor. But we should also resist the urge to hold up their childhood as some kind of mirror to check our own reflections or boost our own egos.
I'm speaking to myself as much as anyone. It's tricky to find that sweet spot just before becoming overinvested, especially when you love these people more than life itself.
Maybe "OK, Boomer" can be our canary in the coal mine. Maybe "OK, Boomer" can remind us, when all else fails, to be a little better at laughing stuff off.

Leo, 8-Year-Old Star of 'The Daily'

Texto completo: Luckily, an 8-year-old asked them.
Our producer Bianca Giaever on meeting Leo:
For the past few days, I've been fielding text messages, phone calls and social media messages all asking: "Where did you find Leo?"
Leo is the 8-year-old we featured in Wednesday's episode, "A Third Grader's Guide to the Impeachment Hearings."
As Michael Barbaro mentioned in the episode, I just joined "The Daily." My mission is to incorporate kids into our news coverage, and I wanted to do a story for kids about impeachment.
I was driving to a murder mystery dinner party on Halloween weekend, and asked if anyone knew a kid interested in impeachment. My friend's colleague mentioned that her third-grade nephew had been following the impeachment inquiry. Soon, I was on the phone with Leo. He assured me that he was "very, very interested" in the subject.
I went to Leo's house in New Jersey, where we had 24 hours to prepare for his interview with national security reporter Mike Schmidt. Leo is an artist, and had been making impeachment-inspired drawings. He was very informed, but there were some gaps in his understanding. For example, Leo thought that "whistle-blower" was an elected position in government. There was also some confusion over whether it was Joe Biden or his son running for president (because Biden's name is technically Joseph Biden Jr. -- it's confusing!).
Talking to an 8-year-old in a critical moment for our country was a risky move. We had no idea how the conversation would go. Mike Schmidt travelled from Washington to New York on an early-morning train, because he wanted to be there in person. He showed up in a suit and cufflinks.
Leo sat with me, Mike and Michael in the studio. His parents watched from the control room as he consumed a hot chocolate in under 30 seconds. We knew the show would work as soon as Michael said, "Right, same concept. Do not chase after dolphins. Do not ask the president of Ukraine to do you a political favor."
When Mike explained "this big thing called the Cold War," we got to hear Leo learn American history in real time. I had hoped that our story would be funny and informative, but I hadn't expected it to also be moving.
We plan to continue doing stories with kids. If you're a parent, we want to hear your kids' questions. The questions can be about the news ("What is happening with the Supreme Court and DACA?") or about anything they want to learn ("How are pencils made?"). If you can record your kids asking questions on your phone and pass along the audio, that's even better than a written question. And if your kids want to send us a song they made up, we'll take that, too. Say hello at thedailykids@nytimes.com.
Talk to Bianca on Twitter: @biancagiaever .

"Release the Drawings"
"Release the drawings," one person tweeted at Michael after hearing Leo describe his impeachment artwork on Wednesday's episode. "I just hope that in your newsletter you can include that drawing," another connoisseur of fine things emailed us. Well, dear listeners, we've got you.

Introducing 'The Latest'
Maybe you've noticed a couple extra updates from "The Daily" this week in your podcast feed: Bill Taylor became an ideal witness for Democrats, and Nancy Pelosi started using a new word to describe President Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
These are some of the biggest developments in the impeachment inquiry since the public hearings began this week, and we're bringing them to you in our new podcast. It's called "The Latest," and it features reporters in our Washington bureau as they dissect impeachment news at the end of the day after the hearings are over, and tell you what you need to know.
You can listen on "The Daily," or subscribe to "The Latest" wherever you listen.
On 'The Daily' this week
Monday: Andrew Kramer explains why the American military aid at the heart of the impeachment inquiry is so important for Ukraine -- and for the United States.
Tuesday: Julie Davis on a small act of rebellion with big consequences: "It turns out that the way that Elaine Duke wrote this memo was kind of a ticking time bomb that has brought us all the way to this issue of DACA being before the Supreme Court."
Wednesday: Before the impeachment hearings got underway, Mike Schmidt sat down with an 8-year-old named Leo who's obsessed with the inquiry.
Thursday: Mike Schmidt on what the public phase of the impeachment inquiry could mean for President Trump.
Friday: Amanda Taub on the protests in Chile: "What's happening in Chile goes to this question that countries all over the world are asking, which is basically: Is more capitalism always better?"

That's it for The Daily newsletter. See you next week.

There is Much to be Thankful For Right Now in the Rangeley Region ….but like you, I have a few other items on my list as well

I suspect that elsewhere in this issue of The Highlander, there is a story or two about the very encouraging news regarding an imminent sale of Saddleback Ski Area to Arctaris Impact Fund based in Boston, so I am not going to dwell on that topic…right now at least. But that doesn’t mean that I am not as upbeat about the prospect as most of you are.
However, I also know that we have been down this road before…sort of. The major difference is that Arctaris is a well capitalized investment organization with very skilled and proven leaders at the top….as opposed to the Aussie organization that showed its true “smoke and mirrors” approach when its leader was tossed in an Australian jail for serious and proven fraud. A very big difference, I’m sure you would agree.
Nonetheless, we will all certainly exhale with a large sigh of relief when the sale is finalized in mid-December and real plans and timelines begin to be shared with the Rangeley community. This is a big reason for thankfulness during this upcoming Thanksgiving season.
It is certainly a time to be thankful for all that is positive with respect to the most important focal points in each of our lives,…our families are always #1: Good health, good grades and other accomplishments in school and/or life in general, good fortune in sports activities, and so forth.
And speaking of sports on a broader level, Boston/New England professional sports teams are enjoying very good fortune right now. I just had to share my photo of the standings for three of those sports as of this past Saturday, November 9th. They were positioned side by side in a New York Times’ sports page…this, in a city that harbors serious rival teams in all of these currently active sports…and especially the one making its home in Fenway Park. Thank goodness the Red Sox’ season is over….and we can focus on next year. There is, of course, always the coming year and hopes for another “worst (almost) to first” season. We have to believe that will happen again in 2020, right? Hope doth spring eternal.
<img class=" wp-image-12166174" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/thumbnail_IMG_4939-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="646" height="485" />
Evidence that New England sports fans have much to be thankful for this Thanksgiving season. (Thankfully, the Red Sox’ 2019 season is in the past) Allen Wicken
For me, the category of thankfulness that I have been thinking about the most for the past two or three weeks is related to a news story on National Public Radio (NPR) I heard one morning about a breakthrough combination of drugs that are proving to be a source of real hope (finally) for those young people with cystic fibrosis, upwards of 90% of those afflicted the report stated. The story struck me because the researcher who was being interviewed had the wavering sounds of true emotion in his voice. I could relate to his excitement, just as any health professional who has worked with cystic fibrosis (CF) kids could also relate.
In the 17 years I directed the physical therapy division at Maine Medical Center, from 1975-1991, I and my staff worked hard to help many patient types with acute problems that were at times life-threatening. Few patient categories (other than badly burned patients such as the firefighters who were recently injured in the horrific propane explosion in Farmington and sent to Maine Med), were more challenging to treat, and more in need our daily services, than the CF kids.
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease whereby the carriers of the defective gene usually have no symptoms. Children born with the defective gene combinations have a very serious complex of physical problems. The most serious, and life threatening, lead to pulmonary (breathing) problems, usually infections of the lung tissue, that significantly impact the young patient’s lives. When these infections become serious enough, they would be admitted to Maine Medical Center for management of the infections and especially their impact on basic effective breathing. Physical therapists are key, via breathing exercises, positioning and other techniques to make their coughing most productive in clearing the mucous build-up in the lungs of these kids who are constantly struggling to breath and hence get the needed oxygen so their bodies can function.
In the early ‘80s, recognizing that our cardiopulmonary services needed to be strengthened due to the increasing complexity of the patients we were seeing with heart and/or lung conditions requiring a strong multi-disciplinary approach to be most successful in reaching the most positive outcomes possible,….and in the case of CF, the greatest longevity well into the teenage years.
In the early ‘80s, I saw the growing need to get approval for an experienced cardiopulmonary specialist physical therapist to lead our cardiopulmonary services. That approval, with the help of the fine pulmonary medicine physicians, was granted, and I was able to recruit a very good clinical specialist to lead our services for a wide range of diagnoses involving breathing problems (to include, among others, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, most often related to chronic smoking).
Over time, a number of our PTs began focusing on lung problems as their chosen area of practice. And with that, many became dedicated to working with the young CF patients who were admitted for very focused care to win the battle against yet another lung infection and its life-threatening consequences. The frequent returns to the medical center resulted in a closeness by staff;… physicians, nurses, and physical therapists, with these kids. It was a very human result.
Hence, even though it has been many years since my tenure at Maine Med, my being extremely heartened by that news report a couple of weeks ago regarding a medication development that gives true hope for these kids and their families was not surprising at all. I am very, very thankful for this breakthrough that has been the goal of those researchers for many years, dedicated to helping the children dealing with cystic fibrosis on a daily basis.
My interest in improving lung health in Maine continued years later. I was asked to be on the Leadership Board of the Maine Lung Association for over a dozen very rewarding years from 2002-2016 (see photo). It is a very effective organization that has raised millions of dollars over the years for lung health care in our state via the “Trek Across Maine” (a 3-day cycling event I have ridden five times, and was a volunteer staff member for at least as many more)… Thoughts of the many patients with breathing problems we treated at MMC were with me on each of those rides…especially those special CF kids who continued to fight for every breath, every day.

So, for this medical progress I am thankful as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches…also all the good things regarding our wonderful sons and their young families,…and of course, the very encouraging progress we all share regarding the prospective, and impressive, new owners of Saddleback and, of course, the positive impact the new ownership is sure to have on this very special Rangeley Region and its residents.
However, I guess we have to continue to keep in mind the insightful words of Yogi Berra: “It ain’t over ‘till its over”. Finalization of the sale in mid-December WILL, I believe, then be a very welcome Christmas gift for this very special community!
We need to write, otherwise nobody will know who we are. Garrison Keillor

Who can win in 2020? Voters shift focus toward centrists.

Texto completo: As the New Hampshire primary draws closer, and average voters start coming out to hear the presidential candidates in person, there’s a common refrain at Democratic events: We want someone who can beat President Donald Trump – and not just in coastal states like ours.  
Even some avowed progressives are expressing concern that, as much as they love Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s calls for systemic change, programs like “Medicare for All” might be more than fellow voters across the nation can swallow, especially in the heartland.
That may explain an uptick of interest in Midwestern candidates like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, as well as the last-minute entry of former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and the possible bid by a centrist like Michael Bloomberg. Despite the unusually large Democratic field, what’s emerging is a deepening sense that beating Mr. Trump will be no cakewalk.
A recent New York Times poll indicated that among the front-runners, only former Vice President Joe Biden would beat Mr. Trump in a majority of Midwestern battleground states – and only barely.
“We need to build a blue wall around those states ... and make Donald Trump pay for it,” Senator Klobuchar told a theater full of voters in Rochester, New Hampshire, so packed at lunchtime on a weekday that more than a few people had to stand. To do that, she emphasized, the nominee must reach out not only to Midwestern Democrats but also to independents and “Republicans of conscience.”
That message has won the support of Patrick Quinn, a Republican who credits President Trump’s tax cut with dramatically improving his income as a travel nurse but calls the president himself “vile.”
“For the first time ever, I started looking at Democratic candidates,” says Mr. Quinn, who paid $45 for a ticket to a recent Democratic gala in southern New Hampshire headlined by Senator Klobuchar. By the end of the night, he was sold on her – despite his friends’ reactions on Facebook. “I’m happy to donate to her campaign, support her in any way that I can.”
In particular, Mr. Quinn, who still plans to vote for Republicans in every race other than the presidential contest, says he’s impressed with the Minnesota senator’s bipartisan record. She has passed more than 100 bills as the lead Democrat and was the primary sponsor of a third of those, compared with a handful for senators like Bernie Sanders and Ms. Warren.
That no doubt contributed to her winning 42 counties in 2018 that had gone for Mr. Trump just two years prior. And what about in a face-off? A recent poll shows her beating the president by 17 points in the state.
“Not flyover country to me” “The heartland is not flyover country to me,” Ms. Klobuchar told a packed audience at a retirement community in Exeter, New Hampshire, earlier that day. Demonstrating how she would spar with Mr. Trump on a debate stage, she added, “I don’t think about these farmers and workers in the middle of the country as poker chips in a bankrupt casino like you do, as you bankrupt the country – they are my neighbors and friends.”
The go-to candidate for centrist voters all along has been Mr. Biden, a Roman Catholic who comes from a blue-collar family in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and is seen as having a more natural appeal to some of the white working-class voters who ditched the Democrats for Mr. Trump in 2016.
When he arrives at the New Hampshire capitol to officially file his papers for the Feb. 11 primary, the narrow hallways are packed with firefighters and other supporters chanting his name. “J-O-E for 6-0-3,” they yell, referring to the state’s area code. As the former vice president walks with his wife past gilded portraits depicting New Hampshire statesmen, young staffers beat on upside-down plastic buckets hastily painted the day before, leaving a trail of blue paint chips behind them.
Outside, a modest crowd assembles in the frigid weather, awaiting Mr. Biden’s exit. They include voters who have just put the schedule of candidate visits on their fridge and are coming out for the first time, as well as people like John Keenan, who saw the crowd and stopped to see what it was about.
“I’m more worried about [finding] the candidate that can beat Donald Trump than policy,” says Mr. Keenan, who was shopping with his daughter to replace her pink Converse low-tops. He says he likes Mr. Biden but also Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Warren – and adds that he knows it will take someone really strong to beat the president. “When [Mr. Biden] is under the gun, he’s not as quick as he could be.”
Others dismiss the idea that Mr. Biden is too old or should pass the baton to a new generation, noting that he would be able to enter the White House on Day One knowing how to run it, and could leverage his many relationships with world leaders to repair America’s alliances.
“What better way to pass the baton than to right the ship and then pass it on to the next generation?” says Chris, a New Hampshire voter who didn’t want to give his last name because he is a federal employee.
“The character of our nation is on the ballot,” Mr. Biden said when he took to the stage before a modest crowd that had braved snow squalls on a frigid Friday afternoon. He indirectly addressed the president’s criticism around his and his son’s involvement in Ukraine. “I’ve learned two things the last several weeks: One is that Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president,” he says. The other – “that Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the nominee.”
“He’s scared of you!” shouts one woman amid more drumming and cheers.
In a five-minute speech, Mr. Biden presents himself as the only one who can bring the country together and make progress on key issues like health care, while still respecting Americans’ freedom to choose for themselves.
Mr. Biden is the only candidate who has a chance of beating Mr. Trump, says Dianetta Gilmore of Brooklyn, New York, when he finishes, pushing a cart of Biden buttons toward a line of protesters on the sidewalk with Medicare for All signs. Button sales haven’t been good today, though. “I tell you what,” she says, “Sanders and Warren are bringing them out in bigger numbers, and that’s not good.” 
Not an either/or choice? Indeed, there has been tension throughout the campaign season over whether a crusader promising sweeping overhaul, like Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders, is what’s needed to energize Democrats and get them to the polls in larger numbers. While some back that theory, others argue that it would be better to find a moderate candidate who can woo back former Obama supporters who went for Mr. Trump, win over disaffected Republicans, and help the country heal.
Mr. Buttigieg, the 38-year-old gay Harvard grad and Navy reservist, tells voters they don’t have to settle for one or the other.
“Don’t let anybody tell you that we’re going to have to choose – either solve the problems, or everyone is going to be united but we can’t get anything done. That’s not an acceptable choice,” he said, adding that the nation needs a president “who can stand on the rubble of what has been busted in our society and in our politics, pick up the pieces, implement bold solutions to get something done about those issues, and find a way to do it that’s actually going to unify the American people.”
Mr. Buttigieg has been raking in contributions lately, even as Mr. Biden’s fundraising machine has sputtered amid apparent donor worries about the staying power of his candidacy. The South Bend mayor now has more offices than any other campaign in New Hampshire, and has nearly doubled his staff since the summer, according to his campaign.
One voter from Boston, a 2016 delegate for Mr. Sanders who didn’t want to be identified because his clients come from across the political spectrum, says he likes Senator Warren’s policies but that recent polls have started to change his thinking. “[Mr. Buttigieg] might be the candidate that strikes the right balance [of] being inspiring without triggering fear of change,” he says. In particular, he’s concerned about the backlash Medicare for All could create, citing challenges with the Affordable Care Act’s rollout. “If you force that big a change ... you will upset a lot of people and eventually energize a lot of Republican voters in 2022 or 2024.”

Texto completo: Buttigieg and Sanders seem well positioned to gain by exploiting the vulnerabilities of Biden and Warren.
Elizabeth Warren's seemingly inexorable rise and Joe Biden's dogged resilience have been the two major stories of the Democratic primary so far.
Over the next and more intense period of campaigning in the early states, the story could be very different. The two will probably have to confront their vulnerabilities to a greater extent than they have to this point, and they face challengers who are well positioned to exploit them.
Pete Buttigieg's lead in a recent Monmouth University poll of Iowa is as good a time as any to mark the beginning of a new phase of the race.
Until now, the front-runners in the topline poll numbers have shown few signs of weakness. Mr. Biden's lead has been mostly steady in national polling averages over the last month. Though Ms. Warren's rise in national polls has stalled, it has not seemed to reverse in a significant way.
But their weaknesses have been evident by other measures, including in more specific polling questions, for some time.
Mr. Biden has never emerged as a classic establishment front-runner, one with a large number of endorsements and strong fund-raising. Now, as the race reaches the point when the establishment front-runner would typically be poised to deploy vast financial resources to fend off attacks and challenges, he finds himself likely to be outspent, even badly, by lesser-known rivals.
Mr. Biden may already be suffering the costs in Iowa, where Mr. Buttigieg is the clearest beneficiary of his weakness among the party's elite. Mr. Buttigieg, the South Bend mayor, has raised more money than Mr. Biden and has steadily gained in Iowa polling, culminating in the Monmouth poll that put him in the lead. (Our New York Times Upshot/Siena poll, conducted earlier, showed Mr. Buttigieg rising. He was third, a point behind Bernie Sanders and four points behind Ms. Warren.)
The softness of Mr. Biden's elite support may also create a new set of threats, like the new candidacy by Deval Patrick and a potential run by Michael Bloomberg. It's not clear if either man would win substantial support. But if they do gain traction, it could easily come at Mr. Biden's expense.
Tepid elite support and Mr. Buttigieg are not Mr. Biden's only challenges in Iowa. He also has little support from political activists. This has contributed not only to his financial deficit but also threatens his support in a relatively lower-turnout environment like a caucus. Mr. Biden was a distant fourth in Upshot/Siena polling, with 13 percent to 14 percent of support among voters who were "almost certain" to attend the caucus or those who had attended before.
All of this is separate from another question: whether Mr. Biden's performance on the stump and on the debate stage is strong enough to retain his support as voters tune in more intensively. Mr. Biden's resilience in the polls to this point suggests that these concerns could be overstated, though he does seem to have lost more ground in Iowa, where voters are generally paying more attention than they are nationwide. Of course, it is possible that Mr. Buttigieg's rise, not Mr. Biden's performance onstage, is primarily responsible for the weakening in his support.
Mr. Buttigieg's gain might also come at the expense of another candidate: Ms. Warren, who also appeals to the meritocratic-minded, well-educated voters who tend to admire Rhodes scholars or Harvard law professors.
Ms. Warren's rise in the polls has been impressive, but there is no reason to assume it will be durable. In Iowa, 78 percent of her supporters said they could change their mind, more than with any of her top rivals, according to the Upshot/Siena poll.
She has vulnerabilities of her own, and she has come under greater scrutiny since she began to match Mr. Biden in national surveys. Her position on "Medicare for all" funding has given her rivals an avenue to attack, and her standing in national and state polls has seemed to slump over the last month.
Her rivals could also point to questions of electability: Although there is still a long way to go, state and national polls show her underperforming her top rivals in matchups against President Trump.
A substantial share of Ms. Warren's supporters in Iowa (60 percent) said that a woman would have a harder time defeating Mr. Trump and strongly agreed (41 percent) that sexism was a major factor in Mr. Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. Ms. Warren's own supporters were likelier to hold these views than supporters of Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders or Mr. Buttigieg, in Upshot/Siena polling.
And Ms. Warren has another rival for support on her left flank: Mr. Sanders.
He has been holding steadily at third in national polls. After a health scare in October, he came back with a strong debate performance and a high-profile endorsement from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. His standing in the polls has ticked up since, and he remains highly competitive in Iowa and particularly in New Hampshire, where one recent poll gives him the edge.
According to the RealClearPolitics averages, Mr. Sanders is essentially even with his rivals in New Hampshire, and just four points out of the lead in Iowa.
His position -- just behind the front-runners, without obvious momentum, and with little news media scrutiny -- seems to confer tactical advantages heading into the final stretch. Few candidates have incentive to attack him, as his supporters are among the likeliest to say they won't change their mind.
And Mr. Sanders has outraised all of his opponents so far this cycle, potentially giving him the resources to push to the front of the pack in the early states over the final stretch. Even if he falls short, it could sap Ms. Warren's strength.
It's unclear whether Mr. Sanders's resources, or collateral damage among his rivals, will be enough for him to claim an early state win, or deny one to Ms. Warren.
It seems even harder to know what will happen when the campaign rapidly spreads past the early states to Super Tuesday and beyond.

North Korea Accuses U.S. Of Stalling On New Talks

Texto completo: The top North Korean envoy to the negotiations with Washington said he was not interested unless the United States was ready to make substantial concessions.
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said on Thursday that the United States had proposed resuming talks on denuclearization in December, but warned that Pyongyang was not interested unless Washington was ready to meet its terms. And a top envoy said he believed the proposal was merely "a trick to earn time."
The North Korean envoy to the talks, Kim Myong-gil, said on Thursday that his counterpart in Washington, Stephen E. Biegun, had sent a proposal to the North through a third party. Mr. Biegun and Mr. Kim led their countries' delegations to working-level talks in Sweden last month, which ended without an agreement.
In a statement that was carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency, Mr. Kim expressed strong doubt about Mr. Biegun's sincerity, asking why the American envoy had sent his proposal through an intermediary rather than contacting him directly.
"If the negotiated solution of issues is possible, we are ready to meet with the U.S. at any place and any time," Mr. Kim said. But he added that North Korea had "no willingness to have such negotiations" if the United States merely planned to stall, as he said Mr. Biegun's team had done in Stockholm.
After those talks collapsed, North Korea said it had no desire to engage in "sickening negotiations" with the United States anymore, swearing that it would never meet with American negotiators again until Washington had taken "a substantial step" toward a "complete and irreversible withdrawal" of its "hostile policy."
On Thursday, Mr. Kim said he intuitively believed that Washington was not ready to give a satisfactory answer to the North's demand.
"Explicitly speaking once again, I am not interested in such a meeting," he said.
The North Korean statement did not specify what the American proposal was suspected to be a distraction from. But earlier, the North had accused the United States of using negotiations for "domestic political" purposes, a reference to the Ukraine scandal that is fueling impeachment hearings in Washington.
Mr. Trump and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, held their first summit meeting in June last year in Singapore, signing a broadly worded agreement for North Korea to "work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" in return for "new" relations and security guarantees from Washington.
But when the two leaders met again in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February, they failed to agree on how to implement the Singapore deal. Mr. Kim insisted that his country could denuclearize only in phases. As the first step, he suggested, the United States should lift all major United Nations sanctions against his country in return for the dismantling of a key nuclear fuel production complex.
Mr. Trump demanded a quick and comprehensive elimination of the North's nuclear weapons, as well as their means of delivery and production facilities, before easing any international sanctions.
In Stockholm last month, negotiators had tried in vain to narrow the gaps. Washington said at the time that the American negotiators had presented the North Koreans with "creative ideas."
On Thursday, Mr. Kim, the North Korean negotiator, indicated that the United States had offered incentives such as signing a document declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted in a truce, and exchanging liaison offices in each other's capitals.
But he said such incentives of "secondary importance" fell far short of meeting the North's demand that the United States lift its "hostile policy," which he said was "harmful to our rights to existence and development."
North Korea has typically cited international sanctions and the United States' military threats, including its joint exercises with South Korea, as part of such a hostile policy. Washington and Seoul are set to start a joint air-force drill later this month.
In a speech in April, Kim Jong-un said he would wait until the end of the year for Washington to come up with a more flexible proposal. In recent months, North Korea has resumed a series of missile and rocket tests, warning that it would find "a new way" if the Trump administration did not meet its demand by then.
In response to the latest North Korean statement, a State Department spokesperson said that Mr. Trump remained "committed to making progress toward the Singapore commitments of transformed relations, building lasting peace and complete denuclearization."

Bloomberg’s team issues apology for disparaging comments on women

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg’s campaign team started cleaning up after its candidate before he has officially entered the 2020 presidential race.
A spokesperson from Bloomberg’s campaign issued an apology after a report from the New York Times revealed the former New York City mayor had made many demeaning comments about women.
Bloomberg, 78, made several remarks suggesting that women should be left to go shopping instead of making important decisions, according to the report. People close to him claimed he said, “If women wanted to be appreciated for their brains, they’d go to the library instead of to Bloomingdale’s.”
He also used a joke in his sales pitches to potential buyers where he would tell his computer terminal “do everything” including oral sex, adding, “I guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business.”
These accusations had surfaced before, but Bloomberg brushed them off as “borscht belt jokes.” His campaign, however, took a softer approach and apologized for the remarks.
Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Bloomberg and his former press secretary, said, “Mike has come to see that some of what he has said is disrespectful and wrong. He believes his words have not always aligned with his values and the way he has led his life.”
Bloomberg hasn’t officially announced his entry into the Democratic presidential primary, but he did file to run in Alabama on Monday.

Texto completo: MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace went on CBS's The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to talk about politics, and she revealed that while she had left the Republican party, her parents were still big fans of President Trump.
"My parents think Donald Trump belongs on Mount Rushmore," Wallace told the CBS host. The MSNBC host mentioned her parents after Colbert asked how Kellyanne Conway and George Conway stay married despite their very public disagreements over the Trump presidency.
"I live this sort of need to sort of understand and understand that people have different views about Donald Trump. So I've got no judgment on that," she added. "I think that if transparency is the disinfectant, they’re both sort of living their political views out loud."
While Wallace said she is understanding of her parent's views, she had harsh words for Republicans who still support Trump. "If I had any capacity for sympathy for my old party, it would be so sad, it would be embarrassing. But I don’t," she told Colbert after the host brought up a clip of her calling several Fox News personalities "chickenshit."
The cable host has said she would support any Democrat in 2020 to take down Trump, who she has compared to Adolf Hitler. She has praised South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg as "chicken soup for my soul."
Wallace, 47, is a former Republican who worked as George W. Bush's communications director during his presidency. During the 2008 presidential election, she served as a senior adviser to Sarah Palin, who was Sen. John McCain's vice-presidential pick.
Wallace went on to co-host The View in 2015 before joining MSNBC as a full-time host and renounced being a Republican. She said she told Jeb Bush that "he should have punched" Trump for his treatment in one of the 2016 Republican primary debates.
She regularly invites anti-Trump and former Republicans on her show, including Charlie Sykes, Steve Schmidt, and David Frum. Some conservatives refer to her show as the "traitor hour" on MSNBC. Wallace still praises Republicans such as McCain and Bush but said, "that's about it" in regards to Republicans she still respects.
Earlier this year, she divorced her husband, Mark Wallace, of 14 years and started dating Michael Schmidt, a New York Times reporter. iFrame Object

Texto completo: A report by the Southern Poverty Law Center seeks to illustrate how Mr. Miller brought anti-immigrant beliefs to the White House and turned them into policy.
WASHINGTON -- A batch of leaked emails obtained by a civil rights advocacy group show that Stephen Miller, the White House adviser with a direct hand in shaping President Trump's hard-line immigration policies, promoted theories popular with white nationalist groups to an editor at a prominent conservative publication before he joined the administration.
The group, the Southern Poverty Law Center, on Tuesday published a summary of some 900 messages that Mr. Miller sent to Breitbart News from March 2015 to June 2016. The center shared with The New York Times seven pages of the emails included in that summary.
The emails, supplied by Katie McHugh, a former editor at Breitbart, show that Mr. Miller tried to shape news coverage with material he found on at least one website that espouses white nationalist viewpoints, including fringe theories that people of color are trying to engage in "white genocide." The law center's investigation, which the group says it will turn into a series, seeks to illustrate how Mr. Miller brought anti-immigrant beliefs to the White House and turned them into policy.
In an exchange from October 2015, when Mr. Miller was an aide to then-Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, Mr. Miller and Ms. McHugh appeared to share a concern that Mexican survivors of Hurricane Patricia, a Category 5 storm, could be granted temporary protected status, or T.P.S., to seek refuge in the United States.
"This being the worst hurricane ever recorded, what are the chances it wreaks destruction on Mexico and drives a mass migration to the U.S. border?" Ms. McHugh wrote, focusing on the possibility that large numbers of refugees might end up in the United States.
"100 percent," Mr. Miller replied. "And they will all get TPS. And all the ones here will get TPS too. That needs to be the weekend's BIG story. TPS is everything."
Mr. Miller then shared a link from a website called VDare, which regularly publishes white nationalists and traffics in anti-immigrant messaging, to prove his point.
Ms. McHugh was fired from Breitbart in 2017 after publishing anti-Muslim Twitter posts. In an interview on Wednesday, she said she had a change of heart after being fired and now renounces far-right views.
"Miller is the most prominent architect of immigration policy within the White House," Ms. McHugh said, "and it's easy to draw a clear line from the white supremacist websites where he is getting his ideas to current immigration policy."
Mr. Miller declined to comment.
Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, responded that the Southern Poverty Law Center was an "utterly discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization."
The Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the nation's wealthiest and best-known legal advocacy groups, has focused a significant amount of its resources -- it operates with an endowment of about $ 471 million -- on exposing the work of extremist groups that espouse hateful ideologies.
Mr. Miller's hard-line beliefs are reflected in the president's language and decision making. This fall, Mr. Trump declined to grant temporary protected status to Bahamian survivors of Hurricane Dorian, a storm that devastated the islands and left at least 2,500 people missing. The administration has also sought to roll back temporary protections for citizens of El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti who have lived for years in the United States.
An email exchange from June 2015 revealed that after a white nationalist shot and killed nine black worshipers at a church in Charleston, S.C., Mr. Miller appeared concerned about the removal of Confederate merchandise from e-commerce websites like Amazon. He suggested to Ms. McHugh that she write about the Communist-era merchandise that Amazon continued to sell.
"Have you thought about going to Amazon and finding the commie flags and then doing a story on that?" Mr. Miller wrote to Ms. McHugh.
"Yes, definitely," Ms. McHugh replied. "There's all kinds of hammer and sickle merchandise, Che shirts, Stalin shirts ... the list goes on and on."
An article soon appeared on Breitbart about the Amazon merchandise, and the two continued to discuss the matter: "Should the cross be removed from immigrant communities, in light of the history of Spanish conquest?" Mr. Miller wrote.
In the White House, Mr. Trump has been vocal about preserving Confederate monuments. "Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments," he wrote in 2017 after a violent rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., resulted in the death of a protester.
Other emails illustrate Mr. Miller's influence on Breitbart. Ms. McHugh also recalled a phone conversation from July 2015 in which Mr. Miller called her to discuss an article he had read on "AmRen," shorthand to its followers for American Renaissance, a site with ties to white supremacy groups. The article, "New DOJ Statistics on Race and Violent Crime," by Jared Taylor, the founder of American Renaissance, approvingly notes that the Justice Department had begun reporting Latinos in a separate category on crime statistics "rather than lumping them in with whites."
Mr. Taylor also wrote that the Justice Department had "long counted Hispanics as a victim category in its hate crime reports. We look forward to their inclusion as a perpetrator category."
In an email exchange from September 2015, Mr. Miller urged Breitbart editors to refer to "The Camp of the Saints," a 1973 French novel that popularizes the idea that Western civilization will fall at the hands of immigrants. The book was covered days later by Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart writer who now works in the White House. Her job is to communicate administration talking points to surrogates.
Since the publication of the emails, several prominent Democrats, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota -- two members of a group of nonwhite congresswomen who have drawn the ire of the president and his supporters -- have called for Mr. Miller to resign.
In a Twitter post, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez called Mr. Miller a "bonafide white nationalist" who was working at the White House to shape immigration policy. She added: "Miller must resign. Now."
Ms. Grisham, the White House press secretary, said in an email that the Southern Poverty Law Center "has recently been forced -- to its great humiliation -- to issue a major retraction for other wholly-fabricated accusations."
Ms. Grisham was apparently referring to the fact that last year the group apologized and paid $ 3.3 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Maajid Nawaz, an activist whose advocacy organization the law center initially said was an "extremist" group. In March, the organization's co-founder, Morris Dees, was fired over internal claims of mistreatment of staff, sexual harassment, gender discrimination and racism.

Resumen: The deep state has a long history of betraying the trust of the American people. They aren't our friends just because we share an enemy in common.

Texto completo: “Thank God for the deep state,” declared former acting CIA chief John McLaughlin recently while appearing on a panel at George Mason University. A year ago, the deep state was routinely reviled as a figment of paranoid right-wingers’ imagination. But much of the news media are now conferring the same sainthood on the deep state that was previously bestowed on special counsel Robert Mueller.
A New York Times article last month gushed that “over the last three weeks, the deep state has emerged from the shadows in the form of real live government officials, past and present . . . and provided evidence that largely backs up the still-anonymous whistleblower” on President Donald Trump’s phone call to the president of Ukraine. Times columnist James Stewart declared: “There is a deep state, there is a bureaucracy in our country who has pledged to respect the Constitution, respect the rule of law . . . protecting the American people. ” Times editorial writer Michelle Cottle proclaimed that “the deep state is alive and well” and hailed it as “a collection of patriotic public servants. ”
Intelligence agencies gone rogue
Former CIA Director John Brennan, appearing on the same panel as McLaughlin, declared, “The reason why Mr. Trump has this very contentious relationship with CIA and FBI and the deep state people . . . is because they tell the truth. ”
Much of the news coverage of the Trump impeachment is following that storyline — even though it is astonishing as an overheated Trump tweet.
Five years ago, Brennan’s CIA ignited what should have been a constitutional crisis when it was caught illegally spying upon the Senate Intelligence Committee, which was compiling a massive report on the CIA torture program. After 9/11, the CIA constructed an interrogation regime by “consulting Egyptian and Saudi intelligence officials and copying Soviet interrogation methods,” The Times reported in 2007. Secret Bush administration torture memos “set the CIA loose to slam suspects’ heads into walls up to 30 times in a row, to deprive suspects of sleep for more than a week straight, to confine them to small dark boxes for hours at a time . . . and to suffocate them with water to induce the perception that they are drowning,” Georgetown University law professor David Cole noted. But the only official who went to prison was John Kiriakou, a former CIA operative who publicly admitted that the CIA was waterboarding.
Is the deep state more trustworthy when it is killing than when it is torturing?
Brennan declared in 2016 that “the president requires near certainty of no collateral damage” before approving a drone strike. Confidential CIA documents revealed that the CIA had little or no idea who it was killing most of the time with its drone attacks in Pakistan, Somalia, Afghanistan, Yemen and other nations. A Salon analysis, summarizing an NBC News report, noted, “Even while admitting that the identities of many killed by drones were not known, the CIA documents asserted that all those dead were enemy combatants. The logic is twisted: If we kill you, then you were an enemy combatant. ” Lying about drone killings quickly became institutionalized throughout the deep state. The Times reported in 2015: “Every independent investigation of the (drone) strikes has found far more civilian casualties than administration officials admit. ”
House Intelligence Committee chairman: Trump betrayed America. Soon the public will hear from patriots who defended it.
The deep state is practically designed to destroy privacy that enable government officials to deny illegalities. The National Security Agency’s credibility was obliterated in 2013 when former NSA analyst Edward Snowden revealed that the agency can tap almost any cellphone in the world, access anyone’s email and web-browsing history, and crack the vast majority of computer encryption. But the NSA’s definition of “terrorist suspect” was ludicrously broad, including “someone searching the web for suspicious stuff. ” A few months before Snowden’s revelations, national intelligence director James Clapper lied to Congress when he denied that the NSA collects “any type of data at all on millions, or hundreds of millions of Americans. ”
Cover-ups at the Pentagon
Trump’s version of his call to the Ukraine president has been challenged in closed testimony to the House Intelligence Committee by Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the Ukrainian-born officer who listened in to the call while serving on the National Security Council.
There are plenty of honorable, upright military officers, but the Pentagon per se has as much credibility as a second-term congressman. In the post 9/11 era, Pentagon officials deluged the news media with false progress claims on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, perennially covered up killings of civilians, and also sought to bury their own torture scandal (revealed in a neglected 2008 report by a Senate investigation co-chaired by John McCain).
The deep state has an appalling record of abusing the whistleblowers who are now being acclaimed. A draft Intelligence Community Inspector General report last year found that intelligence agencies refused to recognize retaliation against whistleblowers in 99% of cases, according to The Daily Beast. A 2017 report by Foreign Policy magazine concluded that “the intelligence community’s central watchdog is in danger of crumbling thanks to mismanagement, bureaucratic battles, clashes among big personalities, and sidelining of whistleblower outreach and training efforts. ” After CIA Inspector General John Helgerson compiled a damning report on the CIA’s post 9/11 interrogation program, CIA chief Michael Hayden launched a major investigation of Helgerson in 2007, provoking outrage on Capitol Hill. (The CIA managed to delay the release of Helgerson’s report for years, thereby keeping both Congress and the American people in the dark regarding shocking abuses. )
Scandal: Trump's new impeachable offense is threatening the life of a CIA officer
It is worse than naive to expect the deep state to provide an antidote to the venality of American politics. The agencies now being exalted have some of the longest records of deceit and crimes. The secrecy that has shrouded U. S. intelligence, surveillance and military operations has done nothing to make former Boy Scouts and church choir members ascend to key policymaking positions.
The Trump-deep state clash is a showdown between a presidency that has become far too powerful versus federal agencies that have become fiefdoms that enjoy immunity for almost any and all abuses. Regardless of the outcome of the congressional impeachment investigation, can the political system pull in the reins on imperious agencies? It is unlikely.

Will impeachment hearings be must-see TV?

Texto completo: When the House impeachment inquiry goes live Wednesday morning, it promises to be must-see TV that could shape the future of American politics for a generation to come. That is, if your boss will let you watch it.
Major TV and cable networks will preempt regular daytime programming Wednesday and Friday to air the impeachment hearings, as testimony goes from behind closed doors to live television. It is a pivotal moment as both legislators and the court of public opinion weigh whether President Donald Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden represented an impeachable abuse of power.
But with entrenched partisan politics, fragmented media platforms and the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, many people may be relegated to hunching down in their cubicles and sneaking furtive glances on their smart phones.
Businesses are certainly not throwing March Madness-like impeachment watch parties. And with no plans for a nightly network rebroadcast, as PBS did during the 1973 Watergate hearings, this week's hearings may be defined more by surreptitious streaming and sound bites than potentially compelling testimony.
"One of the most important aspects of the televised hearings is how many people watch them," Darrell West, director of governance studies for the Brookings Institution, said.
"During Watergate, millions watched and learned new things about (President Richard) Nixon, which ultimately turned them away from him. For Democrats to have any hope of altering public opinion, they need robust viewership levels."
That may be a hard sell at some Chicago-area businesses.
Tom Gimbel, founder and CEO of LaSalle Network, a Chicago-based staffing and recruiting firm, goes all in for March Madness viewing parties. But he is less enthusiastic about the impeachment hearings as a workplace event.
"People really try to shy away from politics at work, especially in this day and age, because it can get so heated," Gimbel said. "If you look for updates on your phone or something, you can't stop people from that, but I would not advise any company to make it a part of their business. Politics get messy, people get emotional."
To be sure, the broadcast networks are all in, with gavel-to-gavel coverage scheduled for ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS, as well as cable channels CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and CSPAN. The Trump impeachment is the first such event of the digital age, allowing viewers to stream it live, or digest it in pieces through social media and online news websites.
It may be hard, however, to match the impact of the Watergate hearings, when broadcast TV was the only way to watch.
In 1973, rotating network coverage of the Senate Watergate hearings, and the PBS rebroadcasts at night, drew millions of viewers and proved a tipping point for public opinion about Nixon, who resigned amid abuse of power charges before facing articles of impeachment.
The 1998 impeachment process of President Bill Clinton did little to change public sentiment. It was the dawn of the cable news wars, with CNN, MSNBC and Fox offering 24/7 coverage of the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. But Clinton's popularity remained high and many Americans tuned out the House impeachment investigation, with only 34% paying close attention to the proceedings, according to a 1998 Pew Research study.
In fact, when the House voted to impeach Clinton in December 1998, CBS broke with other broadcast networks and aired a Saturday football game between the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets. The NFL game drew more viewers than any of the impeachment broadcasts.
Clinton was subsequently acquitted by the Senate.
Democrats are hoping the televised testimony in the Trump impeachment hearing will sway public opinion enough to convince Republicans in the Senate to vote to remove Trump from office, if the House first votes on articles of impeachment, as expected by analysts.
"Given the polarized environment, it is not likely that many minds will shift," West said. "But if Democrats can boost the number wanting to remove Trump from office from 50 to 60%, that would substantially alter the public opinion climate and make some Republican legislators nervous about continuing to support Trump. They want to make sure he doesn't take them down with himself."
But some advocates believe that sound bites alone won't sway public opinion in these partisan political times. As such, former PBS journalist Bill Moyers took out an ad in the New York Times urging PBS to preempt its primetime programming as it did during Watergate, and rebroadcast the full Trump hearings.
"Airing the impeachment hearings as streaming video on a website isn't enough," Moyers said in the ad. "Plenty of Americans still rely on good old broadcast TV to get the word. Hearken, PBS: Pull out the stops once again, and for the sake of the nation, throw away the schedule and air the Trump impeachment hearings in prime time."
The televised hearings are scheduled to begin Wednesday at 9 a.m. with testimony from Bill Taylor, charge d'affaires at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine and George Kent, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. Testimony will resume on Friday morning with Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.

Texto completo: That didn't take long.
"OK, Boomer" went from a fun, harmless-even-though-it-stings-a-bit phrase to an overthought, hyperanalyzed, "declaration of intergenerational war" (Maureen Dowd's words, not mine) in a week flat.
The saying started out as a clever, if biting, retort delivered by Generation Z in response to the lame directives/opinions/hand wringings of pretty much anyone over 30.
Then the New York Times wrote about it. And NBC News covered it. And Deseret News got defensive about it. ("Generation Z is embracing this new phrase called 'OK, Boomer.' But baby boomers have something to say about that phrase. They don't like it!")
And just like that, the air started leaking out of "OK, Boomer" like a day-old helium balloon.
"Boomers hate it, gen x will mock it, millennials will enthusiastically use it to the point of exhausting it without actually inventing it," New York-based writer Rachel Syme tweeted, "and gen z has already moved on and thinks we are all nobs."
We killed "OK, Boomer."
Killing stuff is supposed to be a millennial thing, but I actually think my generation - the one actively raising kids right now - is pretty adept at it too. In our quest to stay connected and close to our kids, we sometimes forget that they need and deserve space to live their childhoods without us taking every one of their triumphs and travails and quips so personally.
I probably unwittingly contributed to "OK, Boomer's" early demise. Last week I wrote about how I came face-to-face with the saying when my kids and their friends were home during the Chicago Public Schools teacher strike. I thought the phrase was pretty clever - a sign that kids are simultaneously bemused by us and eager to reject our old ways of thinking, confident they'll create a better, healthier, more equitable world than we have. And I believe they will.
But I think something a little bigger is at play here as well.
I think a lot of us, well-intentioned though we may be, fail to keep our own egos in check when we're observing and participating in our kids' childhoods.
Their grades become a measure of our parenting, rather than a measure of how well they grasped the academic material in front of them.
Their colleges become the grand finale of our 18 years of work - the ultimate return on investment - rather than a place for them to build on their 18 years of life so far - and a place from which to launch into the rest of their decades.
Their sports? Oh, man. Their sports. I have watched grown-ups take a child's game and turn it into a high-stakes pressure cooker more times than I care to count. Grown-ups yelling at 15-year-old umpires. Grown-ups yelling at their kids' opponents, who also happen to be kids, of course. Grown-ups yelling at other grown-ups about who was out, what was foul, whether that kid was offside, whether that judge is biased. So very much yelling.
I have watched my son come home from various games and turn to the cold comfort of his Xbox, where he can control the wins and losses on Madden NFL 20 and no one's screaming at his teammates from the sidelines or the bleachers. I have watched, on some days, a video game become more fun than a real game played with real humans.
Are these the same forces that killed "OK, Boomer"? It all sounds a little overwrought, I realize.
But I do think it's worth asking ourselves, in any situation, but particularly in parenting: Is this really about me?
Haven't younger generations always been skeptical of older generations? Isn't "OK, Boomer" just the latest version of the '60s mantra, "Don't trust anyone over 30?" Couldn't we have shrugged this one off?
It's too late for "OK, Boomer," which has officially jumped the shark.
The other stuff though - the bigger stuff, the stuff that takes up more time and space in our kids' hearts and schedules and futures - I think that stuff is worth pausing and thinking hard about.
It's their childhood. We had ours. We can and should be there for as much of it as we possibly can. That's a gift and an honor. But we should also resist the urge to hold up their childhood as some kind of mirror to check our own reflections or boost our own egos.
I'm speaking to myself as much as anyone. It's tricky to find that sweet spot just before becoming overinvested, especially when you love these people more than life itself.
Maybe "OK, Boomer" can be our canary in the coal mine. Maybe "OK, Boomer" can remind us, when all else fails, to be a little better at laughing stuff off.

Texto completo: The 2019 college admissions scandal exposed both parents and college personnel willing to engage in fraud to ensure admission of probably undeserving children to "elite" colleges. In addition, Arizona State University was unfairly scandalized by Mossimo Giannulli (the husband of actor Lori Loughlin) when he wrote in an email that he wanted to make sure that his daughter got "into a school other than ASU!" ASU President Michael Crow responded in a recently published New York Times op-ed aptly titled, "It's time to end the obsession with college exclusivity."
My colleague and I are proud to be faculty members at ASU, a university with a charter that states it should be "measured not by whom it excludes, but rather by whom it includes and how they succeed." Not a bad ideal for parents to consider when helping their children choose a university. But does this aspiration lead to accomplishment?
To help enlighten readers about accomplishment, here is a partial list of amazing students who won various awards in just one ASU department (Psychology) in just one year (2018-2019 academic year):
Libby Villalobos is the Dean's Medalist in Psychology. Each of the 18 science departments in the ASU College of Liberal Arts and Sciences chooses a medalist from among 4,000 students. Villalobos first attracted attention when she applied to be an undergraduate teaching assistant before she was even enrolled at ASU. As a homeless, single mother, she was determined to use education to help overcome poverty. She has maintained an A+ average while working at the Women's Refugee Health Clinic and in two labs. Her goal is to obtain a J.D. and Ph.D. and become an advocate for underserved populations.
Eleanor Rodriguez is the winner of the Phillip Mickelson Award for Excellence in Psychology (PGA champion Mickelson was a psychology major at ASU). At the age of 13, she told her parents she would like to go to college rather than high school. With their support, she applied, was accepted and graduated at age 17 with a bachelor of science degree in education and dance. She has received national recognition in ballet, figure skating and archery. She has now returned to college at ASU as a Barrett Honors student to earn another degree majoring in psychology and minoring in kinesiology.
Elliot Smith is the winner of the Ernest Lindholm Award for Outstanding Senior in Biopsychology. Ms. Smith is a Barrett honors student double majoring in Psychology and Biophysics. She has served as an aide for the ASU Physics mentoring program, an academic facilitator and mentor for the ASU Sundial Program. She's helped to organize and chair multiple student conferences and is co-author of a publication.
Anna Yee is the winner of the John W. Reich Prize in Applied Social Psychology. She is a Barrett Honors student double majoring in psychology and neuroscience. In addition to her lab work, she volunteers at an outreach wellness clinic for the homeless, has been a research assistant at an ASU center for applied ethics, was a Mayo Clinic premed scholar and is a volunteer medical intern in Argentina.
Nicole Richards is one of the winners of the Zita M. Johnson Child Study Scholarship. Richards is diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. Nonetheless, she is a Barrett Honors student double majoring in psychology and sociology with a minor in studio art. In addition, she works in two labs, serves as an undergraduate representative on the college student affairs and grievances committee. She plans to earn a Ph.D. in developmental psychology and to specialize in parenting of children who experience pain.
Measuring ASU by the success of these students would surely put it among the elites.
Dr. Arthur Glenberg is a professor of psychology and Dr. Lynda Mae a principal lecturer of psychology at Arizona State University.

'Anonymous' warns that Trump won't 'exit quietly'

Texto completo: The anonymous official who has written a scathing account of the presidency of Donald Trump suggests that the president might refuse to leave office even if convicted in impeachment hearings or defeated narrowly in the 2020 election – and says he is preparing his followers to see either outcome as a "coup" that could warrant resistance.
"He will not exit quietly – or easily," the author, self-described as a senior administration official, writes in "A Warning," a book that builds on an explosive op-ed by the same unnamed author last year. An early copy was obtained by USA TODAY.
"It is why at many turns he suggests 'coups' are afoot and a 'civil war' is in the offing. He is already seeding the narrative for his followers – a narrative that could end tragically."
As the House of Representatives prepares to open public impeachment hearings Wednesday, the book also says that Trump ordered aides more than a year ago to pursue a "deliberate and coordinated campaign" to obstruct an impeachment inquiry and other congressional investigations. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff has said he is considering obstruction of Congress as a possible article of impeachment.
The book's author is identified only as "a senior official in the Trump administration," and its forthcoming publication has created a firestorm over both its depiction of a dysfunctional president and the decision by the writer to remain anonymous.
"The coward who wrote this book didn't put their name on it because it is nothing but lies," White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said.
Many of the disclosures echo news stories that have portrayed the president as impulsive, sometimes uninformed and regularly willing to defy established norms. There is already no shortage of books by Trump critics, including former FBI director James Comey and others who have served in his administration, that raise questions about the president's fitness for office.
But the New York Times op-ed in 2018 and the new book, being published Tuesday by Twelve, have commanded enormous attention because the author had an inside view, often participating in small White House meetings where crucial decisions were made.
The author portrays himself or herself as sharing some policy views with Trump and initially having a positive if wary view of his presidency.
The author says the intended audience for "A Warning" isn't those who closely follow politics but rather those who don't, particularly voters from across the country who were drawn in 2016 to Trump's promise to shake up the establishment.
Dropping Pence from the ticket?
The book says that Trump "on more than one occasion" discussed with staffers the possibility of dropping Vice President Mike Pence before the 2020 election.
"Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley was under active consideration to step in as vice president, which she did not discourage at first," the author writes, saying some advisers argued that putting Haley on the ticket would help the president bolster his support among female voters.
In an interview Friday with USA TODAY, Nikki Haley dismissed the suggestion that she might replace Pence. In her new book, "With All Due Respect," Haley offers a generally positive portrait of Trump, and the president rewarded her with a friendly tweet urging his millions of followers to buy a copy.
"Anonymous" depicts Trump as impatient, immoral, cruel, even dangerous as he rejects the limits placed on presidents by Congress and the courts.
As the 2018 midterm elections approached, the book says, the White House counsel's office began to develop a "contingency plan" to shield the administration if Democrats gained control of Congress, and with that the ability to launch inquiries and issue subpoenas. New lawyers were hired and procedures revamped, the author says.
A mission to obstruct, author says
"The goal wasn't just to prepare for a barrage of legislative requests," the book says. "It was a concerted attempt to fend off congressional oversight. When Democrats finally took the House, the unspoken administration policy toward Capitol Hill became: Give as little as possible, wait as long as possible. Even routine inquiries are now routed to the lawyers, who have found unique ways to say, "We can't right now," "Give us a few months," "We're going to need to put you on hold," "Probably not," "No," and "Not a chance in hell."
The author says the administration's refusal to comply with congressional requests and even subpoenas "go beyond standard practice and have turned into a full block-and-tackle exercise against congressional investigators across an array of Trump administration controversies."
On the president's actions with Ukraine, now the heart of the impeachment inquiry, the author writes that the idea Trump was trying to battle corruption abroad – rather than gain some partisan political advantage at home – was "barely believable to anyone around him."
But the book provides no significant new information or insights into that episode.
'Get Out of Jail Free' cards
The author's agent, Matt Latimer, said the author didn't take an advance payment for the book and plans to donate a substantial amount of the royalties to nonprofit organizations that encourage government accountability and an independent press.
Among other allegations, the book says:
Several top advisers and Cabinet-level officials last year discussed a mass resignation, "a midnight self-massacre," intended to call attention to what they saw as Trump's questionable and even corrupt behavior. "The idea was abandoned out of fear that it would make a bad situation worse."
If a majority of the Cabinet called for Trump's removal under the rules of the 25th Amendment, Pence would have been willing to go along with them. But the author provides no evidence to back up that assertion, and Pence has strongly denied it.
Trump told officials that, if they took illegal actions on his behalf, he would give them presidential pardons. "To Donald Trump, these are unlimited 'Get Out of Jail Free' cards on a Monopoly board."

He wants you to drink better beer

Texto completo: Author Joshua M. Bernstein has written five books on craft beer, including “Drink Better Beer," released last month. In addition, Bernstein contributes beer and travel coverage to the New York Times, Men's Journal, and Imbibe.
I recently caught up with Bernstein to discuss his latest book, industry trends, and more.
Q. You write that the release of your last book, in 2013, seems like “sixty-five million years ago." What have been some of the biggest shifts in beer since then?
A. Six years ago, American craft beer was sitting in a hot air balloon that seemed to be soaring ever higher, no end in sight. Bitter IPAs were all the rage, and we bought beer at grocery and liquor stores in bottles, not cans. Now, hazy IPAs that flaunt juicy, tropical aromas and flavors and scant bitterness rule the land, the beers sold in 16-ounce cans directly from taprooms where — why not! — folks might stick around for another round served on site. The biggest shifts are where we buy beer, and where we drink beer.
Q. What are your favorite beer trends right now?
A. I'm psyched to see, slowly and steadily, that brewers are gravitating back toward traditional styles. Look, it's great to make something that tastes like your favorite childhood cereal, a beer to drink once and maybe never again — because it's never brewed again — but I like the trend toward refining pilsners and lagers and other classic styles, served in proper glassware with the right amount of foam on top.
Q. What are your least-favorite trends?
A. There's a beer for everyone, that's for sure. But I'm not the biggest fan of dessert-style stouts that are packed with excess alcohol, sugar, and enough candy bars to stock a corner store. I also have zero sweet tooth, so perhaps this isn't a trend for me, but I don't get excited about beers that I can only sip by the ounce, maybe two. I want to have a full pint and talk to folks, the beer a companion to conversation.
Q. You've got a section on hard seltzer in there. What are your thoughts on that trend?
A. Seltzer, in its booze-free form, is all about bubbly refreshment. It's a guilt-free pleasure. Hard seltzer has borrowed the healthy veneer, offering an of-the-moment mix of low calories, invigorating carbonation, and restrained alcohol content. You can also drink a couple of them, maybe five or six, while sitting at the beach on a sweltering summer day. Will the trend have lasting traction? I don't think we'll be making White Claw memes five years from now. We're always looking for a new flavor of the month. But if you reframe hard seltzer as a premixed, portable vodka soda, then you can see its appeal. If breweries want to make hard seltzer, go for it! It's fermentation. Brewers are good at fermenting things. Brewing is also a business. And as the industry grows more competitive and the taproom model evolves, it's imperative to offer drinks that might tickle everyone's fancy.
Q. I wonder how your own personal beer preferences have changed over the years.
A. When I first dove into beer more than 15 years ago, I used to chase intensities with the best of them, always seeking out flavors that were cranked high. Now, though, I've learned to appreciate beers that speak in whispers and conversational tones, not shouts. I want to get to know a Munich helles lager over several rounds, as well as knock back a couple Czech-style pilsners. Also, I seek out beers with a more moderate ABV. My liver isn't quite as fresh as it once was, and my first-grade daughter wakes up at the same time — 6 a.m. or so — every single day.
Q. You mention London and Brussels as go-to beer destinations. Are there any others that you'd highly recommend?
A. Don't sleep on domestic beer tourism. The great thing about America's brewery boom is that you'll find thriving and compelling scenes anywhere and everywhere. Go to Austin, Texas, and drink your way through the city's pilsners, or travel to Chicago and explore the town's deft integration of beer and food. I was just in Jacksonville, Fla., and I found a bundle of great breweries, many perched in the city's strip malls — the local version of the old abandoned warehouse. From regional flavor preferences to repurposed infrastructure, there's a wealth of amazing beer being made anywhere and everywhere. To experience it, you need to get in a car, plane, or train and drink up the local culture, one pint at a time.
Q. What's the best beer experience you can remember?
A. The day after my daughter was born, I bought a case of Sierra Nevada Celebration, the brewery's annual fresh-hop IPA. I sipped a cold bottle in the hospital while cradling Violet, a touch of bitterness bringing immeasurable joy to that memorable November day.
Bernstein will be at Samuel Adams' Boston brewery for a book event on Nov. 18 from 6 to 8 p.m.

Texto completo: On the male-dominated black market, a permit for mobile food vending can easily cost $ 25,000.
The hot dog carts that are synonymous with New York City street food are run mostly by men. So are the ice cream stands in Central Park, and the halal carts dishing out aromatic tins of chicken and rice in Midtown.
But just as much a part of New York City life, if harder to spot, are the female street vendors, who often hawk their wares from small pushcarts. They sell things like sliced mangos on busy street corners, churros on subway platforms and Italian ices outside of schools in warm weather, usually for a dollar or two.
A video of police officers handcuffing a woman selling churros on Friday in a subway station in Brooklyn has focused attention on this subset of street sellers, who generally work without permits or permanent locations. That puts them at risk of fines, property confiscation and arrest.
Their decision to work illegally, those who study street vendors say, is linked to a broader problem: It is practically impossible to get a permit for mobile food vending in New York City, except on the black market. In that booming, male-dominated economy, $ 200 city-issued permits, good for two years, can easily rent for upward of $ 25,000 each.
The woman's detention was also part of a string of recent incidents posted to social media that some say highlight aggressive policing in the subways, even as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo calls for 500 more officers to join the force. On Monday afternoon, another woman was arrested after selling churros at a different station in Brooklyn. The police said she had two outstanding warrants, for prior summonses for selling unlicensed food.
Edward Delatorre, the chief of the Police Department's transit bureau, said a common theme was that people refused to cooperate with the police.
"When people don't follow our requests or commands, there's a potential for escalation," Chief Delatorre said at a Metropolitan Transportation Authority board meeting on Tuesday.
Why is there a black market for mobile food vending licenses?
To operate legally, mobile food vendors need two documents: a mobile food vending license for themselves, which costs $ 50, and a mobile food vending permit for each cart or food truck, which costs $ 200.
The city limits the number of citywide mobile food vending permits to 2,900 -- a cap that has remained unchanged since 1983. Even though an additional 2,200 permits are issued for things like seasonal food selling and fruit and vegetable vendors, demand far exceeds supply.
Because of the permits' scarcity, the market for them functions a bit like the taxi medallion market, said Mohamed Attia, executive director of the Street Vendor Project, which supports lifting the cap. Owners sometimes lease their permits to other vendors -- mostly poor, immigrant families -- for upward of 125 times the price, which can drive the vendors into debt.
This practice violates city Department of Health regulations, because the permits are nontransferable. As a result, Mr. Attia said, transactions are typically all-cash deals and no paperwork is exchanged, leaving the lessees particularly vulnerable.
Kabir Ahmed, a halal cart vendor profiled by The New York Times in 2017, for example, said he had paid $ 25,000 to lease his license.
"We think it doesn't make any sense that they are able to get vending licenses, but not vending permits," Mr. Attia said.
How many people are waiting for vending permits?
New York capped its wait-list for citywide permits in 2007, when there were 2,500 names on it, Mr. Attia said. So, vendors who have gone into business since then are likely leasing their permits. The Street Vendor Project estimates that some 20,000 vendors work on the city's streets, more than half of whom sell food.
Immigration status is not a central factor limiting people's access to their own permits, Mr. Attia added. Undocumented immigrants can get both mobile food vending licenses and permits, because only a tax identification number is required for them.
A special class of permits exists for disabled veterans, who are permitted to sell food along the perimeter of city parks without restriction. Also, unlimited permits can be granted for food vending on private property, with a lease agreement from the owner, the Department of Health said.
What can be changed?
The City Council is considering legislation to gradually increase the number of mobile food vending permits over the next several years. Councilman Rafael L. Espinal Jr. said on Monday that 29 Council members had signed on; his district includes the subway station, Broadway Junction, where the woman was handcuffed on Friday.
In the State Senate, Jessica Ramos of Queens has introduced a bill that would eliminate caps on the number of food and merchandise street vendors statewide. The legislation is similar to a recent law in California that largely legalized street selling.
"It's about legalizing their small businesses," Ms. Ramos said.
What are the concerns about adding permits?
Opponents of issuing more permits, which include the restaurant industry and various business improvement district groups, say the changes would hurt brick-and-mortar storefronts and congest sidewalks. They want robust enforcement of the existing rules and more regulations dictating where street vendors can operate.
Mayor Bill de Blasio did not throw his weight behind adding permits in 2017, when an earlier version of the bill was considered in the City Council. He has since said he supports an increase.
Also in 2017, the city's Department of Health warned that without additional sanitary commissaries to house food carts, and better enforcement of the smoke some of them produce, more carts could pose health challenges.
Did the churro seller detained last week have a permit?
On Friday, several police officers surrounded Elsa Morochoduchi, a 43-year-old immigrant from Ecuador who was selling churros in a subway station, which is not permitted by the M.T.A. They handcuffed her, confiscated her cart and ultimately gave her a summons.
Mr. Attia said that he had later met with Ms. Morochoduchi and that she did not have a vending license or a permit for her churro cart. If she had both documents, she would have been able to sell on the street, but not in the station.
Is she typical of women selling food on the street?
Yes. In October, the Urban Justice Center published what it believes is the first survey of female street vendors in New York. Of the 50 women surveyed, 36 were from Mexico or Ecuador, like Elsa. Their average age was 46, and most were the primary breadwinners in their families.
The vendors typically lived in Queens, Brooklyn or the Bronx, and 72 percent of them did not have vending permits. The women said the work could be dangerous, but some said they still preferred it over domestic or restaurant work, their other main employment options.
What percentage of vendors are women?
The issue is lightly researched, so it is impossible to know. On the lucrative, tourist-rich corners of Manhattan, mobile food vendors tend to be men. But in some immigrant neighborhoods, the majority of the sellers are women.
In Corona, Queens, for example, a Street Vendor Project survey in 2017 found that 79 percent of the vendors were women. The organization also found that women seem to be disproportionately penalized for street vending.
In 2018, 57 percent of the tickets for unlicensed mobile food vending were issued to women, according to data from the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. At the same time, only 22 percent of the 46,000 people who received mobile food vending licenses from 2000 to 2018 were female, the Street Vendor Project found.
Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Azi Paybarah contributed reporting.

Texto completo: ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar - The Russians were hard to miss. They appeared suddenly last year in Madagascar's traffic-snarled capital, carrying backpacks stuffed with cash and campaign swag decorated with the name of Madagascar's president.
It was one of Russia's most overt attempts at election interference to date. Working from their headquarters in a resort hotel, the Russians published their own newspaper in the local language and hired students to write fawning articles about the president to help him win another term. Skirting electoral laws, they bought airtime on television stations and blanketed the country with billboards.
They paid young people to attend rallies and journalists to cover them. They showed up with armed bodyguards at campaign offices to bribe challengers to drop out of the race to clear their candidate's path.
At Madagascar's election commission, officials were alarmed.
"We all recall what the Russians did in the United States during the election," said Thierry Rakotonarivo, the commission's vice president. "We were truly afraid."
Of all the places for Russia to try to swing a presidential election, Madagascar is perhaps one of the least expected. The island nation off the coast of southeastern Africa is thousands of miles from Moscow and has little obvious strategic value for the Kremlin or the global balance of power.
The operation was approved by President Vladimir Putin and coordinated by some of the same figures who oversaw the disinformation around the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to dozens of interviews with officials in Madagascar, local operatives hired to take part in the Russian campaign and hundreds of pages of internal documents produced by Russian operatives.
The meddling in Madagascar began just a few weeks after Putin sat down with the nation's president, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, in Moscow last year. The meeting, which has never been reported, also included Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close confidant of Putin who was indicted in the United States for helping to orchestrate Russia's effort to manipulate the 2016 U.S. election.
Putin has repeatedly denied any official effort to tamper with foreign elections. But his sit-down with Madagascar's president - Prigozhin by his side - points to his involvement in Russia's electoral interference in even the smallest, most remote countries.
In some vital ways, the Madagascar operation mimicked the one in the United States. There was a disinformation campaign on social media and an attempt to bolster so-called spoiler candidates. The Russians even recruited an apocalyptic cult leader in a strategy to split the opposition vote and sink its chances.
But while Russia's efforts in the United States fit Moscow's campaign to upend Western democracy and rattle Putin's geopolitical rivals, the undertaking in Madagascar often seemed to have a much simpler objective: profit.
Before the election, a Russian company that local officials and foreign diplomats said is controlled by Prigozhin acquired a major stake in a government-run company that mines chromium, a mineral valued for its use in stainless steel. The acquisition set off protests by workers complaining of unpaid wages, canceled benefits and foreign intrusion into a sector that had been a source of national pride for Madagascar.
It repeated a pattern in which Russia has swooped into African nations, hoping to reshape their politics for material gain. In the Central African Republic, a former Russian intelligence officer is the top security adviser to the country's president, while companies linked to Prigozhin have spread across the nation, snapping up diamonds in both legal and illegal ways, according to government officials, warlords in the diamond trade and registration documents showing Prigozhin's growing military and commercial footprint.
But Russia's forays abroad have been far from flawless. For all its efforts, the operation in Madagascar missed its mark at first, plagued by a startling incompetence and corruption that undercuts Russia's image as a master political manipulator.
Campaign materials were riddled with grammatical mistakes. Ballpoint pens meant as election giveaways misspelled Rajaonarimampianina's name. Some operatives appeared to undermine the campaign for their own personal gain, demanding fake receipts with double the actual price of publishing the newspaper so they could pocket the difference.
One person working for the campaign described packets of gold and precious stones piled on the bed in the room of a Russian operative, another sign that the people entrusted with the mission were often more interested in profit than politics.
They also chose the wrong candidate. As it became clear that Rajaonarimampianina had little hope of winning, even with their help, Russian operatives pivoted quickly, dumping the incumbent and shifting their support to the eventual winner, Andry Rajoelina.
The maneuver worked. After the Russians pirouetted to help Rajoelina - their former opponent - win the election, Prigozhin's company was able to negotiate with the new government to keep control of the chromium mining operation, despite the worker protests, and Prigozhin's political operatives remain stationed in the capital to this day.

Thousands of Twitter 'bots' targeted Kentucky with fake news on election night

Texto completo: As the final votes trickled in during last week's Kentucky gubernatorial election, a network of automated Twitter accounts suddenly sprang into action.
They spread misinformation about the election being rigged, according to the CEO of a company that tracks political misinformation on social media.
Gideon Blocq, the founder and CEO of VineSight, told The Courier Journal his company witnessed thousands of accounts with "bot-like" automated behavior spreading misinformation about the race, including a screenshot of a tweet by one account claiming to have destroyed ballots with votes for incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.
"Immediately at the end of the counting of the votes, these stories started popping up in parallel, all about the election being rigged," Block said.
One of the tweets spreading the furthest came from user @Overlordkraken1, which tweeted at 8:39 p.m. he had "just shredded a box of Republican mail in ballots," adding "Bye bye Bevin." The tweet listed the user's location as Louisville, though it misspelled the word.
Bevin would end up losing to Democratic Andy Beshear by 5,189 votes, though the governor told supporters at 10 p.m. Tuesday that he would not concede the race, sighting unspecified voting "irregularities."
The next day, Bevin requested an official recanvass of the vote, alleging widespread fraud and "thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted." In a Courier Journal fact check of Bevin's claims, local elections officials refer to the allegations as "ridiculous" and "flatly not true."
The governor has not provided any proof for such claims, and spokespersons for his office and campaign have not responded to questions asking if this tweet plays into Bevin's allegations.
After being retweeted at least 91 times, the account was suspended -- though Blocq said a screenshot of the tweet was then posted Tuesday night and "we saw huge bot networks just pushing it around."
While the suspended account was likely a real person just "trolling" with the shredding tweet, Blocq said "thousands" of bot accounts spread the screenshot in parallel with other tweets alleging that the election was rigged, showing "this is not a small operation... it is not just one person doing this."
By early Wednesday, someone created a meme suggesting thousands of votes for Bevin were not counted because every other Republican candidate on the ballot did so well. That also spread rapidly among social media. For example, one Twitter account with more than 117,000 followers tweeted the meme along with the word "rigged!" which was retweeted more than 1,000 times over the next day, mostly by bot accounts.
Blocq said by Thursday evening, a simple search for the Kentucky election on Twitter would turn up tweets including the screenshot, meme and other claims about the election being rigged in its top results.
While the influence of Kremlin-backed groups to spread misinformation in the 2016 presidential campaign is well documented, Blocq said he could not determine the origin of the bot network pushing tweets about the Kentucky race, as he can only see publicly-available data. However, he said that those working at Twitter would have more answers about the location of the bots.
Twitter told The New York Times this weekend that the spread of misinformation regarding the Kentucky race for governor largely appeared to originate in the United States.
The Department of Homeland Security tracks foreign interference in U.S. elections that exploits divisions through the spread of misinformation on social networks.
Bevin's requested recanvass will take place on Thursday, with voting officials in each county checking to make sure they transmitted the correct numbers to the secretary of state.
Republican state legislators have expressed skepticism that the recanvass will significantly change the official vote totals and warned against Bevin creating a "fishing expedition" by contesting the election in the legislature if that is the case.
Some legislators have also urged the governor to present evidence of fraud or voting irregularities to the public if he has any, saying making such claims without any proof undermines faith in the democratic system.
"Any attempt by Gov. Bevin to undermine these results in the legislature is wrong and should be viewed as a direct attack on the democratic process." state Sen. Morgan McGarcy, D-Louisville, said. "Once the recanvass is complete, the General Assembly must accept the outcome of this election and help Gov.-elect Beshear prepare for the 2020 budget.

La publicación era la última de la marca Hoy que quedaba en funcionamiento. Hoy nació en Nueva York en 1998, y se expandió a Chicago y Los Ángeles al ser adquirido por Tribune Co. en 2000 .
Impremedia, propietaria de El Diario y La Opinión, adquirió Hoy Nueva York en 2007, cuando era un diario de distribución gratuita. El medio cerró en 2009.
En agosto pasado, el semanario Hoy Los Ángeles fue cerrado por Los Angeles Times para dar paso a Los Angeles Times en Español, que solamente opera de manera digital.
Tribune Publishing ofreció a los empleados de Hoy Chicago vincularse a plazas abiertas en el Chicago Tribune.
El sindicato del Chicago Tribune lamentó el cierre de Hoy.
“Estamos profundamente decepcionados de que Tribune Publishing esté cerrando Hoy, que ha ido más allá de los estereotipos y ha proporcionado noticias significativas al vasto cuerpo de hispanohablantes en nuestra región. Esto es perjudicial para nuestros periodistas, nuestros lectores y nuestra empresa”, escribió el sindicato en su cuenta de Twitter.
We're deeply disappointed that Tribune Publishing is shutting down Hoy, which has gone beyond stereotypes and provided meaningful news to the vast body of Spanish-speakers in our region. This is a disservice to our journalists, our readers and our company.

Deval Patrick wants to run for president. What in the world was he thinking?

Texto completo: God, grant me the confidence of a pulse-having politician from Massachusetts, where anybody who's ever wrangled 8,000 votes in an uncontested race in North Attleborough is secretly convinced that they ought to be president.
Ted Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, John Kerry, Mitt Romney, Jill Stein, Jill Stein again, Seth Moulton. . . . Welcome to Massachusetts, here's your Charlie Card and your paperwork to get on the ballot in New Hampshire. In the 2020 race, both major parties have a Massachusetts option: Elizabeth Warren, of course, and Bill Weld, who is “running" for the Republican nomination the way I “run" on the treadmill after lunch at Mr. Bartley's.
And now comes former governor Deval Patrick, who is making a last-minute bid for the Democratic nomination, on the grounds that the roughly 400 people already seeking said nomination have failed to establish “political momentum."
It was this unmistakable and definitely real concept of political momentum, of course, that propelled Hillary Clinton to her landmark victory in 2016. . . . Just a moment, I'm getting a message in my earpiece. Oh my. Oh dear. I have just received some troubling news .
I'm old enough to remember when Patrick said he wasn't running. It was way, way back in the sepia-toned days of November 2018. Let me tell you, youngsters, those were interesting times. Men were men and women were women and Hollywood was churning out classics like “Ralph Breaks the Internet," which was tops at the box office.
Ah, the good old days. So much has changed! The culture of cruelty that surrounded our elections, which Patrick decried when he decided not to run, is mercifully behind us now — ah, hang on, getting something in my earpiece again . . . uh oh. Oh no.
Just when you thought Michael Bloomberg was getting in too late and for no good reason — he's from Massachusetts, too, by the way, though neither of us likes to talk about it — here's Patrick, even later, and without the giant pile of money Bloomberg is so eager to set on fire.
Warren is already running as strong a campaign as any Massachusetts liberal has in decades. Massachusetts is sufficiently represented on the national stage. And yet, I'm half-expecting Moulton to announce that he's considering a last-minute run for president, hoping everyone has forgotten he already did that. Is, I dunno, Martha Coakley shoring up support somewhere just in case?
Imagine looking upon this very strong field of candidates and seeing a hole in the lineup that is exactly your size and shape, whether you're Bloomberg or Patrick. It is true that support in polls is divided between moderate options like former vice president and current Medium.com blogger Joe Biden and Brad Stevens impersonator Pete Buttigieg; and the “progressive senator from New England" hive (Bernie Sanders, Warren). It is also true that exactly zero votes have been cast and won't be for months.
Allowing Democratic primary voters to winnow the field via months of campaigning and debates, narrowing it down to a few front-runners and sorting that out during the primaries sounds like a pretty good way to pick a candidate, actually. Complaints about a lack of good options aren't something you'll hear from actual Democratic primary voters this time around.
This is a race in which incredibly accomplished and impressive candidates like Senators Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris appear to be also-rans. Beto O'Rourke turned out to be kind of a weirdo and it didn't matter at all because there were still a dozen people worthy of serious consideration.
No, the only people complaining about the field are Republicans, who love to provide free, useless advice to Democrats about how the secret to winning is becoming indistinguishable from Republicans.
You want to know who has bad options? Republicans. They're choosing among a semicoherent, obviously corrupt Twitter addict who will soon be impeached, a couple of vanity candidates, and Bill Weld. But please, tell us more about how a field featuring a popular former vice president, four accomplished senators (and the reportedly annoying mayor of South Bend, Ind., for some reason) is a dry hole.
So here's some free advice for Republicans, whose field is looking mighty weak indeed. There's another Massachusetts governor — the current one, actually — who might be able to save your party. The bad news is that he's the only politician in the history of Massachusetts who doesn't seem to want the job.

Texto completo: There's a cost to caring too much.
Two prominent mental health counselors – a resilience expert at an Ivy League college and a megachurch pastor – died by suicide in September. At the 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Health Means Business summit, Arianna Huffington, sleep evangelist and author of "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time," said people who toil in the charitable space often have the most trouble detaching from work and, well, going to bed.
Justin Phillips, a mother who lost her son to a drug overdose, is trying to start the #chooseempathy movement. She founded Overdose Lifeline to raise awareness that addiction is not a choice and requires empathetic responses.
Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and self-described empath, agrees society needs more empathy given the rising rates of addiction, suicide and mental illness, among other challenges. But she cautions those who choose to be empathic – or find it comes naturally – of the need to care for themselves first.
The New York Times best-selling author's new book, "Thriving as an Empath: 365 Days of Self-Care for Sensitive People," is in stores. She talks with health policy reporter Jayne O'Donnell, who calls herself an "overempathizer."
Question: How do you know if you are an empath? What are the character traits?
Dr. Judith Orloff: Ordinary empathy is the ability to feel someone else's pain as well as their joy, the ability for us to be open-hearted. It's such a beautiful trait. Being an empath, however, goes further. Empaths have extremely sensitive neurological systems and don't have the usual filters that other people have, so they feel things intensely and often are emotional sponges who take on other people's stress if they don't learn how to set boundaries and practice other self-care techniques ... Most empaths are introverts like myself, but some are extroverts who love socializing but still need to decompress afterwards to take care of themselves. As part of my research on empaths, I developed a 20-question self-assessment test in my earlier book, "The Empath's Survival Guide," to determine if you are an empath. Some of the questions include: Have I been labeled as overly sensitive? (in a derogatory way). Do crowds drain me, and do I need a lot of alone time to replenish myself? Do I take on other people's stress or emotions? Do I replenish myself in nature? Am I super-sensitive to noise, smells and excessive talking? Empaths have many special challenges and also many gifts.
Q: There's a clear need for more empathy in our country, isn't there?
Orloff: I believe empathy is the most precious trait in human nature. We need more of it in our country and in the world. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes so you can see their point of view. Empathy is so powerful because it opens our hearts. It allows us to try to understand another person's position, even if we don't particularly like them or if we disagree on an issue. This gives us the best chance of successfully communicating with them and resolving differences.
Q: But there are risks in caring too much, aren't there?
Orloff: Yes, I've seen many of my patients, including empaths and all sensitive people, care too much and become burned out by empathy overload – or get involved with addictions, including substances, food and sex to numb themselves out. In my psychotherapy practice, there has been an epidemic of empathic patients consulting me who are exhausted, anxious, depressed and overwhelmed by added stress in their personal lives, which is aggravated by our world's non-stop stress. Arianna Huffington reports that over two-thirds of doctors in the U.S. say they are burned out, depressed or both! Plus the general suicide rate in our country just keeps going up. Those in the helping professions have trouble turning stress off so they also tend to experience impaired sleep and increased anxiety.
Q: What are the most effective ways for empaths to establish boundaries?
Orloff: Taking adequate alone time is essential to decompress. When my empath patients go nonstop in their jobs or as parents – without periodically slowing down – they risk chronic exhaustion and anxiety. Scheduling mini-breaks in your life to take a few deep breaths, spending some quiet time without phone calls, demands or over-stimulation, taking a walk or meditating for even a few minutes will break the momentum of stress and prevent sensory overload. Also I teach all my patients that "no is a complete sentence."
Q: Shouldn't we all try to be better listeners and responders to those going through hard times?
Orloff: Being a caring listener is one of the great empathic gifts we can give others. But we don't have to listen for hours on end to be effective. Giving someone your caring attention for five to 10 minutes can be very potent, as opposed to getting hooked into repetitive two-hour phone conversations that wear you out. "I love you and I will be thinking of you" is a wonderful thing to say after responding to the person for a limited time. Also, I recommend having short check-ins with the person. A technique I suggest in "Thriving as an Empath" is the "3 Minute Phone Call." This is when you tell the person you're available for this period of time and you want to support them. As an empathic person, you adore giving, but what I hope my book will provide you with are strategies to give in healthy ways – but also practice self-care so you can be a balanced, happy person.

Twitter bots spread fake news about election

Texto completo: As the final votes trickled in during last week's Kentucky gubernatorial election, a network of automated Twitter accounts suddenly sprang into action.
They spread misinformation about the election being rigged, according to the CEO of a company that tracks political misinformation on social media.
Gideon Blocq, the founder and CEO of VineSight, told The Courier Journal his company witnessed thousands of accounts with "bot-like" automated behavior spreading misinformation about the race, including a screenshot of a tweet by one account claiming to have destroyed ballots with votes for incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.
"Immediately at the end of the counting of the votes, these stories started popping up in parallel, all about the election being rigged," Block said.
One of the tweets spreading the furthest came from user @Overlordkraken1, which tweeted at 8:39 p.m. he had "just shredded a box of Republican mail in ballots," adding "Bye bye Bevin." The tweet listed the user's location as Louisville, though it misspelled the word.
Bevin would end up losing to Democrat Andy Beshear by 5,189 votes, though the governor told supporters at 10 p.m. Tuesday that he would not concede the race, citing unspecified voting "irregularities."
The next day, Bevin requested an official recanvass of the vote, alleging widespread fraud and "thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted."
In a Courier Journal fact check of Bevin's claims, local elections officials refer to the allegations as "ridiculous" and "flatly not true."
The governor has not provided any proof for such claims, and spokespersons for his office and campaign have not responded to questions asking if this tweet plays into Bevin's allegations.
After being retweeted at least 91 times, the account was suspended — though Blocq said a screenshot of the tweet was then posted Tuesday night and "we saw huge bot networks just pushing it around."
While the suspended account was likely a real person just "trolling" with the shredding tweet, Blocq said "thousands" of bot accounts spread the screenshot in parallel with other tweets alleging that the election was rigged, showing "this is not a small operation ... it is not just one person doing this."
By early Wednesday, someone created a meme suggesting thousands of votes for Bevin were not counted because every other Republican candidate on the ballot did so well. That also spread rapidly among social media. For example, one Twitter account with more than 117,000 followers tweeted the meme along with the word "rigged!" which was retweeted more than 1,000 times over the next day, mostly by bot accounts.
Blocq said by Thursday evening, a simple search for the Kentucky election on Twitter would turn up tweets including the screenshot, meme and other claims about the election being rigged in its top results.
While the influence of Kremlin-backed groups to spread misinformation in the 2016 presidential campaign is well documented, Blocq said he could not determine the origin of the bot network pushing tweets about the Kentucky race, as he can only see publicly available data. However, he said that those working at Twitter would have more answers about the location of the bots.
Twitter told The New York Times this weekend that the spread of misinformation regarding the Kentucky race for governor largely appeared to originate in the United States.
The Department of Homeland Security tracks foreign interference in U.S. elections that exploits divisions through the spread of misinformation on social networks.
Bevin's requested recanvass will take place on Thursday, with voting officials in each county checking to make sure they transmitted the correct numbers to the secretary of state.
Republican state legislators have expressed skepticism that the recanvass will significantly change the official vote totals and warned against Bevin creating a "fishing expedition" by contesting the election in the legislature if that is the case.
Some legislators have also urged the governor to present evidence of fraud or voting irregularities to the public if he has any, saying making such claims without any proof undermines faith in the democratic system.
"Any attempt by Gov. Bevin to undermine these results in the legislature is wrong and should be viewed as a direct attack on the democratic process." state Sen. Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, said. "Once the recanvass is complete, the General Assembly must accept the outcome of this election and help Gov.-elect Beshear prepare for the 2020 budget."

Texto completo: An appeals court struck down a broad 1986 law under the First Amendment, saying it covers conversations between family members and legal advice.
WASHINGTON -- A 1986 federal law makes it a crime to "encourage" unauthorized immigrants to come to or stay in the United States.
"The statute potentially criminalizes the simple words -- spoken to a son, a wife, a parent, a friend, a neighbor, a co-worker, a student, a client -- 'I encourage you to stay here,"' Judge A. Wallace Tashima wrote last year for a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, in striking down the law.
The law applies to a grandmother urging a grandchild to overstay a visa or a lawyer advising a client to stay in the country while fighting deportation, Judge Tashima wrote. It may cover public officials helping immigrants in sanctuary cities and perhaps even speeches at immigration rallies, he wrote.
Last month, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the law can be squared with the First Amendment. The case, United States v. Sineneng-Smith, No. 19-67, is one of several significant immigration matters on the court's docket. On Tuesday, the court will hear arguments on whether the Trump administration can rescind protections for so-called Dreamers. Later in the term, it will consider whether immigrants can go to court to challenge orders calling for their expedited removal.
The First Amendment case concerns Evelyn Sineneng-Smith, who ran an immigration consulting firm in San Jose, Calif. Her clients, mostly from the Philippines, worked without authorization in the home health care industry. Ms. Sineneng-Smith offered to help them get green cards under a Labor Department certification program that she said would give them permanent resident status and allow them to work legally.
But the program had expired. Ms. Sineneng-Smith nonetheless charged her clients $ 6,800 to file applications she knew to be futile. She was convicted of mail fraud, a conviction that the Ninth Circuit affirmed and that Ms. Sineneng-Smith is not challenging in the Supreme Court. The question for the justices is whether her separate conviction under the 1986 law for encouraging her clients to stay in the United States was proper.
In the Ninth Circuit, Ms. Sineneng-Smith argued that she had a First Amendment right to file the applications, which was not a particularly strong argument. "Speech integral to criminal conduct," the Supreme Court has said, is not protected by the First Amendment.
When the case reached the Ninth Circuit, it did something unusual. It asked for briefing on a different First Amendment question. The court wanted to know whether the law was overbroad, chilling the free speech of people other than Ms. Sineneng-Smith.
After getting additional briefs and hearing another round of arguments, the appeals court ruled that the law was unconstitutional.
In urging the Supreme Court to hear its appeal, the Trump administration said the Ninth Circuit had gone too far. The Supreme Court has said that striking down laws because they are too broad is "strong medicine" to be used only when the laws are unconstitutional in a substantial number of real-world settings rather than in "fanciful hypotheticals."
In his Ninth Circuit opinion, Judge Tashima said that his examples of possible prosecutions "are not some parade of fanciful horribles."
"Instead," he wrote, "they represent real and constitutionally protected conversations and advice that happen daily."
Whatever the literal language of the 1986 law, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote for the government in its petition seeking review, criminal laws are "ordinarily understood not to prohibit abstract advocacy of illegality."
"Just as a teenager does not aid, abet or solicit marijuana possession merely by saying to a friend, 'I encourage you to try smoking pot,"' Mr. Francisco wrote, a grandmother does not violate the 1986 law "merely by saying to her grandson whose visa has expired, 'I encourage you to stay."'
Mr. Francisco asked the justices to decide only whether speech made for financial gain could be made criminal. The 1986 law does discuss financial gain, but in a separate provision allowing longer sentences when money is involved.
Prosecutions under the law tend to be limited to cases concerning classically criminal conduct by unsympathetic defendants. But not always. In 2012, for instance, a Massachusetts woman, Lorraine Henderson, was convicted of hiring an unauthorized immigrant to clean her home and offering general and not always reliable advice about immigration law.
In that case, Judge Douglas P. Woodlock, of the Federal District Court in Boston, wrote that the "plain and unadorned language" of the law "can be read to cast a wide net over those who interact with illegal aliens by offering employment."
Judge Woodlock did not consider First Amendment issues in his decision, but he granted Ms. Henderson's motion for a new trial based on his misgivings about the sweep of the law. Prosecutors dropped the case.
In Ms. Sineneng-Smith's case, the government argued that it did not pursue prosecutions based on ordinary interactions with unauthorized immigrants.
That was small comfort, Judge Tashima wrote. "Just because the government has not (yet) sought many prosecutions based on speech," he wrote, "it does not follow that the government cannot or will not use an overbroad law to obtain such convictions."
In the Supreme Court, Ms. Sineneng-Smith's lawyers said they should be allowed to challenge the law in order to protect the constitutional rights of other people.
"The very reason that overbroad laws are subject to facial attack," they wrote, "is to remedy the chilling effect resulting from keeping such laws on the books."

Texto completo: Engaging in a debate about whether you’re effectively brain dead is not really how you want to celebrate a big anniversary.
NATO is marking a couple of milestones this year: 70 years since its founding to counter the Soviet threat to Western Europe, and 30 years since the threat from Moscow seemed to evaporate with the fall of the Berlin Wall. There were a lot of solemn words and self-congratulations in Berlin on Saturday. And there’ll be a big party — a splashy summit meeting — early next month in Britain.
But in the meantime, the alliance is focused on a rhetorical bomb tossed last week by one of Europe’s leading statesmen, French President Emmanuel Macron.
“To my mind, what we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO,” Macron told the Economist. His case in point was what he said is a complete lack of coordination on recent developments in Syria. For good measure, the French president questioned whether the heart of the alliance, its mutual defense clause, meant much anymore.
He might be guilty of overstatement, but not by a lot. There is little doubt that the alliance has been in desperate need of new thinking for years. If you took a fresh look at NATO today, would you include Turkey, for instance? What should Europe’s relationship be with the United States? Or Russia, for that matter?
Macron also has been creating friction this fall within the other pillar of European stability, the EU. He argues that the European Union can’t effectively manage its 27 current members, much less continue doing what it has been doing regularly — take in two more countries on its periphery, in this case Albania and North Macedonia. The EU does indeed have a problem with leaders such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his so-called illiberal democracy. But what do you do about it?
All you really need to do to grasp the dire state of European affairs is realize that the two dominant figures at that NATO summit Dec. 3-4 in Britain are likely to be President Trump, who disdains and distrusts most mainstream European leaders (and whose EU ambassador is a diplomatic neophyte up to his neck in the Ukraine scandal); and Boris Johnson, who will be in final stretch of an election campaign that he hopes will give him a mandate to pull Britain out of the EU.
It also tells you something when the biggest praise for Macron’s comment about the state of an alliance created to oppose Moscow comes from … Moscow. The French president’s views on NATO are “golden words … a precise definition of the current state of NATO,” according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.
Syria is important to European leaders like Macron, not just because of what it says about Europe’s relations with important countries like Russia and Iran, but because the refugee crisis of recent years has been enormously destabilizing for their countries. France and Britain participated in air strikes the Trump administration ordered last April on what it said were chemical weapons sites in Syria. So it matters that Trump doesn’t feel the need now to consult with his allies, and that his unilateral actions have allowed NATO member Turkey to attack the Kurdish allies of France, the United States and other NATO members. Macron could have – but didn’t – mention that more broadly, Turkey has been buying advanced weapons from the Russians. He dodged, but didn’t totally reject, the question whether Turkey even belongs in NATO anymore.
Even given France’s long, complicated relationship with NATO, an influential head of state just doesn’t say some of those things. German Chancellor Angela Merkel chided Macron for his “drastic words.” But she herself came close in 2017, when European leaders first started getting an idea of what the Trump presidency and Brexit would mean. Merkel said Europe couldn’t completely depend on either the United States or London anymore.
The European Union has managed to hang together on Brexit, although there too Macron has been pushing to draw a line. If the British insist on shooting themselves in the foot, there’s not much the EU can do except stand aside, remind them how much it’s going to hurt, and try to avoid catching a ricochet.
It’s not doing so well on its eastern flank, where Poland and Hungary in particular are pushing well past what’s considered acceptable in a European democracy. If the officials responsible for the EU’s giant agricultural subsidy program aren’t brain dead, they’re not far off. As the New York Times’ lead story last Sunday made clear, Orban has weaponized the subsidy program to enrich his friends and bolster his own power, in the process squeezing out small farmers. The EU hasn’t showed much interest in stopping him.
Martin Kettle wrote recently in the Guardian that the big December party celebrating NATO’s anniversary should actually be a cause for worry because it will make clear how many big problems are out there waiting for a solution that is nowhere in sight. The entire rules-based order that took hold after the fall of the Wall is in decline.
Brain dead? Maybe not. But Europe has been tottering for some time and its leaders seem no closer to even agreeing on what ails it – much less what the cure is.

Public impeachment hearings: A look at the witnesses, the format, and more

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry into whether President Trump improperly withheld aid to a foreign government in exchange for help with his re-election bid is entering an important phase this week, as the first public hearings are held by the House Intelligence Committee.
Up until now, House investigators have held closed-door depositions with key Trump officials as they gather information and documents on the allegations.
What can we expect from these hearings? Here's a look at the format, the witnesses, and what we might learn.
Who is participating this week? Wednesday's hearing will feature a top diplomat to Ukraine, William Taylor, and a State Department official, George Kent. Friday's hearing will feature former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.
William Taylor is a career diplomat who has served under every presidential administration since Ronald Reagan, according to a New York Times profile that quoted colleagues who described him as “universally respected."
Taylor became a key witness after becoming the first to testify to Congressional investigators last month that release of military aid promised to Ukraine was contingent on Ukraine declaring publicly that it was investigating Trump's political rivals.
George Kent , who oversees Ukraine policy at the State Department, testified that it was his understanding that Trump wanted the investigations done as a condition of releasing the aid, based on conversations with other administration officials.
Kent also corroborates testimony from Taylor that there were two channels of diplomacy toward Ukraine, an official channel headed by the State Department, and an unofficial channel led by Rudy Giuliani, who was acting as Trump's personal lawyer.
Kent testified that he was told to “keep my head down and lower my profile in Ukraine."
Marie Yovanovitch was the subject of a smear campaign by Giuliani and other Trump allies and was eventually recalled from her ambassadorship by the State Department. Yovanovitch was singled out by Trump in his infamous July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, cryptically telling the Ukrainian leader Yovanovitch was about to “go through some things."
What time do the hearings start? Can I watch it live? The hearing for Taylor and Kent is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Wednesday, and the Yovanovitch hearing will begin at 9 a.m. on Friday. BostonGlobe.com will carry a livestream of all the testimony.
Do we know anything about what could be said at Wednesday's hearing? Taylor will undoubtedly be asked by Democrats to expand on a key moment in his closed-door testimony, when he told lawmakers that Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told a Ukrainian official that US military aid would be held up until Zelensky committed to investigating Burisma, the company that employed Hunter Biden. Taylor's account was later backed up by Sondland in his revised testimony.
Kent is likely to be questioned about the conversations that led him to testify that it was Trump's wish to hold up aid until Ukraine announced investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election.
Republicans are likely to counter that neither official directly heard the president himself issue a directive to hold up the aid in exchange for the investigations, and ask questions that highlight this point.
Additionally, as someone who has visited the front lines of the war in Ukraine, Taylor could provide critical context about the importance of military aid to soldiers fighting Russia. In the years following the annexation of Crimea, the conflict has often dropped out of the headlines, and some have described it as an “invisible war." In his opening statement last month, Taylor offered a glimpse of the situation on the front lines:
“Ambassador Volker and I could see the armed and hostile Russian-led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge across the line of contact. Over 13,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the war, one or two a week. More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the US assistance."
What is the format of the hearings? How does it differ from regular Congressional hearings? The hearings will be different from recent hearings (like the testimony of Robert Mueller) in that Representative Adam Schiff and ranking minority member Representative Devin Nunes will each have the opportunity to conduct lengthy questioning at the outset of the hearing, before it returns to the traditional format of five minutes of questioning per member.
Committee staff members will also be allowed to ask questions, another departure from the typical format.
Those rules were laid out in a House resolution passed at the end of October formalizing the inquiry and establishing the process.
In another unusual move, Republicans have taken the step of adding Representative Jim Jordan to the House Intelligence Committee, replacing Representative Rick Crawford, so Jordan can question witnesses.
Despite loud complaints that they have not been given full access to the hearings, Politico reported last week that some House GOP members were expressing frustration that members who were allowed in were not participating in all of the depositions.

Texto completo: LOUISVILLE — As the final votes trickled in during last week's Kentucky gubernatorial election, a network of automated Twitter accounts suddenly sprang into action.
They spread misinformation about the election being rigged, according to the CEO of a company that tracks political misinformation on social media.
Gideon Blocq, the founder and CEO of VineSight, told The Courier Journal his company witnessed thousands of accounts with "bot-like" automated behavior spreading misinformation about the race, including a screenshot of a tweet by one account claiming to have destroyed ballots with votes for incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.
"Immediately at the end of the counting of the votes, these stories started popping up in parallel, all about the election being rigged," Blocq said.
One of the tweets spreading the furthest came from user @Overlordkraken1, which tweeted at 8:39 p. m. he had "just shredded a box of Republican mail in ballots," adding "Bye bye Bevin. " The tweet listed the user's location as Louisville, though it misspelled the word.
Bevin would end up losing to Democratic Andy Beshear by 5,189 votes, though the governor told supporters at 10 p. m. Tuesday that he would not concede the race, sighting unspecified voting "irregularities. "
The next day, Bevin requested an official recanvass of the vote, alleging widespread fraud and "thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted. " In a Courier Journal fact check of Bevin's claims, local elections officials refer to the allegations as "ridiculous" and "flatly not true. "
The governor has not provided any proof for such claims, and spokespersons for his office and campaign have not responded to questions asking if this tweet plays into Bevin's allegations.
After being retweeted at least 91 times, the account was suspended — though Blocq said a screenshot of the tweet was then posted Tuesday night and "we saw huge bot networks just pushing it around. "
While the suspended account was likely a real person just "trolling" with the shredding tweet, Blocq said "thousands" of bot accounts spread the screenshot in parallel with other tweets alleging that the election was rigged, showing "this is not a small operation. . . it is not just one person doing this. "
By early Wednesday, someone created a meme suggesting thousands of votes for Bevin were not counted because every other Republican candidate on the ballot did so well. That also spread rapidly among social media. For example, one Twitter account with more than 117,000 followers tweeted the meme along with the word "rigged!" which was retweeted more than 1,000 times over the next day, mostly by bot accounts.
Blocq said by Thursday evening, a simple search for the Kentucky election on Twitter would turn up tweets including the screenshot, meme and other claims about the election being rigged in its top results.
While the influence of Kremlin-backed groups to spread misinformation in the 2016 presidential campaign is well documented, Blocq said he could not determine the origin of the bot network pushing tweets about the Kentucky race, as he can only see publicly-available data. However, he said that those working at Twitter would have more answers about the location of the bots.
Kentucky governor's race: 'I knew he was in big trouble': An inside look at 24 crazy hours in Bevin vs. Beshear
Twitter told The New York Times this weekend that the spread of misinformation regarding the Kentucky race for governor largely appeared to originate in the United States.
The Department of Homeland Security tracks foreign interference in U. S. elections that exploits divisions through the spread of misinformation on social networks.
Bevin's requested recanvass will take place on Thursday, with voting officials in each county checking to make sure they transmitted the correct numbers to the secretary of state.
Republican state legislators have expressed skepticism that the recanvass will significantly change the official vote totals and warned against Bevin creating a "fishing expedition" by contesting the election in the legislature if that is the case.
Some legislators have also urged the governor to present evidence of fraud or voting irregularities to the public if he has any, saying making such claims without any proof undermines faith in the democratic system.
"Any attempt by Gov. Bevin to undermine these results in the legislature is wrong and should be viewed as a direct attack on the democratic process. " state Sen. Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, said. "Once the recanvass is complete, the General Assembly must accept the outcome of this election and help Gov. -elect Beshear prepare for the 2020 budget.

Giuliani Associate Says He Passed Demand on Biden to Ukrainians

Texto completo: The claim by the associate, Lev Parnas, is being vigorously disputed.
Not long before the Ukrainian president was inaugurated in May, an associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani's journeyed to Kiev to deliver a warning to the country's new leadership, a lawyer for the associate said.
The associate, Lev Parnas, told a representative of the incoming government that it had to announce an investigation into Mr. Trump's political rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and his son, or else Vice President Mike Pence would not attend the swearing-in of the new president, and the United States would freeze aid, the lawyer said.
The claim by Mr. Parnas, who is preparing to share his account with impeachment investigators, challenges the narrative of events from Mr. Trump and Ukrainian officials that is at the core of the congressional inquiry. It also directly links Mr. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, to threats of repercussions made to the Ukrainians, something he has strenuously denied.
But Mr. Parnas's account, while potentially significant, is being contradicted on several fronts. None of the people involved dispute that the meeting occurred, but Mr. Parnas stands alone in saying the intention was to present an ultimatum to the Ukrainian leadership.
Another participant in the meeting, Mr. Parnas's business partner, Igor Fruman, said Mr. Parnas's claim was false; the men never raised the issues of aid or the vice president's attendance at the inauguration, lawyers for Mr. Fruman said.
Mr. Giuliani denied Mr. Parnas's contention that he had delivered the warning at the direction of Mr. Giuliani. "Categorically, I did not tell him to say that," Mr. Giuliani said.
The dispute represents the clearest indication yet that Mr. Parnas, who was indicted along with Mr. Fruman last month on campaign finance charges, has turned on Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, both Soviet-born businessmen from Florida, worked with Mr. Giuliani for months in Ukraine outside normal diplomatic channels to further Mr. Trump's interests. The men have been subpoenaed to testify before Congress, and Mr. Parnas's lawyer has said his client will comply to the extent he can without incriminating himself. It is unclear if Mr. Parnas will ultimately be called to testify.
Mr. Parnas's account of the meeting, if corroborated, would reveal the earliest known instance of American aid being tied to demands for Ukraine to take actions that could benefit Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. It would also represent a more extensive threat -- to pull Mr. Pence from the inaugural delegation -- than was previously known.
Mr. Trump froze nearly $ 400 million in military aid to Ukraine shortly before a July 25 call with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump personally sought investigations into the Bidens and claims that Ukrainians had meddled in the 2016 election. In the call, Mr. Trump did not explicitly link the aid and the investigations.
Mr. Trump has denied a quid pro quo involving aid, and Mr. Zelensky has said he never felt pressured to pursue an investigation.
The meeting in Kiev in May occurred after Mr. Giuliani, with Mr. Parnas's help, had planned a trip there to urge Mr. Zelensky to pursue the investigations. Mr. Giuliani canceled his trip at the last minute, claiming he was being "set up."
Only three people were present at the meeting: Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and Serhiy Shefir, a member of the inner circle of Mr. Zelensky, then the Ukrainian president-elect. The sit-down took place at an outdoor cafe in the days before Mr. Zelensky's May 20 inauguration, according to a person familiar with the events. The men sipped coffee and spoke in Russian, which is widely spoken in Ukraine, the person said.
Mr. Parnas's lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, said the message to the Ukrainians was given at the direction of Mr. Giuliani, whom Mr. Parnas believed was acting under Mr. Trump's instruction. Mr. Giuliani said he "never authorized such a conversation."
A lawyer for Mr. Fruman, John M. Dowd, said his client told him the men were seeking only a meeting with Mr. Zelensky, the new president. "There was no mention of any terms, military aid or whatever they are talking about it -- it's false," said Mr. Dowd, who represents Mr. Fruman along with the lawyer Todd Blanche.
In a statement on Friday, Mr. Shefir acknowledged meeting with Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. But he said they had not raised the issue of military aid. Mr. Shefir said he briefed the incoming president on the meeting. Mr. Shefir was a business partner and longtime friend whom Mr. Zelensky appointed as his chief adviser on the first day of his presidency.
"We did not treat Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman as official representatives, and therefore we did not consider that they could speak on behalf of the U.S. government," Mr. Shefir said. He added Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman had requested that Mr. Zelensky meet with Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Shefir said in his statement that he had told Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman "that we could consider meeting with Mr. Giuliani, but only publicly and officially and only after the inauguration of the newly elected president."
The statement from Mr. Shefir, issued in response to an inquiry from The New York Times, did not directly address Mr. Parnas's claims that he had delivered an ultimatum about American aid in general and Mr. Pence's attendance at the inauguration. A representative for Mr. Zelensky did not respond to a request for further comment.
Mr. Bondy, Mr. Parnas's lawyer, challenged Mr. Shefir's characterization. "It would simply defy reason," he said, "for Mr. Shefir to have attended a meeting with Mr. Parnas if he did not believe Mr. Parnas spoke for the president, and also for Mr. Parnas not to have conveyed the president's message at this meeting."
Mr. Pence did not attend the inauguration. His office said in response to questions from The Times that it had told Ukrainian officials on May 13, a week before the swearing-in, that the vice president would not be there.
Mr. Giuliani is under investigation by Manhattan prosecutors and the F.B.I. over whether he illegally engaged in lobbying for foreign interests in connection with the Ukraine efforts. He has denied any wrongdoing, saying he was working for his client, Mr. Trump.
That investigation grew out of one into Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. An indictment unsealed on Oct. 10 accused the men of illegally routing a $ 325,000 contribution to a political action committee supporting Mr. Trump through a shell company and linked them to an effort to recall the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was the subject of criticism from many of Mr. Trump's allies. The men were also charged with funneling campaign contributions from a Russian businessman to other American politicians to influence them in support of a marijuana venture. The two men, and two co-defendants, have pleaded not guilty.
The impeachment inquiry was started after a whistle-blower complained about the July phone call in which Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to look into Burisma, a Ukrainian company that gave Mr. Biden's son Hunter a seat on its board and paid him as much as $ 50,000 a month. Mr. Trump suggested to Mr. Zelensky that Ukraine should contact Mr. Giuliani and the United States attorney general, William P. Barr, about the Bidens.
With Mr. Trump by his side at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr. Zelensky told reporters that his July call with the president had been "normal" and that "nobody pushed me," adding that he did not want to become entangled in American elections.
Maggie Haberman and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.

Texto completo: On the night after the Berlin Wall fell, as I watched crowds of delirious East Germans surge down West Berlin's broad Kurfürstendamm street, it didn't occur to me that history was ending. On the contrary, it seemed that in the former captive nations of Eastern Europe, history was making a comeback.
Soviet-imposed communism, I wrote that night in an article for The Post, had suppressed the politics that drove events in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and other East Bloc states before World War II. As the wall fell, those currents were suddenly reappearing, as if awakened from a long sleep. Poland's Solidarity movement was splintering into liberal and nationalist factions that resembled prewar parties. In Yugoslavia, ethnic animosities between Serbs and Croats were resurfacing. Hungary had rediscovered its prewar nationalism in a feud with Romania.
Thirty years later, the politics of the 1930s are still playing out in the former Eastern Bloc. Poland is governed by an authoritarian-minded right-wing government closely aligned with a reactionary Catholic Church. An uneasy peace prevails in the splintered remains of Yugoslavia after a devastating ethnic war. Hungary, which was ruled by a right-wing authoritarian government before World War II, is now dominated by the proudly 'illiberal' Viktor Orban, who has tried to rehabilitate former strongman Miklos Horthy.
Though these political movements are sometimes lumped in with the modern-day populists of Western Europe, they are, in key respects, more like their 20th- century predecessors. They are authoritarian and socially reactionary " anti- LGBTQ rhetoric is a favorite theme of Poland's ruling party. Prewar evils such as irredentism and anti-Semitism are alive in mainstream politics to a degree they are not on the other side of the former Iron Curtain. Just ask emigre Hungarian Jewish financier George Soros, whom Orban cast as his leading opponent in the last national election.
What's surprising to me is the extent to which communist-era politics have also survived. My assumption in 1989 was that Soviet-syle totalitarianism was an alien implant that would vanish from countries closer to Berlin than Moscow. Yet some legacies of communist rule have proved enduring, perhaps because they are all too compatible with the resurgent illiberal movements.
One is the use of state-run national television for political propaganda. After the establishment of democracy, Poland moved to make its government-owned network independent, similar to the BBC. That abruptly ended when the right-wing Law and Justice party came to power in 2015. Now state television glorifies the ruling party and slimes its opponents in a fashion eerily reminiscent of communist times. In Hungary, Orban has gone a step further, using state resources and friendly businessmen to all but eliminate independent media.
A second legacy is pervasive official corruption. In the morally nihilistic world of Eastern Bloc communism, everyone from traffic cops to Communist Party secretaries felt free to exploit the system for private profit. To a disturbing extent, that has not changed. Only a few months ago was Liviu Dragnea, Romania's most powerful politician through the 2010s, finally imprisoned for abuse of power. As the New York Times recently documented, European Union subsidies have enriched Orban's relatives and old friends.
In 1989, I predicted that Czechoslovakia would revert to the model of democratic pluralism it had under Thomas Masaryk, its president from 1918 to 1935. It did at first, thanks to Velvet Revolution leader Vaclav Havel. But the president of the Czech Republic today, Milos Zeman, is a sleazy tool of Russian interests; Prime Minister Andrej Babis was until recently under criminal investigation for fraud. Slovakia's shady prime minister, Robert Fico, was forced to step down last year after the gangland-style murder of a journalist investigating corruption.
The most insidious communist legacy may be ahistoricism. After the war, while West Germany de-Nazified, East Germans, Hungarians and Poles were told they bore no responsibility for fascism or the Holocaust, which were portrayed as capitalist crimes. Today's governments follow suit: Poland's passage of a law criminalizing accounts of the Holocaust that hold Poles accountable is the quintessential example.
It's hardly surprising that it is in the former East Germany that fascist-friendly movements such as the Alternative for Germany (AfD) have gained the most traction. In last month's state election in the eastern state of Thuringia, the AfD won 23 percent of the vote and finished ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. Its local leader, Bjorn Hocke, has denounced the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin and called for an end to Germany's 'culture of remembrance.'
In many ways, of course, Eastern Europe is far better off than in 1989. Its people are vastly richer and, in spite of creeping authoritarianism, far freer. But the euphoria I saw and shared in that momentous weekend in Berlin seems a little naive 30 years later. We underestimated the tenacity of the culture created by Soviet communism " and the perils of a return to history.

Spreading disinformation within United States is dangerous

Texto completo: Sean McFate was an infantry officer in the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division and then, in 2004 as a private military contractor, was tasked to prevent a genocide in Burundi. After he left his career as a “door kicker,” he finished his graduate work at Harvard and got a Ph.D. in international relations at the London School of Economics. Now he teaches senior military and governmental officers strategy at Georgetown and the National Defense University.
McFate could be accused of being a “globalist” in the same way that George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and Charlie Beckwith, the founder of Delta Force, could be called “globalists” — meaning that only ostriches, the dangerously naive and Russian propagandists want the U.S. to stay out of international affairs.
In his latest book, “The New Rules of War,” McFate argues that uncreative, stuck-in-the-past, conventional thinking has prevented the United States military from decisively winning its wars since 1945, and so he offers strategists 10 new rules of war to follow to advance our national security.
Rule No. 5 is “The best weapons do not fire bullets.” These weapons refer to propaganda and disinformation campaigns. Throughout our history, the United States has been no stranger to dishing out and being on the receiving end of propaganda. However because of our democratic values, most U.S. military strategists aren’t all that good at propaganda.
But some politicians are.
McFate summarizes the efficacy of Rule No. 5 as follows: “The best weapons do not fire bullets ... [they] weaponize influence. … Shaping people’s perceptions of reality is more powerful than mobilizing a carrier strike group. It can topple governments, undermine national unity, and weaken resolve in wars.”
The average American adult has a busy job, demanding family responsibilities and community service commitments. Therefore, they can be forgiven for not having the time to diligently and critically think about whether or not some of the information they’re consuming is propaganda. On the other hand, our Founding Fathers realized that the integrity of a republic depended on the quality of its citizens’ virtue, education and logical reasoning.
In the era of social media, especially Twitter, it is hard to determine which has had a more negative effect on our citizens’ logical reasoning — our adversaries’ propaganda or our president’s Twitter habits. The reason why it’s hard to make this determination is because President Donald Trump often retweets our adversaries’ propaganda.
Everyone agrees — including Trump himself — that Trump can masterfully shape his base’s perceptions of reality. The best example is this: Trump is a failed casino-owning, tax-return hiding, draft dodger who convinced his base that a Vietnam veteran who earned two awards for valor and served Republican and Democratic presidents alike was not only an illegitimate agent of a shadowy “Deep State” controlled by “globalists” — but the real criminal during a “witch hunt.”
It is truly remarkable that a reality TV star turned politician successfully used this narrative to shape his supporters’ perceptions of reality throughout Robert Mueller’s investigation. Propaganda is indeed more powerful than carrier strike group.
The New York Times recently published an article “reviewing each of [Trump’s] more than 11,000 tweets and the hundreds of accounts he has retweeted, tracking the ways he is exposed to information and replicating what he is likely to see on the platform.” It’s to be expected that Russian, Chinese, Iranian and other hostile intelligence agencies would direct their propaganda at Trump, and they have. However, what’s not expected is that Trump retweets some of it.
According to the Times’ analysis, which could be verified by anyone taking the time to do the same analysis because the Times used publicly available information, Trump has retweeted conspiracy theories from the fringiest of right-wing fringe groups, propaganda created by neo-Nazis, and stories created by Russian intelligence operatives whose fake accounts have now been banned by Twitter. Twitter has banned dozens of additional accounts that created propaganda retweeted by Trump.
Stop for a moment and let the reality of this sink in: President Trump spreads Russian and neo-Nazi propaganda.
It’s not clear if he does this knowingly or unknowingly but, as stated earlier, Trump himself brags about his ability to shape people’s reality. But what’s shaping his?
To make matters worse, Max Boot, a former Republican, argues that Trump’s spreading of disinformation, whether it’s created by Trump or someone else, is abetted by many of Trump’s supporters.
In October, Boot wrote this in The Washington Post: “The rise of irrationality on the right is a deeply disturbing development that goes hand in hand with the right’s embrace of Trump’s authoritarianism.”
The good news is there are signs that such irrationality is getting checked.
According to a recent Fox News poll, which Sean Hannity said couldn’t possibly be true, 53% of Americans think Trump should be impeached and 49% think he should be impeached and removed. Surprisingly, 57% of those opposing impeachment said nothing could change their minds.
Fox News accurately pointed out that this means about 25% of Americans’ minds are incapable of change based on new information. This mindset is called “irrational” and “illogical,” which the Founding Fathers warned was a grave threat to a republic.
McFate is right that propaganda is a more powerful weapon than bullets. However, he recommends that we direct propaganda at our adversaries, not at ourselves.
Consider what it says about our president that he spreads Russian and neo-Nazi propaganda. If he’s spreading it unwittingly, then he needs to be removed from office for abuse of power and dereliction of duty.
If he’s spreading it wittingly, then he needs to be removed from office for those reasons — and additional high crimes and misdemeanors.

Big tech on trial

Texto completo: Today marks the 100th anniversary of Abrams v. United States, a notable Supreme Court case involving free speech and Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Russian immigrants in New York who had circulated “disloyal publications” during World War I were charged with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. In a 7–2 opinion, the Supreme Court, sustaining the immigrants’ conviction, held that the law did not violate their freedom of speech.
Holmes, who had upheld criminal convictions in free speech cases only months earlier, changed his mind in Abrams, and famously dissented: “The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.”
Immediately before “the best test of truth,” Holmes wrote that men “may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas.”
Holmes’s “free trade in ideas” quote is likely to be trotted out by the Google–Facebook–Twitter–Amazon "juggernet" to justify their being left alone by government antitrust forces. But the question for these forces, and the public, is whether there is really the competition in the market that Holmes was (and we are) relying on.
Is there any real competition to Google, Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon? Especially in the political campaign realm where they wield tremendously consequential power?
CEO Jack Dorsey has said Twitter will ban all political advertisements starting Nov. 22. The “all” may sound universal, until you remember Twitter was one of Trump’s most successful campaign vehicles and likely to be so again. Not for nothing is Trump called the Twitterer-in-Chief. Banning political ads is like limiting campaign expenditures: It benefits primarily incumbents and the media, which — as everyone except ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC, MSNBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and all their enthusiasts and lobbyists will concede — is primarily liberal.
And what counts as political? Suppose someone in the district of a candidate running against a serious gun controller writes a piece reporting that the 2018 death toll from mass shootings was “only 80,” contrasting it with the 561 people who were shot and killed last year in Chicago alone. Do media moguls and other gun-control advocates want voters to know that? Or do they want the public to think the “mass shooting” death toll is alarmingly high?
Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook will not censor political ads, much to the consternation of its employees. Question: How much sub-rosa censorship in the free trade of ideas can those employees conduct without Zuckerberg’s knowledge?
Google owns YouTube. Dennis Prager testified before Congress that YouTube has at various times restricted about 100 of Prager University’s videos, including “Why Don’t Feminists Fight for Muslim Women?” by Somali–American women’s rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, “Are the Police Racist?”, and even “Why Is Modern Art So Bad?”
Does Google believe in Holmes’s free trade in ideas? Yes, of course it does — just not in dangerously subversive ideas, like the ones the government objected to in Abrams.
Is it likely that Amazon, owned by Jeff Bezos, would traffic in “dangerously subversive ideas”? Half of all book sales in the United States take place on Amazon.com. If any company is a marketplace of ideas, certainly Amazon is it.
Amazon is said to have banned books by the “alt-right,” which may sound innocuous. But it’s a good bet the term can ooze over to include books written by conservatives that Amazon doesn’t like. All kinds of things could happen: Books just wouldn’t get listed … you know how sloppy employees can be. And how would anyone ever be able to tell?
In current antitrust law, a small degree of market power (which is not the same as monopoly power) is very common and understood not to warrant antitrust intervention. A dry cleaner in a good location may be able to charge slightly more than one in a different location, and no one will object. But even a trivial skewing of the marketplace of ideas by one of the giant tech information companies could have made the difference between “President Trump” and “President Clinton.” Trump won Wisconsin by 0.77% of the vote, after all.
The original antitrust thinking of 1890 was reinterpreted in the 1970s–1980s by what is sometimes called the “once-revolutionary Chicago School of Antitrust.” But the world has changed again since then, and it’s time to revisit antitrust law. People who believe in competition, especially in the marketplace of ideas, shouldn’t let tech CEOs stop the clock there. Like Holmes, we should be willing to change our minds.

How to beat Trump on immigration

Texto completo: A wave of anxiety swept through Democratic ranks this week when a Times/Siena College poll suggested that Donald Trump is leading key Democrats in a bunch of swing states. How the heck is this guy still doing so well out there, after all that has happened?
The short answer is: immigration. Trump, like global populists everywhere, understands that we're in the middle of a vast social experiment. Waves of migration are transforming societies across the globe. The U.S. will have no majority group in three decades. Sweden could be 20%-30% Muslim by 2050, according to Pew Research projections.
As the saying goes, everybody is now everywhere. We're entering into states of interdependence with all sorts of people unlike ourselves. In the course of this, millions of people perceive that they are losing their country, losing their place, losing their culture.
Trump, like global populists everywhere, tells them: I'll help you regain control.
By contrast, highly educated white progressives tell them: If you want to restrict immigration you're probably a racist. As Eric Kaufmann notes in his book "Whiteshift," 91.3% of white Hillary Clinton voters with graduate degrees said it's racist to want less immigration for ethnic and cultural reasons.
Trump then turns around and says: See? These liberal elites want to silence you! They think you're bigots! Game over.
If Trump opponents want to reach these voters, they need a better answer to one of the central challenges of our age: how to create a mass multicultural democracy where people feel at home.
This week I was at a Faith Angle Forum conference in France with a group of European and American scholars and journalists. I got a glimpse of that better answer.
The Europeans reminded me of something that is taboo here: that immigration is always, at the most personal level, a cultural encounter. It's a person with one language and set of values interacting with a person with another language and set of values. When people meet in this way, they put their opinions, identities and way of life at risk. They might be changed by the encounter. The process is unsettling.
The crucial question becomes: Do the people in the encounter feel secure enough to learn from it rather than to react with anxiety and fear? Right now, we are asking millions of Americans to accept high immigration while they are already living with maximum insecurity. Their wages are declining, their families and communities are fragmenting, their churches are shrinking, government services are being cut, their values and national identity feel unstable.
Of course they are going to react with suspicion if suddenly on top of all this they begin to feel like strangers in their own place.
The lesson is that to create thick pluralistic society, you first have to help people embed in a secure base. That includes economic and health care security, but it also involves cultural and spiritual security. It involves offering people opportunities to embed in their local culture, to practice their particular faith, to live by local values that may seem alien to you and me.
Only people who are securely rooted in their own particularity are confident enough to enjoy the encounter with difference.
This is the paradox of pluralism: In order to get people to integrate with others you have to help them weave close communities with their own kind. Cosmopolitans never get this.
A person who is firmly rooted can go out and enjoy the adventure of pluralism. This is the second phase of thick pluralism. The person with the pluralist mindset acknowledges that God's truth is radically dispersed. It is not contained in one tradition and community. The good life is only understood through a holistic journey across traditions.
The pluralist doesn't see society as a competition for scarce resources, but as a joint voyage of discovery in search of life's biggest answers. Pluralism offers us the chance, and the civic duty, to be a daring social explorer, venturing across subcultures, sometimes having the exciting experience of being the only one of you in the room, harvesting the wisdom embedded in other people's lifeways. A key pluralist trait is curiosity, the opposite of anxiety.
Social exploration is a skill. It requires the ability to not merely tolerate difference, but to greet it with a generosity of spirit. Walking into each room confident in your convictions but humbly aware that they are not the only convictions. Being slow to take offense when somebody says the wrong thing, quick to forget the transgressions of others and honest in acknowledging your group's past wrongs.
The conversations at the Faith Angle Forum reminded me that in a pluralistic society, institutions like schools, companies and neighborhoods have to be structured to offer both kinds of experience: bonding experience within your own tradition to create rootedness and also bridging experience that offers journeys of curiosity across different moral ecosystems.
Conservatives tend to emphasize the value of being rooted in place. Progressives tend to celebrate living across difference. Life is miserable, and a nation is broken, unless you do both.

Texto completo: For the moment, "Parasite" feels like the it movie.
The South Korean film is part dark comedy, part thriller and is one of the year's most buzzworthy films. In May it became the first Korean film to win the top prize at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, in September it was a runner-up for the people's choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival and it's been chosen as South Korea's entry in the foreign film category at the upcoming Academy Awards.
Another film festival it'll be captivating an audience? The upcoming Weyauwega International Film Festival, which runs Nov. 13-16 at the historic Gerold Opera House.
"('Parasite') is truly a unique cinematic vision from Bong Joon Ho," said Ian Teal, the festival's co-founder and director. "The film is exciting, funny, dark, thought provoking and beautifully filmed."
"Parasite" will be shown at 8 p.m. Nov. 16. It's one of 57 films from 16 countries to be showcased over the event's four days.
Despite a lot of acclaim, Teal was told by the film's distributor his festival screening is likely to be the only one in northeast Wisconsin. Curious movie-goers would otherwise have to head to Milwaukee or maybe Madison to see it.
"Parasite," which despite playing on a limited number of American screens since opening here in early October, has amassed more than $100 million worldwide. The New York Times called it "brilliant and deeply unsettling" and Variety "ferocious" and "brilliant" with "flawless craft and humor."
It's a story about two families — one wealthy, one not — whose lives intersect at first in humorous, then in shocking ways. There's chatter it could garner a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, though that's a tough task for a foreign-language film.
What's showing at the WIFF The ninth annual WIFF gets rolling at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday with a documentary feature called "Dreaming of a Vetter World." That's followed by a series of short films and a 6:30 p.m. opening reception. The 1944 noir "Double Indemnity" plays at 7 p.m. Wednesday attendees also get treated to a complimentary pasta dinner before the featured presentation.
Thursday's slate starts with a run of shorts at 3 p.m. and another batch at 4:30 p.m. A documentary feature, "The Burden," plays at 6 p.m., followed by another doc, "Decoding the Driftless," at 7 p.m. Jonas Stenstrom, the director, will be on hand. The night finishes with "Lost Bayou," a feature, at 8:15 p.m.
Friday's action begins at 1:30 p.m. with the documentary "Power to the Children," then a pack of shorts at 3:15 p.m. At 4:30 p.m. starts the festival's Psycho Fest, a horror-themed run of shorts and features celebrating Weyauwega's connection to "Psycho." (Robert Bloch, the author of the novel Alfred Hitchcock's horror classic was based on, lived and wrote in the small town in Waupaca County). The features are "The Field" at 7:30 p.m. and "Black Flowers" at 9:30 p.m. "The Field" was filmed in Manitowoc.
Saturday's schedule starts with a 10 a.m. filmmakers seminar. It's a discussion on distributing and marketing indie films online. A run of short films starts at 12:45 p.m. The feature "Fourteen" plays at 2:30 p.m. (with two of its stars in attendance), followed by another batch of shorts. The feature "Give Me Liberty," from Milwaukee filmmaker Kirill Mikhanovsky, starts at 5:45 p.m. and then "Parasite" is at 8 p.m. The awards ceremony and closing reception then wrap things up at 10 p.m.
WIFF tickets are on sale at wegafilm.com. Daily admission is $18 and full-event passes are $45. The full-event passes also include a free popcorn and drink.

Texto completo: ALBION — What happened — or what could have happened — at the middle school is understandably the talk of this Western New York village. Rumor is filling in where limited facts end, fueling frustration, fear and endless questions.
More will be known this coming week, when three teenagers authorities say were plotting a deadly attack on their school head to court for the first time.
A judge will determine the conditions of their continued release, or if detention is warranted. The school district will assess their continued suspension and solidify tutoring arrangements.
For now, though, Superintendent Michael Bonnewell has a stack of messages to return, including from the New York Times, CNN and ABC News. And he has a school community in need of reassurance.
"I'm trying to get the kids back to normal," Bonnewell said. "They need to know that they're safe, and that coming to school is safe."
Albion Middle School student reported threat Nov. 4 Albion is a town and village of less than 6,000 about 45 minutes west of Rochester. The school district numbers 1,950 students, with 465 in the middle school, grades 6-8, all housed on a singular, 30-some acre campus along Highway 31 a short distance from Main Street.
District offices are in the back, erected as a temporary building decades ago and still adorned with wood paneling of the era.
The ordinariness of school life became jolted beginning Monday, Nov. 4, when an Albion Middle School student told a teacher or administrator about threats she had received. The gaming app Discord was the location of some of the threats. An investigation by administrators led to two student suspensions within 24 hours, and a third the next day, officials said.
By Friday, there had been one statement to Albion parents -- and then another. There was a press conference at which a plot involving weapons and even explosives was detailed. A statement from Gov. Andrew Cuomo soon followed.
Albion parents filled with questions about three 'young teen' suspects A visit to Albion by two Democrat and Chronicle reporters yielded a series of conversations with individuals who did not want to be quoted by name.
The question many are asking — in the Village House diner, in the Hoag Library and especially in hundreds of social media posts — is why the three were released to their parents? This concern was raised dozens of times in Facebook comments on the pages of the Orleans Hub and the Batavia Daily News.
Should the community be concerned?
Or, conversely, are these three kids (whose identities have not been released) capable of the violence that authorities say they had been discussing for several days?
Police Chief Roland Nenni III said the plan was to "enter the school with explosives, incendiary devices and firearms and to kill and injure students and staff."
"They had been talking about it for more than a few days," District Attorney Joseph Cardone said. "But while their plans had advanced somewhat, it does not appear it was something that was going to happen imminently."
There was a date for an attack identified, authorities have said, but they profess to know of no significance to the day. A search of the students' homes found legally registered firearms, but no explosives.
Rumors of a list of targets? "I know of no hit list," Cardone said.
"There is no particular event. No particular real motive has been described by any of them," Cardone said. "I do think that there are some emotional issues involved."
He added: "These are all individuals of normal, if not more than normal intelligence."
All three have been interviewed by law enforcement, he said, have have "been forthcoming, at least to a point," He said the same for their parents.
Threat assessment team moves into action for first time The trio each face a count of second-degree conspiracy, a felony. Their names were withheld by police because of their age, and their cases will be adjudicated in family court.
This case marks the first time Albion's local threat assessment team — formed this past spring — has been fully utilized. The team grew out of a recommendation from a yearly public safety seminar at the University at Buffalo.
It includes the school district, the village Police Department, along with the Orleans County District Attorney and Department of Mental Health. The team does not identify threats but rather collaborates on the best response to a given situation. In this case, Bonnewell said, the system worked, starting with the young student telling an adult.
Police have had an added presence on the district campus in recent days. This coming week, the middle school principal plans to visit classes individually to talk with students.
"The kids have been, within the building, together," Bonnewell said. "Through this, they have kept it together."
'Do I think there is an imminent threat?' Parents want details, understandably, he said. Students, he suspects, will be trying to confirm who among their classmates are to blame. But this is both a criminal and disciplinary matter, which limits what school officials can share about an individual student.
"Do I think that there is an imminent threat from these three students? I don't," Bonnewell said, answering one community concern.
Their parents are aware, and authorities are involved, he said. Having been in his job for 10 years, he has known many of the district's students since pre-K.
"I tell them all the time, they're my kids," Bonnewell said, adding that the sentiment extends to the three students as well.
"They are kids who have a life ahead of them yet," he said. "They matter to me, and I'm sitting here thinking, 'Wow. This is a hurdle they are now going to have to overcome.'"
But for those worried of an over-reaction, he says this:
"In our day in age, given things that have occurred, it's natural that a response is going to be pretty significant. Too many things have happened ... for folks to sit back."

PEN mightier than the president? Writers suing Trump

Texto completo: Donald Trump was holding a news conference, going through his stream-of-consciousness babble about how great the economy is, how transparency and truth were being honored by his administration, and about the wonders of his foreign policy dealmaking. Everything is beautiful.
How, he wondered, does he not get more credit? "When I was in New York," he mumbled, "I got such good PR. I was very good at it until I ran for politics. I used to be the king of getting good press."
Well, not really, Mr. President. You were New York's playboy builder. The tabloids loved your back-page nightlife exploits. You were comic relief. The Clown of Construction. But since you weren't a public official, they handled you with kid gloves when it came to your business affairs. Except for one columnist, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Sydney Schanberg, who wrote about New York for the New York Times and then the Village Voice.
Schanberg sneered at Trump and distrusted him way back in the 1980s. He showed how Trump consistently lied about his involvement in public projects, exaggerated his wealth, showed off his girlfriends – and wives – like pieces of meat, and how he claimed he knew everything about everything better than the experts.
Wrote Schanberg, "Trump presents himself as a class act who always tells the truth (but he) keeps himself in the public eye by bullying people regularly with frivolous lawsuits." New York City Mayor Ed Koch screamed at Trump, "Piggy, piggy, piggy."
Today, as the screams come from all directions, Trump says his good friends Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity wonder how a man "could handle what I've had to handle."
Truth is, Trump isn't so philosophic about his detractors, especially in the press. He attacks the press in ways that, frankly, could be added to the list of impeachable offenses. "Presidents are free to mock, needle, evade and even demean the press, but not to use the power of government to stifle it," declares PEN America, a writer's group that is suing the president in federal court.
The president can launch "verbal tirades against the press," but he can't use his office to punish speech he doesn't like. "When President Trump proposes government retribution against news outlets and reporters, his statements cross the line," PEN asserts.
Don't get me wrong. That line is unclear. Presidents and the press have warred forever. It's built into the relationship. The three branches of government check each other. But then a "fourth branch" – the press – watches over government and reports to the people. No one likes being criticized and, in Trump's case, endlessly mocked by late-night TV hosts and "Saturday Night Live," along with the intense critical scrutiny of CNN and MSNBC, not to mention the Washington Post and New York Times.
Most presidents simply fire back, play a little hard ball, but understand it's the way of the Constitution; that a free press benefits citizens. Not this president. He is resorting to the tricks of authoritarians who try to defy democracy.
His allies create dossiers on journalists who are particularly harsh to him, "the enemies" he sees everywhere. They collect "information" – personal and otherwise – to discredit the offending reporters. This tactic was used by the Stasi, the East Berlin secret police; and by Fidel Castro, when he wanted to silence critics; or Richard Nixon, who audited the taxes of disfavored journalists.
In 1798, when Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Act, ostensibly to round up saboteurs, the party in power used the law to lock up three of the editors of the leading opposition newspapers. In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court finally ruled the law illegal.
But this pesident has little concern for legalities. The law is his pawn to attack his critics. Journalism, he tweets, is "nothing more than an evil propaganda machine for the Democrat Party." Thus, he writes in a letter, he will sue CNN because it "falsely advertises itself as a news organization." He demands "substantial payment to cover damages."
The lawsuit will never happen; it has no basis, but it is, in First Amendment terms, "chilling," meant to intimidate speakers, certainly not to promote debate so that the people can make informed decisions.
Trump wants to make his opponents afraid to dare challenge him. "The consequences of the president's menacing of the press," asserts the PEN lawsuit, "have been felt not just in Washington, but across the country and around the world."
Reporters take notice that an angry president may strike back.
When a reporter from the respected Reuters questioned the president about his infamous Ukraine conversation, he snarled, "You talking to me?" Just like hoodlum characters Robert DeNiro plays in the movies.
Writers without protection of a big media company think twice before publishing pieces that will stir the ire of the president. "Journalists in the United States should not have to operate under the threat of possible harm in order to report on government," asserts PEN.
That is why the founders constructed a wall between government and press so the "fourth" branch could operate freely, without fear of being punished or silenced. People could decide not to buy their product but the government couldn't try to put them out of business.
Both press and government should be in the same business – to help the people, to provide a better life for the people. We may disagree how to get there, but that is when we debate.
And the press holds the government accountable as the debate proceeds. It relays government's mission but also reveals its miscues. It aids the government in getting out its message but also makes sure government's opponents have equal say. The party in power cannot control the marketplace of ideas. The people need to hear competing versions and visions.
This will be adversarial! But your opponent is not the enemy. And the president can respond to win over listeners with reason, fact and, yes, spin. Lies will not win out in the long run. The marketplace will expose the liars who will simply fade away, overtaken by truth and fact. And this happens because the neutral adversaries in the press corps are allowed to make it happen.
Two weeks ago, the White House announced it canceled subscriptions to the New York Times and Washington Post. "We don't even want it in the White House anymore," Trump said. "They're fake." What he meant was they print news he doesn't like.
Given that this president never reads, there is no loss to presidential knowledge. But the message is what counts: If you do your job and report closely on my activities, I will try to wreck you.
"At the start of his career in hype and carnival barking, the press fawned over" Trump, Schanberg wrote years ago. "He made great copy." But now the monster the media helped create is a threat to the press – and democracy.

Texto completo: If you are looking for the perfect gift for your most stylish friend, several new books are bound to please. While the words "icon" or "legendary" get thrown around loosely, these books all feature true masters of style in different genres: men's and women's fashion, music and art. Whether it's getting a rare peek behind the making of Chanel's haute couture collection or slice-of-life images of New York street style, there's something guaranteed to delight and inspire any reader.
"Bowie: An Illustrated Life"
By María Hesse and Fran Ruiz
One of the most innovative artists of the 20th century, David Bowie created work that crossed genres and shattered boundaries.

"Chanel: The Making
of a Collection"
By Laetitia Cénac, Illustrated by Jean-Philippe Delhome
Rarely can mere mortals glimpse how a fashion collection comes together from idea to fruition, but the new book about the House of Chanel by fashion writer Laetitia Cénac pulls back the curtains. This 240-page book contains hundreds of color illustrations by famed artist Jean-Philippe Delhomme detailing Karl Lagerfeld's Spring 2019 collection - Lagerfeld's last before his death. The book also highlights the work of the artisans who create the fashion house's distinct style, the embroiderers, flower-makers, shoemakers and many others. Cénac weaves in the history of the iconic house with its contemporary collections. $35
"I've Seen the Future and I'm Not Going:
The Art Scene and Downtown New York
in the 1980s"
By Peter McGough
In his memoir, artist Peter McGough tells of that almost-mythical time in New York's pregentrified Lower East Side in the 1980s, when he fell into the East Village's art scene, getting to know artists like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and frequenting mythic locations like Studio 54 and the Chelsea Hotel.
When McGough first moved to New York in 1980, he met and fell in love with another artist, David McDermott, and has collaborated with him ever since. McDermott and McGough became as well-known for their work in painting and photography as much as their lifestyle, which embraced a Victorian aesthetic in all they did, including wearing top hats and detachable collars and living in a converted townhouse lit only by candlelight.
Their paintings were backdated to various decades, depending on the subject, adding a highly conceptual element to the work, and their photography was produced in historical processes such as cyanotype, gum bichromate and salt prints, leading the duo to became hugely successful, and showing in three Whitney Biennials. Told with humor, McGough looks back at their professional and romantic partnership and struggles. $29.95

Texto completo: Iraq
6 are killed as protests continue BAGHDAD — Iraqi security forces killed six antigovernment protesters and wounded more than 100 others on Saturday, pushing them back from three flashpoint bridges in central Baghdad, medical and security officials said. Five of the protesters were killed by live ammunition, while the sixth died after being shot in the head with a tear gas canister. The Iraqi officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The current cycle of antigovernment protests and the heavy-handed security crackdown has left more than 250 people dead. Mass protests erupted in Baghdad and across southern Iraq last month, calling for the overhaul of the political system established after the 2003 US-led invasion. The deaths occurred Saturday when demonstrators tried to reach the three bridges spanning the Tigris River to the Green Zone. (AP)

Countries vow to fight food waste ROME — More than 70 countries have pledged to do more to cut down on the amount of food lost due to poor refrigeration. The countries signed the pledge Saturday at an annual meeting of the Montreal Protocol where ministers, government officials, and experts work on regulating man-made chemicals used in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems that are harmful to the ozone layer. The meeting took place at the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in Rome. About one-third of the world's food is lost or wasted and the hope is that developing better methods to keep food cold while it's stored and transported will reduce waste. Experts say better refrigeration would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the harmful gases used in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. (AP)
Australia
Early wildfires are hitting hard SYDNEY — Wildfires surging across Australia's drought-ravaged East Coast have left two people dead and destroyed more than 150 homes, officials said on Saturday, sounding the alarm for what is expected to be one of the country's worst recorded fire seasons. With summer heat waves still several weeks away, 1,500 firefighters were battling 70 fires across New South Wales, mostly north of Sydney, where massive clouds of smoke drifted east, turning skies orange. The smoke clouds were large enough to create their own weather systems, experts said. Officials said it was unprecedented to see so many fires so out of control this early in spring.

Texto completo: Most Democrats in the country’s battleground states want to vote for a candidate who is more centrist than liberal, according to a new survey.
A New York Times-Siena College poll released Friday found that voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, and Florida preferred a candidate who would work with the other side of the aisle. Of those surveyed, 62% said they want a nominee who promises “to find common ground with Republicans,” compared to 33% who said they want a nominee who fights “for a bold progressive agenda.”
Additionally, 55% said they want the candidate to be “more moderate than most Democrats,” while 39% preferred the candidate to swing further to the left than most. Respondents were split on how they want to see the candidate handle the role, with 49% preferring that the nominee bring “politics in Washington back to normal” and 45% hoping for a “fundamental, systemic change to American society.”
Joe Biden led in five of the six states polled, with Elizabeth Warren enjoying a slight edge in Wisconsin. The only three candidates who brought in double-digit support in any of the states were Biden, Warren, and Bernie Sanders. Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris fell far behind the trio in all six states.
Nationally, Biden is the front-runner, with a RealClearPolitics average putting him at 28.3% support and Warren trailing him 20.6%.

What polling doesn't tell you about Trump's standing in Wisconsin

Texto completo: With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife's edge.

Texto completo: Valerie Plame, whose role as an undercover CIA operative was famously blown in an act of political retribution in 2003, has some advice for the still-anonymous whistleblower who sparked the Trump impeachment investigation: Be prepared to see your life turned upside down.
"Your name is being tossed out in the public sphere and it's being distorted and who you are and what you've done," Plame said Thursday in a telephone interview, recalling her experience. "I found it very disorienting."
Plame, a Democrat who is running for a House seat in New Mexico, recalls getting stares and hearing whispers at preschool drop-offs and supermarket lines, seeing her husband challenged to a fight at an airport, and holding awkward conversations with friends and family whom she had misled for years about her life as a spy.

She said she was horrified by attempts by President Trump and some of his allies to identify and smear the motives of the individual -- reportedly an intelligence officer -- who filed the complaint despite federal laws intended to shield whistleblowers from retribution.
As he left the White House on Friday, Trump complained repeatedly to reporters, slamming the "fake whistleblower" as a "disgrace to our country." The individual's identity, he added, "should be revealed."
Although a parade of White House, State Department and other officials have confirmed and expanded on the whistleblower's account, the president and his allies have suggested that anonymity is proof of partisan bias.
Trump long has attacked anyone who criticizes him as biased or corrupt. In September, days after the complaint was revealed, Trump likened the whistleblower to a spy inside the White House who had committed treason.
At a Louisiana rally on Wednesday, Trump read a tweet that the whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, had sent soon after Trump's inauguration in 2017 that said "a coup has started" and "impeachment will follow ultimately."
"His lawyer, who said the worst things possible two years ago, he should be sued and maybe for treason," Trump told reporters Friday.
The whistleblower's lawyers warned the White House this week that the president's efforts to unmask the whistleblower were putting their client in danger.
Zaid warned in a statement that anyone identifying a suspected name for the whistleblower would put "that individual and their family at risk of serious harm," and would deter future whistleblowers from coming forward. He said he would not confirm or deny any name published or promoted by the president or his supporters.
Zaid's co-counsel, Andrew P. Bakaj, sent a letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone on Thursday warning of "the legal and ethical peril" that Trump could face if anyone is "physically harmed as a result of his, or surrogates' behavior."
So far, no mainstream news organization has named the individual. Donald Trump Jr. linked on Twitter to an article in Breitbart, a far-right website, which cited another conservative news outlet that purported to name the person. Trump Jr. denied coordinating with the White House, and the name has not been confirmed.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who appeared with Trump at a rally Monday in Lexington, Ky., urged the media to out the whistleblower while declining to do so himself. "Do your job and print his name," he said.
On Wednesday, Paul blocked a Senate resolution that would have reaffirmed support for whistleblower protections, prompting an exchange with the bill's sponsor, Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat.
"Let's be clear. The real purpose of these attacks is to scare anyone else who may be thinking of coming forward to stay silent," Hirono said on the Senate floor.
Trump's daughter Ivanka offered a different view from her father, telling the Associated Press on Friday during a visit to Morocco that the whistleblower's identity is "not particularly relevant aside from what the motivation behind all this was."
"The whistleblower shouldn't be a substantive part of the conversation," she said, because the person "did not have firsthand information."
Transcripts from closed-door impeachment hearings released this week show that Republican attorneys have asked questions in several hearings intended to reveal or confirm the person's identity. None of the witnesses did so.
Republicans have also sought to force the whistleblower to testify in Congress, rejecting Zaid's offer to have his client answer their written questions.
"All whistleblowers are not created equal," Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Thursday on Fox News. He called the whistleblower an "anonymous informant" and said "it was pretty unreasonable for the whistleblower to expect to remain anonymous."
Trump has claimed that the whistleblower gave false information in a complaint that alleged Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, after freezing nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine.
But a memorandum of the call released by the White House and testimony by multiple witnesses have borne out the whistleblower's narrative.
Three witnesses are scheduled to testify next week in the first public hearings of the impeachment inquiry.
The current circumstances do not directly echo Plame's. But there are similarities.
She was thrust into the spotlight after her husband, Joe Wilson, a former diplomat, had written an op-ed that publicly contradicted part of President George W. Bush's justification for going to war in Iraq.
The CIA had sent Wilson to the African nation of Niger to investigate whether it had sold a uranium concentrate to Iraq for a suspected nuclear weapons program. Wilson, who died in September, quickly determined the claim was false.
But administration officials, in an apparent act of retaliation, suggested Wilson only got the job because he was married to a CIA officer, and leaked her name to several reporters. A subsequent investigation led to the jailing of a New York Times reporter who refused to reveal her source and the conviction of a top White House official for lying and obstruction.
Plame sees a common thread: "Shoot the messenger. Trump is fantastic at this tactic -- 'Look at the shiny ball,'" she said.
Plame said she fears the whistleblower could face personal danger as the rhetoric escalates. She said she was denied protection for her and her family after they received a credible threat.
"I felt somewhat, frankly, abandoned by the leadership of the CIA. They didn't know what to do with me. I was such a political hot potato," she said.
In the end, Plame said she relied on friends and family for support -- and urged the whistleblower to do the same.
"This will be a storm, you will need them," she said. "He'll just have to hunker down and try to weather this."

Texto completo: Are they afraid of informed voters?

Stories of our infamous Florida Man - like the one about the guy bitten by an alligator he was trying to get drunk or the fellow who crashed his riding mower into a police car while inebriated - are what get us the big laughs on late-night TV. And not in a good way.

Apparently, it's time to add Florida Politician to the mix - or politicians, since they sometimes work in tandem when they do something so deeply embarrassing it makes headlines across the nation.

In sleepy Inverness three counties north of Tampa, Citrus County commissioners last month considered a request for a modest $2,700 to give digital access to the New York Times to some 70,000 library cardholders. The library gets the print edition of the paper, but this would mean people could read the New York Times on their phones, computers and other devices.

Commissioners could have talked about how it's a library's job to get information from varied sources to lots of citizens. Instead, they appeared ready for an oldschool book burning for the digital age.

Commissioner Jimmie Smith: 'Why the heck would we spend money on something like that?' Commissioner Ron Kitchen Jr.: 'Do we really need to subscribe to the New York Times?'

Commissioner Scott Carnahan: 'Fake news, I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county. I don't agree with it, I don't like 'em, it's fake news and I'm voting no.' So if they don't agree with it, by gosh, the people they represent weren't going to get expanded access to it - even the New York Times, a storied publication that's won more than a hundred Pulitzers in its time. What's next, going through library shelves and tossing out classics that don't match a commissioner's particular worldview?

Public libraries are one of the best things we've got going, filled with ideas, literature, beach reads, history, science, politics. They're a window on the world. They hold material that's appealing, thought-provoking, unfamiliar, even offensive. It's about knowledge, and how people different from you think.

Unless your elected officials decide you don't need to know.

Not so long ago, a small display of gay literature at a Hillsborough library inspired some offended commissioners to pass a ban on county participation in anything to do with gay pride. Not long after, voters elected their first openly gay commissioner and the board ultimately did away with that anti-pride mandate.

Back in Citrus County, commissioners had another meeting, and protesters wanted them to know how they felt about censorship and partisanship. That day, Commissioner Kitchen lamented, 'We can no longer have a conversation between one another.' But conversation involves leaving room for views other than your own. They'll revisit the New York Times access issue at their Nov. 19 meeting.

On this one, an elected official's presidential preference or personal politics should matter not a whit. We're not talking about a commissioner's private library or stack of favorite paperbacks on his front porch. This is about the greater good for the citizens this commission serves.

And fear of information is not a good look, even for Florida Politician.

Former FBI agent lays out case that Kirstjen Nielsen behind anonymous book

Texto completo: A former FBI special agent speculated that former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is the author of the scathing book about President Trump written by a senior administration official.
Josh Campbell, now a CNN analyst, said in April that Nielsen's resignation letter resembled a New York Times op-ed written by the unnamed Trump official, who said that they were part of a “resistance” working to undermine the president’s worst impulses.
Campbell said Thursday that book excerpts published by the Washington Post bolster his argument.
The book excerpts and Nielsen’s past speeches both have sentences that begin with “It is,” use the phrases “those who would” and “all I can tell you,” he said.
Tweet
In tweets from April that appear to have since been deleted, Campbell compared sentences between Nielsen's resignation letter and the op-ed.
“As a trained investigator, I’m just going to go on record now saying that anonymous NYT op-ed was LOADED with commas and em dashes,” Campbell said. “And so is this resignation letter.”
The same days as Campbell’s tweets, CNN’s Jake Tapper said a senior administration official told him Nielsen believed Trump was “becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests.”
Nielsen said through a representative last year that she had more important matters to focus on than writing the anonymous opinion piece.
"These types of political attacks are beneath the Secretary and the Department’s mission," the statement said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A senior American diplomat has written a highly critical assessment of the Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of troops from northeast Syria last month, a decision that paved the way for an attack on U.S.-allied forces in the area, officials said Thursday.
In an internal memo, William Roebuck, the top American diplomat in northern Syria, takes the Trump administration to task for not doing more to prevent Turkey's invasion or protect the Kurds, who fought alongside U.S. forces in the battle against the Islamic State group, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter.
One of the officials described the memo, which was obtained and first revealed by The New York Times, as "lengthy and harsh." The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
Roebuck's memo highlights how President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the troops was deeply divisive, even within his own administration. The move was widely criticized by Democrats and Republicans as abandoning a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State.
Turkey invaded days after Trump ordered the U.S. special forces to leave.
In the memo quoted by the Times, Roebuck said there was no way to know if more pressure on Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, would have stopped the operation.
"It's a tough call, and the answer is probably not. But we won't know because we didn't try," the Times quoted Roebuck as writing.
Trump's ordered withdrawal from the northeast has been somewhat tempered by the deployment of forces to protect oil fields in Kurdish-held areas.
GM selling shuttered factory
in Ohio to electric truck maker
TOLEDO, Ohio - General Motors is selling a massive assembly plant it shut down earlier this year in Ohio, a closing that drew threats and scolding from President Donald Trump, to a newly formed company that said Thursday it intends to begin making electric trucks by late 2020.
The company called Lordstown Motors Corp. plans to hire 400 production workers at the outset, but said it still needs more investors before manufacturing can begin.
GM had employed 4,500 people at the factory near Youngstown just two years ago before it began cutting production and eventually in March ended more than 50 years of car manufacturing there, part of a major restructuring plan.
Terms of the sale and the investors who are behind the deal weren't disclosed by the privately held Lordstown Motors.
French leader laments NATO's 'brain death' due to US actions
BRUSSELS - French President Emmanuel Macron claimed that a lack of U.S. leadership is causing the "brain death" of the NATO military alliance, insisting in an interview published Thursday that the European Union must step up and start acting as a strategic world power.
Macron's public criticism of the state of the world's biggest military alliance was rejected by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, setting the scene for a possible showdown in London next month when NATO leaders meet.
"What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO," Macron told The Economist magazine. He said the United States under President Donald Trump appears to be "turning its back on us."
North Carolina no longer an outlier on sex and consent
GREENSBORO, N.C. - North Carolina's governor has signed a sexual assault bill that says women can revoke consent during sex.
Gov. Roy Cooper said in a news release Thursday that he had signed the bill, which undoes a 1979 court decision that made North Carolina the only state where women can't revoke consent.
The law also undoes a court ruling from 2008 that said sexual assault laws don't apply to people who were incapacitated because of their own action as victims, such as by taking drugs or alcohol. It also increases penalties for child abusers.
The law goes into effect Dec. 1.
Both houses of the legislature approved the bill unanimously last week. Cooper says the bipartisan legislation "will help more people seek justice against abusers."
Okla. woman in failure-to-protect case to be freed
OKLAHOMA CITY - An Oklahoma woman who has served 15 years in prison for failing to report her boyfriend, who served just two years for abusing her children, is scheduled to be released from custody.
The Oklahoma Department of Corrections says Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed the commutation sentence of Tondalao Hall and she is to be released Friday.
Her release comes about after the state Pardon and Parole Board voted unanimously to recommend that Stitt commute her sentence to time served.
Hall's ex-boyfriend, Robert Braxton, pleaded guilty to abusing the children and was released on probation after two years in jail.
The disparity of the sentences outraged women's rights groups and brought further attention to Oklahoma's high rate of incarceration, particularly of women.
Governor of Texas to open homeless camp in Austin
AUSTIN, Texas - Texas' Republican governor said Thursday that he is creating a homeless campsite on 5 acres of state land of the outskirts of downtown in the capital of Austin, escalating a battle with the city's liberal leaders over people living on the streets.
Greg Abbott's announcement was met with a mix of muted welcoming and accusations of political posturing from Democrats who run the state capital around the Texas Governor's Mansion, where Abbott has spent months lashing out at the city's homelessness problem on Twitter.
Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the campsite will have portable restrooms and hand-washing stations. He said it will also provide access to homeless case workers and health care providers until permanent sheltering opens.
In China: A court sentenced nine fentanyl traffickers Thursday in a case that is the culmination of a rare collaboration between Chinese and U.S. law enforcement.
Liu Yong was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, while Jiang Juhua and Wang Fengxi were sentenced to life in prison. Six other members of the operation received lesser sentences, ranging from six months to 10 years. Death sentences are almost always commuted to life in prison after the reprieve.

Texto completo: A federal judge has dismissed presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren from a libel suit filed by 10 Covington Catholic High School students.
The students, identified only as the "Covington Boys" in court records, filed suit in August alleging they were defamed by a dozen public figures in the aftermath of their encounter with Native Americans on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 18, 2019.
That encounter, which was captured on video, went viral and garnered strong rebukes of some of the Kentucky students' behavior toward the Native Americans, including Nathan Phillips.
A day after the incident, Warren tweeted that Phillips "endured hateful taunts with dignity and strength, then urged us all to do better."
The students sued the Massachusetts congresswoman and 11 other public figures who criticized the students, including New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, actress Kathy Griffin, activist Shaun King and U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland.
U.S. District Judge William Bertelsman ruled Tuesday that Warren acted within the scope of her employment when she tweeted and is therefore protected by sovereign immunity.
The judge also dismissed Haaland, of New Mexico, from the suit. Haaland had tweeted that Phillips was "harassed and mocked by a group of MAGA hat-wearing teens."
Attorneys for the students claimed the boys became the target of "a social media lynch mob" that spread misinformation and led to the boys receiving death threats and hate mail.
They argued that as more video of the encounter came out, a fuller picture of the incident emerged, undercutting earlier claims about the teens.
In his Tuesday order, Bertelsman declined to dismiss the remaining defendants and sent the case back to Kenton Circuit Court.
Other defendants named in the suit are:
Reza Aslan, a scholar and author;
Matthew Dowd, a political consultant and analyst;
Adam Edelen, a former state auditor of Kentucky;
Jodi Jacobson, the editor-in-chief of Rewire News;
Clara Jeffery, the editor-in-chief of Mother Jones;
Kevin Kruse, a history professor at Princeton;
Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and frequent CNN guest.
The suit seeks between $15,000 and $50,000 for each Covington student.

Texto completo: The 43rd stamp in the United States Postal Service's Black Heritage series honors Gwen Ifill, one of America's most esteemed journalists.
The stamp features a photo of Ifill taken in 2008 by photographer Robert Severi and designed by Derry Noyes, according to the Postal Service.
Among the first African Americans to hold prominent positions in both broadcast and print journalism, Ifill was a trailblazer in the profession.
Ifill was born on September 29, 1 955, in New York.
Her father, O. Urcille Ifill, Sr., served as an African Methodist Episcopal minister who hailed from Panama.
Her mother, Eleanor Husbands, was from Barbados. According to Ifill's 2012 biography and interview with The History Makers, her father's ministry required the family to live in several cities in different church parsonages throughout New England.
Those stops also included Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York, where the family resided in federally subsidized housing.
Ifill's interest in journalism was rooted in her parents' insistence that their children gather nightly in front of the television to watch the national news, according to The History Makers.
In 1973, Ifill graduated from Classical High School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Four years later, she received her B.A. degree in communications from Simmons College in Boston.
"During her senior year, she interned at the Boston Herald American newspaper," the biography reads.
She later worked at the Baltimore Evening Sun, the Washington Post, and the New York Times before moving over to NBC News.
In 1999, Ifill became the first African American woman to host a prominent political talk show on national television, when she became moderator and managing editor of PBS's Washington Week and senior political correspondent for The PBS News Hour.
Ifill died at the age of 61, on November 14, 2016.
"She was the most American of success stories," Sherrilynn Ifill, a law professor, director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and Gwen Ifill's cousin told NBC News. ""Her life and her work made this country better."

Texto completo: Microsoft co-founder and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates says he has paid over $10 billion in taxes over his lifetime, but Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren‘s wealth tax proposal might force him to count how much he’s got left.
Speaking at The New York Times DealBook conference on Wednesday in New York City, the philanthropist said he’s all for hiking taxes on the ultra-wealthy to increase government revenue, but lawmakers need to think about building an effective “incentive system” that will work for all of the billionaires and multi-millionaires.

“I’ve paid more than anyone in taxes. If I had to pay $20 billion, it’s fine,” Gates said during an onstage interview with Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin. “But, you know, when you say I should pay $100 billion, OK, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over… Sorry, I’m just kidding. So you really want the incentive system to be there, and you can go a long way without threatening that.”
Bill Gates’ net worth currently stands at $106 billion.
Asked whether he would like to discuss his thoughts with Warren in person, Gates said, “You know, I’m not sure how open-minded she is, or that she’d even be willing to sit down with somebody, you know, who has large amounts of money.”
Responding to the news over the internet, Warren tweeted that she’d like to invite Gates for a face-to-face meeting to explain “exactly how much” he would have to pay under her policy.
“I’m always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views,” she wrote, tagging Gates directly. “If we get the chance, I’d love to explain exactly how much you’d pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it’s not $100 billion.)”
Last week, Warren laid out a plan to fund “Medicare for All,” which requires $20.5 trillion in federal spending over a decade, by imposing a 6% tax on households with over $1 billion in net worth and raising capital gain taxes on the top 1%.

Alleged whistleblower Eric Ciaramella was cited in key passage of Mueller report

Texto completo: Eric Ciaramella, alleged to be the Ukraine whistleblower, was cited in a key passage of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report in connection to the meeting between President Trump and Russian officials in the Oval Office the day after James Comey was fired as FBI director.
Ciaramella, a career CIA analyst, was Ukraine director on the National Security Council during the end of the Obama administration and remained there during the early months of the Trump administration, when he was briefly acting senior director for European and Russian affairs before the arrival of Fiona Hill. This week, the Washington Examiner reported that Ciaramella, 33, is now a deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia on the National Intelligence Council, reporting to the director of national intelligence.
On Oct. 31, RealClearInvestigations reported that Ciaramella was the whistleblower who filed a complaint about a July 25 phone call. During the call, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into a conspiracy theory regarding CrowdStrike and to investigate Democratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.
Ciaramella appears in a footnote on the 71st page of Mueller’s 448-page report, with Mueller citing two emails that he sent to John Kelly, then chief of staff, and other administration officials describing the details of a meeting between Trump and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

A letter that then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote in May 2017 justified Comey's firing by criticizing his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, but Trump would subsequently suggest he'd fired Comey because of the Trump-Russia investigation. After Comey was fired, he leaked information from some of his memos to the media in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.

The Mueller report footnote referenced Ciaramella’s emails when it stated that “the meeting had been planned on May 2, 2017, during a telephone call between the President and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the meeting date was confirmed on May 5, 2017, the same day the President dictated ideas for the Comey termination letter to [Trump aide] Stephen Miller.”
The body of the Mueller report went on to quote from a New York Times article published on May 19, 2017, that cited an “American official” who read a “document summarizing the meeting” to the reporters.

“I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job,” Trump was quoted as saying. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off … I’m not under investigation.”

Mueller noted that “the White House did not dispute the account” but rather issued a statement defending Trump’s decision to fire Comey.

“By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia’s actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia,” former press secretary Sean Spicer said at the time. “The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified conversations.”
The New York Times had already revealed on May 16, 2017, that Trump disclosed some classified information about an anti-ISIS operation in Syria to the Russians during the same Oval Office meeting.
Mueller went on to say that former Trump adviser Hope Hicks “said that when she told the President about the reports on his meeting with Lavrov, he did not look concerned” and that Trump reiterated that Comey “is crazy." Mueller also said that when White House counsel Don McGahn asked Trump about his comments to Lavrov, Trump “said it was good that Comey was fired because that took the pressure off by making it clear that he was not under investigation so he could get more work done.”

The whistleblower complaint in August alleged that the transcript of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky was “locked down” in a potentially “abusive” way and that U.S. officials were “deeply concerned” by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s “circumvention of national security decision-making.”
Trump asked for a "favor" from Ukraine in investigating a conspiracy theory related to the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which determined the Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee’s email systems, an assessment agreed to by Mueller and the U.S. intelligence community. Trump also urged the Ukrainian leader to look into any Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election. The president brought up his request related to CrowdStrike immediately after Zelensky asked about purchasing anti-tank weaponry, known as Javelins, from the United States. Trump also talked about "the other thing," suggesting that the Ukrainians investigate allegations of corruption related to Biden and his son.
In recent weeks, more reports from the May 2017 meeting between Trump and the Russians have emerged.
CNN’s Jim Sciutto reported in early September that Trump’s handling of classified information during his discussion with the Russians prompted the U.S. to exfiltrate a high-level CIA informant close to the Kremlin shortly thereafter, although a follow-up story from the New York Times and others cast doubt on CNN’s reporting, stating that the U.S. had tried to pull the informant out as early as 2016 and that its 2017 decision to remove him from Russia wasn’t due to Trump’s comments.
The informant, recruited by the CIA decades ago, has been described as a mid-level Russian official who was outside Vladimir Putin's inner circle and yet saw Putin on a regular basis and was privy to high-level information. This Moscow spy's intelligence was allegedly key to the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Putin himself ordered a Russian interference campaign in the U.S. 2016 election.
The Washington Post reported in late September that, during his conversation with the Russians, Trump said that he “was unconcerned about Moscow’s interference in the U.S. election because the United States did the same in other countries” and that Trump’s assertion “prompted alarmed White House officials to limit access to the remarks to an unusually small number of people.”

What Trump and Republicans should learn from Virginia Democrats' gun safety win over NRA

Texto completo: Republicans suffered a major defeat in Virginia this week, losing control of both houses of the state legislature for the first time in nearly 25 years. While electoral strategists are still poring over the results, one major takeaway is clear: Candidates, especially those who rely on swing suburban voters, can win by making gun safety a central part of their campaign. And given Virginia’s status as a reliable national bellwether, the results should strike fear in the heart of every candidate up and down the ballot who is controlled by the gun lobby — including President Donald Trump.
The outcome shouldn’t have come as a surprise to Virginia Republicans. Gun safety has been a key issue in the state for years now, dating to the Virginia Tech mass shooting in 2007. But it was a more recent tragedy, the May 31 killing of 12 people in Virginia Beach, that laid the groundwork for Richmond’s new gun-sense majority.
Four days after the shooting, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam ordered a special session on gun violence. One month later, Republicans ended the session after just 90 minutes without taking up a single piece of legislation.
Republicans' big mistake on guns
This would prove to be a decisive mistake. It soon became clear that voters did not share Republicans’ disinterest in keeping their communities safe. A Washington Post poll found that 75% of Virginia voters ranked gun policy as “very important” to their vote, ahead of bread-and-butter concerns like education and health care. And preventing gun violence is the driving issue for one critical group of swing voters: suburban women.
Recognizing this, my organization, Everytown for Gun Safety, spent $2. 5 million to let voters know which candidates stood for gun safety and which stood with the National Rifle Association, headquartered in Northern Virginia. With our support, candidates across the commonwealth made this their signature issue. Now the voters have spoken and their message was clear: They want leaders who promise to put gun safety ahead of the gun lobby.
The Virginia results are just the latest example of a national trend. We saw this in the 2018 midterms, when voters sent a gun-sense majority to the U. S. House of Representatives and elected gun-sense champions to state houses across the country. And this trend doesn’t just apply to Democrats — one recent poll found that 83% of Republicans want to expand background checks, and that 85% support red-flag laws allowing guns to be taken from people judged to be a danger to themselves or others.
Take it from a doctor: Gun violence is a health crisis, not a political football
If there’s one politician who should be especially shaken by Tuesday’s results, it’s Trump. After the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, this summer, Trump said he was open to taking action to prevent gun violence. But when NRA leader Wayne LaPierre visited the White House and made it clear that the organization’s continuing support for Trump hinged on him doing nothing, the president quickly fell in line, according to The New York Times.
Trump can't ignore suburbia
What Trump doesn’t seem to be considering is that in order to win reelection, he needs swing district suburban voters far more than he needs the NRA’s backing. Unless he uses Tuesday night’s results as a wake-up call and pushes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take up the backlog of gun safety bills passed by the House, the president can expect to pay a serious price at the ballot box — just like the Virginia Republicans did.
Tim Kaine on Virginia Beach shooting: Will we fix laws or let the carnage continue?
Trump and members of Congress who take their cues from the gun lobby need to realize that the old myth of the NRA as a political juggernaut has been debunked. The organization is under the harsh microscope of investigations by two attorneys general, paying tens of millions in legal fees, and trying to rationalize exorbitant spending on private jets and luxury clothes.
As the dust settles in Virginia, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Everytown out-organized the NRA on the ground and outspent it 8-to-1.
Next year's candidates face a simple choice when it comes to gun safety: Follow the lead of Virginia Republicans and hope against reason that history won’t repeat itself, or side with the American people and pledge to do something about gun violence. Savvy politicians, particularly those who need to win over suburban swing voters, will see that standing up to the gun lobby isn’t just the right thing to do — it’s also smart politics.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former national security adviser John Bolton refused to appear before the House impeachment panel on Thursday and his lawyer told Democrats he would fight a congressional subpoena.
"His counsel has informed us . . . Mr. Bolton would take us to court if we subpoenaed him," a House Intelligence Committee official told USA TODAY.
The official said the committee would not issue a subpoena for Bolton's testimony because it would only delay the investigation and would instead consider Bolton's refusal to appear as evidence of obstruction.
"We regret Mr. Bolton’s decision not to appear voluntarily, but we have no interest in allowing the administration to play rope-a-dope with us in the courts for months," said this official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Rather, the White House instruction that he not appear will add to the evidence of the president’s obstruction of Congress. "
Bolton is known as a political bomb thrower, and Democrats hoped he would provide explosive testimony as they pursue allegations that President Donald Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.
Bolton is a hard-charging hawk who clashed repeatedly with Trump, and left the White House under acrimonious circumstances. But he is also a Republican stalwart who is likely to resist becoming a pawn in the House Democrats' impeachment probe.
"Frankly, I don’t think anybody knows, except John Bolton, exactly what role he wants to play in this drama," said Aaron David Miller, who served as a foreign policy adviser to presidents in both parties and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
"Is he looking for revenge?" Miller said. Or will he see this inquiry as a "Democratic show" that he wants no part of?
Bolton offered a tease on Thursday morning, blasting out an "opening statement" via his political action committee, which raises money to support GOP candidates who, like him, embrace hard-line positions on national security issues. In the pitch, Bolton blasted "radicalized Democrats" and suggested he sees the impeachment inquiry as a dangerous distraction.
"While America is preoccupied with events on Capitol Hill, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are doing everything in their power to take us down," Bolton says in the email, which links to a "survey" on political and national security questions. "We're doing more to destabilize ourselves than they could ever accomplish in their wildest dreams. "
Before Thursday's scheduled appearance, Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, had said the former national security adviser wouldn't appear before the impeachment panel without a subpoena. Bolton may be waiting for the outcome of a court case challenging Congress' subpoenas in the Ukraine matter.
Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank, said if Bolton eventually agrees to testify, he will be walking a tightrope.
“I think it will be a balance for John, who has been a lifelong Republican and who is a big supporter of the party through his PAC,” said Pletka. Bolton worked at AEI before he joined the Trump administration in 2018. He also runs a political action committee that doles out campaign contributions to hawkish GOP candidates.
On the one hand, Pletka said, Bolton will not want to become “a political football. ” On the other, he will want to “stay on the right side of the law and of the principles that he embraces. ”
“There’s just a lot of forces at work here that make it very hard,” she said.
Whether Bolton testifies or not, one thing is clear: He was a central player in the Ukraine saga. Previous witnesses have portrayed him as a leading critic of the effort, led by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine's new leader to open two investigations that would have benefited Trump's domestic political prospects ahead of the 2020 election.
Bolton reportedly referred to Giuliani as "a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up. " Fiona Hill, who served under Bolton as the National Security Council's senior director for Europe and Russia, told lawmakers in her closed-door testimony that Bolton wanted no part of what he derided as a White House "drug deal" to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
Bolton would be the highest-ranking Trump administration official to testify in the impeachment inquiry, and the closest adviser to the president.
"He saw this whole movie up close and personal, which means his testimony would be incredibly damaging and devastating should he agree to do the full reveal," said Miller.
A string of other witnesses, from the State Department and other executive agencies, have already provided private depositions. But Bolton could offer an insider's account of whether Trump urged Ukraine to investigate his political rival, while withholding nearly $400 million in U. S. military aid that Ukraine needed to counter Russian aggression. State Department and National Security Council officials have said Giuliani was running a shadow foreign policy campaign on Ukraine.
Bill Taylor, the top U. S. diplomat in Ukraine, told lawmakers it was his "clear understanding" that U. S. military aid to Ukraine was being withheld until Ukraine's president publicly agreed to open investigations that Trump and Giuliani wanted. Taylor mentioned Bolton numerous times in his testimony, according to a transcript released Wednesday.
Taylor said Bolton shared his concerns about Trump's refusal to release the military aid, and told him to send a cable to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing alarm about that situation.
"He indicated that he was very sympathetic," Taylor said of Bolton.
Still, Pletka said she does not expect Bolton to provide a watershed moment in the House probe, because Democrats have already drawn their conclusions and are bent on impeaching Trump. Plus, she said, Bolton will not be easily flummoxed by Democrats’ grilling.
He is a shrewd lawyer and is "very good at understanding where to draw these sorts of lines. "
Bolton either quit or was fired in September amid numerous disagreements with Trump over foreign policy.
Some other administration officials have refused to testify, citing the White House's argument that executive privilege or absolute immunity protects them from being compelled to testify before Congress.
Former White House counsel Don McGahn continues to fight his congressional subpoena in federal court. Bolton's deputy, Charles Kupperman, asked a federal court to rule which carries more weight: a White House directive not to testify or a congressional subpoena. But the House withdrew Kupperman's subpoena Wednesday.
Bolton could become one of the final closed-door witnesses for the three key committees investigating Ukraine: Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform. Another witness summoned Thursday is Jennifer Williams, a State Department staffer reporting to Keith Kellogg, the national security adviser for Vice President Mike Pence. The panels summoned two witnesses Friday, including acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, but neither is expected to appear. Public hearings before the Intelligence Committee begin next week with Taylor, the U. S. diplomat in Ukraine, on Nov. 13 and Marie Yovanovitch, the former U. S. ambassador to Ukraine, on Nov. 15.
Several State Department officials, including Gordon Sondland, the U. S. ambassador to the European Union, and Bill Taylor, the top U. S. diplomat in Ukraine, described two channels setting policy for Ukraine. One channel was through the State Department. The other was guided by Giuliani, who worked with Sondland; Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine; and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to Taylor.
The irregular channel began in May 2019 after an American delegation returned from Ukraine, Taylor said. Diplomats described learning that Trump and Giuliani repeatedly sought a Ukraine investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
A flashpoint came at a July 10 meeting at the White House on Ukraine policy. Hill, then the National Security Council's senior director on Europe and Russia, testified that Bolton told her to contact John Eisenberg, the council's top lawyer, after the meeting.
Bolton said he wasn't part of "whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up," according to an account of Hill's testimony in The New York Times.
Taylor said that Hill and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council expert on Ukraine, relayed details of the meeting to him during a July 19 phone call.
"They told me that Ambassador Sondland had connected 'investigations' with an Oval Office meeting for President (Volodymyr) Zelensky, which so irritated Ambassador Bolton that he abruptly ended the meeting, telling Dr. Hill and Mr. Vindman that they should have nothing to do with domestic politics," Taylor said, according to his opening statement before the impeachment panel.
Bolton had argued against a phone call between Trump and Zelensky, fearing it would be a "disaster," according to Taylor.
Vindman testified that he was concerned about a briefing he attended after the July 10 meeting, when Sondland emphasized the need for a Ukraine investigation "into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma," the Ukrainian company whose board had included Hunter Biden. Vindman said he told Sondland that "his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security. "
Vindman and Hill each reported their concerns to the council's lawyer, Eisenberg.

Texto completo: An Editorial Observer column argued that the speaker of the House should not be next in line after the vice president. Readers offer their opinions.
To the Editor:
Re "Nancy Pelosi Should Not Be President," by Jesse Wegman (Editorial Observer, Nov. 4):
Mr. Wegman has identified a genuine problem in our political system: It is extraordinarily unwise, and even politically dangerous, to place the speaker and the president pro tem of the Senate in the line of succession, given the real possibility that they are not from the president's own party.
As Mr. Wegman accurately points out, there is also a completely serious (and I believe persuasive) argument that the Presidential Succession Act is unconstitutional, even if it is almost impossible to imagine a federal court actually evicting a speaker who becomes president.
There is no excuse for the failure to pass bipartisan corrective legislation, ideally co-sponsored by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the president pro tem, Charles Grassley. If passed in the next few weeks, it would actually give us something to be grateful for at Thanksgiving!

To the Editor:
If the corruption and moral rot of the party in power lead to the impeachment of both the president and the vice president, perhaps turning the presidency over to the other party is well deserved.
Peter McCabe
East Brunswick, N.J.
To the Editor:
The writer's concern that party continuity in succession might be violated when the speaker is of a different party has validity, but it is eclipsed by this: Institutional obligations under the separation of powers are more important than party politics. And so is the preference for giving the reins of government to an elected official -- a member of Congress -- over a cabinet secretary.
Witness the fact that the founders rejected turning impeachment over to the courts. Alexander Hamilton warned that putting impeachment in congressional hands risked acceding to political motivations, but as James Madison noted, "In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates." Madison was right.

The writer is chairman of the political science department at SUNY Cortland and the author of "The Presidency and the Constitution."
To the Editor:
Jesse Wegman asks, "Don't the American people choose presidents largely because of their parties?" He makes this presumption the basis for deciding that Nancy Pelosi shouldn't be in the line of succession to the presidency.
Mr. Wegman conveniently overlooks the fact that, according to a recent Gallup poll, registered Republicans comprise only 26 percent of the voting public. Clearly, President Trump couldn't possibly have been elected if party registration were the only decisive factor.
In calling for cabinet officials to replace members of Congress in the line of succession, Mr. Wegman also overlooks the fact that much of the executive branch is now composed of "acting" officials who have never been confirmed by the Senate. This has occurred because of extraordinary turnover in the Trump White House. Does Mr. Wegman want an acting secretary of state in the line of succession, someone who accepted the job as a fill-in until a better qualified person could be nominated?

The writer is the author of "The Two-Party System Nobody Asked For."
To the Editor:
The idea that the laws governing presidential succession should be changed has merit. However, your suggestion that the law should designate cabinet members immediately after the president and the vice president is flawed. Many of the members of this carousel cabinet are, or have been, as unqualified to be president as Donald Trump.
Perhaps a better idea would be to have the members of the president's party in the House of Representatives select someone. If a safeguard were required, members of the president's party in the Senate could confirm. This has the validating aspect of being parallel to the process used to remove a president.

Texto completo: Steven Menashi, who faces a key vote Thursday, helped devise an Education Department plan to use Social Security data to deny students debt relief, an effort that a judge ruled violated privacy laws.
WASHINGTON -- A judicial nominee slated for a key Senate committee vote on Thursday helped devise an illegal Education Department effort to use private Social Security data to deny debt relief to thousands of students cheated by their for-profit colleges, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times.
The plan, outlined by Steven J. Menashi when he was acting general counsel under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was ruled by a federal judge to violate federal privacy laws. She ordered the department to stop the practice.
In the memo, President Trump's appeals court nominee, who left the Education Department to join the White House legal team, outlined the department's plan to use earnings data from the Social Security Administration to forgive only a small percentage of debts shouldered by 30,000 borrowers who attended Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit chain that the Obama administration found misled thousands of students. Corinthian's collapse left its students and graduates with worthless degrees and mountains of debt.
In the previously unreported memo, Mr. Menashi wrote that Ms. DeVos had the discretion to determine how to respond to requests for relief, then boasted that the department had used Social Security income data: "The department utilized actual earnings data for borrowers maintained by the Social Security Administration."
He also said her method was not subject to judicial review.
That proved untrue: Six months after a new partial-forgiveness policy was implemented, Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled that using the Social Security data violated the federal Privacy Act. Since then, the department has been entangled in a messy court battle, which recently resulted in Ms. DeVos being held in contempt of court and facing a $ 100,000 fine.
The fight has now become part of a broad effort to thwart Mr. Menashi's confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Eileen Connor, the legal director at Harvard's Project on Predatory Student Lending, the group representing Corinthian students in the lawsuit, warned that "putting Menashi on the bench will be seen by government agencies as a green light to put their agenda above the rights of everyday Americans, and above the rule of law."
"As we've seen time and time again, the only way for students to get a fair shake is not from the Department of Education, it's through the courts," she said. "Menashi has shown that in his view there is no role for the federal courts in reviewing, much less checking, executive action. This is a dangerous perspective for someone who could potentially hold a lifelong appointment to the federal appeals court."
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
The memo sheds light on the role that Mr. Menashi played in creating one of the Education Department's most embattled policies, which has made it significantly harder for people to seek student loan forgiveness. The memo, in which Mr. Menashi outlined the legal bases for the new loan forgiveness calculation resting "on substantial evidence of the harm to borrowers," informed a high-ranking official in the department's student aid office that it superseded legal interpretation by the Obama administration.
In response to questions during his confirmation process, Mr. Menashi has maintained that he was involved in "all aspects" of the department's operations, but in a hearing in September, he declined to answer specific questions about his efforts, prompting criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. At least one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she would oppose Mr. Menashi's confirmation, in part, because of his reluctance to answer questions about the specific policies he has influenced.
Other key Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, such as Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, also expressed reservations.
Mr. Menashi, a former law clerk to Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. at the Supreme Court, has also drawn criticism for past writings on issues affecting the gay community, women and other minorities.
Mr. Menashi has expressed regret about the writings. But critics have also raised concerns about his role in rolling back students' civil rights protections at the Education Department, where he was instrumental in overhauling regulations that govern how schools and colleges respond to complaints of sexual assault.
Last month, Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, sent a letter questioning Mr. Menashi about whether he helped Ms. DeVos "undermine protections" for student borrowers. She noted that his tenure overlapped with the lawsuit challenging the partial-forgiveness policy.
"I am concerned in light of your troubling record of working with Secretary DeVos to undermine protections for students who were cheated and defrauded by for-profit colleges," Ms. Murray wrote.
The 11-page memo is dated Dec. 14, 2017, about a week before Ms. DeVos announced a new system for calculating loan forgiveness, using "average earnings" after college to determine whether Corinthian students suffered long-term economic harm. She said the new system would allow "harmed students to be treated fairly," while protecting "taxpayers from being forced to shoulder massive costs that may be unjustified."
The department halted use of the data after Judge Kim's ruling. It had obtained the data from the Social Security Administration to implement another Obama-era regulation intended to force for-profit colleges to show that their degrees would lead to gainful employment.
In his memo, Mr. Menashi wrote that data obtained to hold for-profit colleges accountable could be repurposed to scrutinize their students. Mr. Menashi argued that the department was in a "unique position" to examine whether students had gone on to earn the salaries of other students in similar programs. He said a comparison of Corinthian students' earnings determined that the schools "provided measurable value to students."
Corinthian students argued that the department should not have been using the data for anything but the purpose it was requested for, and the judge agreed. Advocates for the students said the department's consideration of whether students went on to do well despite being lied to by their colleges was not relevant, nor was it relevant that some obtained jobs that had nothing to do with what they had trained for.
But Mr. Menashi's legal advice found a willing audience: Ms. DeVos has been clear that she did not want to grant full relief to students who claimed they were defrauded by colleges. She criticized the Obama administration's approach as "free money."
In a 2017 memo, unveiled in court filings, Ms. DeVos signed off on discharging the loans of 16,000 Corinthian students whose applications were approved under the Obama administration, but took the liberty of writing a message in the comments section of the form: "With extreme displeasure."

Texto completo: Week of November 6-12
November 6
1746 - Absalom Jones is born into slavery in Sussex, Del. He becomes the first Black Episcopal Church priest. Along with African Methodist Episcopal Church founder Richard Allen, he also founds a Black self-help group called the Free African Society. Jones dies in 1818.
1858 - Samuel E. Cornish dies. Along with John Russwurm, he established the first Black-owned and operated newspaper in America - "Freedom's Journal." The newspaper's famous motto was "We wish to plead our cause."
I860 - Abraham Lincoln is elected the 16th president of the United States. His opposition to the expansion of slavery prompted slave-owning states to succeed from the union which brought about the Civil War. Lincoln's opposition to slavery was more pragmatic than moral signified by his famous phrase - "A nation cannot exist half-slave and half-free."
1900 - James Weldon Johnson composes "Lift Ev'ry Voice And Sing." The song becomes the "Black National Anthem.'' In 1920, Johnson becomes the first Black head of the NAACP.
1928 - Oscar DePriest (1871-1951) is elected to the 71st U.S. Congress from the first Congressional District of Illinois. He was the first Black congressman from the North and the first to take a seat in Congress since Jim Crow laws and attitudes drove the last Black from Congress in 1901.
1973 - Coleman Young and Thomas Bradley are elected mayors of Detroit, Mich., and Los Angeles, Calif, respectively. They thus become the first Black mayors of cities with populations of one million or more.

November 7
1837 - Elijah P. Lovejoy, one of the White heroes of Black history, is killed by a pro-slavery mob while defending his anti-slavery newspaper in Alton, Ohio.
1841 - The "Slave Revolt On The Creole" occurs when 125 Black slaves overpower the crew of the slave ship Creole and sail it to the Bahamas, where they were granted freedom and political asylum.
1876 - The disputed presidential election which changed the course of Black history occurs. The dispute led to the Hayes-Tilden Compromise. In order to be declared president, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes reached an agreement with southern Democrats, which had the effect of ending much of Reconstruction and the protection of Black rights. The Jim Crow era began with "Black codes" and other measures which severely limited Black rights. Many of these rights were not restored until the 1960s. 1934 - The first Black Democrat is elected to the United States Congress. His name was Arthur L. Mitchell. Up until this point in history, most Blacks were Republicans because of the roles of Abraham Lincoln and a group, known as the "Radical Republicans," played in ending slavery. Mitchell defeated Oscar DePriest for the congressional seat from Chicago.
November 8
1898 - The Wilmington Massacre occurs. A mob of Whites launches a terror campaign against Blacks in Wilmington, N.C. They destroy a Black newspaper plant, seize control of city government and officially leave nine to 11 Blacks dead. However, the unofficial death toll was said to be closer to 100. The Black press building was burned.
1933 - Actress Esther Rolle is born in Pompano Beach, Fla. She is best remembered for her role in the 1970s television series "Good Times."

Banneker constructed the first clock made in America; completed the design and layout of Washington, D.C., after Pierre L'Enfant returned to France; published a farmer's almanac for 10 years, while also studying astronomy; and predicted solar eclipses.
1868 - The governor of Arkansas, Powell Clayton, calls out the state militia and declares martial law in 10 counties in a bid to put down a Ku Klux Klan-led insurrection.
1868 - The Howard University Medical School - the first designed to train Black medical personnel - opens in Washington, D.C. There were eight students in the first class.
1901 - Fiery pioneer Black journalist William Monroe Trotter starts the Guardian newspaper in Boston, Mass. Trotter made headlines throughout the nation when in November 1914, he confronted President Woodrow Wilson in the White House for failing to do more to stop the lynching of Blacks. For daring to argue with the president, the New York Times denounced Trotter saying he had "superabundant untactful belligerency." But W.E.B. DuBois called him "fearless."
1922 - Actress Dorothy Dandridge is born in Cleveland, Ohio. She is generally considered one of Hollywood's first Black female sex symbols. She appeared opposite Harry Belafonte in "Porgy and Bess" and was the first Black woman nominated for an Oscar. Dandridge died in 1965 at age 43.
November 10
1898 - George H. White introduces the first anti-lynching legislation in the U.S. Congress. The North Carolinian was one of the last Blacks in Congress before Jim Crow laws and attitudes drove most Blacks from high elected offices. After leaving Congress, he founded a Black bank and established an all-Black community called Whiteville near present day Trenton, N.J.
1891 - Granville T. Woods patents an improvement to the electric railway. Woods was one of the most prolific Black engineers and inventors in U.S. history. His motto could have been "I didn't invent the product, but I invented something that made it better." Born in Columbus, Ohio, he invented and patented improvements to the electric railway, air brakes, telegraphs, telephones and numerous other products.
1957 - Charlie Sifford wins the Long Beach Open, becoming the first Black person to win a major professional golf tournament.
1994 - Famed Jazz singer Carmen McRae dies in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was born in New York City on April 8, 1920.
November 11
1831 - Anti-slavery rebel Nat Turner is hanged roughly two months after his capture for leading the bloodiest slave revolt in U.S. history. The minister and mystic told reporters God had called on him to lead the revolt, which left 55 Whites dead.
November 12
1775 - General George Washington, first president and "father of the country" issues an order barring free Blacks from serving in the army as the U.S. struggled for independence from England. Washington was also a slave owner. The slave owning aristocracy felt if free Blacks fought for America's liberation they would demand freedom for their enslaved brothers and sisters. Despite Washington's order, hundreds of Blacks did fight in the Revolutionary War.
1900 - Henry Ossawa Tanner becomes an internationally acclaimed artist as he takes a silver medal for his art displayed at the Paris Exposition. Nearly 7,000 artists had entered their works. The Pittsburgh-born Tanner had numerous major works including his painting called "The Banjo Lesson."

Texto completo: El hijo mayor del presidente Donald Trump, tuiteó este miércoles el supuesto nombre del denunciante anónimo que reveló las presiones de su padre sobre Ucrania . La información que compartió Trump Jr. no ha sido corroborada y solo la han compartido pequeñas páginas web vinculadas a la extrema derecha.
La presunta identidad de quien reveló la información que desató el inicio del proceso para el juicio político al mandatario lleva semanas dando vueltas por la red . El propio mandatario ha pedido abiertamente a la prensa que revele el nombre, algo que va en contra de la leyes de protección al denunciante.
En su tuit, Trump Jr. enlazó un artículo de una publicación que sugería que el denunciante apoya a los demócratas y no a su padre. “ No hay denunciante. Hay alguien con intenciones ocultas contra Trump “, tuiteó el presidente el lunes.
Ese mismo día por la noche, en un acto en Kentucky, Trump y el senador republicano Rand Paul instaron a los medios a publicar la identidad del informante. “Nosotros también sabemos ahora el nombre del denunciante. Le dije esta noche a los medios: ‘hagan su trabajo y publiquen su nombre'” . Hasta ahora, según publicó The New York Times, solo se sabe que es un hombre que trabaja como agente de la CIA . The Times también adelantó que dicho agente tenía un amplio conocimiento de la política ucraniana .
La primera que publicó el supuesto nombre aseguró que su identidad había sido un secreto a voces en Washington. Andrew Bakaj, uno de los abogados del informante, no confirmó ni negó el nombre revelado a la agencia AFP y en un comunicado público dijo que “identificar cualquier nombre con el denunciante solo pondría en riesgo a esa persona y a su familia”.
Trump Jr. se ha desmarcado de los comentarios que le acusan de revelar una información que puede poner en peligro la vida del denunciante. El hijo del presidente se lava las manos asegurando que el nombre era público desde hace semanas.
The entire media is #Triggered that I (a private citizen) tweeted out a story naming the alleged whistleblower. Are they going to pretend that his name hasn’t been in the public domain for weeks now? Numerous people & news outlets including Real Clear Politics already ID’d him. https://t.co/bcamyTaXP3

Texto completo: I do understand that diet is a very personal choice. People quite rightly get frustrated when they feel that others are trying to tell them what to eat, or guilt-trip them into a change.
These are interesting times for a person who eats a whole-food, plant-based diet. When I moved back to Iowa in the early 1990's, vegetarianism was still regarded with some suspicion. Now, with Impossible Burgers gracing the menu at Burger King, physicians recommending we eat less meat, Greta Thunberg and other inspiring figures reminding us that the most effective personal step we can take to protect the environment is to go vegan, a cultural shift seems to be taking place. Meat producers are getting a bit nervous.
It's still hard for me to understand how the violence and cruelty that characterizes the meat industry can be rationalized. Likely it's a matter of out-of-sight, out-of-mind.
I do understand that diet is a very personal choice. People quite rightly get frustrated when they feel that others are trying to tell them what to eat, or guilt-trip them into a change.
As with other public health and safety issues, though, it helps to examine the social costs involved. There are health costs that we as a society bear, when diet and obesity-related diseases flood our hospitals. Environmental costs we suffer when confinement lots spill their manure, their odor, into the surroundings, or forests are bulldozed for grazing land and leave us with less oxygen.
I'd argue that the suffering of an innocent creature killed for meat also registers a social cost. Any suffering inflicted on animals is a social negative. Like throwing a sack of unwanted kittens into a pond, such actions necessarily leave a mark on our psyches, on our souls. We all get that when it comes to family pets. It hasn't quite registered when it comes to other sensitive creatures like pigs and cows.
I believe, though, that we're riding an unstoppable trend. This cat is not going back in the bag.
Want to learn more about vegan and vegetarian diets? Or celebrate their diversity and deliciousness? Here's your chance.
The second annual Vegfest of Eastern Iowa will happen Saturday, Nov. 9, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the Kirkwood Regional Center, 2301 Oakdale Blvd in Coralville. Admission is $5 for adults, and free for kids under 18; tickets are available online at vegfesteasterniowa.com. Last year over 700 people attended and that number is expected to grow.
Attendees will be able to purchase delicious vegan food and beverages from Trumpet Blossom Café, Brightside Kitchen, Get Fresh, The Full Bowl, Dodge Street Coffeehouse, Clementine, Oryza Asian Cuisine, Wild Culture Kombucha, and Comfort Food Farms (local makers of vegan cheese). Other vendors will offer cruelty-free home goods and body products, jewelry, apparel, the essentials needed for a zero-waste home, vegan chocolate treats, and more. Nonprofit groups will be present to share more about how attendees can get involved in the local vegan community.
Some great speakers and research-based educational presentations will appear throughout the day. Topics include the environment, animal welfare and animal rights, nutrition and health, and fitness. Cooking demonstrations by local chefs are also on the slate.
Jenny Brown, this year's keynote speaker, is an author and farm animal sanctuary founder who previously worked in film and television. An experience in Texas documenting stockyard conditions led her to change course and dedicate her life to farmed animal advocacy. Jenny's story has been featured in the New York Times, New York Magazine, CNN, and more. She is the author of "The Lucky Ones: My Passionate Fight for Farm Animals".
Advance ticket purchase is recommended, though tickets will still be available at the door. The first 150 guests through the door receive a free swag bag full of vegan products and coupons.
This event is presented by the Vegan Community of Eastern Iowa, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, whose mission is to promote the joy, compassion, and life-enhancing possibilities of a vegan lifestyle.
Writers' Group member Andy Douglas is the author of "The Curve of the World: Into the Spiritual Heart of Yoga."

Warren's plan buoys Trump

Texto completo: With the fact of serious ethical breaches by President Trump all but demonstrated, most elected Republicans do not seem to be struggling with their consciences over impeachment. They wrestle, instead, with a more practical challenge: continuing to support a corrupt man without appearing too corrupt themselves.
This is not the kind of political objective that encourages idealism and attracts young people to public service. Instead, the torch has been passed to a new generation of shills and rationalizers, frightened of their own mercurial leader, intimidated by an angry base and dedicated to maintaining the blessing of presidential fundraising for their campaigns.
The main occupation of the GOP at this point in history is the defense of public corruption, which is a particularly insidious form of corruption. Those who excuse Trump's abuses of power will not escape his taint.
And yet - at this low point of presidential character and congressional GOP courage - perhaps the most politically talented Democratic challenger to Trump in 2020, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is 6 points behind the president in Michigan, even with Trump in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and 4points behind Trump in Florida (according to recent surveys by the New York Times Upshot and Siena College).
This should horrify Democrats. One of the most exciting, substantive, compelling voices in their presidential field would stand a good chance of re-electing Donald Trump. And this is not a problem that can be solved through good speeches and clever advertising. The weak points that Trump would exploit are the centerpieces of Warren's campaign - the very reasons that Democrats are falling for her.
The health care issue symbolizes the problem. In producing her recent funding plan for "Medicare for All," Warren doubled down on ending private health insurance in America. This ideological boldness is precisely what many Democrats like about her. But now Warren has very little flexibility to make her plan seem less disruptive and frightening in a general election against Trump. "You can't unring that bell," says William Galston of the Brookings Institution.
This presents three difficulties. First, Warren is proposing to hugely expand the role and reach of government in our lives, and to spend an additional $20.5 trillion (or more) over 10 years, at a time when trust in government is near an all-time low. Her plan to socialize - there is no other word for it - the health insurance industry fights against a swift current of public skepticism.
Second, Obamacare - which Warren proposes to replace - has stabilized over time. Though it never achieved what its champions promised, it has reduced the number of uninsured Americans and provided some useful lessons for the next rounds of reform. This argues in favor of incremental changes - of the kind former Vice President Joe Biden proposes - rather than the dramatic transformation of a system that would displace insurance arrangements for tens of millions.
Third, Warren's contention that Medicare for All can be created without middle-class tax increases remains questionable, in spite of her recently released, 26-page funding proposal. In Galston's view, the Warren approach relies on optimistic cost and revenue estimates that the Urban Institute and others have sharply disputed. It doesn't account for the likely responses of corporations and wealthy individuals to massive tax increases. It assumes huge cuts in defense spending and the passage of comprehensive immigration reform. And it assumes that rural hospitals can meet their costs based on 110% (or less) of current Medicare payments.
When Biden was asked about Warren's funding approach, he replied: "She's making it up." There is serious evidence to support that charge - and it will be Warren's burden to answer it during the Nov. 20 debate.
The main question that Warren faces as a candidate is this: Can she eventually transform her public image from being a progressive populist to being a mere populist? Her health care proposal indicates she cannot. Trump's charge of Socialism - more accurately, SOCIALISM! - may seem hyperbolic. But it is more likely to stick when a candidate proposes to abolish all private health insurance, put a government bureaucracy in charge, and spend an additional $2trillion a year on her ambitions.
It is always tempting to view the weakness of a political opponent as an opportunity to gain total ideological victory. But in the case of Trump, this would be a blunder. If the 2018 midterms are any indication, the president has shed supporters at the more moderate edges of his coalition. And they will be attracted by stability and incrementalism, not disruption and radicalism - no matter how principled and well explained.

Texto completo: "Every generation blames the one before." - Mike + The Mechanics
So I guess "OK boomer" is a thing now. And I gather I'm supposed to be offended by it. Certainly, some people seem to be.
The saying - a dismissive eye roll from Generation Z to their elders - is suddenly all the rage. It appears on hoodies and in headlines, tweets and memes, this catch-all response to old folks' nonstop nagging and criticism. Some members of the baby-boom generation are not amused. Maureen Dowd of The New York Times sees it as "intergenerational war." Steve Cuozzo of The New York Post says the young ones "really, really hate us." Bob Lonsberry, a conservative radio host, declared "boomer" - no joke - "the N-word of ageism."
Granted, these are media types - not real people - so we should be careful about generalizing. I, for one, can't say I really feel "hate" from young folks. But to whatever degree I should be taking this seriously - "You darn kids, get off my internet!" - I find that I can't. I keep laughing instead.
It strikes me as funny that some in my generation, which defined itself by an insolent rejection of the old, are traumatized by a younger generation's insolent rejection of us. Am I the only one who remembers when the hippies warned, "Don't trust anyone over 30"? Does no one else recall when Pete Townshend sneered, "Hope I die before I get old"?
Then how dare any of us clutch our pearls over a little intergenerational sniping? Besides, it's not as if the kids don't have a point. Our record is certainly mixed.
I'd say our music was better than theirs, but they have better television - and more of it - than we could've dreamed. Boomers made great strides in civil rights for black people, women and LGBTQ Americans. But we dropped the ball on climate change, failed to address a rigged financial system. And we - the white cohort of us, at least - bear blame for the catastrophe of Donald Trump. We deserve both credit and castigation. Every generation does - even the "Greatest."
When I was a kid, I used to tease this old man in the neighborhood for being an old man in the neighborhood. "Keep a'livin'," he'd always retort. And I did. And here I am, just turned 62 and wondering how the heck that happened. The Gen Z kids will too soon enough wonder the selfsame thing. The big wheel keeps on turning.
Usually that confers perspective and context, the soil from which wisdom grows. But you couldn't prove that by these overwrought responses to young people's taunts.
I'm remembering teenage battles with my mom as I write this. As it happens, I've got Nat King Cole playing in the background. He was Mom's end-all and be-all. She didn't want to hear any noise from my room about P-Funk getting funked up, Papa being a rolling stone or midnight trains to Georgia. As far as she was concerned, music stopped when King Cole died. I got sick of hearing his name, scorned him on general principle.
But I remember one day Mom deigned to listen to the Stylistics with me. Afterward, she sniffed that "Betcha By Golly Wow" was actually a pretty song to have such a silly title. It was a backhanded compliment, but I felt vindicated by it just the same. I doubt that she needed my vindication - adults didn't need that from kids back then. Still, somewhere in the intervening decades, I decided Cole wasn't so bad either. I just had to learn how to hear him - and I did.
So the kids may "OK" this boomer to their hearts' content. Because as they will eventually discover, that old man in my neighborhood was right.
Keep a'livin' indeed.

Texto completo: Headnote Digital advertising project aims to counter Trump's early spending advantage in battleground states
A progressive organization is plunging itself into the presidential campaign, unveiling plans to spend $75 million on digital advertising to counter President Donald Trump's early spending advantage in key 2020 battleground states.
The effort, by a nonprofit group called Acronym and an affiliated political action committee, is an outgrowth of growing concern by some Democratic officials that Trump could build an insurmountable edge in those key states through massive early advertising efforts. Trump has spent more than $26 million so far nationally just on Facebook and Google, more than the four top-polling Democrats - Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg - have spent in total on those platforms.
"The gun on this general election does not start when we have a nominee; it started months ago," said David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and was a key adviser to him in 2012, and who recently joined Acronym's board. "If the things that need to happen don't happen in these battleground states between now and May or June, our nominee will never have time to catch up."
Plouffe and Tara McGowan, the founder and chief executive of Acronym, said their digital campaign would kick off immediately with a heavy focus on shaping how the public views Trump and the Democratic Party during the primary season, well before a nominee emerges.
"Our nominee is going to be broke, tired, have to pull together the party and turn around on a dime and run a completely different race for a completely different audience," Plouffe said.
"There is an enormous amount of danger between now and then," he added. "If the hole is too steep to dig out of, they're not going to win."
The campaign, which the organization is calling "Four is Enough," will focus initially on key swing states: Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. One state that is historically a battleground was notably missing from the initial list: Florida.
The effort will feature advertisements across multiple digital platforms, including Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Hulu and Pandora. There will be original content, such as videos and animations, as well as boosting local news coverage that portrays Trump, his administration and his agenda in a harsh light.
McGowan said that for months her group had been raising the alarm about Trump's early online spending advantage.
"It started to feel as though we were really screaming into the abyss," she said. So they decided to take matters into their own hands.
McGowan said the group had already raised approximately 40% of the planned $75 million budget. Plouffe has joined as both a political adviser and to help raise funds. The spending will be made across two groups, Acronym, which is a nonprofit that does not disclose its donors, and Pacronym, a political action committee, which does. (The group's winking moniker is a poke at the frequent practice of settling on a meaningful series of words to form an acronym for a nonprofit; they have skipped that alphabet-soup step entirely.)
"We're absolutely, as a party, not doing enough and I don't know that $75 million is enough," McGowan said. "We can't afford to not do this work right now." Of the fact that some of her group's donors would remain undisclosed, she said, "We have to play on the field that exists," noting that Trump is aided by such funds, as well.
Trump is not just spending heavily on advertising - he has dozens of Facebook ads currently running that cite the "baseless attacks" from Democrats on impeachment - he is also benefiting from a conservative media echo chamber that amplifies his message and a meme factory of MAGA ("Make America Great Again") supporters cranking out content in hopes of a presidential retweet.
Much of Trump's advertising budget has gone toward recruiting new donors. His campaign manager, Brad Parscale, announced Friday that the Trump campaign had raised $19 million online in October.
Plouffe said he knew the advantages of incumbency intimately from the 2012 Obama reelection campaign and wanted to blunt the current White House's advantage.
"Trump will be ready for them, as we were ready for Romney, as Bush was ready for Kerry, as Reagan was ready for Mondale," Plouffe said, ticking off recent presidents who won reelection.
He lamented having to watch Trump buy ads that tried to frame the Democratic Party as out of the mainstream. "He's trying to define our entire field as unacceptable to swing voters: "They're socialists, there are going to be 90% taxes, you can't fly on an airplane, you can't eat steak,'" Plouffe said. "We have to understand there is live fire out there." He called the Trump campaign's commercial that aired during the World Series "compelling."
The Democratic National Committee has spent little on advertising against Trump in 2019. Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC, has been ramping up its digital activities, spending nearly $3 million on Facebook in the past three months, particularly in battlegrounds.
In a 30-day window that ended in late October, Priorities USA, for instance, spent nearly $1 million in Pennsylvania - far more than Trump's campaign spent there, according to Facebook advertising data.
McGowan, who worked for Priorities during the 2016 cycle, said her current efforts did not represent any criticism or tension with that group. "There is a lot everyone can do," she said.
"Trump has upped the ante by spending more than any candidate this early in a general election campaign," she said, "and right now our side is simply not on the field."

Mexico's president AMLO must confront the cartels, or else the US has to do it for him

Texto completo: Responding to President Trump's offer of assistance following the massacre on Monday of six children and three women who were all American, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he will respond "independently and asserting our sovereignty."
If he really wants to go there, then the United States should independently assert its right to defend its citizens.
There is no question that the American people bear some responsibility for Mexico's terrible drug wars — we are the ones lining cartel pockets by buying the drugs. But this latest attack offers stark proof that U.S. national security faces an intolerable threat. If López Obrador wants to maintain his idiotic and immoral "hugs not bullets" strategy toward the cartels, that is his prerogative as Mexico's democratic leader. But America must defend its citizens.
The images and witness accounts from the attack scene are terrible. The victims' SUVs are burnt out and littered with hundreds of bullet holes. One family member told the New York Times that babies in one of the cars were burned alive as they sat stuck in their seats.
This must not be allowed to stand.
As a first step, President Trump should make clear to López Obrador, known universally in Mexico as AMLO, that he must identify the cartel responsible. Based on the location of the attack, along the state borders, the primary suspects are the Juárez Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel. Regardless, Trump should push López Obrador to have the federal police work alongside joint investigative teams from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the CIA, and the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group. He should demand that U.S. agencies receive access to all necessary intelligence and support.
And once the culpable cartel is identified, López Obrador should move to gut it. If he fails to do so, which is likely, Trump should issue a covert action finding authorizing the U.S. government to take decisive action. This action would include rendition operations, lethal strikes, and the seizure of cartel assets. The tactical objective should be to significantly weaken the cartel's operations and to eliminate its leadership. The strategic objective should be to send a deterrent message to the other cartels that murdering American citizens is bad for business.
These specific actions must also sit within a broader strategy. Recently praising himself for allowing the cartels' free reign, López Obrador said he was focused on "how to save lives and achieve peace and tranquility in the country using other methods." His shallow wit is now marked not simply with the blood of thousands of Mexicans, but also with the blood of innocent Americans.
The cartels can only be constrained by force. Yes, that constraint requires a much deeper introspection among young Americans as to the costs of their snorting habits. As a country, we should consider drug law reforms that might reduce the street price of illegal drugs and thus reduce cartel profit margins. Nevertheless, American coercive action is necessary.
The example of Colombia proves that it can be done, so let's get on with it.

Patriots-Ravens had something that's been missing all season: competition

Texto completo: Picked-up pieces in the shrinking daylight . . .
■  Sunday's 37-20 loss to the Ravens was easily the most entertaining Patriots game of the season thus far. Sorry, but I find a game like this more enjoyable than yet another nauseating 60-minute network homage to the greatness of Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, Bob Kraft, and New England's Boogeyman defense.
Patriots-Ravens was still a 4-point game through three quarters. The Patriots had plenty of chances to come back and win it. Silly me, I find this more exciting than watching a 43-0 blowout at Miami, or seeing the Browns turn the ball over on three consecutive touches in the first half of a beatdown at Gillette. I like it when there's some big-boy pushback from the other team, when the coach on the other sideline is not genuflecting at the Altar of Bill.
It's called competition, and it's what got most of us into sports in the first place. The contest : that crazy notion of anticipating a game and not being certain which team is going to win.
In the Patriots' unparalleled two-decade run of success, the spirit of competition has been replaced around here by one of entitlement. Because there are so many bad teams, stupid coaches, and poorly run franchises, we go into each year assuming the Patriots will win the AFC East and gain home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
Invariably, they wind up with a first-round playoff layup, then beat one good team at Gillette to qualify for the Super Bowl. That's where it looked like we were headed before the Ravens game. Now, it's Game On in the AFC. Something to watch. Something to root for.
Last year's Super Bowl run was more fun because it was more challenging. The Patriots struggled early in the season and had to beat a good team on the road (Kansas City) to get to the Super Bowl. It was like the first years of this dynasty when the Patriots twice won AFC Championship games in Pittsburgh. Those were hard-earned, contested, and more fun.
Bring on the Eagles, Cowboys, Texans, and Chiefs — four teams with winning records (what a concept!). It'll be so much more fun than crushing the Tomato Cans of the first eight weeks.
■  The weekend of July 25-26 next summer could be a biggie for Boston baseball fans. The Red Sox will be in New York City to play the Yankees. Meanwhile, the Hall of Fame will hold its induction ceremony, and there could be a few inductees/honorees with ties to Boston and the Red Sox.
Derek Jeter is a lock to be enshrined on his first time on the ballot, but Curt Schilling has his best chance yet to get the 75 percent of votes required. Here's the New York Post's inimitable Joel Sherman on Schill's chances: “Most likely to join Jeter on the Baseball Writers' Association of America's ballot is his old nemesis and general embarrassment to the species Curt Schilling."
The BBWAA voting results will be announced in January. On Dec. 8, we will find out whether Dwight Evans passes the audition with the “Modern Era" panel at the Winter Meetings in San Diego. Dewey is one of 10 candidates on the Modern Era ballot. Others include Marvin Miller and Tommy John.
Meanwhile, three of the eight candidates for the coveted Ford C. Frick broadcaster's award have Boston roots: Joe Castiglione, Ken Harrelson, and Ned Martin (“Mercy!"). The late Nick Cafardo is one of three finalists for the J.G. Taylor Spink Award presented for contributions to baseball writing. The Frick and Spink winners will be announced at the December meetings.
■  Baseball is not as bad off as you might think. It simply has morphed into a regional sport more than a national pastime. Ratings for MLB's big events (World Series, All-Star Game) shrink almost every year, but many of the local markets remain strong and lucrative.
The New York Times reports that, according to Nielsen ratings, 12 of the 29 US-based major league teams were the most popular prime-time broadcast in their market. On cable, 24 big league teams ranked first in their market in prime time.
■  Has any team other than the 2019 Red Sox had three hitters bat .300 with 30 homers and 100 RBIs (J.D. Martinez, Rafael Devers, Xander Bogaerts) and not made the playoffs?
■  QUIZ: Cuban-born Yuli Gurriel homered in the Astros' Game 7 loss to the Nationals. Name the last Cuban-born player to homer in a World Series Game 7. (Answer below.)
■  Favorite story about Red Sox baseball boss Chaim Bloom: When Don Zimmer served as a senior adviser with the Tampa Bay Rays, Bloom would watch games in the clubhouse with Zim, the late, great baseball lifer who died in 2014.
■  Scott Boras had nine players in this year's World Series, including Jose Altuve and Juan Soto. He also has free agents Gerrit Cole, Stephen Strasburg, and Anthony Rendon.
■  New York's Nassau County has a three-year-old policy designed to prevent blowouts in high school football games, and last week a coach in Plainedge was suspended after he did not pull starters in a 61-13 victory over South Side. According to officials, if a team wins by more than 42 points, the winning coach has to explain why he or she could not avoid the carnage (I'd call it the Auriemma Rule).
In Belichickian fashion, the Plainedge coach told a committee that he did not pull his starters because he was concerned South might mount a comeback from a 35-point deficit at the start of the fourth quarter.
■  Weak sauce: Belichick getting asked (postgame Sunday) if he could be more specific regarding how he needed to coach better and answering, “It's obvious. Did you see the game tonight?"
■  Harold Reynolds played high school basketball against Danny Ainge when both were teenagers in Oregon.
■  Try naming the worst NFL coach. It's like trying to identify the worst member of the presidential cabinet. Cleveland's Freddie Kitchens and Chicago's Matt Nagy are my front-runners.
■  Has Ed Davis cracked the case in the Dominican Republic yet?
■  I don't know about you, but I find it troubling that the new Red Sox assistant hitting coach never played above A ball. Another win for the geeks.
■  The Jackie Bradley Jr. Love Society must be in mourning after JBJ was snubbed again in Gold Glove voting. I mean, if you're going to be considered untradeable despite hitting .225 with 155 strikeouts, can you at least win the Gold Glove?
■  Sunday's joust between the winless Dolphins and the 1-6 Jets reminded me of the 1981 season-finale “Stupor Bowl" pitting the 2-13 Patriots vs. the 1-14 Colts at Baltimore. Ron Erhardt's Patriots lost, 23-21, in front of 17,073 at Memorial Stadium. The Stupor Bowl loss earned the Patriots the No. 1 pick, and they wasted it on Ken “Gameday" Sims," a Texas lineman who only wanted to play hard on Sundays.
■  Veteran Globe scribe Marvin Pave delivered a spectacular obituary for longtime Bruins defenseman Ted Green in Sunday's Globe. Green's former teammate Ed Westfall recounted the moments in an Ottawa hospital in 1969 when it was feared Green might die after engaging in a stick fight with Wayne Maki. Green did not play that season, but when the Bruins won the Stanley Cup, teammates made sure his name was engraved on the chalice.
■  Steve Belichick almost got more TV airtime than Brady Sunday night.
■  UMass's football team is 1-8, allowing 52 points per game. The Minutemen were beaten at home by Liberty, 63-21, Saturday. What can taxpayers do to make this stop?
■  There's still time to get tickets for The Tradition at the Garden Nov. 20. Matt Light, Paul Silas, Ben Crenshaw, Zdeno Chara, Michelle Kwan, and Manny Ramirez are the honorees. For tickets and information, visit sportsmuseum.org.
■  Quiz answer: Tony Perez famously homered off Bill Lee's eephus pitch in Game 7 of the 1975 World Series.

Primaries are a lot like Christmas: The shopping season begins way before, and things rarely live up to expectations. (I mean this in the secular sense. I'm not talking about celebrating the birth of Jesus; I'm talking about pretending to be psyched about new socks or, say, Joe Biden.)
I still like Christmas, but I'm happy to play the Grinch with the primaries. We should get rid of them. If I could, I'd sneak into the Whovilles of Iowa and New Hampshire and steel the voting machines, ballots and bad coffee.
In the past, my Grinchiness was mostly reserved for the "first in the nation" Iowa and New Hampshire votes. Why should these two states have so much power? Two generations of political consultants have made their careers by knowing how to fill hotel rooms in Des Moines and whose palms to grease in Nashua. Scour the Federalist Papers and the Constitution and you'll find no mention of primaries, never mind the Hawkeye and Granite State hegemony. And yet, if you win in either or both, you're statistically likely to become your party's nominee.
The Iowa caucuses are a particular affront. If it weren't for them, there'd be no ethanol subsidies, which are bad for your car, the economy and the environment. If such things bother you, Iowa and New Hampshire are also very white places, and I don't mean in the white Christmas sense.
But the proposed remedies - rotating the primary states every four years, nuking Iowa from orbit, etc. - don't really fix the underlying problem. We shouldn't have primaries at all - and that goes for Senate and House primaries, too.
Primaries date back to the early 20th century, but they never mattered much until 1972, when the Democrats (with Republicans soon to follow) did something revolutionary: They voluntarily relinquished the ability to choose their own candidates. No other advanced democratic nation has done this (though the British have been heading in that direction, which is one reason their politics are becoming as dysfunctional as ours).
The argument for democratizing the selection of candidates was justified with the preposterous notion that there's nothing wrong with democracy that more democracy can't fix. (It's this potted thinking that leads people to argue for lowering the voting age to get more electoral input from teenagers.)
Those infamous "smoke-filled rooms" - among my favorite kinds of rooms, by the way - were supposedly bad because they allowed party bosses to impose their choices on voters. There's no doubt mistakes were made by those party fat cats and fixers, but those smoke-filled rooms also gave us Lincoln, Coolidge, the Roosevelts, Eisenhower, Truman, Kennedy, et al. I don't love all of those guys, but it's not obvious to me primaries would have given us better. And you can hardly argue that they weren't democratically elected. (We can talk about JFK's election shenanigans another time.)
One of the paradoxes of democracy is that it depends on healthy institutions that are fundamentally undemocratic. Families don't put everything to a vote, nor do churches, the Boy Scouts or the Marines. Back before the parties were castrated by the primaries, they had the power to impose standards on candidates and to protect their long-term interests and principles.
James Madison was a better philosopher than Alexander Hamilton. He understood that parties were a necessary tool of democracy because they forced different factions and interests to compromise in order to win. Kindred groups were willing to sacrifice a few items from their wish lists if it meant their party would be able to deliver on most of its agenda.
Primaries blow all of that up. Candidates on the left and right promise purity in all things, and elected politicians are often more scared of a primary challenge than a general election contest. Pandering to the most passionately ideological voters is the direct result of democratizing party decisions.
This leaves the parties behaving like advertising agencies for whichever candidate happened to exploit outrage the best - or lied most convincingly about the things they can deliver. The Democrats right now are like department store Santas promising the kids jetpacks and lightsabers. Once elected, they'll be lucky to deliver socks. And the resulting outrage will restart the whole stupid cycle all over again.

Texto completo: Emissions of a banned ozone-destroying gas that had risen unexpectedly since 2012 appear to have declined in the last two years, according to preliminary data reported by scientists on Monday.
The findings suggest that China, which was thought to be the source of most of the rogue emissions of the chemical, CFC-11, has made strides in clamping down on illegal production of the gas. CFC-11 is used to make insulating foams.
"The good news is, the report this morning shows emissions now going down significantly," said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C.
The data was presented by Stephen A. Montzka, a research chemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, at a meeting in Rome of signatories to the Montreal Protocol, the landmark environmental accord of the 1980s that banned CFC-11 and similar chemicals collectively known as chlorofluorocarbons.
Dr. Montzka and colleagues reported in 2018 that worldwide CFC-11 emissions were rising, following years of steady decline as new production was outlawed and most emissions came from existing foams as they aged. If the emissions increase continued, they said, that would slow progress in restoring the ozone layer, which protects living organisms, including humans, from harmful solar radiation.
The 2018 study suggested the source of most of the rogue emissions was East Asia. Additional research this year pinpointed the source more closely, suggesting that at least 40 to 60 percent of the increased emissions were coming from eastern China. Several investigations, including one by The New York Times, found evidence that factories in that part of China were making the gas or using it to make insulating foams.

The Montreal Protocol, which is generally considered the most successful environmental pact in history, was drawn up in response to research showing how chlorofluorocarbons, once widely used as refrigerants and propellants, were harming the ozone layer. (Because they are greenhouse gases, they also contribute to global warming.)
Through requirements for monitoring and phasing out production of the chemicals, the pact has led to an increase in stratospheric ozone, with a full recovery of the ozone layer expected by the middle of the century.
Mr. Zaelke said the new findings showed that "the treaty regime is continuing to do its job and we're seeing a response."
China initially denied that its factories were violating the ban on CFC-11, but the government also promised to eliminate any illegal production it found. On Wednesday, it submitted a short report to the meeting about its efforts.
Among other things, the government said it had stepped up monitoring and enforcement efforts, supplying inspectors with equipment to instantly detect the presence of CFC-11 and building six regional testing laboratories.
The report also detailed the destruction of several CFC-11 factories, including one in Liaoning Province that was situated behind a seafood-processing facility. But all three factories described in the report were small, incapable of producing anywhere near the quantities of CFC-11 that have been emitted since 2012.
Mr. Zaelke said that the Chinese report suggests there is more work to be done to fully understand how the rogue emissions happened and to make sure similar episodes do not occur.
"China is clearly taking the issue very seriously and responding well," he said. "But that's not where the story ends."

Texto completo: Corrupt forces find it easy to manipulate this president.
Kenneth McCallion is a New York lawyer who once represented former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko of Ukraine. A few years ago, he brought a civil racketeering lawsuit on her behalf against some now familiar figures like Paul Manafort and the Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash. He knows a lot about corruption in Ukraine, and he said that earlier this year F.B.I. counterintelligence investigators approached him for information about Rudy Giuliani's Ukrainian activities.
By then, McCallion had already been hearing strange things about what Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, whom we now know as Giuliani's close associates, were doing in Ukraine.
Parnas and Fruman, both American citizens born in the former Soviet Union, aren't ordinary political operatives. Parnas has long been a low-level grifter. Fruman owns an Odessa beach club called Mafia Rave, and a joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and BuzzFeed News found ties between him and an Odessa organized crime figure named Volodymyr Galanternik, known as "Light Bulb."
The duo first appeared on the American political scene in 2015 as enthusiastic supporters of Donald Trump. They became big-dollar donors to a number of Republicans; their Instagram accounts would soon fill up with photos of party elites. Then, this year, McCallion learned they were poking around Ukrainian politics, where they were spreading conspiracy theories that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in America's election in 2016.
"All of a sudden they started going around Ukraine telling anybody who would listen, particularly with the government, that they have been advised by a high-level, mysterious unnamed source, that in fact the D.N.C. servers had been hidden in Ukraine, that Russia was not the origin," he told me. This claim, which echoed Russian propaganda, contradicts the findings of the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee. Nevertheless, it soon came to shape American foreign policy.
The heart of the Ukraine scandal, for which Trump will almost certainly be impeached, is simple. Trump used congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine, as well as the promise of a White House visit, to try to extort Ukraine's president to announce investigations that would benefit Trump politically.
But there's a broader story that's still murky, because in this scandal Trump is both the perpetrator and the mark. Trump used the power of his office to try to force Ukraine to substantiate conspiracy theories. But the president was fed those conspiracy theories by people with their own agendas, who surely understood that he is insecure about Russia's role in his election, and he will believe whatever serves his ego in the moment. The main reason Trump should be removed from office is that he has subverted American foreign policy for corrupt personal ends. But this scandal is the latest reminder of how easy sinister forces find it to pull his strings.
On Saturday, BuzzFeed News obtained previously secret documents from Robert Mueller's investigation via Freedom of Information Act lawsuits. The documents showed that Manafort, convicted felon and Trump's former campaign chairman, was pushing the story that Ukraine was to blame for hacking the D.N.C. as far back as 2016. Manafort seems to have picked up that narrative from his associate Konstantin Kilimnik, a former Russian intelligence officer who, according to federal prosecutors, "has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016."
At first glance it might seem as if Parnas and Fruman were just doing Giuliani's bidding when, in 2019, they started pushing the same disinformation. But Giuliani wasn't paying them -- they were paying Giuliani. Parnas, in turn, was being paid by Firtash, who is, according to the Justice Department, an "upper echelon" associate of Russian organized crime. Firtash is also close to the Kremlin; a Ukrainian official once described him as "representing Russia's interests in Ukraine."
Firtash, who made his fortune as a middleman in Ukraine's natural gas industry, is stuck in Vienna, fighting extradition to the United States for trial on bribery and racketeering charges. Last month, when Parnas and Fruman were arrested while attempting to leave the United States on one-way tickets, Vienna was their destination.
On Friday, CNN reported that Parnas boasted of the "luxurious lifestyle" Firtash bankrolled. "Beginning in mid-August, this included around-the-clock bodyguards, two luxury S.U.V.s for his entourage, and at least six private charter flights in the past several months," CNN said. It's hard to imagine what Firtash would have been paying for besides access to Trump.
It was reportedly Firtash's lawyers who first obtained an affidavit from the fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin claiming, falsely, that Joe Biden had targeted Shokin for investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board. Giuliani would later wave this affidavit around on cable television as proof of his claims against Joe Biden.
Firtash's motives aren't hard to grasp. As he fights extradition, he has obvious reasons to want to ingratiate himself with Trump. It was in his interest to see the former Ukrainian ambassador Marie Yovanovitch fired, because her work against corruption -- particularly her support for the reform-minded chief executive of Naftogaz, Ukraine's national gas company -- threatened his business interests. And by helping to spread damaging conspiracy theories about Ukraine, he aided his allies in the Kremlin. "It serves the interest of Russian intelligence to cause further consternation and confusion by pointing the finger at Ukraine rather than Russia for the 2016 successful disinformation campaign," said McCallion.
In court last month, a lawyer for Parnas said that some evidence against him could be subject to executive privilege, apparently because his work with Giuliani overlapped with Giuliani's work for Trump. If that's true, then Firtash is directly linked to America's president. The two men may have used each other, but there's no reason to believe that Trump was the one in control. There was a time when Republicans would be mortified by an American president being manipulated by a figure like Firtash. Lucky for them, they've lost the ability to feel shame.

Keep the state’s hands off free speech

Texto completo: On the relationship between freedom, societal norms and law, no one has yet improved upon Judge Learned Hand's dictum: "Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it."
Nevertheless, people keep suggesting that government should use its coercive powers to control free expression in the name of social peace.
The latest is Richard Stengel, Nelson Mandela's biographer, a distinguished former managing editor of Time magazine, former chief executive of the National Constitution Center and former undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.
When someone this experienced in politics and journalism joins the cause of laws against hate speech, it's wise to pay heed, especially since his argument, presented in a Post op-ed last week, does make a serious point.
Defenders of America's free-speech doctrine - which allows almost anything that doesn't libel a narrow range of private individuals, directly incite violence or depict the sexual abuse of children - often rely on an analogy between public discourse and competitive markets. When competing freely, truthful, beneficial thoughts will prevail over false, pernicious ones.
Though deeply rooted in Anglo- American political and legal theory, this "marketplace of ideas" metaphor has never quite corresponded to reality, as Stengel notes. Now social media - where hate and lies spread unchecked, inspiring terrorists of all stripes - has definitively disproved it.
The United States should try legal "guardrails," like those in Germany or France, to bar "hateful speech that can cause violence by one group against another," according to Stengel.
It would be easy - too easy - to reply that European hate-speech laws have hardly eliminated intolerance or intergroup violence. To shoot another fish in the barrel: The federal government ban on proprietary trading by banks is about 1,000 pages long, including all the definitions and exceptions. It would be even more difficult to write a legally consistent ban on speech that "deliberately insults people based on religion, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation" - and only on that speech.
No doubt citizens struggle to distinguish lies from truth, as indicated by the studies of Internet-using teenagers that Stengel cites. But that is an argument against democracy generally. (Also against lowering the voting age to 16.)
Rather, the best response to Stengel is to concede there is market failure in the marketplace of ideas - and to explain why it doesn't, or shouldn't, justify calling for laws against hate speech.
The question is not whether regulation is needed, in finance or speech. The question is who should do the regulating.
Fundamental individual freedoms - what the nation's founders considered natural rights - are not as strongly implicated in, say, securities trading, as they are in writing, speaking, painting, singing, tweeting, marching, flag-waving and, yes, Koran- (or Bible- or flag-) burning.
In this sense, the market metaphor, which bases free speech on its consequences, rather than on humankind's intrinsic right to engage in it, needs reformulation:
There should be a strong presumption against using government to fix the idea market's inevitable failures, as long as there are private-sector alternatives - including not only competing speech, as the marketplace of ideas metaphor implies, but also peer pressure and other informal restraints on expression that people find unacceptable.
For all its excesses, even political correctness beats governmental enforcement of acceptable discourse.
Whether we are better off when everyone reads the "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," or shuns that Mark Twain classic because it frequently employs the n-word is not the point. The point is that the only thing worse than "cancel culture" would be "cancel culture" enforced by your state, i.e., the local district attorney, police and jailer.
"It is important to remember that our First Amendment doesn't just protect the good guys; our foremost liberty also protects any bad actors who hide behind it to weaken our society," Stengel writes - as if the same did not apply to the whole Bill of Rights. The Fourth Amendment protects terrorist hideouts from warrantless searches; the Fifth lets rapists refuse to confess.
This is nothing new. "Bad actors" - domestic and foreign - have been exploiting freedom to undermine it since time immemorial. Generally that has been thought of as a reason to redouble commitments to civil liberty, thus denying "bad actors" a victory.
"The Russians understood that our free press and its reflex toward balance and fairness would enable Moscow to slip its destructive ideas into our media ecosystem," Stengel notes. "When Putin said back in 2014 that there were no Russian troops in Crimea - an outright lie - he knew our media would report it, and we did."
Substitute "Stalin" for "Putin," plus a few other changes, and you have a paragraph about the Russian lies that caused the New York Times to deny the Ukraine famine during the 1930s.
We live in an era of globalized social media and globalized politics, much of it frightening and extreme. Judge Learned Hand's spirit of liberty can guide us through it, while preserving democracy, social harmony and the natural right to speak freely.

It's beginning to look as if Democrats don't want him to go away at all. The betting odds, along with many of my fellow pundits, assess Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to be the likely nominee. So why, then, does Biden continue to hold a substantial lead in the national polls? And why, at the moment, is that lead growing?
The clear and simple answer has little to do with the Democratic Party's progressive-vs.-moderate divide, which is more a theoretical chasm than a practical one. Biden's staying power has everything to do with President Trump - and the imperative that the incumbent be defeated next November.
It now appears overwhelmingly likely that Trump will be impeached by the House and face trial in the Senate. The chance that 20 Republican senators will join with Democrats in voting to remove him from office is not zero - especially if public airing of the evidence against the president weakens his support among the GOP base - but remains, at this point, somewhere between small and minuscule.
We have no way of knowing how an incumbent president marked with the stigma of impeachment would fare in a bid for reelection, because such a thing has never happened before. But we're likely to find out.
Hypothetical matchup polls taken over the past month show any of the leading Democratic contenders beating Trump in the general election. But almost all of them have Biden beating him by the biggest margin. A Fox News poll released Sunday, for example, showed Biden leading Trump by 12 points, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) led him by eight points and Warren led him by five.
It follows that the question is how risk-averse Democratic voters will prove to be. As long as Biden looks like the surest bet to beat Trump, he's going to be hard for any of his rivals to knock off.
A set of New York Times polls of likely voters in battleground states, released Monday, offered more good news for the Biden campaign - and bad news for his nearest competitors. They showed Biden beating Trump narrowly in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona, tying him in Michigan and losing by a whisker in North Carolina. In every one of those states, Biden was seen as faring better than Warren or Sanders. Warren was shown as beating Trump only in Arizona and either losing to him or tying him in the other state matchups.
Numbers such as those may be why Biden continues to lead the Democratic field in the RealClearPolitics national poll average, with 29.1 percent, followed by Warren with 20.6 percent, Sanders with 16.6 percent, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 7.1 percent. At this point, everybody else in the race is basically hanging around, waiting for lightning to strike.
That is not what anyone would call a commanding lead. But it has been remarkably durable, and I see no reason to doubt it reflects the reality of the contest.
It is true that Biden's fundraising has been anemic compared with that of Sanders and Warren. If money and passion were dispositive, Biden would already be toast. Yet something else - I believe it's his numbers against Trump's - keeps him in front.
What, exactly, is going to prompt the Biden collapse that so many knowledgeable observers seem to think is coming? A lousy debate performance? He has survived several of those just fine. Some kind of off-the-wall utterance at a campaign stop? Biden has been a reliable source of flubs and non sequiturs for decades, and his supporters are unbothered.
Here is another way to look at the race. If all of today's RealClearPolitics poll averages are borne out - they won't be, but humor me - Biden would lose to Warren in both Iowa and New Hampshire, but then beat her in Nevada and South Carolina. That would set up a showdown on Super Tuesday, March 3, 2020, when 14 states hold their primaries, including California, Texas and five Southern states where the African American vote - perhaps Biden's greatest strength - will be crucial.
The necessity of sending this historically bad president home to Trump Tower - or now, I guess, Mar-a-Lago - so overshadows the Democratic campaign that voters are commitment-shy. A recent poll in Iowa showed that the number of undecided Democrats there increased sharply over the summer. I admit that I don't know what's going to happen.
But anybody who hopes to win has to get past Biden. So far, nobody has.

Texto completo: The Delaware River is the official border between the First State and New Jersey, right?
Yes and no.
Unbeknownst to many residents, the two states actually share two land borders, one of which is nearly 2 miles long.
Not only does Delaware own a small chunk of Artificial Island, where the Hope Creek Nuclear Power Plant is, but there's a weird swath of land just outside Pennsville that belongs to the Diamond State.
The entire thing is only about 580 acres, but it and rights to the nearby Delaware River have been the subject of not one, but three U.S. Supreme Court cases, the most recent of which concluded in 2008.
Local residents call it "The Point" or "The Baja."
"It's weird, and it has been weird for a long time," Pennsville Mayor Robert McDade said of property's existence. "Most people wouldn't even know that it's out there."
So why is the tiny piece of land such a big deal? And why does it exist in the first place?
The answers to both questions are surprisingly complex.
How was the border established? The answer to the second question, which we'll tackle first, lies with Delaware's northern border, which is curved instead of a straight line.
Its existence dates from a deed to William Penn from the Duke of York on Aug. 24, 1682, which granted Penn all the land west of the Delaware River within a 12-mile compass circle beginning at the courthouse in New Castle.
Unlike other territorial boundaries, however, where rivers are essentially split in half between two states, the deed gave Penn rights to the entire waterway up to the low-tide mark on the east side.
Originally, that also gave Delaware ownership of a marshy wetland just outside Pennsville, which was designated a federally protected bird habitat in the 1930s.
It was called Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge.
But then, in the first part of the 20th century, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the river and depositing silt at Killcohoook, eventually turning it into solid land.
Tim Boyle, a spokesman for the Corps, said the process took several decades.
Dredging helps keep the river deep enough for shipping traffic, and during and after World War II preserving nature took second priority to finding an easy place to dump silt and mud, according to The News Journal's archives.
The wetland was transformed into fields of tall plume grass and dusty hills, and Killcohook's status as a refuge was revoked in 1998. Conservationists cried foul and raised concerns about chemicals and pollution from the mounded dredge spoils.
Thousands of geese, mallards, ducks, teal and pheasants were replaced by empty beer bottles and junked cars. On a recent Thursday, the only sound one could hear at The Baja was that of the wind racing through invasive phragmites, a species of reed that crowds out native vegetation.
The New York Times, which wrote about the dredge-spoil dumping in 1985, said the failed wildlife area was perhaps one of New Jersey's "ugliest ecological secrets."
Ownership and management of Killcohook was "a real ball of wax," the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the newspaper.
The land is part of Delaware, is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has been managed as hunting grounds by wildlife agencies in both New Jersey and Delaware.
"It was a bastard within the national wildlife system," an official later told The News Journal in 1998. "It really has been kicked back and forth between its parents."
Today, Boyle said the land isn't used for anything specific. McDade, Pennsville's mayor, said dredge spoils are still routinely dumped there.
The Army Corps of Engineers has since become more environmentally conscious and uses dredge spoils to create or restore wildlife habitats, replenish beaches and more, according to its website.
What were the court cases about? New Jersey has long argued that the small strip of land created by dredging shouldn't be Delaware's in the first place.
There have been three Supreme Court cases between the two states over its ownership and rights to the Delaware River.
The first was resolved in 1905 with a compact between the two states that addressed fishing rights but didn't define the border.
The second lawsuit, in 1934, concluded that Deleware owned "the river and the subaqueous soil" up to the low tide mark.
A third case in 2007 was sparked by a liquid natural gas plant. In 2005, a fight erupted between the two states over British Petroleum's then-proposal to build a $500 million LNG import facility just across the river from Claymont.
Under the plan, New Jersey would have built a delivery pier that jutted into Delaware's territorial waters. While New Jersey saw jobs and economic development, Delawareans feared potential explosions of the condensed fuel.
In 2006, Sen. Harris McDowell, D-Wilmington, co-sponsored a bill, likely in jest, that would have authorized then-Gov. Ruth Ann Miner to send the Delaware National Guard across the river to physically block construction of the port's bulkheads and piers.
New Jersey jokingly threatened to bring the Battleship New Jersey down.
By 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court intervened, ruling that Delaware's laws could, in fact, prevent the plan from progressing.
No man's land While Delaware hasn't ceded the small strip of land outside Pennsville to New Jersey, it has relied on the other state to help maintain order there.
It's a bit of a no man's land, referred to by some local residents as "The Baja," Pennsville police Chief Allen J. Cummings said. He's not sure what inspired the nickname but said it's been referred to as that since he was a kid.
In the past, New Jersey police had no jurisdiction over the property, which means people would go there to commit crimes, according to a 1990 Baltimore Sun story.
Teens could do drugs and drink there without fear of arrest.
Then, in 1987, Pennsville police found the body of a 45-year-old hunter who had been shot in the head.
The department had to call Delaware coroner's office to pick up the body because no one in New Jersey was authorized to do it. The man was only 10 feet over the state line, authorities said.
The death, which was eventually ruled a suicide, highlighted jurisdictional issues over the land. Eventually, the two states agreed that the Pennsville Police Department could enforce laws on the property.
That doesn't mean Cummings and his officers patrol The Baja, the police chief said. They only go out there if they get a call about something.
"We've had a few fatalities up there, kids on four-wheelers or motorcycles or dirtbikes," Cummings said.
The mayor said for a time, after word got out that the land was a good place for off-roading, people were coming from nearby states like Pennsylvania with big trailers full of ATVs.
Accesses to the property are blocked off by iron gates, but they can be circumvented by small recreational vehicles, Cummings said. There are fewer off-road vehicles now, thanks to enforcement efforts, but teens likely still use the area to party.
Even so, it's better than it used to be when he was in high school. He said the department hadn't gotten any calls from the area in a couple of years, though if you walk along the shoreline there are signs of recent bonfires and drinking.
"We don't have to drive up there and check it every night," Cummings said. "It's not like that anymore."
The department also gets calls about human remains found in The Baja. Sometimes, when someone takes their own life by jumping off the Delaware Memorial Bridge, they will wash up on its shores.
Years ago when Cummings was a detective, a child even found a human skull on the beach, which he brought into the police department in a milk crate.
Near the site it was found, police found a pair of pants with a set of car keys in the pocket, which were matched to a vehicle found abandoned near the bridge.
When there are fatalities or human remains are found in the water or the land belonging to Delaware, Pennsville officers call the Delaware State Police Department, which recovers the bodies and heads up any subsequent investigations.
"It's an interesting place," Cummings said. "There's a lot of history there."

Young people’s hatred for baby boomers is completely justified

Texto completo: Boomers ruin everything. Now, they’re trying to ruin the “OK Boomer” meme, too.
It all started when the New York Times published a piece explaining the slang phrase used by young people to dismiss out-of-touch arguments from their elders. Journalist Taylor Lorenz described “OK Boomer” as “Generation Z’s endlessly repeated retort to the problem of older people who just don’t get it, a rallying cry for millions of fed-up kids.” As she reports, “Teenagers use it to reply to … basically any person over 30 who says something condescending about young people — and the issues that matter to them.”
Thus, the Times’ headline seems fitting: “‘OK Boomer Marks the End of Friendly Generational Relations.” It does indeed.
But boomers aren’t taking the slight lying down. New York Post columnist Steve Cuozzo stirred up quite a controversy with his Saturday column titled “Millennials’ extreme hatred for baby boomers is totally unjustified.” He’s completely wrong and in the most boomer way possible. In fact, the grievances that young people have with their elders are fully justified, as the baby-boomer generation has screwed us over in innumerable ways.
It’s worth noting that Cuozzo’s column is guilty of many of the same cringe-worthy tropes that lead young people to deride boomers in the first place.
For one, he spends much of the piece decrying “millennials,” when, in fact, “OK Boomer” is largely a Generation Z phenomenon. This is not exactly the best way to rebut criticisms that you're out of touch.
So, too, Cuozzo dismisses young people’s concerns over student loans by reminiscing about how, back in his day, he paid his loans off. He doesn't bother to mention that the inflation-adjusted cost of college has increased by 1100% since 1978 (four times greater than inflation). He also reminisces about how he once worked 10-hour shifts at a restaurant without any break. Apparently, he expects young people to shut up and accept poor working conditions because he did so decades ago.
Basically, in his column defending baby boomers, Cuozzo falls into the stereotypical boomer attitude that young people hate so much: “I suffered, so you should too!” And the Post columnist never really grapples with the more substantive grievances that young people have with his generation. For instance, baby boomers (and other older generations) have essentially left their young buried in debt they can never repay. The national debt now tops $23 trillion, a whopping $185,000 per taxpayer.

Boomers won’t live long enough to face the consequences of their spending spree. But young Americans will live to see larger annual interest payments, slowed economic growth, and increased financial instability.
That’s not all. As Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank noted, “Boomers expanded entitlement programs that are wrecking the nation’s finances; they failed to act on global warming; they presided over declining faith in virtually all institutions, from religion to the Supreme Court; and their children may be the first generation with dim prospects of doing better than their parents did.”
Of course, it’s not as if boomers have never done any good. But Cuozzo attempts to overstate his generation's accomplishments. He takes credit in his column for everything from the defeat of communism to the digital revolution. But boomer voters didn’t control the government until the 1990s. The Greatest Generation deserves credit for winning the Cold War, not boomers. And the absurdity speaks for itself that he tries to give credit for the “digital revolution” to the generation that is still figuring out Facebook.
No individual deserves blame for the faults of a whole generation. But boomers ought to give their generation’s legacy an honest reckoning and realize that maybe, just maybe, the kids have a point.

The weak case for Trump's impeachment gets weaker if the whistleblower won't testify in person

Texto completo: The career government employee — excuse me, I mean “patriotic public servant” — who kicked off the impeachment proceedings is so confident in the substance of his complaint that he’s refusing to answer questions about it in public.
Lawyers for the so-called whistleblower said Sunday that he’s willing to testify in front of Congress but only in written form, meaning members could submit questions to his legal team and that his answers would come back in written form.
The New York Times generously described this evasion as an attempt to “deter Republican attacks and show that the whistle-blower, a C.I.A. officer, is above the political rancor unleashed by House Democrats’ inquiry.”
That’s not what it is. It’s an attempt at avoiding scrutiny.
CNN’s Chris Cuomo and other liberals in the national media have been saying that there’s no need to know anything more about the whistleblower because other testimony has already corroborated his account. The White House has released the transcript of the phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, offering further confirmation of the original complaint.
But one niggling fact is that not everyone is in agreement on whether Trump did anything wrong. Those who think he did were given the opportunity by Congress to say why and each time, the reasoning boiled down to a disagreement over policy and politics.
In his testimony last week, National Security Council official Alexander Vindman said he was uneasy with Trump’s remarks on the phone call as they related to Joe Biden because he thought they “would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.” In other words, Vindman personally disagreed with Trump and thought the call would jeopardize yet more and more financial aid to Ukraine. Well, I’m glad he blew the lid off that one.
As the issue relates specifically to the whistleblower, though, the public deserves to know a lot more directly from him. To what extent was there a coordinated effort to bring his complaint forward? With whom did he coordinate?
The inspector general’s report on the complaint said that the whistleblower demonstrated a political bias in favor of one of Trump's political rivals and that he has a direct personal connection with one of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. What’s the nature of that connection, and who is the candidate?
An impeachment based on policy disagreements from a handful of bureaucrats is weak. It’s not going to get any stronger if the public doesn’t get to hear directly from the bureaucrat who started it all.

El presidente Trump califica el proceso de una “cacería de brujas”, tal como lo hizo con las investigaciones sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016 y ha endurecido su postura contra Pelosi, al pedirle que se dedique a atender asuntos relacionados con su Distrito electoral, en San Francisco, California, en lugar de andarlo investigando.
“Creo que Nancy Pelosi se ha vuelto loca y creo, francamente, que debería regresar a su hogar en San Francisco” , expresó el mandatario en conferencia afuera de la Casa Blanca el domingo.
A pesar de sus críticas, el proceso avanza en el Comité de Inteligencia, liderado por Adam Schiff . A continuación el contexto general para entender en qué momento se encuentra esta batalla política y legislativa.
1. La llamada.- El 25 de julio, el presidente Trump tuvo una llamada telefónica con su homólogo de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky , a quien felicitó por su reciente elección, pero hizo una petición, “un favor”: reabrir una supuesta investigación contra Hunter Biden , hijo del exvicepresidente Joe Biden , por su relación con una empresa gasera de aquel país, además de determinar si el fiscal encargado de ese caso fue despedido ante la presión del exvicepresidente. La llamada fue escuchada por un selecto grupo del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional.
2. Petición y ofrecimiento.- Tras informarse que el presidente Trump pudo haber incurrido en alguna falta al pedir a un gobierno extranjero investigar a un ciudadano estadounidense, especialmente a un rival político camino a las elecciones 2020, el republicano negó haberlo hecho. Para demostrarlo pidió que se diera a conocer la transcripción de aquella conversación. Sin embargo, a pesar de que la reproducción publicada el 25 de septiembre por la Casa Blanca no era fiel , en ella se establece una petición de indagar al exvicepresidente Biden y a su hijo, además de que el presidente Trump ofrece colaboración a través de su abogado personal, Rudy Giuliani , y el fiscal general, William Barr .
3. Un informante.- Esta nueva batalla ante el Congreso comenzó cuando un informante anónimo alertó sobre los dichos del presidente Trump en aquella llamada. La identidad de esa persona sigue protegida y se descarta dar a conocer su nombre, pero The New York Times afirmó que se trata de un agente de la CIA que fue brevemente enviado a la Casa Blanca. El presidente Trump exige que diga de quién se trata. Mark Zaid , uno de los abogados del informante, pidió a los Comités de Inteligencia de la Cámara y del Senado proteger a su cliente .
4. Dos testigos clave.- De los testigos que han rendido testimonio a puerta cerrada ante los investigadores de la Cámara destacan dos: el embajador en funciones de Estados Unidos ante Ucrania, Bill Taylor , quien afirmó haber alertado sobre mensajes, donde en forma explícita se indica que los fondos para Ucrania estaban siendo retenidos por la Administración Trump hasta que el Kiev accediera a abrir una investigación que pudiera perjudicar a Biden y al Partido Demócrata. El otros es el teniente coronel Alexander Vindman , el principal experto en Ucrania del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, quien dijo ante la Cámara que en la transcripción de la Casa Blanca de la llamada se omitieron palabras o frases cruciales, como el nombre de la compañía de energía que empleó Hunter Biden en su junta directiva, la cual es Burisma Holdings. El presidente Trump amagó dar a conocer información sobre Vindman, luego de ese testimonio.
5. Los siguientes pasos.- La aprobación en la Cámara de las investigaciones ayudaría a la Casa Blanca a colaborar, aunque expertos adelantan que no será fácil. El demócrata Schiff indicó que ahora el procedimiento permitirá audiencia abiertas, un abogado interrogará a los citados hasta por 45 minutos, los miembros del Comité podrán hacer preguntas posteriores y también se harán públicas las transcripciones de las declaraciones. Los primeros cambios se verán esta semana, cuando se den a conocer las transcripciones de las audiencias en privado. La intención de los demócratas es votar por un juicio político a mediados o finales de diciembre.

Some boomers are OK with 'OK Boomer' meme

Texto completo: Perhaps you've seen a young person wearing a T-shirt that says "OK Boomer" and thought, "That's nice. They're honoring their elders!"
No, not at all.
"OK Boomer" sounds like something someone would say to a dog on a show about two guys who drive a car around the South. But, as we learned this week from a New York Times story, it is something the Whippersnapper-American community says to The Olds.
It's a flat, affectless response to boomers being typical out-of-touch, unhip, willfully ignorant people who still think it should be 1979 and anything called a "phone" should be bolted to a wall and have a gnarled, knotted 12-foot beige cord.
An example of how the phrase is used: "What you kids call a phone isn't a phone at all! It's just a time-wasting toy."
"OK Boomer."
Are you at risk for this withering retort? Possibly. Let's see if you qualify.
First, are you a boomer? This is the group that was born between 1946 and 1964. It's a ridiculously large group. I have little in common with anyone who was 18 in 1964, sitting in a dorm room leading a hootenanny singalong with a Kingston Trio album, or some other folk record. "If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning!" Well, what's stopping you? They're $14.99 at the hardware store. Set an alarm clock and get to it.
If you grew up in the mid-'70s, boomer music was their music, not yours, and it's only been the last few years when you could walk into a grocery store and not hear boomer anthems playing on the sound system. If I seem a bit testy about it, blame too many days in the frozen foods aisle hearing "Four dead in
Oh-hio" trickling from above while I select my ice cream.
Granted, boomer culture had its moments, but just because you were 20 when an album came out, doesn't mean it was great.
" 'Stairway to Heaven' is the modern day equivalent of a Handel oratorio."
"OK Boomer."
Second: How you use the internet is critical. If you use the web only to go on Facebook and post pictures of Minions giving something the side-eye with the caption "I don't do Mondays," fine. People lead rich, productive, fulfilling lives without hanging out on Twitter for seven hours a day.
But there are advantages to modern tech that some boomers not only reject, but get a bit angry about.
Boomer to Millennial: "I need to get to my book club, it's in Eden Prairie. Can you help me?"
Millennial (looking at phone): "Sure. Just tell Siri where you want to go, and it will give you a route. Then press 'go' for turn-by-turn directions."
Boomer: "No, I need to know where I'm going. I need a map."
Millennial (not looking up from phone because eye contact feels invasive, and also people are mad on Twitter about something and it's terribly important): "Why?"
Boomer: "So I know where to turn."
Millennial (looking up, blinking with confusion at the sudden imperative of a real-world interaction): "Siri will tell you."
Boomer: "But I just want to print off a map!"
Millennial: "OK Boomer."
It's not the inability to adapt to tech. It's the angry refusal to learn the basics that gets you the "OK Boomer" retort. And boomers should be able to relate to that. They felt the same thing when their parents wouldn't get a VCR.
"But, Dad, you can record shows!"
"Don't need it, I sit here with a pad of paper and a pencil and write down the dialogue. I can reconstruct it with my imagination. Your generation has to have everything spelled out for it."
Some of you don't think anything that happened before the internet matters much, and you think all this meaningless stuff on the internet matters a lot. Some of you join online mobs with glee to cancel out people who said something that was fine last week but pure hot sin today. Some of you live in a world of limitless vistas and behold it through a glass slab 3 inches wide.
Some of you are mad about the preceding assertions even though I took pains to say "some."
Note: I asked my daughter, who is 19, if she or her friends had ever encountered this phrase. They shrugged. They'd heard it as an online thing that other people were saying, but it hadn't made much of an impression on them.
Which makes "OK Boomer" just another tiny blip inflated to zeppelin-size proportions, puffed up by people who need something silly to fill the maw of contention, outrage, division and tribal alliances. Altogether now: "OK internet."

Texto completo: Daniel Romanchuk became the first American to win the New York City Marathon wheelchair division two years in a row on Sunday, capturing his fifth major race in 2019. He won with a time of 1 hour, 37 minutes and 24 seconds.
The 21-year-old was born with spina bifida, a "birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly," according to the Mayo Clinic. He also has a 6-foot-10 wingspan — wider than swimming icon Michael Phelps.
Romanchuk's coach, Adam Bleakney, told The Wall Street Journal that Romanchuk's wingspan gives him an advantage because he can use a 17-inch-diameter hand ring (the device athletes grip for propulsion during race) as opposed to the 15-inch one most other elite racers use.
"That allows him to have a very high max velocity," Bleakney told the newspaper. "That's paramount in winning in our sport. "
Romanchuk again had to fend off Swiss foe Marcel Hug, edging him by one second -- just like he did in the previous NYC Marathon.

“It was a very tight finish,” said Romanchuk, via Reuters. “As it got later in the race, there’s just more and more people catching up and making a bigger group, and then things got a little bit more tactical. ”
Last year at age 20, Romanchuk won the New York City Marathon with a time of 1:36:21 to become the youngest man to claim the title. Shortly after, Romanchuk became the youngest to win the Boston Marathon and the first American to win in 26 years. By September, Romanchuk had secured a World Marathon Majors title for the most points won over a year — the first American to accomplish the feat.
At the New York City Marathon, Romanchuk won $25,000, a five-fold increase from last year, according to The New York Times.
The 21-year-old also has qualified for the Paralympic Games in Tokyo next summer as a result of his Chicago Marathon time (1:30:26) in October.

Texto completo: Documents from the special counsel's inquiry show that President Trump's former campaign chairman shared the theory shortly after stolen Democratic emails were published that June.
WASHINGTON -- Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, spread a conspiracy theory now at the center of the impeachment investigation -- that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee -- as early as five months before the 2016 election, according to newly released documents from the special counsel's investigation.
Mr. Manafort told his deputy on the campaign about the theory shortly after emails stolen from the Democrats were published in June 2016, and questions arose about whether Russia hacked the emails to help the Trump campaign, according to the documents.
The documents have no information about when Mr. Trump embraced the conspiracy theory, which he later asked Ukraine's president to investigate in a July 25 phone call even as he was withholding military aid for the country. Those revelations helped touch off the impeachment inquiry.
The details of what Mr. Manafort told campaign officials are included in a trove of records from the special counsel's investigation obtained by BuzzFeed News through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The documents -- including F.B.I. interview reports with several key witnesses and emails of Mr. Trump's top campaign officials -- contain few startling details that were not in the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, but they underscore the notion that Mr. Trump's campaign eagerly welcomed Russia's help in the election and show how concerned campaign officials were about being tied to Russia.
The documents also provide new insights into how the Fox News personality Sean Hannity played a role in Mr. Trump's campaign and how Mr. Manafort remained involved in helping Mr. Trump long after he was fired in August 2016.
"I am really feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday and focusing on preserving the victory," Mr. Manafort said in an email to Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, three days before the election. "This memo deals with this concern."
Mr. Manafort, who was removed as the campaign's chairman after questions arose about his business ties to Ukraine and is now in prison for financial crimes associated with his work there, told Mr. Kushner that he had briefed the deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates, and Mr. Hannity on the memo.
Mr. Kushner forwarded the email to Mr. Trump's top campaign strategist, Stephen K. Bannon.
"We need to avoid this guy like the plague," Mr. Bannon said. "Paul is a nice guy but can't let word get out he is advising us."
Mr. Bannon added, "They are going to try to say the Russians worked with WikiLeaks to give this victory to us."
The account of how Mr. Manafort first raised the prospect that Ukraine had been behind the hack was included in an F.B.I. report about an interview the special counsel's office did with Mr. Gates in April 2018. Mr. Gates said Mr. Manafort's theory echoed one that had been pushed by a Ukrainian businessman who had worked with Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates when they consulted for the government there years earlier. Mr. Mueller's office has said that the Ukrainian businessman, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, has ties to Russian intelligence.
"Gates recalled Manafort saying the hack was likely carried out by the Ukrainians, not the Russians, which parroted a narrative Kilimnik often supported," according to the F.B.I. interview report. "Kilimnik also opined the hack could have been perpetrated by Russian operatives in Ukraine."
It is unclear when Mr. Trump embraced the theory. In April 2017, just three months into his presidency, he first raised the issue publicly, questioning how the F.B.I. conducted its investigation into the hack and why agents declined to take the server from the Democrats to more closely examine who breached it.
The Democrats "get hacked, and the F.B.I. goes to see them, and they won't let the F.B.I. see their server," Mr. Trump told The Associated Press.
"They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based," Mr. Trump said in an apparent reference to a company the Democrats brought in to investigate the hack. "That's what I heard. I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian."
Mr. Gates laid out for investigators how determined Mr. Trump appeared to be during the campaign to find emails from Hillary Clinton's private email account and how Mr. Trump told his aides that he wanted them to "get the emails."
Mr. Trump's top national security aide on the campaign, Michael T. Flynn, "said he could use his intelligence sources to obtain the emails," Mr. Gates told investigators.
Mr. Flynn told campaign officials that the American intelligence agencies would be unable to determine who was behind the hack, Mr. Gates said, adding that he believed Mr. Flynn had a negative view of the agencies because he had been pushed out of the intelligence community during the Obama administration.
"Gates said Flynn had the most Russia contacts of anyone on the campaign and was in the best position to ask for the emails if they were out there," according to Mr. Gates's F.B.I. interview report.
Mr. Trump fired Mr. Flynn less than a month into his presidency. In 2017, Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I. agents about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the transition, and he is awaiting sentencing.
Mr. Gates said Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner had initially been skeptical about working with the Republican National Committee. But Mr. Gates said that they became more interested in collaborating after learning that the committee wanted to help amplify the emails that WikiLeaks planned to release.
Mr. Gates said that the committee had private information that indicated it knew the timing of upcoming email disclosures.
"Gates did not specify who at the R.N.C. knew this information," according to the documents. "Gates said the only nonpublic information the R.N.C. had related to the timing of the releases."
The Republican National Committee said in a statement that Mr. Gates's claims were false.
"The R.N.C. had no advanced knowledge. Gates has already pled guilty to lying to federal authorities," said the committee's communications director, Michael Ahrens. "Why would anyone believe him now?"

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The New York City Marathon has been called the world's greatest block party, and for good reason. Every year, one million to two million spectators are estimated to line the 26.2-mile course, which traverses all five boroughs. The number of applicants for the marathon has grown steadily since the race's founding in 1970. This year, a record-breaking 117,709 people applied for the non-guaranteed drawing for a chance to run. More than 50,000 people from all over the world participated in yesterday's race.

Each year during race weekend, designers and editors at The New York Times race to our own finish line: to publish what we call the Marathon Agate, a list of the names and finish times of many of the day's runners, in the following day's city edition paper. (An agate is journalism jargon for the presentation of information printed in smaller type -- in this case, just a quarter-inch high.) Compared with a typical Monday, the post-marathon city paper sees a bump in retail sales of almost 50 percent.
The Marathon Agate as city residents will see it in today's paper was born in 1994, for the 25th annual race, and has appeared in the paper every year since.

The number of names published depends on both the amount of pages allotted for the agate as well as runners' finish times. Later finish times have less of a chance of appearing in the following day's paper. On Nov. 6, 1994, 29,732 runners stepped up to the challenge that is the New York City Marathon, and 28,348 of those runners' names made it into the next day's paper.

In 2018, The New York Times published more than 35,000 runners' names and their finish times. Kyle Brillante, a Brooklyn resident and the principal of the Highbridge Green School in the Bronx, was among the names my colleagues and I reviewed and published. His time was 4 hours, 15 minutes, 13 seconds. It was his first marathon.

Reached by phone this year, Mr. Brillante said seeing his name in the paper the next day filled him with pride and a sense of accomplishment. "Seeing that there, it's like a job well done. Like I made it," he said.

Sharon Ryan, who lives in Upper Westchester in New York, ran her first marathon in 2015 at 50 years old and has also been featured in the Marathon Agate. She ran in the second wave yesterday, her fourth New York City Marathon.

Ms. Ryan woke up at around 4:30 a.m. so she could check in on time. By 6:45 a.m., she was all set but waiting.
"We're not running until after 10 o'clock, so we have a long morning," she said. "We set up a blanket, we have our breakfast."

The Marathon Agate is produced by the Print Hub, the department at The Times that creates each day's print paper. Most of us who work on the Print Hub, where I've designed the marathon feature for two years running (so to speak), are night owls by virtue of our jobs and were fast asleep as the marathoners started their day. When Ms. Ryan was waiting in her corral at 9:30 a.m., I was just rising for my own breakfast.

By the time the fastest runners have cooled down and are enjoying hard-earned, high-calorie meals, my shift begins. It starts slow: a waiting game until the New York Road Runners, a nonprofit running organization based in New York City, sends along data files containing the runners' finish times. Once the first files arrive, around 3 p.m., our race begins.

Our goal is to publish as many names as possible in the pages allowed. This means adjusting character spacing, respectfully abbreviating long names to fit on one line, fact-checking accent marks that don't translate properly in the text files and adding time stamps at important intervals throughout the pages.
I am the first to scan the 30,000-plus names that will be printed, before passing on the list to a handful of other editors.

All of this must be finished up and sent to the printer by our 8 p.m. deadline. (That's also around the time some runners I spoke to go to sleep.)

By the time the last pages of the agate are sent, there's a feeling of relief and accomplishment in the Print Hub. Of course, it doesn't compare to the euphoria many runners experience when crossing the marathon's finish line.
"It was the most magical day -- the sheer amount of support and love," Mr. Brillante said about last year's race. "I broke into tears when I finished."
And the next day, he picked up a paper.

Texto completo: For just over two hours Sunday, the New York City Marathon returned the sport to simplicity. Don't expect it to last.
The New York City Marathon finished without controversy on Sunday on a pristine autumn day.
Joyciline Jepkosgei of Kenya won the women's race in ideal long-distance running conditions, completing her debut in the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 22 minutes 38 seconds, seven seconds off the course record. She edged out Mary Keitany, 37, also of Kenya, denying her a fifth title. It was the fastest debut in the women's race.
Jepkosgei, 25, is the world-record holder in the half-marathon, but the race on Sunday was her first major marathon.
"I knew Mary had more experience in marathon, so I was trying to push," Jepkosgei said. She added that she was looking back during the past few miles to see if her opponent would catch up.
In the men's race, Geoffrey Kamworor, 26, also of Kenya, broke the tape at the finish line in 2:08:13. He finished third in 2018 after winning in 2017.
"About 24 miles, I saw I was able to go, and I was feeling strong," Kamworor said. "That's when I decided to pull away."
Before that point, he ran mostly with a pack of several runners. Albert Korir of Kenya finished second in 2:08:36. Girma Bekele Gebre of Ethiopia finished third in 2:08:38.
The marathon was the last major competition on the running calendar. The world's best runners will now turn their focus to the 2020 Olympics. In the United States, the Olympic trials marathon is scheduled for Feb. 29 in Atlanta.
The triumphant finishes rounded out a tumultuous year in the sport that generally reflected, and sometimes fueled, broader debates both social and otherwise.
It was a year in which running had to confront thorny questions. Who counts as a woman? What do those women deserve in terms of compensation, and who is keeping them from getting it? There were even debates about what counts as a world record, and what counts as a proper shoe.
"This year had a lot of big breakthroughs that wound up transcending the running community," said Hawi Keflezighi, the track and field agent whose brother, Meb, was one of America's top distance runners of the modern era. "There were a lot of discussions about fairness in the sport, whether it's around shoes or gender. You have all these amazing athletes who are so dominant and admired and connecting with fans. We're following them closer and getting to know them and their journeys and their challenges. Everyone can have an opinion. They're simple questions but not simple issues. People's lives and careers are at stake."
In May, Caster Semenya of South Africa, the two-time Olympic 800-meter champion, was barred from racing against other women because her testosterone levels give her what the International Association of Athletics Federations considers an unfair advantage over all but a tiny segment of the female population. She is currently the best in the world at her event, but had to sit out the world championships in Doha, Qatar, in September.
The ruling triggered an uproar around athletic and gender activists who felt Semenya was unfairly targeted for being a black, intersex woman. Semenya has never revealed details of her biology. Others questioned the fairness of having someone with higher testosterone levels race against other women, going so far as to say that "losing the next generation of female athletes" was at stake in the case. The I.A.A.F., track and field's world governing body, imposed hormone restrictions in women's events from 400 meters to the mile, leading many to question the invasive nature of mandating that a person regulate her hormone levels.
Also in May, the Olympians Alysia Montaño, Kara Goucher and Allyson Felix disclosed to The New York Times that they faced reduced compensation from their shoe sponsors for having children. Felix disclosed that her contract with Nike had lapsed while she had her daughter in November 2018. She went on to win two more gold medals at the world championships in Doha less than a year postpartum, making her the most decorated track and field athlete of all time.
The revelations prompted a national debate about the extent to which the sport protects pregnant athletes and new mothers, and whether it had an obligation, or an incentive, to do so at all. Nike faced particular criticism -- its roots in the sport are deep, and its advertising campaigns celebrated women who combined sports and motherhood while its contracts punished them.
In August, Nike's executive vice president for global sports marketing, John Slusher, issued a letter to the company's sponsored athletes detailing changes that have been made to their contracts in an effort to support them through pregnancy.
Controversy followed Nike. During the world championships in Doha on Sept. 30, Alberto Salazar, the former champion runner and famed coach, was barred for four years from the sport after being found guilty of doping violations by the United States Anti-Doping Agency. Ten days later, Nike shut down Salazar's team, the Nike Oregon Project, which trained some of the best athletes in the United States, including the Olympic medalist Galen Rupp and the woman with the second fastest American marathon time, Jordan Hasay.
Then came an incredible weekend for the sport last month. In a run through a park in Vienna on Oct. 12, Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya broke the two-hour barrier in the marathon, finishing in 1 hour 59 minutes 40 seconds. The performance followed through on Kipchoge's prerace musings: "I don't know where the limits are, but I would like to go there."
The limits were stretched significantly by science and other support. Kipchoge received fuel as he ran and had pacers blocking the wind. He wore a pair of unreleased shoes with Nike's patented carbon plate. The effort, which captivated the world, was a time trial rather than a race, and was therefore not counted as an official world record, which he already holds: He ran a 2:01:39 at the Berlin Marathon last year. This year in Berlin, in a nearly overlooked event, Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia came within two seconds of breaking Kipchoge's mark.
The day after Kipchoge's breakthrough time, another Kenyan in Nike's new shoes, Brigid Kosgei, shattered the woman's world record at the Chicago Marathon.
"I wanted to be the second Kipchoge -- the Kipchoge for women," she said.
The two performances catapulted a conversation that had been happening in professional running circles for three years into the wider public: Are races being won by the best athletes -- or the best shoes? Right now, the carbon plates in the expensive Nike-patented shoes are seemingly so good at what they're designed to do -- help whoever's wearing them to go faster -- that any athlete wearing them has a significant advantage over those not wearing them. The I.A.A.F. quickly appointed a task force to come up with shoe guidelines.
With the 2020 Olympics on the horizon, the volume of the debates will likely rise. A sport that can seem so simple, as it did on the streets of New York on Sunday, is proving to be anything but.

Genuine Self-Care Transcends Trends

Texto completo: Face masks and bubbles baths? Next.
Welcome to the Smarter Living newsletter! Every Monday, S.L. editor Tim Herrera emails readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.
Self-care: In all its "treat yourself" glory, the term is now shorthand for a caricature of millennial self-indulgence, a hook on which everyone can hang complaints about "kids these days."
But it wasn't always that way. A decade ago, when Google search interest in "self-care" was at its lowest and it hadn't yet become that caricature, the idea was to focus on something far more substantial than scented candles and bath bombs: namely, mental health and taking care of oneself. And enjoyable as those minor indulgences are, the mental health side of self-care is having a resurgence, according to Anna Borges, senior health editor for Self magazine and author of the book "The More or Less Definitive Guide to Self-Care."
"I think it's come a little full circle by now," Ms. Borges said. "The 'face masks and bubble baths' of self-care hit a peak a little bit ago, then people started rebelling against it and talking about how it's no longer that."
She added: "It's about mental health and taking care of yourself. People are coming back around on it in response."
It could be a matter of culture catching up. According to Harvard Business Review, "Mental health awareness has reached an inflection point. Singers, actors and athletes are increasingly coming out about their challenges." And data from the American Psychological Association published last May supports the idea that we're more open about dealing with mental health: "A total of 87 percent of American adults agreed that having a mental health disorder is nothing to be ashamed of, and 86 percent said they believe that people with mental health disorders can get better," according to the poll.
From buzzword to benefits
Discarding the superficial associations we have with self-care is the easy part. From there, tending to yourself becomes a matter of trial and error to find what works for you.
We can break down self-care into four buckets: physical, mental, social and spiritual. (Think of that last one as a grab bag.) Using those frames of references, you can begin to experiment with different techniques that might work.

So, for example, let's say you've identified that you've been feeling more lonely these days. You might want to center your approach to self-care around strengthening the ties you have with friends and family -- maybe through regular phone calls or catch-up chats. Or let's say your health has dipped. In that case, self-care for you might focus on building a workout routine. Whatever self-care means for you, the point is to figure out just that: what it means for you.
"My definition of self-care is different than anyone else's definition, and that's kind of the point," Ms. Borges said. "There's no one definition. It all comes down to how you take care of yourself in order to equip yourself with the tools you'll need for your physical, mental and emotional health."
Embrace the process
Effective self-care isn't something you do. It's ... a lifestyle. (I know, I know, but stay with me.)
"My self-care routine is very much that: It's a routine," Ms. Borges said. "What I've learned in the past is if I make decisions based on how I'm feeling in the moment, I will make bad decisions."
We talk about habits all the time in Smarter Living, but for good reason: They work. Building habits around positive behaviors takes willpower and self-control out of the equation; you just do them.
Let's come back to the loneliness example. We know that loneliness can negatively impact physical and mental health. To fight back, maybe you build a habit by calling a close friend on the same day at the same time each week. Building that habit is a way to incorporate this act of self-care into your regular routine so it goes from being just an act to being a part of your life.
Another tactic is to consider what feels good now -- bingeing Netflix and pizza after an anxiety-ridden week, for example -- versus what will make you feel good in the long-term -- developing a habit around something that genuinely enriches your mental well-being. It's a lot of trial and error, and there isn't a "one simple trick" to discovering what self-care means for you, but developing a personalized self-care regimen is worth the effort.
Your definition of self-care will be whatever you make it. All that matters is that you do put in that effort.
"There's a billion different things that can be self-care, and you have to piece them together to figure out what works for you," Ms. Borges said. "People want quick fixes, but a lot about self-care is putting in the work long-term."
What is your self-care routine? Tell me on Twiter @timherrera.
Thanks, have a great week!

Texto completo: JUSTICE THOMAS AT UF,Earl Crittenden Jr., chair, OnePulse Foundation: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas will teach a course in spring 2020 at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. The class addresses the First Amendment as it pertains to religious clauses (think, the bakery doesn't have to design your wedding cake if it takes religious exception with your choice of spouse). The subject matter is as controversial as its professor, arguably a #MeToo icon. Students will get a glimpse of a somewhat enigmatic member of the court as the usually silent justice - he rarely speaks during oral arguments - facilitates discussions of this topic.
PULSE MEMORIAL, Tom Dyer, attorney, founder of Watermark: The challenge was daunting: transform Orlando's worst tragedy into a resource for inspiration and love. On Oct. 30, the onePULSE Foundation announced that French architects Coldefy & Associes have been selected to design the National Pulse Museum and Memorial. Coldefy's team, which includes Orlando-based HHCP Architects, proposed a tall, billowing, circular white museum tower that opens to the sky and will be visible for miles. The nearby memorial honors Pulse victims with a reflecting pool and garden planted with 49 trees. The hoped-for completion date is 2022. If fully realized, the ambitious project will redefine our city.
MAGIC DISTRICT, Jane Healy, former editorial page editor and managing editor, Orlando Sentinel: The news that the Orlando Magic entertainment district will now be more than double its original $200 million estimate is significant in more ways than one. Yes, its stores, apartments, event space and a hotel will add greatly to what's already downtown. But equally important is that it's a major private investment west of I-4. For years and years, the only major investment in that area has been done by government. The Magic mega-development also is sure to spur other private ventures, expanding the downtown vibrance.
BRIDGING THE GAP, Viviana Janer, vice chair, Osceola County Commission: The awarding of a federal contract to BRIDG worth more than $20 million to develop advanced microelectronics is proof that Osceola County's strategy to radically transform its economy is working. As the initial anchor at NeoCity, BRIDG is an emerging leader in securing our nation's microelectronics supply chain. This agreement potentially opens the door to larger defense contracts and investment from private defense contractors. As operator of an advanced microelectronics fabrication facility, BRIDG is positioned to become a leader in 5G wireless, the Internet of Things, and the creation of countless smart sensors.
HOPE IN POST-COMMUNIST LANDS, Timothy McKinney, Chief Executive Officer, United Global Outreach: I just returned from a busy few weeks working alongside and encouraging professional fellows that United Global Outreach has hosted in Bithlo this past year from Slovakia, Romania and Albania. Each of these post-communism countries still face great challenges as they continue the sometimes-painful process of maturing as democracies. I left each country knowing they are in good hands with these talented young leaders working hard to ensure that every citizen would have an equal opportunity to succeed through active civic engagement with and oversight of government ensuring civil societies free from corruption providing just treatment for all.
HOMESTEAD FACILITY, Muhammad Musri, president, Islamic Society of Central Florida: Finally, the Trump administration announced Oct. 28 that it is shutting down the Homestead detention facility for child migrants who were separated from their parents as a result of a "zero-tolerance" policy at the U.S.-Mexico border. The facility was costing $720,000 a day to run even when no children were left there. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the contract with Comprehensive Health Services Inc. is set to end on Nov. 30. About 2,000 workers will be terminated in the coming days. The facility will go, but the policy will remain as a stain on American immigration legacy.
FALL BACK, John Thedford, entrepreneur, founder of SMART Financial: Former Gov. Rick Scott signed the "Sunshine Protection Act" in March 2017, but federal law has yet to be amended to keep daylight-saving time year-round. Thus, we roll back our clocks Nov. 3 and the Sunshine State will succumb to another year of losing one hour of precious daylight. Despite the fact that longer daylight in the evening would reduce car crashes and pedestrian incidents and benefit agriculture, our clocks will roll back. Fingers crossed that the act signed over two years ago will become federal law before fall 2020.
ISIS LEADER'S DEATH,Michael Zais, political blogger for the Drunken Republican: On May 2, 2011, a day after Barack Obama green-lighted the operation that led to the long sought demise of Osama bin Laden, a New York Times headline read "Obama Finds Praise, Even From Republicans." And rightly so. Sadly, in today's political climate, no such reciprocity was forthcoming in the aftermath of President Trump's similar green-lighting of the operation that wiped ISIS leader al-Baghdadi off the face of the earth. Even worse ... many on the left and in the mainstream media contorted themselves into pretzels to ridiculously search for any angle with which to criticize the commander In chief. Just one lousy day would have been nice for all Americans to celebrate this nonpartisan victory.

Texto completo: DAVENPORT, Iowa — If Senator Elizabeth Warren thought her proposal to pay for Medicare for All would quiet her critics and rivals, that plan didn't work.
As Warren and other Democratic presidential candidates descended on Iowa this past weekend, the attacks came flying at her. Former vice president Joe Biden's campaign suggested she is dishonest. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., questioned her math. And even Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who has long refrained from attacking her, said his own plan to fund Medicare for All is more progressive.
Warren holds a slim lead here in the first caucus state, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll. But as the biggest weekend of Iowa's fall campaign season drew to a close, it was clear she will have to fight a two-front battle to hold onto that lead, with Sanders showing a new willingness to knock her from the left and Biden and Buttigieg laying into her from their more moderate positions.
Well aware of those threats, Warren responded more directly to her rivals after weeks of trying to hover above the fray, calling out Biden by name and retooling the end of her stump speech to address lingering questions about her electability.
“There are people who will just as easily give up on a big idea and sound oh so smart and oh so sophisticated," Warren said in a high school gymnasium Sunday, offering a sharpened defense of a candidacy that is betting bold policy ideas will turn out new voters.
But going on the offense may not be enough to lift Warren out of the Medicare for All morass where Biden and others want her mired. As reporters grilled her on her plan on Saturday, Warren made a rare misstep in describing her funding plan, handing her rivals fuel for criticism and dragging her further into the weeds of a health care debate she never seemed eager to have in the first place.
On Saturday night, Warren told a reporter in Dubuque that her plan “doesn't raise taxes on anybody but billionaires," even though it has provisions that would affect the top 1 percent of American families, many of whom are worth much less than that. Warren's communications team said she was talking only about a provision of the plan that raises her proposed wealth tax for billionaires, but the Biden campaign pounced anyway.
“The American people have to be able to trust whoever our party nominates to take on Donald Trump to be straight with them about health care," said Kate Bedingfield, the deputy campaign manager for Biden, seizing on the gaffe on behalf of a candidate who had mistakenly said he was in Ohio, not Iowa, just hours before.
Biden's statement also singled out Warren's capital gains tax, even though his own health care plan would also increase that tax for wealthy families.
Warren has propelled herself to the top tier of the Democratic presidential field with a soak-the-rich fight against corporate greed and Washington corruption, electrifying progressives with ambitious policy proposals.
But Warren's support for Medicare for All became a major sticking point as candidates including Biden and Buttigieg knocked her vow to deliver an entirely government-funded health care system that did not raise taxes on the middle class without specifying how. Sanders, who wrote the Medicare for All legislation, which does not detail how the program would be funded, never came to her defense. Warren was left to absorb the attacks on her own.
So Warren arrived in Iowa on Friday with a 20-page white paper laying out her $20.5 trillion plan to fund Medicare for All over 10 years without raising taxes on the middle class by “one penny."
It would be paid for, the campaign said, with a 6 percent wealth tax on billionaires — which is higher than the 2 percent tax she already proposed on people with more than $50 million — as well as taxes on financial transactions and capital gains taxes for the top 1 percent.
Employers would have to put about $8.8 trillion into the system, which is similar to their contributions to the current system, and other funding would come from defense cuts and an immigration overhaul.
Biden's campaign immediately ripped into Warren's plan on Friday, which prompted her to suggest he was “running in the wrong presidential primary." Meanwhile, Buttigieg took the stage in front of some 13,500 Iowa voters at the Liberty and Justice dinner in Des Moines Friday night and made comments that seemed to suggest she is too divisive for the general election.
“I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point," Buttigieg said.
When it was her turn to speak, Warren accused her rivals of thinking too small — “Anyone who comes on this stage and tells you they can make change without a fight is not going to win that fight," she said — but by Saturday, she was back to defending herself on Medicare for All.
At a town hall-style event in rural Vinton, a voter asked how she planned to transition to Medicare for All, and Warren focused on her funding plan instead of answering the question (her white paper says she will roll out a transition plan in the coming weeks), touting her claims that it would eliminate $11 trillion in Americans' out-of-pocket medical expenses over the next decade.
Warren's rise has drawn fierce attacks from candidates who want to be seen as a moderate alternative to her, but her health care funding plan has also provided fodder for Sanders to ding her after months of an apparent nonaggression pact between the two liberals.
At his own event in Cedar Rapids Saturday, he seemed to draw a distinction between Warren's promise of free health care without a middle-class tax increase, and his own idea, which he said would levy a 4 percent income tax.
“I'm not going to say it's free," Sanders said. “Nothing is free. Health care's expensive."
He made more pointed comments in an interview with ABC News, saying his approach “will be much more progressive in terms of protecting the financial well-being of middle-income families."
Warren's campaign has pointed out that her plan cuts costs for families at the expense of the wealthiest Americans and corporations. But on Sunday, Warren declined to take the bait, saying simply, “Bernie may have a different vision of how to pay for it, but let's be really clear, Bernie and I are headed in exactly the same direction."
But the issue has put her on the defensive and could distract from her core message at a time when Buttigieg and Sanders are gaining support in Iowa polls. Several voters interviewed at Warren's campaign events said they were trying to decide between her and either — or both — of them.
“I feel safer with him sometimes," said Elise Crow, a lawyer from Cedar Rapids, of Buttigieg, but she said Warren was persuasive too. “You need the numbers and you need the excitement, so I'm more open to it."

Couple's tale shows need for health plan

Texto completo: In today's Tribune on Page C1, photojournalist Mike McCleary recounts the sad ordeal of Doug and Carol Dworshak of Mandan. Doug Dworshak has heart-related problems and she injured her back in an accident. Because of mounting medical bills and the inability to work, they lost their home to foreclosure.
They were a hardworking couple -- he had been working since he was 15 -- who became overwhelmed by medical bills. They aren't alone -- more than one-fourth of Americans have difficulty paying their medical bills, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation and the New York Times. The figures are from 2016.
A 2018 survey by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit private foundation, found more than half its respondents, more than 21 million people, endured tough financial situations related to medical expenses despite having health insurance.
This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. The health care crisis in this country has been an issue for years. President Barack Obama's attempt for a solution, the Affordable Care Act, hasn't healed the division on the issue in this nation. President Donald Trump and Congress have been at odds over the ACA since Trump's election.
What the Dworshaks' dire situation illustrates is the impact on many Americans and the need for more affordable health care. The Dworshaks worked hard, but the costs of raising a family, buying food, paying for a home and vehicles and more had them living from paycheck to paycheck.
When unexpected medical bills occurred, it left Doug Dworshak, 61, and Carol Dworshak, 60, in a financial hole they couldn't crawl their way out of. Nearing retirement, they found themselves back to square one.
Situations like this could have been avoided if the government had reached agreement on a reasonable national health care plan. Instead, our political leaders allowed partisan politics to derail an agreement, and that resulted in continued political bickering. The ACA passed because Democrats controlled Congress, but the measure lacked the bipartisan support needed to gain public support. It's also a flawed piece of legislation.
So Americans like the Dworshaks fall through the cracks. Yes, there are programs to help people in these situations, but they are often too late. Affordable health care could help people from tumbling into a system that leads to foreclosure and other dire consequences.
The Dworshak case also should serve as a reminder to people to start saving and planning for the future at an early age. Parents can start the process by saving for college, establishing saving accounts for their children and even setting them up with life insurance. It's not too early in high school for young people to start saving and planning.
The Dworshaks should be looking forward to retirement; instead, they have to rebuild their lives. It's not their fault that health issues derailed them. They tried to do things right.
Until our nation's leaders develop a health care safety net, others will fall into the same spiral of debt and loss the Dworshaks are facing. That's unfortunate, and the solution is long overdue.

Twilight of the Bro Bibles?

Texto completo: The boys' club of glossy publishing confronts an identity crisis.
Imagine if Kodak had answered the threat of digital photography by pivoting from film to outdoor grills.
Imagine if Blockbuster had taken on the challenge from Netflix by shifting from DVDs to fast food.
Imagine if men's magazines stared down the post-#MeToo manpocalypse by disowning men.
Maybe the last one isn't so hypothetical?
At a time when calls are growing for the Oscars, Tonys and Emmys to follow the Grammys and the MTV Video Music Awards in erasing gendered categories, and to do away with gender-specific magazines, bro bibles like GQ, Esquire and Playboy seem poised to do a backpedal of Michael Jackson moonwalk proportions from the formula that kept them perched at the publishing pinnacle for a half-century.
Namely, being a print version of your father, offering up bourbon-breathed tutorials on the arts of tie knotting, fly casting, and skirt chasing.
In the gender tornado of 2019, men's magazines, it seems, are canceling themselves. (The internet's assault on glossy print isn't helping either.)
"How do you make a so-called men's magazine in the thick of what has justifiably become the Shut Up and Listen moment?" wrote Will Welch, the editor of GQ, in a cri de coeur introduction to this month's "New Masculinity" issue. "One way we've addressed it," he continued, "is by making a magazine that isn't really trying to be exclusively for or about men at all.
So gender fluid it's soggy, the 128-page issue might well have been themed "No Masculinity," with its androgynous cover image of Pharrell Williams looking like an inverted tulip in a floor-length yellow Moncler Pierpaolo Piccioli coat, followed by ruminations on the "weaponized" male body by Thomas Page McBee, a transgender writer and boxer; a defense of makeup for men by EJ Johnson, Magic Johnson's son whose fashion tastes run toward fur shawls and diamond chokers; and a debunking of the power of testosterone itself by Katrina Karkazis, a cultural anthropologist and author.
Such untraditional content is a survival strategy for glossies with a Y chromosome tilt in this homo novus era, where every reference to masculinity wears an implied "toxic" like a hair shirt.
Even Playboy, mired in identity crisis since dial-up modems, is suddenly woke.
The magazine has rechristened its Bunnies as "brand ambassadors," and even embarked on a short-lived experiment to cut out the nudes. After the death of its founder Hugh Hefner in 2017, Playboy has morphed into an art-book quarterly that ditched its old tee-hee-hee motto, "Entertainment for Men," for a gender-blinkered "Entertainment for All."
It's an open question whether the men who now turn to Pornhub and its ilk for the kind of "entertainment" that Playboy built an empire on even noticed.
Even so, the magazine, which long held up Hef, with his phallic-symbol pipe and star-studded skin romps at the Playboy Mansion, as the epitome of American straight male aspiration, is turning the brand's hyper-male, hyper-hetero legacy on its head.
The magazine's new leadership team consists of a gay man (the executive editor Shane Singh) and two women (the creative director Erica Loewy and Anna Wilson, who is in charge of photography and multimedia), all millennials.
Recent feature articles include profiles of Andrea Drummer, a female African-American chef who runs a cannabis-centric restaurant in Los Angeles, and King Princess, a genderqueer pop singer who is as a symbol of self-acceptance to young L.G.B.T.Q. fans.
For a cover image this summer, the team commissioned the fine-art photographer Ed Freeman (a rare man who still shoots for Playboy, though he is gay) for an arty underwater shot featuring three featuring female activists for causes like ocean conservation and H.I.V. awareness.
"The water," Mr. Singh explained to Jessica Bennett of The New York Times for an article in August, "is meant to represent gender and sexual fluidity."
Change is also afoot at Esquire, the tweediest of the men's titles, which for decades carried a whiff of dad's old cedar chest full of pocketknives and Mickey Mantle baseball cards.
This past June, the magazine installed its second editor, Michael Sebastian, in three years. Mr. Sebastian, 39, made his name as Esquire's digital director, where he oversaw a significant rise in traffic to the site, according to Hearst.
His appointment as editor prompted industry speculation that he was going to go "full Cosmo," chasing Instagram-friendly content and trending topics on Twitter just like Cosmopolitan, Esquire's sister publication at Hearst that has lately been pursuing data as hotly as it long proselytized multiple orgasms.
The move seemed symbolic. Mr. Sebastian replaced Jay Fielden, a dapper Texan given to Hemingway and Cifonelli suits, who had departed weeks before, citing the lure of new (and unspecified) possibilities. Mr. Fielden had vowed to revive the "literary charisma" of the magazine of Fitzgerald and Dos Passos. He may have fit the image of the "Esquire man" too well for the times.
In one of his first interviews after he got the job, Mr. Sebastian took a swipe at the publishing patriarchy, telling The Wall Street Journal that he wanted to get away from the idea "that both the Esquire reader and writer is a middle-age white guy who likes brown liquor and brown leather."
In fairness to Mr. Fielden, he said pretty much the same thing years ago, before Harvey Weinstein and his ilk sent half the population to the penalty box. "There's no cigar smoke wafting through the pages," he said to The New York Times in 2017, "and the obligatory three B's are gone, too -- brown liquor, boxing and bullfighting."
As the same article reported, Mr. Fielden had won the job in part because he courted more male readers to the traditionally feminine Town & Country, the Hearst title he headed before Esquire.
At Esquire, he vowed to lure more female readers and ditched boys' club staples like the print version of the "Women We Love" issue.
Apparently, it was not enough. Could anything be? Perhaps not, as manhood itself is being interrogated, scrutinized and radically revised.
The very idea of a men's magazine now sounds "as hopelessly passé as a private gentlemen's club," according to a recent article, "The End of Men's Magazines," in City Journal, which is not exactly a progressive organ (the magazine is published by the Manhattan Institute, a free-market think tank).
Maybe. Or maybe not.
Details is done. Maxim has evolved its identity from a frat-house must-read to a cosmopolitan lifestyle magazine, an about-face that began under a female editor and fashion veteran, Kate Lanphear, who departed in 2015.
But Esquire has already survived the Great Depression, World War II, disco, yuppies and the dot-com bust. It's still here.
And plenty of readers are still here, too, even in a brutal publishing climate that has forced august women's titles like Glamour, Seventeen, Self, and Redbook to retreat from print for the web.
Despite a plunge in newsstand sales that has plagued the whole industry, Esquire still had an estimated total average circulation of 709,000 for the first six months of this year, according to the Alliance for Audited Media; the figure accounts for both print and digital subscriptions as well as single-copy sales.
GQ, too, is a long, long way from life support, with a figure of 934,000 for the same period, according to the alliance.
Times change, sometimes violently. But recent history is full of apparent anachronisms (gas guzzlers, Birkenstocks, Donald Trump) that managed an unlikely second act. And men's magazines have proven pretty adept at sniffing out the shifts in culture, both trivial and seismic, over the decades -- which is one reason they have been around for decades.
Esquire may have swaggered into the 1960s as the Don Draper of magazines, but as the old order began to crumble thanks to Betty Friedan, the Black Panthers and many others, the magazine's editor, Harold Hayes, quickly detoured into a flower-power-era version of woke.
He commissioned Susan Sontag's dispatch from Hanoi at the height of the Vietnam War, and James Baldwin's ruminations on race in America after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Even Playboy opened its pages to thought-provoking interviews with Eldridge Cleaver, Malcolm X and Fidel Castro while sprinkling in at least a few pictorials featuring Playmates of color.
Yes, that was a different time. We've come a long way from Gloria Steinem decrying "The Moral Disarmament of Betty Coed" thanks to the Pill in Esquire in 1962, to Hannah Gadsby, a lesbian comedian, taking aim at "hypermasculine man-babies" in GQ's "New Masculinity" issue.

'Baseball-crazed' D.C. went wild in 1924, too

Texto completo: In the 12th inning of Game 7 of the 1924 World Series, Washington Senators outfielder Earl McNeely hit a one-out groundball that bounced over New York Giants third baseman Freddie Lindstrom's head. Muddy Ruel scored the winning run on the play, which gave the District its first World Series title and touched off a raucous celebration at Griffith Stadium and throughout the city.
"The whirlwind of joy which swept over Washington yesterday immediately after Earl McNeely had driven in the run that made the Nationals world champions continued to rage until well after midnight," The Washington Post reported. "It subsided then only because a baseball-crazed city had yelled itself hoarse and stopped from sheer exhaustion."
The Post described the spontaneous celebration as "an armistice day and mardi gras blended into one."
The report stated: "It was the thrilling outburst of a city's joy which knew no bounds. It was wonderful. Every one of the more than 400,000 men, women and children who make Washington their home took part in the celebration. Every noise-making device that hands could reach was used to produce a mighty din that continued unchecked for hours."
In other words, it was a larger-scale version of the celebration that took place Wednesday night in and around Nationals Park, after the Nationals won the city's second World Series title with a Game 7 victory over the Astros in Houston.
"Street scenes in the downtown section defy description," The Post reported in 1924. "It seemed that the entire population and 100,000 automobiles were jammed into the few blocks between Pennsylvania avenue, F street and Ninth and Fifteenth streets. They pushed aimlessly up and down the thoroughfares, shouting and yelling the greatest acclaim ever given a baseball team. At times it seemed that there were such jams of humanity that they would never untangle. But there would be a break some place and the swirling mass would move on to the accompaniment of honking horns, bursting torpedoes, cutouts, back-fires and the shrill of screams of a delirious fandom."
More from the day after: "The cup of joy had bubbled over and the whole town was drunk with happiness. . . . The carnival spirit held full sway. How could anyone be angry at anything? Surely if a young man wanted to say something nice to a pretty girl, certainly the mere fact that he didn't know her never entered his mind. And, for that matter, it didn't enter her mind, either. Washington had won and that's all anybody cared about."
John Loughney, the 38-year-old local actor who went viral last month for answering "Since today!" when asked by a TV reporter how long he had been a Nationals fan, would have fit right in at the 1924 celebration.
"The demonstration was by no means confined to baseball fans," The Post wrote. "Many who yelled with the others had never seen a ball game. But they, too, sensed that a great victory had been won and they wanted to have a part in its celebration."
The Post wasn't the only newspaper to cover the scene.
"Thousands are trampling the streets in the wildest celebration ever seen in baseball," the New York Times marveled. "From the White House to the Capitol the clamor rises. The streets are full of jostling, joy-crazed citizens blowing horns, manipulating rattlers, firing pistols and making a din that can be heard for miles. On the banks of the Potomac there is bedlam and madness tonight. All the pent-up enthusiasm of a baseball-crazy city is being loosened. With the tension off, the world serene and peaceful again, all the capital is giving itself over to the delirium of thankfulness."
On Saturday afternoon, the 2019 Nationals was feted with a parade down Constitution Avenue, just like the Washington Capitals were after their Stanley Cup championship last year. While 100,000 people turned out to celebrate the Senators capturing the American League pennant in 1924, there was no such parade after the team's World Series triumph, partly because several players left town immediately. The defending champion Senators' home opener in 1925 featured extra-festive pregame ceremonies.
"The District commissioners had planned an official observance but abandoned the idea when they learned the Nationals were abandoning Washington," The Post reported after the World Series. "It is thought better to put off the official congratulation because a prearranged and dignified affair would seem at a zephyr of gratitude and praise after the typhoon of adulation into which the city was vortexed Friday night."
President Coolidge addressed the team at the pennant-winning parade, a celebration that began when hundreds of cheering fans greeted the Senators at Union Station and ended with a banquet at the Occidental hotel.
"By bringing the baseball pennant to Washington, you have made the national capital more truly the center of worthy and honorable national aspirations," Coolidge said.
"The staid old Capital City went wild yesterday when the triumphant Nationals came marching home with Washington's first baseball championship," The Post reported after the Senators clinched the pennant Sept. 29. "Shrieking its acclaim, the city capitulated unconditionally to the little band of heroes, the sight of whom transformed the dignified Capital into a veritable asylum of men and women crazed with the taste of victory after so many dreary years of oblivion in the national pastime."

Heisler: Warriors just went from dynasty to expansion team

Texto completo: Farewell, little dynasty.
That splat you heard was the the Warriors, who dominated the NBA the past five seasons as it went from marginally profitable to immensely wealthy, hitting the pavement like an egg dropped from space.
Of course, it’s still way early to write them off, as TNT’s Charles Barkley did, predicting they wouldn’t even make the playoffs … at halftime of their opener … or, at least it was until Steph Curry broke his hand in the fourth game.
There’s now a common theme in Warriors stories
Will they tank?
Shouldn’t they tank?
Are they tanking?
Isn’t it timely that they lost Curry, removing the temptation to claw into the playoffs so they can tank … as owner Joe Lacob seemed to suggest to The Athletic (“Potentially, there’s a silver lining in all of this, who knows?”)
Not that the Warriors may have a choice with all of last spring’s nine rotation players, and all three of their Big Three, out or gone for the duration: Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook.
That left Draymond Green, who hurt just his left index finger, and Kevon Looney, who’s out with a pulled hamstring.
Things started off challenging with Las Vegas setting their over-under at 47 wins, No. 6 or 7 in the West.
Then, unfortunately for the Warriors, the season started.
Game 1: In the opening of the new Chase Center, the Clippers beat them by 19 points, after leading by 31.
Thompson, recovering from knee surgery, goes on with TNT at halftime, airs his hopes … and has Barkley inform him to his face they won’t make the playoffs.
As if agreeing, Coach Steve Kerr notes, “This is not a one-off. This is the reality. There are going to be nights like this this year.”
Game 2: Showing Kerr was right, they lose by 28 in Oklahoma City … after trailing by 41 … to the Thunder, a 1-4 team going into this weekend.
Game 3: Win in New Orleans!
Game 4: Lose by 11 in Phoenix … after trailing by 33.
In the very bad, awful, no good, worst possible news, Curry breaks his left hand early in the third quarter with the Warriors down by 29.
Game 5: Back home, lose to Spurs by 17 … after trailing by 25.
They now start Green, D’Angelo Russell, Glenn Robinson, Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Jordan Poole, looking more like an expansion team than a dynasty.
This isn’t just a fall. This is the end of the pride of the NBA.
The Warriors didn’t invent the modern offense, spacing the floor with three-point shooters. That was Mike D’Antoni in coaching stints at Phoenix, New York and Houston.
Nevertheless, it was Steph, Klay & Co. who took it and ran with it, popularizing an approach that had always been anathema, expressed by the mantra, “Live by the jump shot, die by the jump shot.”
With their unprecedented firepower came a coincidence of personalities that made the Warriors a delight for the press and lured KD as a free agent in 2016: the personable Kerr … the sweet-tempered Curry, everyone’s favorite … the unaffected Thompson … the trash-talking, stand-up guy, Green.
“To me, they speak not just to the modern NBA, but to the unique place that sports can have in society,” said Commissioner Adam Silver before the season.
“And it’s not just the spirit they bring to the game on the floor, but, I think, the spirit they bring as citizens and to their participation in their community.”
The ascent was symbolized by the $1.4 billion Chase Center they built in San Francisco with money they raised privately, leaving the boondocks of the East Bay.
With personal seat licenses estimated at $18,000 each, revenue is projected to zoom from last season’s $400 million that was already ahead of the Lakers’ $398 million, according to Forbes, to $700 million … ahead of every team in every U.S. league except the Dallas Cowboys.
This is a new reality, indeed. The Lakers, long the NBA’s richest team, used to wish there was no salary cap so they could spend whatever they wanted. Now they can thank their lucky stars there is one
(Giannis Antetokuonmpo, anyone? He’s not free until 2021 but the big teams are eyeing him in all they do.)
The Warriors cherished the fact they were all in this together, but it was no longer true.
Things began unraveling last fall when Green argued with Durant, who had spurned an extension to sign for one year, signaling his intention to become a free agent.
“We won without you,” snapped Green, according to Yahoo’s Chris Haaynes. “We don’t need you. Leave.”
Dray and KD made up, insisting it was behind them in countless interviews … until last week when Durant, now in Brooklyn, acknowledged the blowup had been a factor in his decision to leave (“I mean, your teammate talked to you that way, you think about it. … Definitely, for sure. I’m not going to lie about it.”)
Nevertheless, the Warriors clung to their illusions to the bitter end when Durant went down in Game 5 of the Finals.
GM Bob Myers choked back tears in the interview room. Teammates were glum, despite having just won to cut the Raptors’ lead to 3-2.
If KD wanted most of all to be loved, it looked like the outpouring of grief might persuade him to stay.
Instead, he signed with the Nets to play alongside Kyrie Irving, who is already reportedly showing the mood swings in Brooklyn that he had in Cleveland and Boston.
Of course, the Warriors will try to put Humpy Dumpty back together next season, but they’re not the kids they were when they won the first of their three titles in 2015.
Curry, 31, was averaging 20 points and 2.3 threes, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 30 and 5.1 … as Kerr noted they can’t just turn Steph loose, a la James Harden (“That kind of basketball wears you out, especially for a guy who’s 180 pounds like Steph is.”)
With all those shot attempts and points gone, Green, 29, is averaging a pale 9.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 0.0 blocks, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 14-10-7 with 1.4 blocks.
Thompson, 30, may be coming off a missed season.
You can’t say they didn’t enjoy the journey. In 2015 after winning their first title, Lacob told the New York Times, “We’re light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we’re going to go about things. We’re going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.”
So they were, but “a long time” is over, the Warriors just learned.

Rival Democrats take aim at 'college town' mayor Pete Buttigieg in Iowa

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa —⁠ Pete Buttigieg's Democratic presidential rivals took turns trying to portray him as a small-town mayor as the 37-year-old surges in Iowa.
At the Iowa Democratic Party's fall fundraiser on Friday night, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet compared the size of the budget he managed as Denver Public Schools superintendent to the budget Buttigieg oversaw as mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
"I want to talk to you not as a senator, but as the only superintendent of schools who has ever run for president of the United States," Bennet said. "I worked for the kids of the Denver Public Schools before I went to the Senate. It’s a school district that’s got about a billion-dollar budget. For reference, that's about three times the size of a certain municipality in the state of Indiana. I’m just saying."
When speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the state party's Liberty and Justice Celebration, Bennet insisted he wasn't implying Buttigieg was ill-prepared to be president.
"But I do think there's a huge difference between running a city where it takes 8,000 votes to get elected mayor and running the Denver public schools or getting elected twice in a statewide election," he said.
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock piled on when asked by reporters about Buttigieg's rise in the first-in-the-nation state, pulling ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden in a New York Times/Siena College Iowa poll released Friday. He trails only Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
“He got 9,000 votes in a college town that last voted for a Republican for mayor in 1964. So from the perspective of being able to win back those places that we lost, I don't know that he has it and, by the same token, from the perspective of what it will take to pick up the pieces afterwards," Bullock said.
Buttigieg has irked his some of his competitors by taking shots at them after calling on the historically crowded field to stop deploying Republican talking points against each other. Before the October debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke pushed back at Buttigieg for criticizing their gun policy positions and using the term "gun confiscation."
“Calling buyback programs 'confiscation' is doing the NRA's work for them, @PeteButtigieg — and they don't need our help,” Booker tweeted.
Warren, another candidate enjoying momentum in the Democratic race for the White House, didn't escape scrutiny from her rivals at the Friday night's gathering.
While many hit Warren for her proposal to pay for "Medicare for all," Kamala Harris, her senatorial colleague from California, took a veiled swipe at her corporate legal work.
"I have spent my career as a prosecutor. I’ve only had one client in my entire life, and that has been the people. Unlike other people, unlike others, I have never represented a corporation. I have never represented a special interest," she said.
Harris told reporters on Saturday her statement was more about her own legal career as a former San Francisco district attorney and two-term California attorney general.
"I mean there are, I think, probably at least half-a-dozen people in the race who have worked for corporations or in the private sector," she said at Des Moines NAACP's Economic Freedom Presidential Town Hall.

Texto completo: “Correr es mi vida, me hace sentir libre”, afirma con sencillez Guillermo Piñeda Morales, maratonista de 46 años que actualmente se ubica entre los 10 corredores más rápidos del mundo en su grupo etario.
Contrario a la mayoría, “Memo” no se promociona en las redes sociales, no va a gimnasios costosos ni usa cronómetros complicados. Entrena en el parque y se chequea el pulso tocando su propio cuello con sus dedos.
Nativo de Santa Ana Coatepec ( Puebla ), a los 15 años cruzó la frontera indocumentado hacia EEUU. “Vine a trabajar”, dijo.
Laboró en cocinas y como mensajero en bicicleta. Hoy trabaja en el mantenimiento de un edificio en Rego Parks (Queens).
En 1995 corrió su primer maratón y al año siguiente, cuando fue arrestado por estar indocumentado , pensó que todo había terminado y sería deportado. Pero logró pagar una multa y el juez le dio una oportunidad, que concretó con la ayuda de un abogado de inmigración.
En 2005 pudo naturalizarse, lo que a la larga le permitió convertirse en el 2do estadounidense más rápido en su grupo de edad, tras registrar 2:28:42 en el maratón de Boston, en abril de este año.
Sería el primero en México, pero prefiere representar a EEUU, en agradecimiento, afirmó al diario The New York Times.
Sus claves son dos muy puntuales: trabajar duro y nunca rendirse. Este domingo, correrá el Maratón de Nueva York, con el # 477, y así puede ser ubicado en la aplicación oficial de la competencia.
This is Memo. Memo runs fast — like, top 10 in his age group fast. But, he doesn't need any #Fitspo. He only needs two things: Hard work, and never giving up. https://t.co/hYeNf0m3Sx pic.twitter.com/Fxurvp6EMb

Texto completo: WASHINGTON >> A graphically violent parody video, shown at a meeting of President Donald Trump's supporters at his Miami resort, depicted a likeness of the president shooting and stabbing his opponents and members of the news media in a church, The New York Times reported Sunday.
In the video, Trump's critics and media members are portrayed as parishioners fleeing his gruesome rampage. The fake Trump strikes the late Sen. John McCain in the neck, hits and stabs TV personality Rosie O'Donnell in the face, lights Sen. Bernie Sanders' head on fire and shoots or otherwise assaults people whose faces are replaced with news organization logos.
The video was shown last week at an American Priority conference at Trump's Doral Miami resort, the newspaper said. Trump was not there. Event organizer Alex Phillips told the Times the video was played as part of a "meme exhibit" and was not associated with or endorsed by the conference "in any official capacity." "American Priority rejects all political violence," he said, and is looking into the matter.
The video includes the logo for Trump's 2020 campaign but Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for the re-election organization, told the Times the "video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence."
The setting for the massacre is the "Church of Fake News," capturing Trump's familiar refrain about news stories and organizations that he considers to be fake news.
In the video, Trump's face is superimposed on a killer's body as he shoots people in the face and otherwise assaults them.
Among the targets: former President Barack Obama, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Rep. Adam Schiff, who as Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is leading the impeachment inquiry of Trump.
CNN, The Washington Post, BBC, PBS, NBC and Politico are among the news organizations depicted as victims of the fake Trump's violent fury.
The White House declined immediate comment.

Texto completo: Varias calles son cerradas anualmente durante el Maratón de Nueva York, el más popular del mundo, que atraviesa los cinco condados hasta por lo menos la media tarde del domingo.
Adicionalmente este año, la anunciada visita del mandatario Donald Trump mañana sábado a la ciudad, quedándose hasta el domingo, perfilan una complicación aún mayor en el tráfico de autos y buses.
Trump tiene previsto asistir a una pelea en Madison Square Garden el sábado, según el diario New York Times.
Cada visita suya genera cierre de calles para desplegar su comitiva y controlar posibles protestas. La de mañana será su primera estancia en Nueva York, su ciudad natal, tras anunciar anoche que, al término de su gobierno, se mudará a Florida, alegando que los políticos locales “me han tratado muy mal”.
Durante el maratón de NYC, que se celebra el primer domingo de noviembre y coincide con la entrada del horario invernal, muchas rutas de autobuses son canceladas o redireccionadas y algunas accesos al Metro son cerrados, para garantizar la seguridad de los corredores y de los miles de seguidores que los siguen desde las calles.
En Manhattan, las zonas más restringidas el domingo serán el Upper East Side, Central Park South y West, incluyendo los accesos a la Torres Trump de la 5ta Avenida.
Como es tradición, NYPD ha anunciado su estrategia de seguridad tras la reciente muerte del líder del grupo Estado Islámico (ISIS), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi durante una redada en Siria; y además las recurrentes balaceras causadas por civiles estadounidenses, aprovechando grandes concentraciones y la venta libre de armas y municiones en muchas regiones del país.
La información más actualizada sobre el transporte posible puede consultarse aquí.
Weekend Plans: Trump is tentatively scheduled to go to NYC to attend an MMA event at Madison Square Garden on Sat night, per sources.
Stay over at Trump Tower.
Great news for traffic on NYC Marathon Sunday.

An Open Letter to Mark Zuckerberg

Texto completo: Facebook isn't defending free speech, it's assaulting truth.
Mark,
In 2010, I wrote "The Social Network" and I know you wish I hadn't. You protested that the film was inaccurate and that Hollywood didn't understand that some people build things just for the sake of building them. (We do understand that -- we do it every day.)
I didn't push back on your public accusation that the movie was a lie because I'd had my say in the theaters, but you and I both know that the screenplay was vetted to within an inch of its life by a team of studio lawyers with one client and one goal: Don't get sued by Mark Zuckerberg.
It was hard not to feel the irony while I was reading excerpts from your recent speech at Georgetown University, in which you defended -- on free speech grounds -- Facebook's practice of posting demonstrably false ads from political candidates. I admire your deep belief in free speech. I get a lot of use out of the First Amendment. Most important, it's a bedrock of our democracy and it needs to be kept strong.
But this can't possibly be the outcome you and I want, to have crazy lies pumped into the water supply that corrupt the most important decisions we make together. Lies that have a very real and incredibly dangerous effect on our elections and our lives and our children's lives.
Don't say Larry Flynt. Not even Larry Flynt would say Larry Flynt. This isn't the same as pornography, which people don't rely upon for information. Last year, over 40 percent of Americans said they got news from Facebook. Of course the problem could be solved by those people going to a different news source, or you could decide to make Facebook a reliable source of public information.
The tagline on the artwork for "The Social Network" read, in 2010, "You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies." That number sounds quaint just nine years later because one-third of the planet uses your website now.
And right now, on your website, is an ad claiming that Joe Biden gave the Ukrainian attorney general a billion dollars not to investigate his son. Every square inch of that is a lie and it's under your logo. That's not defending free speech, Mark, that's assaulting truth.
You and I want speech protections to make sure no one gets imprisoned or killed for saying or writing something unpopular, not to ensure that lies have unfettered access to the American electorate.
Even after the screenplay for "The Social Network" satisfied the standards of Sony's legal department, we sent the script -- as promised over a handshake -- to a group of senior lieutenants at your company and invited them to give notes. (I was asked if I would change the name of Harvard University to something else and if Facebook had to be called Facebook.)
After we'd shot the movie, we arranged a private screening of an early cut for your chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Ms. Sandberg stood up in the middle of the screening, turned to the producers who were standing in the back of the room, and said, "How can you do this to a kid?" (You were 26 years old at the time, but all right, I get it.)
I hope your C.O.O. walks into your office, leans in (as she suggested we do in her best selling book), and says, "How can we do this to tens of millions of kids? Are we really going to run an ad that claims Kamala Harris ran dog fights out of the basement of a pizza place while Elizabeth Warren destroyed evidence that climate change is a hoax and the deep state sold meth to Rashida Tlaib and Colin Kaepernick?"
The law hasn't been written yet -- yet -- that holds carriers of user-generated internet content responsible for the user-generated content they carry, just like movie studios, television networks and book, magazine and newspaper publishers. Ask Peter Thiel, who funded a series of lawsuits against Gawker, including an invasion of privacy suit that bankrupted the site and forced it to close down. (You should have Mr. Thiel's number in your phone because he was an early investor in Facebook.)
Most people don't have the resources to employ a battalion of fact checkers. Nonetheless, while you were testifying before a congressional committee two weeks ago, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked you the following: "Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?" Then, when she pushed you further, asking you if Facebook would or would not take down lies, you answered, "Congresswoman, in most cases, in a democracy, I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves."
Now you tell me. If I'd known you felt that way, I'd have had the Winklevoss twins invent Facebook.

Credit Trump for raid that killed al-Baghdadi

Texto completo: President Trump deserves credit for ordering the operation that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It was a high-risk mission that required U.S. forces to fly hundreds of miles into al-Qaida-controlled territory to storm a heavily armed terrorist compound. If things had gone horribly wrong, Trump would have been blamed and borne the consequences. Just ask Jimmy Carter how the Desert One disaster affected his reelection. Trump knew the political risks but gave the order to go anyway.
Would Joe Biden have done the same? Unlikely.
The former vice president advised Barack Obama not to carry out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. As Mark Bowden, author of "The Finish: The Killing of Osama bin Laden," explained in 2012, "The only major dissenters were Biden and (then-Defense Secretary Robert) Gates, and before the raid was launched, Gates would change his mind." During a meeting in the Situation Room, Biden later recalled, Obama turned to him and asked, "Joe, what do you think?" Biden answered, "Mr. President, my suggestion is don't go." Worse, his reason had nothing to do with national security. According to Bowden, Biden told the president that "if the effort failed, Obama could say goodbye to a second term." At the moment America had the man responsible for the 9/11 attacks in her sights, Biden was worried about politics, the absolute last thing a commander in chief should be thinking about in such circumstances. In the end, Bowden writes, "every one of the president's top advisers except Biden was in favor of immediate action."
Yet, rather than praise Trump for ordering the killing of al-Baghdadi, Biden blasted the president, declaring the raid succeeded "despite his ineptitude as commander in chief." The man who opposed the bin Laden operation criticizes the man who approved the al-Baghdadi operation? That's rich. And it was the Obama-Biden administration's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 that allowed the Islamic State to rise from the ashes of defeat and build a caliphate the size of Britain. Talk about ineptitude.
Obama's rejection of Biden's advice not to go after bin Laden does not absolve Obama of criticism for his broader policy in the fight against terrorism. After the bin Laden operation, many pointed out the irony that Obama's signature national security accomplishment was made possible by information gained from the CIA interrogation program that he had shut down on his third day in office. As former acting CIA director Mike Morrell has explained, the key piece of intelligence that led the CIA to bin Laden -- information on bin Laden's principal courier, including his nickname Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti -- came from detainees in CIA custody.
Similarly, Trump's bold decision to go forward with the al-Baghdadi operation does not absolve him of criticism for his Syria policy. The fact is, taking out the Islamic State leader would not have been possible without the U.S. boots on the ground that Trump has announced he is withdrawing, or without the help of the Kurdish allies whom Trump is abandoning. It was the Kurds who cultivated the source inside al-Baghdadi's inner circle who gave us actionable intelligence about his location. So, the Kurds not only took 11,000 casualties in the fight to drive the Islamic State from its physical caliphate, but they also gave us the critical lead that led us to al-Baghdadi's doorstep. It's fair to ask whether the same operation would have been possible six months from now thanks to Trump's drawdown and betrayal of the Kurds.
Our Kurdish allies deserve better. And we still need them. According to a Pentagon inspector general's report, even before Trump's most recent withdrawal announcement, the Islamic State was "resurging in Syria." It has between 14,000 and 18,000 members, as well as about 3,000 foreign fighters under arms in Syria and Iraq. The New York Times reports that before Trump's decision to greenlight Turkey's invasion, Kurdish forces were conducting as many as a dozen counterterrorism missions a day, but now those have ceased. The Kurds were also guarding about 10,000 captured Islamic State fighters, including about 2,000 foreign fighters. Now, according to the State Department, more than 100 of those detainees have escaped and "we do not know where they are."
And while the loss of al-Baghdadi is a major blow, the Islamic State has survived similar blows before. Thanks to Trump, al-Baghdadi is dead. But the Islamic State is not. We still need to keep a boot on its neck, and that requires boots on the ground -- and allies such as the Kurds.

Texto completo: CHESAPEAKE - Chesapeake's trick-or-treat law won't stop haunting the city.
The community is in the national spotlight again for its decades-old law that threatened teenage trick-or-treaters with a fine and/or jail time for up to six months. But even after changing the 1970 ordinance last March, city staff continues to receive calls and emails berating them for being a "Communist city and dictatorship," said Mayor Rick West.
The rule, which previously had an age cap of 12, was changed to allow trick-or-treaters up to 14 years old to collect candy until 8 p.m. But for anyone older than that, it's still a class 4 misdemeanor, and a max fine of $250 - the lowest criminal penalty in Virginia. There's no jail time, though.
West said he now thinks the council should have scrapped the law.
"Looking back on it, I would have preferred that we repeal the ordinance rather than revise (it)," he said. "I just don't think it's necessary. We haven't had any problems in 40 years, and there are all kinds of rules and laws out there that would give the police ample opportunity to act if there was a problem."
Four decades ago, the ordinance was created because a firecracker was thrown into a trick-or-treater's bag.
So far this year, The New York Times, CNN, USA Today, National Review magazine and even Reuters in London have reached out to the city for an update on the story that quickly spread on social media.
Last year, Jimmy Kimmel shot a sketch with actor Fred Willard, who portrayed a fictional Chesapeake police sergeant, poking fun at the law.
Around 50 emails and a few calls from residents all over the U.S., Mexico and the United Kingdom have come in so far this year. None of them are local, West said.
"It's not as viral as it was last time. It's a little easier. Some of these emails are nasty," he said, adding that he received about six this year.
Many have compared Chesapeake to a "dictatorship" and "overbearing government."
Some have stated that all city staff should be fired.
Chesapeake started getting calls and emails from national and international media outlets again this year because the story is "sensational," said city spokesman Heath Covey.
"To be honest with you, I would rather they would focus on important things and not a 48-year-old ordinance that's never seen anybody being arrested," he said. "In the grand scheme of things, there are much more important things that people in the media and people on social media should be focusing on."
Although less emails and social media messages have come in, Covey said misinformation is rampant and the city has been referred to with a "dramatic variety of profanity and name-calling."
"Either they're misinformed or they disagree with the way the ordinance reads," he said. "But they don't seem to have any knowledge of the reality that it's never been an ordinance that's been enforced. We've never arrested or fined anybody."
West said many old ordinances, such as where residents should park horses, are rarely revisited and modified.
"We didn't even know we had it on the books. ..." West said. "Very rarely do we clean up what's out there because it doesn't come into play. Once it does, it's very embarrassing."
He said he doesn't "have a clue" why the story has gained national attention again this year.
"I'm definitely hoping it doesn't come up next year," he said.
"I hope we decide there's no such thing as Halloween."

Texto completo: In a lawsuit, a former senior vice president claims that he was fired for raising safety concerns and that the company's C.E.O. said customers are "drunk and vaping" and wouldn't notice the quality of the pods.
A former top executive of Juul is alleging that the e-cigarette giant sold at least one million contaminated mint-flavored nicotine pods -- and refused to recall them when told about the problem in March.
In a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday, Siddharth Breja, who was senior vice president for global finance, claims he was fired on March 21 in retaliation for whistle-blowing and objecting to the shipment of the contaminated and expired pods and other illegal and unsafe conduct that "has jeopardized and continues to jeopardize public health and safety and the lives of millions of consumers, many of them children and teens."
Mr. Breja detailed a culture of indifference to safety and quality-control issues among top executives at the company and quoted the then-chief executive Kevin Burns saying at a meeting in February: "Half our customers are drunk and vaping" and wouldn't "notice the quality of our pods."
Mr. Burns, who left the company in September, issued a statement Wednesday afternoon strongly disputing the quote. "I never said this, or anything remotely close to this, period," the statement said. "As CEO, I had the company make huge investments in product quality, and the facts will show this claim is absolutely false and pure fiction."
The lawsuit was first reported by BuzzFeed News.
Ted Kwong, a Juul spokesman, dismissed Mr. Breja's claims as baseless.
"He was terminated in March 2019 because he failed to demonstrate the leadership qualities needed in his role," Mr. Kwong said. "The allegations concerning safety issues with Juul products are equally meritless, and we already investigated the underlying manufacturing issue and determined the product met all applicable specifications."
This lawsuit is only the latest in a growing series of cases against Juul being filed around the country by school districts and individuals. Earlier this month a federal judicial panel gathered together the far-flung cases before Judge William H. Orrick in the Northern District of California in San Francisco, who will oversee them. The claims typically focus on personal injury for vaping-related illnesses or false marketing. The panel estimated that there are about 50 lawsuits so far.
Mr. Breja's lawsuit did not specify what the contaminant in the nicotine pods was. The allegations detail that the shipment of tainted mint-flavored pods resulted from a series of decisions by Juul that created a huge demand for that flavor.
In November 2018, Juul, under scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration, announced it would no longer sell its teen-friendly flavored pods in retail stores, making them available only online. But while Juul moved its dessert flavors off the shelves, it continues to sell menthol and mint in retail stores. Mr. Breja alleged that with popular flavors like mango and creme no longer readily accessible, customers began embracing menthol and mint with fervor, so much so that demand outstripped supply.
Mr. Breja said in the legal complaint that Mr. Burns, whom he characterized as behaving like an autocratic "king," pressured suppliers to hurriedly come up with more mint-flavored product. Mr. Burns, he said, also exhorted employees, saying, "You need to have an IQ of 5 to know that when customers don't find mango they buy mint."
In March, Mr. Breja said he learned that batches of pods flavored with mint-flavored liquid and nicotine had been contaminated and that 250,000 "Mint Refill Kits," the equivalent of one million pods, had been shipped and were being sold by retailers.
Juul did not recall the pods, Mr. Breja said, yet he was told to charge the supplier, Alternative Liquids Inc., $ 7 million so that Juul could recover from the contaminated batches. The supplier was not reachable for comment.
Mr. Breja said he urged Juul's chief financial officer to issue either a recall or put out product safety warnings. A week later, the complaint says, Mr. Breja was fired.
Erika A. Kelton, a lawyer at Phillips and Cohen, a Washington-based firm that represents whistle-blowers but is not representing Mr. Breja, said that although the allegations are cast as a wrongful termination case, they are likely to get the attention of regulators. "These contamination allegations are headline-grabbing, and I'd expect both federal and state regulators will investigate because they are of such grave public concern," she said.
Juul is already under investigation by numerous government offices, among them: the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, five state attorneys general and several congressional committees.
They have ordered Juul to turn over reams of internal documents, and the F.D.A., among others, has complained that the records do not appear complete. Mr. Breja's case may offer a clue to their frustration.
He also claims that after the F.D.A. raided Juul headquarters in October 2018, seeking internal documents, Mr. Burns instructed Mr. Breja and other executives not to put anything relating to regulatory or safety issues in writing, so that the F.D.A. could not get them in the future.

NBC's Digital Journalists Say They Will Unionize

Texto completo: Employees of NBC's digital news division announced on Wednesday that they intend to form a union representing about 150 workers, saying it would allow them to fight for better job protections as well as publicly criticize NBC News executives without fear of retaliation.
Leaders of the network's news division have come under renewed scrutiny this month with the publication of Ronan Farrow's "Catch and Kill." In the book, the author paints a damning portrait of the NBC News chairman Andrew Lack and the division president Noah Oppenheim, accusing leadership of interfering with his reporting on Harvey Weinstein and mishandling the allegations against the former "Today" anchor Matt Lauer, who was fired in 2017.
Last week, Rachel Maddow, the highest-rated anchor on MSNBC, confronted her bosses live on air as part of an episode that had Mr. Farrow as a guest, questioning their handling of his reporting when he was a contributor to the network. She also raised the issue of why NBCUniversal had not commissioned an independent review of Mr. Lauer's workplace behavior and the company's response to it.
The digital employees seeking to form a union referred to the internal strife in a letter to NBC management that noted "serious questions" on how the news division has handled workplace sexual misconduct and its "opaque" procedures for "exposing powerful predators."
It continued: "Forming a union will afford us a collective voice in decisions that will benefit the entire company, providing much-needed transparency and ensuring a safer workplace."
In a memo to NBC staff members on Wednesday, Chris Berend, the executive vice president of digital at the network's news division, said, "I want you to know we are deeply committed to a fair and healthy workplace for all our employees. We welcome this dialogue from within our digital organization, and any constructive conversation aimed at building the future of NBC News Digital and ensuring that we're the best we can be."
The workers involved in the organizing campaign write articles and produce videos for several websites, including NBCNews.com and Today.com. They said they hoped to win a number of concessions, including eliminating pay disparities between white men and women and minorities, an improved severance policy, better job protections and more guidance about the company's long-term plans for the digital division.
They also want to speak publicly, without concern for their job security, about controversies at the news division. Being part of a union, they say, would allow them to go public with criticisms of their bosses.
"It's been painful for a lot of people to see headlines and feel like they don't have the space to talk about what's going on in their own workplace," said Nigel Chiwaya, a data journalist who is involved in the organizing campaign.
Mr. Farrow reported on Mr. Weinstein for up to seven months for NBC. Mr. Farrow said that he was told by his bosses on several occasions to stop reporting. Mr. Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, said his story was not ready for broadcast because it did not include any of Mr. Weinstein's accusers on the record, a point the reporter has disputed.
As a result of the impasse, Mr. Farrow took his reporting to The New Yorker. Less than two months later, he published the first of his articles on Mr. Weinstein that would win the Pulitzer Prize in public service.
On Nov. 29, 2017, the network fired Mr. Lauer after receiving a complaint of sexual misconduct against him. In a memo to the staff, Mr. Lack wrote, "While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he's been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident."
Christine Nguyen, an online video producer involved in the organizing campaign, who joined the network the month before Mr. Lauer's firing, said, "I remember the feeling from employees was that management wasn't telling the truth."
Several months later, NBC Universal released the findings of an investigation that absolved its news executives. "We found no evidence indicating that any NBC News or 'Today' show leadership, News H.R. or others in positions of authority in the News Division received any complaints about Lauer's workplace behavior prior to Nov. 27, 2017," the report said.
The publication of Mr. Farrow's book -- with its step-by-step account of what he went through while reporting the Weinstein story at NBC News and its new details concerning accusations against Mr. Lauer -- gave new life to the complaints that had begun in 2017.
"It felt like a reiteration of, 'This is why we decided to do this,"' said Becky Bratu, a social media producer for the NBC website Left Field.
Leaders of the union campaign said the company's response to the allegations against Mr. Lauer prompted them to talk with colleagues about general workplace problems. As workers on separate teams started to speak with one another, they found that they shared concerns about job security, scheduling and pay.
They circulated a spreadsheet in which staffers anonymously disclosed salaries, job titles and years of experience, which appeared to reveal disparities between white men and people of color and women performing similar jobs. The network has told digital employees it does not believe that diversity is a problem in their division.
NBC Universal has several thousand union employees, though in the newsroom it covers mostly production and technical personnel, such as camera operators. Digital workers at most other networks are not unionized, although there are exceptions, including people working at CBS's digital news streaming service.
Earlier this year, NBC managers held discussions with employees about what they could improve, which workers saw as a response to the organizing effort. That was followed by changes that many employees welcomed, including an additional week of vacation for newer workers.
The changes only validated the decision to organize, many employees said, showing that acting as a group could lead to improved working conditions. A large majority of eligible digital employees have signed on to the union effort, those involved in the campaign said.
Mr. Oppenheim met with digital employees on Oct. 10. During the meeting, the NBC News president was asked whether the network would release the script of the Weinstein story that Mr. Farrow had submitted. Mr. Oppenheim suggested he was reluctant to release the script, because it contained unsupported assertions. That answer did not sit well with some digital employees.
"You have Ronan Farrow taking this story to The New Yorker where it gets published two months later as a print story," Ms. Bratu said. "We are technically the outlet for all of that at NBC News. None of our editors were looped into the editing."
Ms. Nguyen and others also expressed frustration that Mr. Lack had largely disappeared from view since the excerpts from Mr. Farrow's book started to circulate, pointing to his recent absences from three Monday afternoon editorial meetings that he typically attends.
The workers have chosen as their bargaining representative the NewsGuild of New York, which also represents employees at The New York Times, The New Yorker and several digital properties, including BuzzFeed.
They may be in for a fight. This week, NBC informed about 10 digital employees eligible for the union that they would be laid off, effective January. At the same time, the network has said that it will add another 60 or so digital employees, meaning that the staff will include a large number of people who were not around during the time of dissension.

Grubhub's Fees For Nondelivery Spark Backlash In New York

Texto completo: More than 30 members of the Council sent a letter to Grubhub criticizing it for charging restaurant owners for phone calls that never led to orders.
The food-delivery giant Grubhub is having a difficult week: disappointing quarterly earnings, a declining share price, even talk of growing skepticism among investors about the broader food delivery market.
Now the company also faces an angry New York City Council.
On Wednesday, more than 30 members of the Council sent a letter to Grubhub's chief executive, Matt Maloney, calling for him to hire a third-party company to evaluate complaints that Grubhub has charged restaurants for phone calls that never resulted in orders.
"A refund must be issued for any phone call fees that did not yield a sale," said the letter, a copy of which was shared with The New York Times. "In the event that you do not take corrective actions, we will explore potential legislative solutions."
Katie Norris, a spokeswoman for Grubhub, said the company is "happy to have an open, working dialogue with the New York City Council" about how to connect consumers to local restaurants, "including improving our phone order process."
The letter marks an escalation of the Council's monthslong investigation into the increasingly popular app-based food delivery market, which has come under scrutiny for the high fees restaurants must pay to be listed on the online platforms.
In June, the Council's small-business committee held a four-hour-long hearing in which restaurant owners decried the steep commissions -- which usually range from 15 to 30 percent -- that Grubhub and other food-delivery services charge on every order.
Over the last few months, the chair of the small business committee, Mark Gjonaj, has said repeatedly that he might introduce legislation to regulate the fees that the food-delivery companies charge.
But the letter was the first time that a majority of the 51-member City Council has made a unified statement raising the prospect of legislation to address Grubhub's practice of charging fees for phone calls without verifying that the calls generated orders.
Although most customers place delivery orders by tapping their smartphone screens, Grubhub allows its users to make phone calls on the app, and Yelp listings often include a Grubhub number alongside a restaurant's direct line. Grubhub uses an algorithm to determine whether calls resulted in orders, charging restaurants based on a range of factors, including the length of the call.
But that formula is far from perfect: In recent months, restaurants have reported paying hundreds of dollars in fees for calls in which customers simply inquired about a menu item or requested a reservation. In December, Tiffin, a chain of Indian restaurants in Philadelphia, sued Grubhub, claiming that for at least seven years the company had charged restaurants on its platform for calls that did not lead to orders.
In August, Grubhub pledged to refund restaurants that could show they were charged erroneously and doubled the time it gives them to review recordings of calls, from 60 to 120 days.
"Four months is more than enough time for a restaurant to review every call they receive via our platform," said Ms. Norris, the Grubhub spokeswoman, adding that the company is "mindful of consumer privacy concerns from keeping this data for longer."
But restaurant owners have protested that the extended window does not go back far enough and unfairly puts the onus on small businesses to spend hours reviewing the calls. The Council's letters calls for Grubhub to hire a company to audit the full history of phone orders placed at restaurants using its platform.
"Owners do not have the time and the wherewithal to listen in to every phone call that was placed," Mr. Gjonaj said. "It was a calculated move on behalf of Grubhub knowing that small businesses would not be looking at their statements carefully."
Mr. Gjonaj declined to say when legislation on food delivery might be proposed or what form it could take. But in the coming months, the Council plans to hold more hearings on food delivery, according to someone familiar with the body's plans.
Local legislation regulating commissions, phone fees or some other aspect of the on-demand food delivery economy could pose a serious threat to Grubhub. New York is one of the company's top-performing American markets, as well as the birthplace of its popular Seamless brand. Across the country, Grubhub has been losing market share to its three main rivals -- UberEats, Postmates and DoorDash.
And even as online food delivery becomes increasingly popular with consumers, investors stung by the recent struggles of start-ups like Uber, Lyft and WeWork are growing skeptical about the prospects of the food delivery services. On Tuesday, Grubhub's stock price plunged by more than 40 percent after it reported sales figures that fell short of analysts' projections.
The company also lowered its expectations for the fourth quarter, blaming its slowing growth on "promiscuous" diners who are being lured away by the other apps.
Much of the criticism that Grubhub has faced in New York also applies to those other delivery apps, whose tipping policies for the gig workers who transport food have proved controversial as well. The companies have long argued that their platforms expose restaurants to new customers, allowing small businesses to tap into a network of tens of millions of online users and to benefit from the advertising muscle of multi-billion-dollar companies.
But in recent months, restaurant owners everywhere from San Francisco to Mumbai have rejected that narrative, arguing that delivery services have cannibalized their existing customers, as people who used to dine out now order through the apps.

Texto completo: President Trump’s former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley asserted that today’s divisive political climate is becoming “a choice between citizenship and victimhood.”
“When we retreat into identity and grievance politics, we make the choice for victimhood over citizenship. By constantly blaming others, we reject personal responsibility for ourselves, our families, and our communities,” Haley said Tuesday night at the American Enterprise Institute gala in Washington.
“This choice of victimhood takes us further away from our exceptionalism,” she said.
Haley, 47, accused Democrats of attacking the history of America as a “lie” when they argue “America was founded not in freedom, but in oppression.”
“Some are attempting to redefine American citizenship itself,” she said. “Ronald Reagan once asked Americans to choose between being citizens or subjects. It was the Sixties. Government and liberalism were on the march. The question fit the times.
“Today, we face a different choice. It is a choice between citizenship and victimhood. Our politics is becoming a contest over who’s got the biggest grievance. Who’s getting the short end of the stick. Who’s being taken advantage of by a rigged system.”

Haley also addressed the anonymous senior Trump administration official who wrote a scathing op-ed about the president in the New York Times last year and has a book coming out next month detailing “the danger he poses.” Haley, who has denied writing the op-ed, said there were others in the administration who undermined Trump.
“When I was in the administration, I served alongside colleagues who believed that the best thing to do for America was to undermine and obstruct the president. Some wrote about it anonymously in the New York Times. Others just did it. They sincerely believed they were doing the right thing. I sincerely believed they weren’t,” Haley said.
She then condemned those officials, saying they are “not free” to push their personal agendas because Trump “was the choice of the people, in accordance with our founding charter.”
“No policy disagreement with him, no matter how heartfelt, justifies undermining the lawful authority that is vested in his office by the Constitution,” she said. “What’s at stake is not President Trump’s policies. What’s at stake is the Constitution.”

Haley served as the governor of South Carolina before she moved to New York to serve in the Trump administration. She resigned from her role as a diplomat in late 2018.
Haley has since joined the Boeing Co. board, returned to a nonprofit she created to address education in rural parts of South Carolina, and launched a policy group. Her book, With All Due Respect: Defending America with Grit and Grace, is set to be published in November.

Impeachment is a power grab by Washington's establishment and it has nothing to do with Trump's character or the Constitution

Texto completo: Everything about the national media’s framing of the impeachment effort is aimed at convincing the public of the laughable notion that this is about doing what’s morally right and wrong.
It’s not. It’s about a naked power grab by an established order in Washington that feels threatened by another four years of a president who doesn’t do things their way.
If Trump were accused of picking any Democrat at random and asking that a foreign government make up a lie implicating them in some crime or corruption, then impeachment might be a moral imperative. But that’s not what he did, and that’s why this cooked up controversy over his call with Ukraine has been impossible to understand from the beginning.
It doesn’t make it easier to wrap your mind around it when the media refuse to talk about the most important issues. Ukraine is rife with corruption; the country’s government interfered in the 2016 election for the explicit purpose of hurting Trump’s campaign; former Vice President Joe Biden knew there was something wrong with his son’s strangely lucrative business dealings with Ukrainian gas company Burisma.
The public hears about these things in passing, if at all. What we hear about around the clock are vague accusations of a “quid pro quo” and “abuse of power.” We hear for sure about how patriotic and honorable career government employees are offering testimony. But, coincidentally, we hear next to nothing about the incredibly fishy story involving Ukraine’s government and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is now locked up in prison.
Trump specifically talked with the leader of Ukraine and not, say, Jamaica, because while nothing out of the ordinary is going on with Jamaica, some very suspicious — and, yes, corrupt — things have happened with Ukraine.
Trump specifically brought up Joe Biden in that conversation and not, say, Elizabeth Warren, because Warren has done nothing related to that country, whereas suspicious and likely corrupt things have occurred relating to with Biden and his son Hunter.
To see it from the national media’s perspective is to put yourself in the shoes of someone who believes Washington was a paradise of patriots and clean government before Trump got there. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote Tuesday what could be taken as a parody of that view, except that he's serious.
“I’m talking about a president willing to sink to banana republic governing norms, including withholding aid to Ukraine to compel its leadership to investigate his political rival,” wrote Friedman, who apparently believes that banana republic governments distribute foreign aid. “I’m talking about Republican lawmakers who know that the president’s Ukraine machinations are indefensible and impeachable…In attacking all the diplomats, intelligence officers and civil servants who have stepped forward, at great professional risk, to bear witness against Trump, they are attacking the people who uphold the regulations — and provide the independent research and facts — that make our government legitimate and the envy of people all over the world, where many people have to bribe government workers for service."
Friedman must really love visiting the DMV and dealing with the IRS.
Government employees have risked nothing for having “stepped forward.” They legitimately have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Ask James Comey (book deal); Andrew McCabe (CNN contract); Sally Yates (liberal hero); Ned Price (MSNBC contract) and on and on.
This impeachment isn’t about the Constitution. It’s not about the character of our president. It’s not about moral imperatives.
It’s about a permanent order in Washington that doesn’t want four more years of discomfort.

Texto completo: There is burying the lead and then there is tucking in a world leader.
Remember that time then-President Barack Obama explained basketball to David Cameron (then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom)in 2012 while attending the NCAA basketball tournament at the University of Dayton?
Well, there’s more to that story.
As Cameron explains in his recently released memoir “For the Record (HarperCollins, $40), ” Obama extended extreme hospitality to the British politician following the basketball game, Cameron’s first.

Below is an excerpt taken from a tweet by Jonathan Martin, a New York Times national political correspondent.
Some Twitter users joked that Martin buried the lead in his tweet.
The passage about being tucked in reads:
“Traveling back on Air Force One, I was beginning to flag (tire). It was about 3 a.m. UK time. ‘Why don’t you use my bed?” Obama asked. He opened a door at the front of the plane, to reveal a double bed in its nose. As I leaned back on it, he proceeded to tuck me in with a blanket... ‘ I bet Roosevelt never did this for Churchill,’” he said.
The book was the first time Cameron relayed the story.

Some news I’ve been waiting to share for a couple of days....
But now’s the time @David_Cameron included a reference to going w Obama to the play-in game in his memoir: pic.twitter.com/IICzOz9fb1
— Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) October 28, 2019
Cameron told the story at a business award ceremony a week after the trip to Dayton, according to the Telegraph.
He reportedly said:
“So I duly did and Barack went to the back of the plane and explained to my private secretary and the team, he said ‘Don’t worry, the British Prime Minister is fine, I’ve just tucked him up in bed’.”

Texto completo: ALBANY - A brewing ballot battle is growing bitter as Gov. Cuomo offered support Tuesday to a proposal that could spell the end of the line for minor political organizations such as the Working Families Party.
New York State Democratic Party boss Jay Jacobs, appointed by the governor to a panel tasked with creating a public campaign finance system, recently floated the possibility that the commission could up the number of votes needed to grab a spot on a ballot - from 50,000 to 250,000.
The idea drew heat from critics, including Dem presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and kudos from Cuomo.
The governor said he sees the reasoning behind the potential change, arguing that a taxpayer-funded matching funds program would be overburdened by crowded ballots.
"You do have some clear issues, if you have seven political parties in the state and you go to public-finance it, which is the goal, you could potentially be financing 1,000 candidates per election cycle," he said. "The public could be financing 1,000 races. Which is obviously politically and economically not feasible."
Critics contend Jacobs' pitch, first reported by The New York Times, is unnecessary and simply the latest Cuomo-orchestrated attempt to use the public campaign financing commission to cripple his political rivals. The governor and the union-fueled Working Families Party have sparred ever since the group endorsed his Democratic primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, last year before ultimately placing his name on their line in the general election.
Warren, whose White House bid is backed by the WFP, called the latest broadside "deeply undemocratic."
"This proposal comes from, of all places, a commission meant to improve our democracy," she tweeted. "But attacking the @NYWFP is deeply undemocratic - and it will only benefit Republicans. No Democrat should allow this to pass."
Jacobs (inset above) confirmed to the Daily News that the commission will be looking at raising the threshold and countered Warren with a play on her own catchphrase.
"I disagree with her - and I have a plan for that!" he said, but did not elaborate.
State GOP Chairman Nick Langworthy, testifying Tuesday before the panel during a public hearing in Buffalo, painted the governor as a puppet-master pulling the strings behind the scenes.
"This is Cuomo's attempt to legally fix elections, and he put the fox in charge of the hen house," he said referring to Jacobs. "As is often the case with Cuomo, he corrupts the so-called anti-corruption tool."
Cuomo (inset below) and Democratic leaders in the Legislature have faced scrutiny from all sides since failing to hammer out a public finance system during the legislative session and instead inserting language in the state budget creating the commission.
Critics and good-government groups are concerned that the broad authority given to the nine-member task force will lead to a watered-down matching funds program and allow its members to do away with fusion voting, which enables candidates to run on multiple ballot lines.
The Working Families Party and the right-wing Conservative Party have filed lawsuits challenging the power of the panel.
Cuomo on Tuesday brushed off concerns about the controversies surrounding the commission. "This is politics on steroids, and everyone has their own politics and they are trying to maximize their political advantage and disadvantage their opponent," he said.
The recommendations of the commission will become law unless legislators return to Albany for a special session within 20 days of its final report, which is slated to be released the day before Thanksgiving.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The New York Times recently visited two prisons in northeastern Syria where former Islamic State fighters and residents of ISIS-held territory are being detained. Ivor Prickett, a photographer based in the Middle East, and Ben Hubbard, the Beirut bureau chief for The Times, documented the conditions and interviewed prisoners, some of whom were young boys, for an article that recently ran on the front page of The Times.
The prisons are part of a network run by Kurdish-led forces that holds more than 10,000 men captured in battles with ISIS, whose status is now uncertain.
Mr. Prickett's images and videos show men, many seriously wounded and emaciated, dressed in bright orange jumpsuits and packed into tight quarters on the floor. Other images show young boys, some smiling and some not, jostling to be photographed.
Mr. Prickett reflected on what it was like to step inside the prisons and capture what he saw. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.
How were you able to get access to these prisons?
It is really difficult. But the Kurdish authorities really want this story to be told, so the world will help them deal with this massive problem. But they don't just let anyone go in. The situation is getting worse for them, and they're losing their grip on power, and they are worried about this problem getting worse.
What are the concerns of the Kurdish authorities?
They're worried that the prisoners in their care are either going to break out, because of the fighting that's going on, or they're going to fall into the wrong hands. That has heightened the whole issue.
How would you describe your work?
I've been based in the Middle East, and covered the Middle East, for the past eight years. I'm a photojournalist. I cover conflict, but I also do a lot of work around conflict and the aftermath of conflict and the humanitarian consequences of war.
What was it like to first step into the prisons?
It was really shocking. It was really surreal.
What felt surreal?
I have never seen a room of so much human suffering. It is always a surreal moment to be inside a prison, but this was on a different level altogether. Not only were these guys locked up, but a lot of them were really badly injured and near death.
When did you feel like you could pick up your camera and start to photograph?
We had to work pretty quickly because we knew our time there was going to be limited. So I started taking pictures pretty quickly. In those situations, it's about making yourself very obvious and giving people the option to be photographed.
What do you hope viewers take away from these images?
It was really shocking for us to discover that kids were there. That was not something we expected to find. So, that became the story more than anything. Regardless of what you think about a man or a woman who joined ISIS, these kids were really young, and had no choice in the matter.
You took a picture of a group of young men facing the camera. Can you talk a little bit about the image?
That picture is kind of an unconventional picture for me. A picture where the kids are standing for me, waiting to have their picture taken, is not something I would usually even submit to my editors. I kind of took it for them, in a way, because they were joking around with us and asking me to take pictures. And so I said, "O.K., back up, back up." I showed it to them afterward and they went nuts.
I didn't think it was going to be a particularly strong picture. But when I looked at it afterward, I realized that they looked so young and normal in that picture. That was what got me, and that's why I think it's really powerful. It's a really conflicted image. They're innocent young boys tarred with these orange jumpsuits.
Each young man has a very distinct expression.
I think that's nice. In photojournalism we rarely give people the chance to present themselves how they want to be seen. It's a pretty unconventional picture for me to take and for us to use. But it ended up saying so much more than some of the other pictures I had.

Texto completo: A high school student says she should not have to worry about air quality or whether her power will be shut off.
To the Editor:
Re California Fires: Live Updates (nytimes.com, Oct. 29):
I live less than two hours south of the Kincade fire. The air is heavy with smoke, and we are told not to go outside. Countless people from the high school I attend have lost power, and I know many others who have been evacuated from their homes.
Is this the new normal? There seems always to be a fire burning in California. Last year, during the Camp Fire, my school canceled classes, which was unheard of at the time. We were given the impression that there would never be a fire of that severity again. And yet, here we are; nothing has changed.
I'm 16. I should not have to worry about the air quality or whether my power will be shut off. And no one should fear that his or her home might burn down. More preventive measures must be taken to prevent future fires, so that we never have to experience this again.

Texto completo: As a White House national security official prepared to give damaging testimony in the House impeachment inquiry Tuesday, President Trump and some of his allies immediately began a push to attack the integrity and patriotism of the decorated Iraq War veteran.
Former congressman and Trump surrogate Sean P. Duffy said Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman had "an affinity for Ukraine" over the United States because it was his birthplace. Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani joined in with the suggestion on Twitter that Vindman was "advising two gov's," an apparent reference to dual loyalties.
And Trump himself attacked Vindman as a political opponent: "Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call 'concerned' today's Never Trumper witness," the president tweeted Tuesday. "Was he on the same call that I was? Can't be possible!"
But for many Republican lawmakers, the moves to discredit Vindman's character were a bridge too far - suggesting that the escalating attacks on the witnesses testifying about Trump's alleged misconduct may have a limit.
"We're talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who have put their lives on the line," said Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). "It's shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in that process."
The competing messages reflect internal tensions among many Republicans as they seek to balance defending Trump with upholding some of their long-standing principles.
While Trump has pushed for GOP lawmakers to "get tougher and fight," he has embraced scorched-earth rhetoric that some in his party have struggled to defend. Over the past month, Trump has compared impeachment to a "lynching," described his GOP critics as "human scum," called for the unmasking of a federally protected whistleblower and accused administration officials testifying against him of being unpatriotic, or worse.
As his attacks have escalated, the Republican response has been disjointed, with loyalists embracing offensive terms such as "lynching" and others distancing themselves from the harsh language and tactics.
On Tuesday, Trump's campaign to brand his opponents as part of a "Deep State" cabal of government officials working against him ran headlong into the biography of Vindman, who fled the Soviet Union with his family as a child and who received a Purple Heart after being injured by a roadside bomb in Iraq.
Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, found himself in the president's crosshairs as he prepared to tell Congress that he was concerned that Trump had sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate Democrats. While his testimony was the latest in a string of damaging revelations by Trump administration officials, the effort by some Republicans to discredit him based on his birthplace created another fault line in the GOP's impeachment response.
Speaking on Fox News on Monday, former George W. Bush administration official John Yoo said he found it "astounding" that Vindman had reportedly been speaking with Ukrainian officials who sought guidance on how to deal with the Trump administration.
"And some people might call that espionage," said Yoo, after host Laura Ingraham said she found the Iraq War veteran's background, language skills and interactions with the Ukrainian government "interesting."
By Tuesday, Yoo was walking back his comment after several elected Republicans said attacking Vindman's loyalty to the United States was inappropriate. Yoo told the Washington Examiner on Tuesday that he was accusing the Ukrainian government of potential espionage, not Vindman.
Duffy, who said on CNN that he did not know if Vindman was putting American interests above Ukrainian interests, also backtracked later Tuesday.
"Lt. Col. Vindman is an American war hero," he wrote on Twitter, adding that he was only trying to highlight that Vindman was "an unelected advisor."
Those retreats came after several elected Republicans admonished some Trump defenders for their willingness to denigrate a veteran.
Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said it was a "mistake" to question Vindman's patriotism.
In his opening statement, which was obtained by The Washington Post, Vindman described himself as a "patriot" and said he thought Trump's push to get Ukrainian officials to launch investigations targeting Democrats was inappropriate.
His testimony added to the growing collection of evidence implicating Trump in an apparent quid pro quo linking military aid or a White House visit for Ukraine to political investigations. It also forced Republican lawmakers to decide whether they would embrace a dual-loyalty smear being pushed by some conservative pundits and right-wing figures seeking to undermine Vindman's account.
While many opted against taking that approach against a decorated veteran, Republicans continue to struggle with defending Trump on the substance of the allegations he faces, said Brendan Buck, who served as counselor to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).
"The ultimate problem is the substance is completely indefensible," he said. "Members can't stomach arguing the merits so you get attacks on credibility and the process."
Trump has already expressed his displeasure with Republicans' process-focused approach, calling for a more robust defense of his dealings with Ukraine.
"So one thing I said, I'd rather go into the details of the case rather than process," Trump told reporters Monday, relaying a conversation with GOP lawmakers.
Defending Trump on the allegations has become increasingly difficult as several members of Trump's administration have effectively testified against him.
Vindman's testimony echoed the opening statement delivered last week by William B. Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Taylor, a Vietnam War veteran and career diplomat, told lawmakers he was alarmed by the White House push for an improper quid pro quo shortly after the Trump administration tapped him to be the top liaison to the Ukrainian government in Kyiv.
Like Vindman, Taylor used his opening statement to stress his bipartisan background and his decades of public service. Few Republican lawmakers have attacked Taylor personally after his testimony, which directly implicated Trump in an improper quid pro quo.
Trump, however, has been more than willing to question whether his critics love the country.
"The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats," Trump said last week after Taylor's testimony rocked Washington. "Watch out for them, they are human scum!"
As some Republicans distanced themselves from that description, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham expanded its meaning in an interview with Fox News.
"The people who are against him and who have been against him and working against him since the day they took office are just that," she said, indicating that the slur applies to all of the president's opponents. "They deserve strong language like that."
While Trump has not attacked Vindman's heritage, many of his most ardent supporters have begun pointing to his Ukrainian background. The charge of dual loyalty - even that Vindman was acting as a "double agent" - quickly gained traction in right-wing corners of the Internet.
The conspiracy theory was advanced by Jack Posobiec, a far-right provocateur known for promoting the "Pizzagate" lie. In a tweet, he falsely claimed that Vindman was working with his "home country" to thwart Trump's agenda. He cited the New York Times as his source, though the notion appeared nowhere in the newspaper's reporting.
The falsehood gained more than 10,000 retweets Tuesday, and the same claim was also repeated word for word by other accounts. Others amplifying the smear against Vindman included Ryan Fournier, the co-chairman of Students for Trump.
Leon Panetta, who served as a defense secretary and CIA director in past Democratic administrations, said the campaign against Vindman amounts to "an attack on what America is all about as a nation of immigrants."
"This combination of a commander in chief who demeans people who served this country, combined with other leaders criticizing those who served the country, are just contributing to an American decline," he said.

Michelle Goldberg: Romney should let his inner Pierre Delecto run free

Texto completo: I’m often incredulous at Republican servility to Donald Trump. I’ve struggled to understand how people who’ve spent a lifetime chest-beating about patriotism can be so willing to burn liberal democracy to the ground to protect a man they wouldn’t trust to sell them a used car. So I’ve tried to envision a situation in which I might be tempted to do the same.
There’s no left-wing analogue to Trump in American life, but it’s possible to imagine such a figure. Picture an amalgam of Marianne Williamson and Hugo Chávez, a charismatic ideologue able to speak to the spiritual hunger of lonely, atomized masses. She enters the Democratic primary to elite mockery, but her rallies are huge and rapturous, and she holds crowds spellbound promising to cleanse America of its demonic legacy of racism and sexism. Her pronouncements are at once shocking and thrilling. She pledges to expropriate investment banks and to turn Mar-a-Lago into a homeless shelter.
At first Democrats freak out — her movement seems like a cult — but she wins the primary, and then the presidency, perhaps with an assist from China. Then she sets about trying to make progressive dreams come true. Stacey Abrams becomes attorney general. Larry Krasner, Philadelphia’s district attorney and an icon of criminal justice reform, replaces Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court. Declaring a national health emergency, the president takes $3.6 billion from the military and gives it to Planned Parenthood. She orders the government not to do business with any company that advertises on Fox News.
It’s obvious to all but true believers that the president is unhinged; there’s an increasingly messianic, Jim Jones quality to the revival-like rallies she presides over. She spends a third of her time at her network of wellness centers, bringing much of the government with her and putting tens of millions of dollars into her family’s company. Conservatives scream that she’s a self-dealing demagogue. Deep down, liberals agree, but they love her appointments and don’t want to be tarred as privileged reactionaries. When the president announces a plan to unilaterally naturalize every DACA recipient, what progressive wants to be the one carping about executive overreach?
I like to hope that in this (admittedly absurd) scenario I would still speak up against corruption and for the rule of law, but I don’t think it would be easy. That’s one reason I’ve come to believe that anti-Trump Republicans — the people Trump called “human scum” last week — deserve more credit than the left typically gives them.
In recent days, as Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has staked out a lonely role as Trump’s most prominent Republican critic, many progressives have rolled their eyes. He’s been widely mocked for the once-secret Twitter account he kept under the pseudonym Pierre Delecto, which he used to like anti-Trump tweets that he’d probably never endorse publicly. Democrats, said a recent NBC News report, “tend to dismiss Romney as ineffectual because he has stopped short of calling for Trump’s impeachment and removal from office.”
Former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who gave up his political career to speak out against Trump, was similarly dismissed. Even ex-Republicans who do call for Trump’s impeachment and removal are regularly pilloried on the left.
I agree with progressives who argue that Trump is the apotheosis of the modern Republican Party, not a departure from it. Everyone who helped build that party bears some responsibility for him. But apostate conservatives also deserve admiration for the sacrifices they’re making. It must be painful to have the movement that’s defined your life turn against you.
“You’re giving up personal relationships, which are some of the most important things psychologically for any human being,” said Jerry Taylor, president of the center-right Niskanen Center, who holds regular meetings of anti-Trump Republicans. “If you spend decades of your life circulating with a certain group of friends and colleagues and associates and business partners and political allies,” it’s no small thing to break with them.
Take George Conway, the conservative lawyer and impeachment supporter married to top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway. Obviously, I’d split with my beloved husband in a second if he backed Trump. But if he worked for a lunatic whose policies I liked ? I’d find it a lot harder to publicly distance myself.
“You have to find entirely new social networks in your life,” said Taylor. “That in a sense is probably the biggest obstacle for a lot of people.”
Those of us who regard Trump as an existential threat to the Republic should try to make it easier for wavering conservatives to make the leap. I don’t mean we should nominate a bland centrist for president, just that we should recognize when people show courage, even if we wished they’d show more.
Last week, I interviewed Harvard professor Erica Chenoweth, an expert on nonviolent social movements, about whether mass protests could create momentum for impeachment. One key, she said, was attracting defectors.
“It’s basically a process where people who would be surprising allies of these calls for impeachment start to appear visibly in support of it,” she said. “That usually indicates that the status quo supporters are starting to shift their sense of what their own interests are.”
People like Romney shouldn’t be jeered for their inner Pierre Delectos. They should be urged to set them free.

Paul Krugman: Our selective deficit hysteria has done significant harm

Texto completo: So the federal budget deficit just hit $1 trillion (actually $984 billion, but close enough). That’s about $300 billion more than the Congressional Budget Office was projecting in the summer of 2017, before the Trump tax cut was enacted. And basically everybody yawned.
Were there fiery speeches in Congress, denouncing fiscal irresponsibility? No. Was there intense media coverage? No — the story was tucked deep inside major newspapers. Was there severe market reaction? No — interest rates are substantially lower than they were before the deficit surge.
This lack of reaction to a deficit that would have been considered shocking only a few years ago is sort of the fiscal policy equivalent of Sherlock Holmes’ dog that didn’t bark in the night. It tells us a lot about economics, politics — specifically the utter hypocrisy of the GOP — and the news media, which on economic matters has a de facto conservative bias.
Start with the economics.
The budget deficit has now soared back roughly to where it was in 2012, when the unemployment rate was more than twice its current level, and the economy desperately needed deficit spending to sustain demand.
Back then, however, the inside-the-Beltway crowd was obsessed with deficit reduction. And it wasn’t just politicians. As Ezra Klein, now the editor of Vox, noted at the time, “the rules of reportorial neutrality don’t apply when it comes to the deficit. On this one issue, reporters are permitted to openly cheer a particular set of highly controversial policy solutions.” And those of us who argued that reducing the deficit shouldn’t be a high priority were treated like freaks.
But the deficit wasn’t a crisis then, and it isn’t one now. In fact, leading economists are now telling us that concerns about government debt have been greatly exaggerated all along. The Very Serious People were completely wrong, and those who opposed austerity have been vindicated.
Of course, while practically everyone in Washington was hyperventilating about debt circa 2012, the most apocalyptic warnings came from Republicans — people like Paul Ryan (remember him?), who declared then, “In this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time.” His pose as the ultimate deficit hawk won him media adulation, which in turn propelled him into becoming speaker of the House.
The truth, however, is that right from the beginning it was obvious that Ryan was a phony. All you had to do was look at the actual content of his budget “plans.” But the media narrative demanded that there be serious, honest Republicans, so that blame for the deficit could be equally divided between the parties; so Ryan was slotted into that role even though he was totally unsuited for the part.
And then, when he and his party got a chance to exercise the fiscal responsibility they declared essential, they blew up the deficit instead. Republicans only pretended to care about debt as an excuse to hobble President Barack Obama and slash social programs. They were and are complete hypocrites when it comes to budgeting (and other things, too, like patriotism, but that’s another topic).
Which brings me to the issue of double standards.
When progressives propose new or expanded social programs, they face intense media scrutiny bordering on harassment over how they intend to pay for these programs. Republicans proposing tax cuts don’t face anything like the same scrutiny; they are seemingly able to get away with blithe assertions that tax cuts will pay for themselves by boosting economic growth, even though every single piece of evidence we have says that this is nonsense.
We’re talking about big numbers here. As I said, the Trump budget blowout, overwhelmingly driven by tax cuts, seems to have raised the deficit by around $300 billion, or around 1.5% of gross domestic product. Over the course of the next decade, that would amount to something like $3.8 trillion — substantially more than, for example, the combined cost of all of Elizabeth Warren’s proposals other than Medicare for All, which we’re still waiting to hear about.
And the truth is that proposals like universal child care are far more likely than tax cuts to repay a significant fraction of their upfront costs, partly by freeing up adults to work, partly by improving the lives of children in ways that will make them more productive adults.
The point is that the media clearly leans conservative in covering budget issues. Progressives face intense grilling over the cost of fairly modest social programs, while conservatives get a virtual free pass on budget-busting tax cuts.
Let me be clear here: I’m not complaining about the lack of panic over our trillion-dollar deficit. We shouldn’t be panicked. The problem is the selectivity of deficit hysteria, which somehow kicks in only when a Democrat is president or progressives propose spending that would make American lives better.
That selective hysteria has done enormous harm. And those who propagate it need to be called out for their bias.

Texto completo: A request to park a food truck outside a federal detention center thrust a small company into the national debate over immigration.
It seemed like a standard request for the Lloyd taco truck, a local favorite in Buffalo. Last week, a building on the outskirts of the city asked the truck to park outside around midday so its employees could have Mexican food for lunch.
But the building in Batavia, N.Y., was a federal detention center run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the hungry workers were mostly ICE employees.
Within hours, the small business, which serves "Tricked Out Nachos" and an "El Camino Bowl," was plunged into the crosshairs of the rancorous national debate over immigration.
Lloyd, which operates four taco trucks in the area, was hit with a barrage of criticism from immigration advocates and left-leaning Buffalo residents, who accused the small business of collaborating with ICE.
That the cuisine was Mexican, the nationality of many of the people subject to stricter immigration policies under President Trump, seemed like additional insult.
The company's owners quickly apologized for agreeing to station a truck outside the detention center, only to find themselves apologizing again shortly after, this time for offending law enforcement.
"We serve all communities, we go to all neighborhoods, we are not political. Why would we be?" one of Lloyd's owners, Pete Cimino, said at a news conference on Monday. "How can any business choose sides in our politically divided country and ever hope to succeed?"
He added: "We make tacos -- not war." The owners did not respond to requests for an interview from The New York Times.
The controversy has stoked divisions in Buffalo, a city that is home to many refugees and immigrants in a largely conservative stretch of upstate New York, and has shown how even small local companies can be lashed by escalating tensions over national policy.
The company first apologized on Thursday for a "lapse in judgment" in sending a truck to the detention center on the previous day and then promised to evaluate all future locations and events to ensure they aligned with its values. Lloyd also pledged to donate the lunch profits to a local immigration advocacy organization.
But that apology sparked a new backlash, as some residents took offense at what they saw as Lloyd's stance against ICE and the values they believe law enforcement agencies espouse.
"In what world does a company feel the need to apologize for serving food to federal law enforcement officers who work in dangerous conditions?" Rob Ortt, a Republican state senator and congressional candidate, said on Twitter. "The men and women who work to enforce our immigration laws and protect us deserve better."
On Monday, Mr. Cimino said his company, which has around 130 employees, does not have a position on federal immigration policies.
But just by appearing to take sides in the immigration debate, the company has already taken a hit: Mr. Cimino said three prearranged visits by a Lloyd food truck were canceled in the last week and its Facebook page had received more than 5,000 heated comments.
"Honestly, we were not prepared for the anger directed at us, it was surprising, and demoralizing," Mr. Cimino said.
Since the Trump administration began implementing its immigration policies, the pressure on companies to reject any link to ICE has grown -- often with success.
Six airlines in the United States said they would not work with the federal government to transport children who were separated from their parents by ICE. Hundreds of employees at companies such as Microsoft and Deloitte Consulting have petitioned their organizations to end their contracts with ICE.
Over the summer, in anticipation of mass ICE raids, several hotel chains, including Marriott International, said they would not allow agents to use their rooms to house detained immigrants, as the agency has done when there is no space in detention facilities.
Small businesses like Lloyd, which cannot usually offer significant support or services to federal agencies, are typically insulated from such pressure.
"It's a shame when small entrepreneurs get embroiled in something they are not giving a lot of thought to, when the big companies -- Google, Facebook, drug companies -- are always involved in this stuff," said Susan McCartney, director of the Small Business Development Center at SUNY Buffalo State.
Still, the pushback could begin to reach a larger swath of companies that work with ICE.
"There is no aspect of immigration detention that can survive without for-profit businesses," said Jennifer Connor, executive director of Justice for Migrant Families of Western New York, an advocacy organization in Buffalo. "I think businesses have to decide what their values are and what kinds of stands they are going to take. There is no not-political stance."

Texto completo: Inyoung You is accused of involuntary manslaughter in the suicide of her college boyfriend, who died on his graduation day.
BOSTON -- A former Boston College student has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the suicide of her college boyfriend on his graduation day, prosecutors announced on Monday.
The charge, announced by Rachael Rollins, the Suffolk County district attorney, bore similarities to the case of Michelle Carter, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2017 for repeatedly urging a close friend in text messages to kill himself.
The former student, Inyoung You, 21, and her boyfriend, Alexander Urtula, 22, were attending Boston College when Mr. Urtula leapt to his death from a parking garage in the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury on May 20. Mr. Urtula's family, from New Jersey, was in Boston that day to watch him appear in the graduation ceremony at 10 a.m. He died about 90 minutes before it began.
In a news conference, Ms. Rollins said Ms. You had been physically, verbally and psychologically abusive to Mr. Urtula over the course of an 18-month relationship, with the abuse becoming more intense and demeaning in the days and hours before his death. She said classmates and family members had observed the abuse, which was also documented in Mr. Urtula's journal and in tens of thousands of text messages. Ms. Rollins said Ms. You urged Mr. Urtula hundreds of times to kill himself, and repeatedly told him that she, his family and the world would be better off without him. Ms. You also used attempts and threats of self-harm to control Mr. Urtula, Ms. Rollins said.
The New York Times was unable to contact a representative for Ms. You on Monday.
Prosecutors said that on the morning of Mr. Urtula's suicide, Ms. You was tracking his location on her phone, as she frequently did, and was present on the roof of the garage at the time that he jumped.
"The indictment alleges Ms. You's behavior was wanton and reckless, and resulted in overwhelming Mr. Urtula's will to live," Ms. Rollins said, "and that she created life-threatening conditions for him that she had a legal duty to alleviate, which, we allege, she failed to do."
"Domestic violence may not always look the same," she added, "but it is always about power and control."
Ms. You, who studied economics and was scheduled to graduate in May 2020, withdrew from classes in August, according to a Boston College spokesman.
She is currently in South Korea, where she is from, Ms. Rollins said. Prosecutors said that a grand jury returned an indictment in the case this month, and that they were working to secure Ms. You's return to the United States.
"We're in contact with somebody who is saying that they're representing her, to see if she will voluntarily return," Ms. Rollins said. "If she does not, we will utilize the power we have to get her back."
In the two months before Mr. Urtula's death, Ms. Rollins said, the couple exchanged more than 75,000 text messages, including more than 47,000 sent by Ms. You.
Asked to compare this case with the case of Ms. Carter, who was 17 when her friend, Conrad Roy III, killed himself, Ms. Rollins said that there were similarities but also significant differences.
Ms. Carter had very limited physical contact with Mr. Roy, but "we have, quite frankly, I would say, the opposite of that," she said. "We have a barrage of a complete and utter attack on this man's very will and conscience and psyche by an individual, to the tune of 47,000 text messages in the two months leading up, and an awareness, we would argue, of his frail state at that point."
The Massachusetts Legislature is considering a bill called "Conrad's Law" that would make it a crime punishable by up to five years in prison to encourage or coerce someone into killing himself or herself.
The Boston College spokesman, Jack Dunn, said Mr. Urtula was a biology major. He had completed his course work in December 2018 and was working as a researcher in New York at the time of his suicide.
"Alexander was a gifted student at Boston College, who was involved in many activities, including the Philippine Society of Boston College," Mr. Dunn said. "We continue to offer our condolences to Alex's family."

Texto completo: The Navy SEAL commando force is the stuff of legend, lionized for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, rescuing an American sea captain from Somali pirates and fighting to the death in the mountains of Afghanistan in the "Lone Survivor" story.
This summer, however, the commander of this vaunted band of war fighters warned about an ethical and professional crisis in the ranks. "We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops.
Two SEALs were accused of killing a U.S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.
And then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.
A combat veteran with the nickname Blade – who said he craved combat and the chance to "kill as many people as possible," according to The New York Times – Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.
The Navy was slow to investigate, and the prosecution's case began falling apart even before trial amid concerns about witness intimidation.
According to The Times report last week, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority "Gallagher effect" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase "Gallagher effect" and decried Green and another top leader as "a bunch of morons."
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture. The commander in chief complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. According to The Times, the Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership. So no action has been taken.
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven – the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid – reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation ... because we try to be the good guys."
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

HOUSE POISED TO PASS VAPING RESTRICTION: The House is expected to pass a bill Monday to restrict online sales of e-cigarettes.
The bipartisan Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act, from Democrat Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Republican Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, would require mail couriers to check people’s IDs when they deliver e-cigarettes and other vapor products.
An adult would need to sign for the package, and there may be different restrictions in states depending on whether it is illegal to sell nicotine to people under the age of 18 or 21.
Proponents of the legislation say that it must pass because government data show more and more teens are vaping, and many of them are getting the devices online or from friends. But the latest outbreak of lung injuries, known as EVALI, are what have catalyzed action that Congress previously eschewed. Vaping has been rising among teens for years, and this isn’t the first time that the legislation has come up. DeLauro first introduced a similar bill in 2015.
It’s not clear yet whether the restrictions would be able to make a dent in the EVALI outbreak that has sickened at least 1,604 people and killed 34, though health officials say it might be starting to level off. The illnesses appear to be linked to THC, the high-inducing chemical in marijuana, and to come from products that were obtained illicitly, sometimes online.
The quick action by Congress, and the fact that the House vote will happen under suspension of the rules, shows how much lawmakers are paying attention to the issue. There’s a companion bill in the Senate from Democrats Dianne Feinstein of California and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, and Republican John Cornyn of Texas.
On top of this, lawmakers have been pressuring the Food and Drug Administration to begin the process of banning flavored e-cigarettes. Right now the agency is up against a major deadline elsewhere: Acting Administrator Dr. Ned Sharpless’ time in the role expires Friday, and President Trump is due to nominate someone to lead the agency.

PUSH TO DELAY THE HEALTH INSURANCE TAX (AGAIN): More than 45 healthcare groups have signed a letter calling for another two-year delay for the Obamacare tax on insurers. The tax was already suspended by Congress in 2017 and 2019, and is set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2020, unless Congress acts. Groups that urged repeal warned it could increase patients’ health costs by up to $20 billion.
WARREN ASKS FOR A ‘LITTLE TIME’ TO FIGURE OUT ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ FINANCING: Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren told a crowd of around 300 people at a South Carolina town hall Saturday that her “Medicare for all” plan, the funding mechanism for which she has yet to release, will not decimate the federal budget. “You don't just get to do what the Republicans did, and that is just blow another hole in the budget,” Warren said. “We actually need to think through this stuff, and I'm there. So, we're going to have a plan on this very soon.”
The big question that Warren has so far refused to answer specifically is whether she will raise taxes on the middle class to foot the bill. Most estimates put the additional cost of the plan to the federal government at about $32 trillion over 10 years. Warren told Saturday’s crowd: “What I'm going to have to do here is I'm going to have to say, give me a little time as we work through this.”
HEALTHCARE FUELED THE LARGEST DEFICIT SINCE 2012: Federal spending increased to $4.45 trillion in fiscal year 2019, contributing to the highest deficit since 2012 at $984 billion. Much of this spending was on government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
HARRIS STUMPS FOR VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT IN SUPPORT OF THIRD-TRIMESTER ABORTION: Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris took a break from the campaign trail to gin up support for Virginia Democrat Kathy Tran, who is running for reelection in the Virginia House of Delegates and believes third-trimester abortion should be easily accessible for women. Harris praised Tran, one of the Virginia legislature’s first Asian-American delegates, for introducing controversial legislation called the Repeal Act, proposing to loosen restrictions on abortions in Virginia. Harris said Sunday: “You know she's taken on huge fights, in particular for the women of Virginia and the families that love them, saying it's not about what's popular at the moment. It's about what's right.” Virginians will head to the polls Nov. 4 to cast their ballots for state delegates.
BIDEN MAY STICK AROUND FOR JUST ONE TERM IN OFFICE BECAUSE OF HIS AGE: If elected president, Joe Biden, 76, may not seek a second term because of his old age. He’s been the subject of some scrutiny about his age and fitness for office, but on Saturday in South Carolina he told the Associated Press: “I feel good, and all I can say is, watch me, you’ll see…It doesn’t mean I would run a second term. I’m not going to make that judgment at this moment.”
Many voters view Biden’s age as a negative, preferring to see a fresh face on the ticket. His supporters, though, consider it an asset. Biden has over four decades of government work under his belt, and says that experience is an advantage to his campaign. “Right now, my age has brought with it a significant amount of experience in government and hopefully wisdom and some sound judgment,” Biden said.
PEDIATRICIANS ADVOCATE FOR WEIGHT LOSS SURGERY FOR KIDS: The American Academy of Pediatricians said Sunday that young people should have access to bariatric surgery meant for severely obese people due to a pediatric obesity “epidemic.” People under 18 with a body mass index above 35 should consider the surgery if lifestyle changes including exercise and diet changes haven’t worked. Dr. Sarah Armstrong, member of the Executive Committee of the AAP Section on Obesity, said: “The last decade of evidence has shown surgery is safe and effective when performed in high-quality centers, with the primary care pediatrician and family in a shared decision-making process. Unfortunately, we see significant disparities in which patients have access to bariatric surgery.”

Texto completo: "This is my life. This is 25 years of my work. Many of these tigers were born here and raised here. To close us down would be a travesty of justice."
Joan Byron-Marasek, 'tiger lady'
One of the more memorable, stranger-than-fiction sagas in New Jersey history began with a sight almost too surreal to believe: a Bengal tiger, roaming through a backyard in Jackson on a brisk January day.
That sighting on Wright Debow Road on the afternoon of Jan. 27, 1999, sparked an eight-hour search through the township that brought upward of 100 state and local officers to the scene.
Police blocked off roadways, contacted the nearby schools to make sure buses wouldn't be dropping off students and worked to prevent onlookers from getting near the scene.
Staff from the nearby Six Flags Great Adventure theme park, all of their safari's tigers accounted for, joined in the search.
Helicopters buzzed overhead and the media descended on the then still-sleepy Ocean County town. The headline in the New York Post the next morning would tell of a "TERRIFYING HUNT IN N.J. WOODS."
After finishing his workday at ecological restoration company the Dawson Corp. on Wright Debow Road around 5:15 p.m. that day, Steve McNamara was walking to his Ford Explorer in the parking lot when he realized he was within 50 feet of something extraordinary.
"A large, four-foot high, eight-foot long orange blur," his how he described it to the Asbury Park Press.
The blur moved a little closer, came into focus, and McNamara was in disbelief.
"I was startled," he said at the time. "I said, 'This can't be true. A tiger can't be sitting in my parking lot.'"
Hours into the search for the big cat — a male measuring more than 9 feet long and weighing 431 pounds — the tiger was spotted by a local woman in the parking lot of a Wright Debow Road business, and came within 20 feet of now-retired Jackson police officer Anthony Senatore.
"When there's no bars between you and a tiger," Senatore said, "yeah, he's pretty big."
Staff from Great Adventure unsuccessfully tried to shoot the tiger with a tranquilizer gun.
With nightfall rapidly approaching, the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, which was in charge of the operation at the scene, made the decision to have the tiger killed.
Using their lights and sirens, police drew the tiger out of the woods. Senatore, armed with a department-issued .308 sniper rifle, and another officer fired.
"I hit him, he fell, he rolled, he got back up, and he went into the woods," Senatore said.
"So now I was dealing with a wounded tiger."
Sniper rifle in hand, Senatore, a tracker and another officer entered the woods to track the animal.
Yet this wild tale was only just beginning.
While a tiger on the loose in Ocean County is certainly notable, the ordeal shined a national spotlight on a reclusive local woman, nicknamed "The Tiger Lady," who had been harboring big cats for decades on her property.
The suspicion and controversy that swirled around Joan Byron-Marasek was covered in the pages of the New York Times, warranted a 2002 New Yorker profile by "The Orchid Thief" author Susan Orlean and even inspired a novelty song (Julie Gold's "Tiger in New Jersey.")
"COPS EYE CAT-LOVIN' 'TIGER LADY' IN JERSEY SCARE," screamed a headline in the New York Post.
Byron-Marasek, reportedly a former circus performer, had housed tigers under a theatrical animal permit at the Tigers Only Preservation Society, an 11.7-acre compound on Route 537 near Allyson Road in Jackson since the mid-1970s.
"I eat, sleep, and breathe tigers," she told the New York Times. "I never take vacations. This is my love, my passion."
For many years, the smattering of homeowners in the area had few issues with her single-minded hobby.
"I've been here 13 years and I have never had a problem with her or her tigers," neighbor Ed Schlechtweg of Berwyn Lane told the Press in the immediate aftermath of the wandering tiger incident.
But by the late '90s, big changes were happening in Jackson — and in Byron-Marasek's neighborhood.
Between 1990 and 2000, the 100-square-mile township's population rose 29 percent to 42,816 residents. Another 12,000 or so people would be living there by 2010.
Emblematic of the town's emerging suburban character was The Preserve, an ironically named subdivision of 31 single-family homes that opened next to Byron-Marasek's property in 1997.
Her new neighbors complained that the compound smelled like a "dirty animal cage." The odor of raw meat was particularly bad in the warm weather, they said.
"We do not want to put up with another summer of this because when it gets 90 degrees-plus, it gets bad," Kevin Wingler, a resident of The Preserve, told the Press in 2002.
"I don't mind her having tigers on her property," Scott Kayser, president of the Quality Express trucking company on Allyson Road, said in 1999. "But you have got to have the proper measures to prevent an escape. ... I'm pretty sure the tiger belongs to her."
Yet the "Tiger Lady" insisted it wasn't.
To this day, it's still not certain the tiger belonged to her.
On the day of the tiger search, school bus driver Barbara Clayton had to take a longer alternate route back to her nearby Wright Debow Road home because of police barricades.
When she finally arrived, she found her her 4-year-old son, Stephen, and her 5-year-old nephew, William, playing in the front yard.
Only later did she learn that the tiger was just an eighth of a mile away.
That's where Senatore, the Jackson cop, and his search party finally tracked the tiger down, near Interstate 195, about a half an hour after wounding it.
"I put another kill shot into him," Senatore said, "and that was it."
The tiger was killed less than a mile from the Tigers Only compound. Yet that wasn't conclusive proof it had come from there.
"It's absolutely not her tiger. I walked around the grounds and couldn't see how a tiger could've got out," her lawyer, Valter H. Must, told reporters days after the tiger was killed, when state game wardens conducted a search of the compound.
"There was no hair, no evidence of a cat moving through the area of containment," Must added. "(Byron-Marasek) said there's absolutely no way a cat could scale a fence of that height."
Municipal officials, however, were convinced. "It's not a hundred percent conclusive, but all indications are the tiger came from her property," then Jackson Mayor William J. Allman told reporters.
"The longest-range possibility (is) someone came from out of state and dropped it off, but that's a pretty far-fetched thing," Allman added.
Months later, in June 1999, state officials announced that DNA hair samples taken from the preserve matched hair taken from the dead tiger. Yet a deputy attorney general would say in court the following year that the state could not definitively prove the tiger was Byron-Marasek's.
Of greater concern for Byron-Marasek was the state's decision not to renew her permit to keep tigers on her property, due to poor condition of the preserve and sloppy record-keeping.
An intense, four-year legal battle ensued.
"This is my life. This is 25 years of my work. Many of these tigers were born here and raised here. To close us down would be a travesty of justice," Byron-Marasek told reporters during a press conference held on her property in 2000.
"We have been here 25 years without a single person being injured. There is not a zoo, circus, or amusement park that can boast of a similar safety record," she said. Her tigers had formed a family unit, she added, and if forced to move and be separated, "most would die from shock and fright."
However, in October 2002, Byron-Marasek's husband, Jan Marasek, suffered head and arm injuries inflicted by one of the tigers. A little more than a year later, in November 2003, after Byron-Marasek lost her final appeal, the state confiscated her 24 tigers and had them transported to the Wild Animal Orphanage in San Antonio, Texas. By August 2004, the Press had reported that at least three healthy cubs had been born to one of the tigers.
Three of the Jackson tigers had been euthanized by then. Two had developed illnesses: Misha, an approximately 5- year-old male, had a brain tumor, while an 8- or 9-year-old female had kidney failure. A third tiger, named Marko, who had injured Byron-Marasek's husband, was put down due to aggressive behavior, the Press reported.
After their arrival in Texas, the tigers were treated for ailments including foot infections, dehydration, stomach parasites and malnutrition, according to the Massachusetts-based International Fund for Animal Welfare, a major backer of the Wild Animal Orphanage.
"The tigers' health has improved greatly since their arrival to our sanctuary," said Carol Asvestas, the preserve's executive director. "They now have proper care and the space they deserve. For most of these animals, it's a happy ending."
But that wasn't the end of the story.
The Wild Animal Orphanage closed in September 2010. The San Antonio Express-News reported in 2011 that the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries had found sanctuaries for the facility's 55 tigers. That total included seven remaining tigers from Jackson.
Four of the tigers were relocated to the Carolina Tiger Rescue in North Carolina, while three went to the Big Cat Rescue in Florida, according to Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries executive director Valerie Taylor.
The last of the Jackson tigers, Max, died in January in North Carolina at the age of 19, Taylor said.
Byron-Marasek lost the Route 537 property via a tax lien foreclosure in 2017, according to public records. The property is currently owned by a Lakewood-based LLC and is on the market for $950,000.
The Press was unable to reach Byron-Marasek for comment.
Senatore, who was assigned to the detective bureau at the time, retired for the force in 2010 after 19 years of service.
John Bergmann, director of the Associated Humane Societies' Popcorn Park Zoo in the Forked River section of Lacey, said there's a clear lesson he hopes people learn from the "Tiger Lady" saga.
"You want a pet, go get a domestic dog or cat," he said. "There's shelters all over the country that are facing (the decision) sometimes to euthanize to animals because (there's) not enough owners or not enough people to adopt them.
"Go get a dog or a cat and let that be your companion."

The tipping system is immoral

Texto completo: For most of my life I've been glad that America is a society that relies heavily on tipping. First, tipping allows us to reward excellent service. Second, in a world of rising economic inequality, a 30% to 50% tip is a small but direct way to redistribute money to those who are working hard to earn a living.
Moreover, tipping nurtures humane relationships. It encourages servers to try to establish social connection through direct eye contact and a display of warmth. Finally, most of the servers I've known like the tipping system. They've believed that by doing their job well they could earn far more than they could through a flat wage. That's certainly what I thought as a bartender.
So overall, I've taken it as good news that tipping culture seems to be spreading to every cashier's counter in the land.
But if you look at the research you find that a lot of it doesn't buttress my priors. In the first place, the amount of a tip is rarely related to the quality of the service. Michael Lynn of Cornell, who is the leading scholar on the subject, finds that the quality of the service has a relatively small effect on tip size.
What matters most is the size of the check. If you want bigger tips, induce your customers to order more. The second thing that matters is the customer. A survey of 40 million Uber trips found that men tip more often than women and people in the middle of the country tip better than people on the coasts. The identity of the customer matters more than the quality of the service.
In short, the meritocratic argument for tipping falls apart. Then there are all the downsides:
Tipping inflames a sexist dynamic. Some men use their tips as leverage to harass female servers. Young blond women are tipped more than older brunettes. Male Uber riders tip female drivers 12% more, but only if they are young.
Tipping inflames a racist dynamic. African American and Latino servers get much smaller tips. In a 2005 study of more than 1,000 tips to taxi drivers in New Haven, Connecticut, black drivers were tipped about a third less than white drivers.
Tipping widens class divisions. Servers who work in upscale restaurants can make good money. Servers who work in diners struggle. The people who work in the front of the restaurant might do well; those who work in the back do not. Many people think the very custom of tipping is a demeaning remnant from the age of aristocracy.
The conclusion from this is that in an ideal world, it would be a good idea to move to the French model: "service compris."
But we live in actual America. In actual America, efforts to eliminate tipping have generally failed. Voters in Maine and Washington, D.C., passed ballot measures to phase out tipping. Both decisions were overturned after protest and confusion. Restaurants that move away from tipping often backtrack.
That's in part because consumers have sticker shock when they see the 20% tip cost included in the menu prices. It's also in part because customers like the tipping experience. If restaurants take it away, diners perceive that the service is worse, and the Yelp scores will go down. Such restaurants also have trouble retaining staff members.
So when you're thinking about compensating servers, it's best to start from the assumption that tipping will be around for a while. The smart thing to ask is, how can we make the best of a bad situation?
Which brings us to the real reason I'm writing this column. It is common these days to think that the way to do political and social change is: Think of the ideal system, then move to that. But the better way to make social change is: Think of the ideal system, then get as close as you can, given the restraints of human nature, and our own situation.
Thomas Sowell's outstanding book "A Conflict of Visions" explores the virtues of working realistically within constraints, and the evils that ensue when people ignore or try to run roughshod over them. He would say the constrained vision is wiser whether the subject is tipping, expanding health insurance or choosing between capitalism and socialism.
In the unconstrained vision, you ask: What's the solution? In a constrained vision you ask: What's the best set of trade-offs and reforms we can actually achieve?
The constrained vision is wiser. So I'll cheer on those who want to move America to a no-tip system. In the meantime, there are ways we can all make the best of a bad system:
- Tip 20% when the meal is over $25 and 30% when it is under.
- Always, always, always leave a tip in a hotel room.
- To combat implicit bias when tipping drivers and others, commit to a percentage for all rides and stick to it.
- Understand that the advantages you enjoy are products of both your individual effort and privileges you didn't earn. Tip accordingly.

Cronyism allegations fly in governor race

Texto completo: Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and Attorney General Jim Hood have adopted similar messages as they fight to become Mississippi's next governor: The other guy is unethical or has conflicts of interest. Vote for me instead.But they may cancel each other out. Both Hood, a Democrat, and Reeves, a Republican, have long faced criticism over their actions surrounding campaign finance, state contracts and pet projects.Most recently, the candidates traded attacks about a frontage road, a television ad and lucrative state contracts for trial lawyers. And in most cases, their claims are accurate.
What does Jim Hood say? The latest barrage of allegations came last week, as Hood hammered Reeves for filming part of a public education commercial at the private New Summit School in Jackson.
The ad promotes a Reeves plan to increase public teacher pay by about $4,000. Hood also proposes raising teacher pay, and says due to inflation teachers make less now than when Reeves entered office.
"This makes my blood boil," Hood said at a news conference. "You know, for somebody who hasn't done anything for public education for the past eight years to go to a private school talking about public education and teacher pay — he's not funded public education or given teachers raises."
Hood criticized the lieutenant governor for accepting campaign contributions from top people at the New Summit, and for steering more than $1 million in state funds to a company affiliated with the school. At a debate last week, Reeves pointed out Hood also received some campaign funds from the school's leaders.
"Everything is transactional with him," Hood said, calling for Reeves to pull the "phony" ad down.
Then Hood released his own ad going after Reeves's proposals, saying they were "last-minute promises on education."
A day later, Hood doubled down on his transactional description of Reeves at a state Capitol news conference.
"It's time for us to throw the money changer out of the temple — I'm talking about Tate Reeves," Hood said, calling out Reeves's campaign donors and what he claimed was their influence on several pieces of legislation in the Senate. "We've got to drain this swamp over here ... He's been transactional. Every bill he's passed, it's been to get campaign contributions back."
Government transparency and campaign finance reform are a central theme of Hood's campaign.
The Legislature should be subject to open records laws, he has said, and gifts to legislators banned. He's also advocated for outlawing campaign contributions during the legislative session, and banning corporate contributions.
What does Tate Reeves say? Reeves has a simple rebuttal to Hood's attacks: trial lawyers own Jim Hood.
In recent days the Reeves campaign pointed to a 2009 Wall Street Journal editorial, which describes Hood's practice of outsourcing major state cases to private lawyers, who earn a hefty cut of any settlement.
The ethical problem, the editorial explained, is that these legal firms are "only too happy to return the favor to Mr. Hood via campaign contributions." It found 27 firms that had worked with the AG who gave a total of $543,000 to Hood's campaign over two election cycles.
And other campaign donations from trial lawyers to Hood were effectively routed through the Democratic Attorneys General Association, the editorial claims.
A 2014 New York Times analysis of trial lawyer-attorney general relationships nationwide found Hood accepted nearly $400,000 from trial law firms over the prior decade, more than any other AG.
One senior partner at a Houston firm gave $125,000 to Hood's campaign after the firm filed suit for Mississippi against drug company Eli Lilly, the report said. In another prominent case, a Louisiana firm and Mississippi attorney Joey Langston, a Hood contributor, received $14 million in legal fees after Hood hired them for a state lawsuit.
Langston later served jail time for conspiring to bribe a judge in another case.
"The business community in Mississippi is scared to death of having a trial lawyer as governor," Reeves said at their first debate, arguing that's why he's been so successful raising money for his own campaign. Reeves also release a TV ad about Hood's relationship with trial lawyers.
The practice continues. Mississippi has paid out more than $115 million in attorney fees to private firms since 2009 for help with big cases, according to state records. And prominent lawyers still cut Hood's gubernatorial campaign some of its largest campaign checks.
Still, Hood often points to massive settlement payouts these high-profile AG cases bring back into Mississippi's coffers. The Times story found Hood's office won $400 million for the state thanks to lawsuits filed with private attorneys.
What other ethics issues have they faced? The ethics back-and-forth began when Hood attacked Reeves earlier this year over a now-halted frontage road designed to connect Reeves's gated Flowood neighborhood to a nearby shopping center.
A 2018 Clarion Ledger investigation found the road project was fast-tracked because of political pressure, and Hood pledged to look into the matter.
But then Hood continued investigating Reeves over the road even as their gubernatorial race heated up this summer — more than a year after the probe began. Hood said he even wrote the investigative report himself.
This prompted sharp criticism from the Reeves campaign, saying Hood's direct involvement was "beyond a conflict of interest" and "abuse of power."
The candidates lobbed attacks about the road during their first debate earlier this month. And both launched TV ads about it.
"The fact is, the emails were there, the evidence is there," Hood said. "He went after a state agency to build a road from his gated subdivision."
Reeves fired back: "The attorney general abused his office investigating his political opponent and everybody knows it."
Early this year, Reeves also faced ethical questions when he quietly helped tuck language into a budget bill to fund a $2 million private school education program, which sends children with special needs to private schools.
Lawmakers were surprised when they discovered the last-minute budget line item. The organization Empower Mississippi pushed for the funding — and had donated $45,000 to Reeves since 2015.
In 2004, not long after Hood took office, he criticized certain types of political donations and issued a stern warning that he would prosecute those who sidestep Mississippi's campaign finance laws.
He said companies and others should not be able to funnel their political donations to candidates through political action committees, labeling the practice "money laundering."
But it turned out Hood himself benefited from such donations. Two Mississippi law firms gave the Democratic Attorney General Association a combined $150,000 one day in 2003. The next day, DAGA reported, it cut a $150,000 check for Hood.

Texto completo: Elaine Stritch was the quintessential Broadway survivor. She got as much press for her hard living as for her up-and-down career, which included a (well-publicized) bartending stint in addition to multiple Tony Award nominations. Stritch finally got her Tony at age 77, in 2002, for the autobiographical one-woman show "At Liberty," which triumphantly cemented her public image as "Broadway's enduring dame": brazen, boozy and blunt.
Before "At Liberty," Stritch's signature song had been "The Ladies Who Lunch," a blast of alcohol-fueled bitterness she first nailed in the original production of "Company." Later in life, she claimed another Sondheim song as her own: "Still Here," the hard-bitten ode to overcoming dark days that gives New York Times writer Alexandra Jacobs the title for her slick, entertaining biography.
Stritch famously loved a good time and a good story, so she probably would have enjoyed Jacobs's gossipy text, studded with juicy anecdotes. This once-over-lightly approach is perhaps appropriate, given that Stritch was not inclined to introspection.
Opening with a vivid account of the 2014 memorial service for Stritch in a Broadway theater, Jacobs characterizes her subject as "restless and routinized, selfish and generous, straightforward and elliptical," a woman who "insisted on being seen and heard, felt and dealt with." It's all rather glib, as is the jab that Stritch was "a girl from a family who put the convent in conventional," followed 12 pages later by the information that "the Stritches were committed but not strict Catholics." Consistency doesn't unduly concern Jacobs if it gets in the way of a good one-liner.
Stritch would probably be fine with that. "I was the girl who sang the songs and told the jokes," she told a reporter in 1961. "I figured the only way to make people love me was to be a million laughs." As that quote indicates, Stritch didn't lack self-awareness; she simply preferred to focus on having fun, onstage and off, and making sure everyone knew about it. Shortly after she arrived in New York from suburban Detroit, in 1943, she was getting frequent mentions from gossip columnists like Walter Winchell and Dorothy Kilgallen for her saloon-hopping and high-profile dates with producer Jed Harris. Jacobs follows the columnists' example by giving plenty of space to Stritch's drinking and her relationships with Gig Young, Ben Gazzara and quite a few others before her 1973 marriage to fellow actor (and fellow alcoholic) John Bay.
Meanwhile, Jacobs's show-by-show narrative captures the professional life of a working actor in the commercial theater. Stritch made her first big splash with the mock-striptease number "Zip" in a 1952 revival of "Pal Joey" and received Tony nominations for her work in William Inge's 1955 drama, "Bus Stop," and Noel Coward's 1961 musical, "Sail Away." But she also gained a reputation as a lush, difficult with directors and a selfish performer who made sure the spotlight was always on her. By 1969, she had become "an obvious employment risk," according to Jacobs, when Harold Prince and Stephen Sondheim cast her in "Company."
Stritch was such a smash in the iconic role of Joanne that she negotiated a 50 percent raise for the show's run in London. She met Bay there and stayed for the rest of the 1970s, starring in a few plays and a TV sitcom. She even quit drinking for several years, but Bay's death, after their return to New York in 1982, pushed her off the wagon, and she hit bottom after her parents died in 1987. Stritch went to AA and loudly proclaimed her sobriety, although her commitment was, in fact, intermittent. It's all part of a jaundiced picture that Jacobs paints of the decade that followed, marked by unprofessional episodes fueled by a sense of entitlement that was, according to composer Larry Grossman, "not commensurate with who she was." (Jacobs has a habit of using quotes from others to make points she seems unwilling to make directly.)
With "At Liberty," Stritch went from being dismissed as a past-her-prime prima donna to being hailed as a theatrical legend and charming scamp. A surge of late-life activity included a regular guest-star stint on NBC's "30 Rock," cabaret performances at Cafe Carlyle, and, at age 85, her final Broadway appearance, as Madame Armfeldt in a 2010 revival of "A Little Night Music." She did her last show at the Carlyle in 2013, shortly before moving back to Michigan to spend her last year among her surviving relatives.
Stritch's tumultuous life and career make an absorbing story, which Jacobs tells briskly and readably. Readers looking for something deeper than the standard showbiz biography will wish that "Still Here" displayed greater empathy and insight when discussing Stritch's frequently bad behavior, so obviously rooted in insecurities and anxieties whose origins Jacobs might have done more to explore. For those content with a capable recounting of a colorful life, "Still Here" will do just fine.

Texto completo: Carl Safina, 64, an ecologist at Stony Brook University on Long Island and a MacArthur “genius” grant winner, has written nine books about the human connection to the animal world. Coming next spring is “Becoming Wild,” on the culture of animals, and a young adult version of “Beyond Words,” on the capabilities of dogs and wolves.
We spoke over lunch in his Long Island garden, surrounded by his three dogs, some wild squirrels and a group of extremely tame hens. An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows.
Q: When a writer for the Sierra Club’s magazine recently put the words “animal” and “cognition” into Google Scholar, he was directed to almost 200,000 citations published in the past five years. Why the explosion of interest in this scientific area?
A: I think it’s happened because in recent years we’ve come to know much more about the inner activity of nonhuman minds.
We have tools today that didn’t exist 50 or even 10 years ago. There are researchers putting dogs into MRIs, and so it’s become possible to watch their brains do things. What we’re learning is that animals do have felt experiences and thus, I think, consciousness.
Q: What’s your definition of consciousness?
A: To me, consciousness is the thing that feels like something. It’s the sensation of experiencing the input from your sense organs. We’re learning that a lot of animals - dogs, elephants, other primates - have it.
Q: How else has research on animal behavior improved?
A: Well, until the 1950s and the 1960s, the study of animal behavior wasn’t seen as real science. Until Jane Goodall, Iain Douglas-Hamilton and George Schaller began publishing, there were few studies. They were among the first to watch wild animals for the purpose of describing their behavior. Before, if you wanted to study elephants, you shot them and pulled their molars out to see how old they were.
Thanks to these pioneers, we’ve learned that wild animals do complicated things. Many recognize the individuals around them - even solitary animals, like mountain lions. There usually is a male mountain lion with a large territory who visits a few females inhabiting the territory. The females all know each other. The adjacent males know who their neighbors are.
Who knew that dolphins could recognize each other after a long separation? Yet, scientists report that there was a dolphin in an aquarium who hadn’t seen another captive dolphin in 20 years. When they were reunited, there was immediate recognition.
Frans de Waal’s latest book, “Mama’s Last Hug,” chronicles the emotional deathbed reunion of an aged zoo chimpanzee and primatologist Jan van Hooff, who had worked with her for many years. Though Mama is listless, when van Hooff approaches her after a long separation, she recognizes him and reaches out to touch him.
Chimpanzees, dolphins, elephants - they’ve all demonstrated signs of recognizing individuals. Videos show that their recognition is not mechanical, not a chemical match with a stored memory bank. It is often accompanied by shows of emotion, which proves to me that the experience is felt.
Q: Has the internet widened our understanding of the animal world?
A: I’d say so. Almost everyone nowadays has a video camera on them all the time, and animal behaviors get recorded that we haven’t seen before. The other day, someone sent me a video where someone was backing up their car and a puppy went behind it. Another dog came streaking out at high speed, snatching the puppy away.
Thanks to the ubiquity of these videos, we’re seeing evidence that the envelope of what animals can do is much bigger than we thought. That leads me to wonder: Why, despite increasing evidence, do some people deny that animals have emotions or feel pain?
Q: What’s your guess?
A: I think it’s because it’s easier to hurt them if you think of them as dumb brutes. Not long ago, I was on a boat with some nice people who spear swordfish for a living. They sneak up to swordfish sleeping near the surface of the water and harpoon them, and then the fish just go crazy and kind of explode. When I asked, “Do the fish feel pain?” the answer was, “They don’t feel anything.”
Now, it’s been proven experimentally that fish feel pain. I think they feel, at least, panic. They clearly are not having a good time when they are hooked. But if you think of yourself as a good person, you don’t want to believe you’re causing suffering. It’s easier to believe that there’s no pain.
Q: As a child, did you have pets?
A: I did. I spent my first 10 years in Brooklyn, where I had the kind of pets you’d buy in a store - a parakeet, little turtles.
From the time I was 7, I had homing pigeons. I learned about life, with a capital “L,” from them. The pigeons figured out who they were going to mate with. They’d be out flying around during the day and they’d come home, feed their babies and go to sleep. Watching them go about their lives, you saw them do a lot of the things that humans do. It was there right in front of your eyes.
Then, I went to college, and I learned that my childhood observations were not allowed. They were “anthropomorphic.” But the more I see of the new neuroscience and neurochemistry, I see a lot of overlap. All of life is literally kin. I first learned that from my Brooklyn pigeons.
Q: You live with three dogs. What have you learned from them?
A: Among things, that they are capable of anticipation. For instance, they show much excitement when I simply touch my car keys, which might well signal that they are going to some place interesting, like the beach. That proves that they have imagination and even memory.
Another thing - and this shouldn’t surprise - they can be quite emotional. Some years ago, I lived with someone with a dog. Before we broke up, we argued a lot. Once, we took her dog to the beach, and we started bickering there. That dog just basically collapsed into a pile of leaves and would not get up. She did not want to be with us. And we weren’t even yelling at her. She just did not want to be a part of an unhappy scene.
That showed me that they can have a real-time valuation of their experiences. They know what they prefer to avoid.
Q: The psychologist who puts dogs into MRIs, Dr. Gregory Berns, wrote a book in 2013 titled “How Dogs Love Us.” Do you think your dogs do?
A: That’s easy. Yes. And I don’t need to scan their brain activity to know this. They show it in their actions and the choices they make. Our dogs sleep on the floor in our bedroom just to be near us.
We’ve never given them any treats in that room. The only thing they get for the effort of climbing the stairs is proximity to us. At dawn, two of the three jump on the bed. Jude, the third, has a knee problem, and he can’t. When we wake up, it’s always all tongues and tails and “Oh happy day!”
During the day, they roam free in the house and the yard. If I’m writing or working outside, they’re never more than a hundred feet from me. That’s their choice.
My point is that they seek us out just to be near us. And what is love’s fundamental emotion? It’s the desire to be near loved ones. So yes, dogs can love their humans.

Texto completo: Facebook on Friday launched a news service that will include curated stories from the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News and more than 200 other news outlets, some of which will be paid for their content.
More than 200,000 Facebook users across the country, including an undisclosed number in Chicago, will see a new tab on their Facebook app giving them access to the news service during an initial test phase. Facebook News is expected to roll out to millions of users by the end of the year.
An effort to combat so-called fake news and provide support for legitimate journalism, the new service will present local and national daily news stories from a wide range of publishers. Instead of relying exclusively on algorithms, the stories will be selected by a team of journalists hired by Facebook, the company said.
Other media outlets providing content to Facebook News include The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, BuzzFeed News, the Los Angeles Times and ABC News.
Facebook will pay licensing fees to some of the media organizations, including Chicago-based Tribune Publishing, which owns the Chicago Tribune and New York Daily News, along with other papers.
"Tribune Publishing is pleased to participate in Facebook News at its inception," Mark Campbell, chief marketing officer of Tribune Publishing, said in a statement Friday. "This partnership will help connect readers with the high-quality journalism of the Chicago Tribune and New York Daily News. We look forward to a successful launch and positive results."
Tribune Publishing and Facebook declined to discuss the financial terms of the content licensing deal.
The new service could boost both online traffic and revenue for the struggling newspaper industry, which has lost advertising revenue to social media giants such as Google and Facebook in the digital age.
At the same time, the service marks a return of sorts to the news business for Facebook, which distanced itself from promoting even mainstream publishers as fake content thrived on the social media platform, especially during the 2016 presidential campaign.
In January 2018, under fire for the dissemination of fake and misleading news content, Facebook overhauled its news feed, prioritizing content from friends and de-emphasizing stories from outside publishers -- including traditional news organizations.
The new service is relying on input from journalists and publishers, employing a "curation team" with editorial independence to manage the daily content on Facebook News, the company said.
Video will not be available at launch, but Facebook expects to add video capabilities to its news service by early 2020.

Texto completo: "La nostalgia por el hogar vive en todos nosotros, el lugar seguro donde podemos ir tal como somos sin ser cuestionados". - Maya Angelou
Los trabajadores agrícolas del Valle de Salinas son el impulso de la industria agrícola del área (cuyo valor es de miles de millones de dólares), sin embargo, sufren para encontrar lugares adecuados para vivir cerca de los campos donde trabajan.
El hogar no es solo donde uno duerme y come, también es un sentido de comunidad, donde se crean recuerdos, se solidifican las relaciones, se encuentra refugio y se refuerzan los valores.
A partir de este mes, el periodista visual independiente, Sebastián Hidalgo, en asociación con la reportera de The Salinas Californian, Kate Cimini, analizarán el significado del "hogar" para miles de trabajadores agrícolas y medirán los elementos sociales, culturales y políticos que intervienen en la economía doméstica y las "viviendas asequibles". También estudiarán el panorama actual de la vivienda y los planes de vivienda asequible, así como el trayecto de Salinas hasta este punto en el que se encuentra.
Esta asociación fue posible a través de la colaboración con Catchlight Local, una nueva iniciativa de narrativa visual de la organización The GroundTruth Project, cuyo objetivo es conservar el periodismo a nivel local y traer prácticas de participación comunitaria a las salas de redacción.
Hidalgo es estadounidense de origen mexicano, periodista visual, productor digital y educador. Ha trabajado en el área del periodismo cívico y ha sido señalado por la sección Lens de The New York Times como uno de los "12 fotógrafos emergentes que deberíamos conocer".
Nosotros y nuestros socios de Catchlight lo elegimos de entre más de 50 solicitantes, como becario del programa Catchlight, para que aporte a la sala de redacción trabajo fotográfico matizado y empático. Según los datos de la Asociación de Líderes de Noticias, en los últimos 20 años, la cantidad de periodistas visuales ha disminuido en 52 % y el personal general de sala de redacción se ha reducido en 40 %.
Esto significa que se ha vuelto más difícil visualizar las historias de la comunidad en el Valle de Salinas. En los próximos meses, el Sr. Hidalgo realizará reportajes, pero también interactuará con la comunidad y llevará a cabo eventos comunitarios para obtener las opiniones de los más afectados por el problema de vivienda.
La Sra. Cimini es una condecorada periodista, recientemente obtuvo la maestría en periodismo de la Escuela Medill de Periodismo de Northwestern University. Antes de integrarse a The Californian en octubre de 2018, trabajó como becaria editorial en The Washingtonian y como periodista de seguridad nacional para Medill Reports.
Nos gustaría escuchar los comentarios de nuestros lectores. ¿Qué inquietudes o preguntas tiene relacionadas con el panorama de vivienda de Salinas, el proceso para ser propietario de una vivienda o las posibles soluciones para la crisis de vivienda? Este proyecto podría analizar algunas de esas inquietudes.
Para participar, envíe un mensaje de correo electrónico a Sebastián Hidalgo a sebastianhidalgophoto@gmail.com y a Kate Cimini a kcimini@thecalifornian.com con una lista de sus preguntas, en orden de más a menos urgente. Los mensajes de correo electrónico pueden enviarse en inglés o en español.
El hogar no es solo donde uno duerme y come, también es un sentido de comunidad, donde se crean recuerdos, se solidifican las relaciones, se encuentra refugio y se refuerzan los valores.

Sixth Debate Is Set for Los Angeles

Texto completo: The sixth debate, hosted by PBS NewsHour and Politico, will be held at U.C.L.A. on Dec. 19.
The Democratic National Committee announced on Friday that the sixth Democratic primary debate would be held in December at the University of California, Los Angeles, while ratcheting up the polling and donor criteria for candidates to qualify for a coveted spot onstage.
The debate will be held on Dec. 19 and sponsored by PBS NewsHour and Politico. The format and moderators have not yet been announced. Another debate is scheduled for Nov. 20, sponsored by MSNBC and The Washington Post.
In an effort to narrow the number of candidates after the largest debate ever in October, the D.N.C. is raising its thresholds for the December debate. It will require candidates to have at least 200,000 individual donors and meet one of two polling requirements: They must either receive 4 percent support in four national or early-state polls conducted by qualifying pollsters, or 6 percent support in two polls in the four early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
A New York Times analysis of polling and donor data shows that three candidates have already qualified for the December debate: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. None of the other 15 candidates in the field have yet hit the D.N.C.'s polling standard, and it is unclear how many of them have crossed the donor threshold.
Many party strategists and activists have clamored for the 2020 Democratic field -- and debate stage -- to be culled. With 10 or more candidates onstage at every debate so far, there has been limited time for the leading candidates to engage in prolonged and detailed discussions.
The thresholds for the November debate are 165,000 donors, and 3 percent in four polls or 5 percent in two polls in the early states. So far nine candidates have qualified for the November debate, with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota securing her spot this week.
Three candidates who were in the October debate have yet to qualify for November: former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and the former housing secretary Julián Castro.
With less than $ 700,000 in the bank entering October, Mr. Castro has said he may quit the race at the end of this month if he does not raise an additional $ 800,000. By comparison, Mr. Sanders had the most money in the bank, $ 33.7 million.
Missing the debate stage has so far been a virtual death knell for campaigns. Those candidates who have dropped out -- most recently Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio on Thursday -- did so either after they missed previous debate thresholds or were on track to miss them.
To count toward the December qualifications, polls must be publicly released between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12, one week before the debate.

Texto completo: The Turkish novelist and journalist Ahmet Altan is serving a life sentence in prison in his home country, allowed to see his children only occasionally and his writing, in theory, limited to short notes to his family and lawyers. Earlier this month, however, Other Press published the English translation of his memoir, "I Will Never See the World Again," which was written behind bars, defiantly, and smuggled out to that world he will never see.
I feel a special sort of empathy with Mr. Altan because I too am facing a life sentence -- a terminal disease in the form of an often fatal form of brain tumor -- but in my case at least I can blame health, God or bad fortune rather than my own vindictive countrymen.
Here it must be said that the title of Mr. Altan's book is the statement of a brutal fact, rather than a cry of despair. There is not a smidgen of self-pity in the memoir's 212 pages. What emerges is this: You cannot jail my mind, and you cannot shut me up. "I have never woken up in prison, not once," he writes. "I am writing this in a prison cell and I am not in prison. I am a writer."
If Mr. Altan, who at 69 is in his third year in prison, defies the degradations of prison life, he also doesn't minimize them. He writes about "the fires of terror," as he calls them; the pernicious process of dis-individuation; the substitution of his normally unused birth certificate name for the one he is usually known by; and the replacement of his clothing for a uniform. He cannot dress or undress, eat, bathe or exercise when he pleases. But one of the harshest privations is a surprising one: There are no mirrors or even reflective surfaces anywhere in his prison campus, which houses an astonishing 11,000 prisoners, most of them there for political reasons.
He had not previously realized how often one contemplates one's own reflection, or how important it is. "Making eye contact with yourself is a small miracle," he writes. "I looked around, searching for myself, and I wasn't there."
On July 14, 2016, Mr. Altan and his brother Mehmet, a professor of economics and a political commentator, participated in a television program hosted by Nazli Ilicak, a prominent journalist. The next day, there was a violent aborted coup against the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which included an attempted assassination, the bombing of Parliament and nearly 300 deaths. The Altan brothers and Ms. Ilicak were accused of sending a "subliminal message" to start the coup.
Ahmet Altan and Ms. Ilicak were arrested and both condemned to life in prison. (Mehmet Altan was ordered acquitted by a higher court.) Ahmet Altan has exhausted every appeal to higher courts, and Erdogan is entrenched in power.
I have been banned from entering Turkey because of articles I wrote about the country's treatment of its Kurdish minority, so over several weeks in June, I interviewed Mr. Altan the same way that he wrote his book: by smuggling questions to him and waiting for his smuggled-out responses, written in hand, with a blue pen. (Our exchange was translated by Yasemin Congar, who also translated his memoir.)
[ As Rod Nordland was covering India's climatic extremes, a medical emergency intervened .]
What, I asked Mr. Altan, was the point of this book? Whatever their courage, I suggested, writers like him pose more of an annoyance than a lethal threat to the state, which can swat them away like pesky mosquitoes.
Mr. Altan's reply was testy, which was fair enough. "You can kill writers, you can imprison writers, you can torture writers, but you can't swat them away like an insect. A writer is not his body only," he wrote. "The more you swat at a writer, the greater you help him become, while diminishing your own stature: The swatter turns into the mosquito. This fact is one of the fundamental reasons why writers cause so much fury in those who hold power. I think I've earned the right to hope that what I wrote will outlive the political authorities in Turkey today; compared to writers, political authorities are pitifully weak."
What if, I asked Mr. Altan, the authorities deprived him of pen and paper? After all, he was jailed for "subliminal messaging," and his memoir is hardly subliminal.
"Of course they can confiscate one's paper and pen, but they haven't done this," he replied. "My book was published in several European languages before coming out in the U.S., and I haven't faced a ban of my writing, because despite the absurdity of the allegations against me, and the fact that the trial was a farce, they want to keep up the pretense that an independent judiciary condemned me for valid reasons. If they obstruct my writing, they will have an even harder time defending what they have done."
"But are you not afraid," I continued, "that the publication of this book, even just in foreign languages" -- it has so far not come out in Turkish -- "will provoke more retaliation? You talk about the vital freedom to think, and to safeguard one's thoughts 'in the attic of the mind,' but don't you also need the freedom to record them? Wouldn't it be devastating if you couldn't?"
"Writing between these thick walls liberates me," Mr. Altan replied. "Fear itself is always more dangerous than the thing you fear. The fear of death is worse than dying. Fear takes you hostage and kills your resistance. Nowhere is fear more fatal than in prison."
He continued: "That said, your fears are mine, too. But since I have been here, I have developed a method to preserve my work whatever happens to me. As I am creating a piece of prose, I pace the prison courtyard while repeating the sentences in my mind until I know them by heart. If they confiscate my papers, the work itself will not be altogether lost. This is not an easy thing to do but I've become used to it in the last three years."
A prisoner of conscience enjoys a certain prestige -- including literary prestige -- that a writer on the outside doesn't. I wanted to know how Mr. Altan felt about it. I asked: "Will life imprisonment ultimately have been worth it, since it enabled you to create this book?"
His reply was refreshingly frank: "Here is my honest answer: Yes, it is worth it. I need to tell you two things about myself: First, when I don't write, I'm nothing, I'm very ordinary; there's no difference between my presence and absence. I'm a restless person. Writing protects me from my nothingness and restlessness. I need to write in order to protect myself from myself."
When I interviewed Mr. Altan, my tumor had not yet been diagnosed, and in editing our exchange, I recognized an affinity that I hadn't felt initially. We are both terminal cases -- his life sentence, my brain tumor -- and writing brings both of us solace, for different reasons. On some days, when I have turned a good phrase, or crafted an artful passage, or written an essay many found moving, I feel, as he does, that our sentences may actually be worth it.
His was imposed by a malevolent political authority, mine by some malevolent force of nature. Yet I find myself cheering on his book's concluding lines, paraphrased here: "Because, like all writers, we have magic. We can pass through your walls with ease."

John Durham opens criminal inquiry in DOJ’s investigation of the investigators

Texto completo: U.S. Attorney John Durham opened a criminal inquiry in his investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and into the conduct of the Justice Department, FBI, and Intelligence Community during their scrutiny of possible connections between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.
The significant new move in the DOJ’s investigation of the investigators, which would give Durham the power to impanel a grand jury and hand down indictments, according to the New York Times.

The DOJ did not immediately return the Washington Examiner’s request for comment.
Earlier this week, it was revealed that the secretive DOJ inquiry included scrutiny of former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, and British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Durham has also been seeking interviews with members of the CIA and FBI.

Durham, whose investigative portfolio recently expanded to include events from the launch of the inquiry in 2015 or 2016 through the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller in 2017, has taken overseas fact-finding trips with Attorney General William Barr, who was given “full and complete authority to declassify information” related to the origins of the Trump-Russia inquiry in May. Barr selected Durham to be his right-hand man soon after.

The 412 pages of redacted Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act documents released in 2018 show the DOJ and the FBI made extensive use of Steele's salacious and unverified dossier. The opposition research firm Fusion GPS was hired by Clinton's campaign and the DNC through the Perkins Coie law firm, and Fusion GPS then hired Steele. Clinton’s campaign received briefings about Fusion GPS's findings during 2016, and watchdog groups allege the campaign purposely concealed its actions from the Federal Election Commission. Steele’s Democratic benefactors, his desire for Trump to lose to Clinton, and the flaws with his dossier weren’t revealed to the FISA court.
DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who recently completed a FISA abuse investigation, said on Thursday that his report would be released soon.

Trump administration to tell federal agencies to end Washington Post and New York Times subscriptions

Texto completo: The White House is planning to direct federal agencies to not renew subscriptions to the Washington Post and the New York Times.
Many details, including when and how the plan will be implemented are still unclear, and the White House was still working on the directive Thursday, according to the Wall Street Journal.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that the move would save the government a lot of money.
“Not renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving — hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars will be saved,” she said Thursday.
Both of the major national newspapers have been a frequent target of attacks from President Trump, who has referred to the news organizations as “fake news” a number of times. The move seems to expand upon Trump’s decision to cancel White House subscriptions of the newspapers.
Print editions of the Washington Post and New York Times were not among the bevy of newspapers delivered to the White House on Thursday.
Speaking to Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump said Monday evening that he was planning to cancel the New York Times.
“We don’t even want it in the White House anymore,” Trump said. “We’re going to probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They’re fake.”
Regardless of his public disdain, Trump is reportedly an avid reader of both newspapers, and aides have said they expect him to continue to do so despite the cancellations.

Hillary 2020 rumors are getting louder

Texto completo: Joe Biden had better watch his back. Prominent Democrats who are not even running in their party’s 2020 primary are circling him like buzzards, weighing whether to swoop in if the former vice president is deposed as the front-runner.
One such buzzard is Hillary Clinton, whose dream of being called “Madame President” is alive and well, despite losing a very winnable election in 2016 to President Trump.

Longtime Clinton capo Philippe Reines, who is a gross and weird human being, fueled speculation this week that the former secretary of state may make a third run at the White House, claiming the two-time failed presidential candidate has not totally ruled out a 2020 candidacy. The moment occurred Wednesday evening during an appearance on Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Tonight.

“She ran for president because she thought she would be the best president,” said Reines. “If she still thought that now, if she thought she had the best odds of beating Donald Trump, I think she would think about it long and hard.”

Carlson asked in a follow-up, “She hasn’t foreclosed the possibility?”

“No,” Reines responded. “This is a huge if. But if she were jump in for whatever reason, and the party has moved someplace that she hasn’t, then she won’t get the votes. That’s the point of the primary. There are still 19 people. There are a few that are in double digits. If she were to run, and people she’s too left, too right, too center, that’s the beauty of it. They get to vote against whatever they want.”

He has clearly given this some amount of thought.

“She’s not running because she has any anxiety about the Democratic field. She really likes a lot of the people running,” Reines concluded. “She knows them well. She thought about some of them for her vice presidency. But there might be a reason that she would be the best person, not only to beat Donald Trump but to govern after Donald Trump.”

Go ahead and put that on a bumper sticker.
Clinton’s inner circle has done a bit more than daydream about the prospect of her jumping into the 2020 Democratic primary. It sounds like they have given it some serious thought.
Then again, take it all with a grain of salt. There is a significant chance that all of the 2020 chatter from Clinton-world is about ginning up sales for Clinton's new book — The Book of Gutsy Women — which she co-authored with her daughter, Chelsea.

Reines' comments Wednesday evening coincide with what the New York Times reported Tuesday of both Clinton and prominent Chinese communism enthusiast Michael Bloomberg:
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win, they would consider entering the primary — but that they were skeptical there would be an opening, according to Democrats who have spoken with them. […] Democrats who have recently spoken with Mrs. Clinton say she shares the same concerns other party elites have about the field — worried about Mr. Biden’s durability, Ms. Warren’s liberal politics and unsure of who else can emerge to take on Mr. Trump. But these people, who spoke anonymously to discuss private conversations, say she enjoys the freedom that comes with not being on the ballot.
Clinton has tried to reinvent herself since the 2016 election as some sort of leader-in-exile, telling anyone who will listen that she is the rightful heir to the throne. She has spent the last three years complaining about her 2016 defeat, blaming everything from sexism to racism to Russian hackers for what really comes down to her own failure to campaign in competitive Rust Belt states.
Clinton believes she should be president, which, oddly enough, summed up the entire message of her failed 2016 candidacy — hence the astonishingly self-centered mottos like “I’m with Her” and “Make Herstory.” That she should be conceited enough to try for a third run at the White House is not that outlandish.
But that comes with the caveat that this might be all about the book sales — something about Clintons and money.

Texto completo: I'm a fan of “Modern Love," the light but often poignant Amazon adaptation of The New York Times column of the same name. It is uneven, though, like most anthology series, including my beloved “The Twilight Zone." So here's a list of all eight episodes, in order of my favorites. Also, all of the episodes intersect in the final half-hour, “The Race Grows Sweeter Near Its Final Lap," which is No. 6 on my list.
1. “When Cupid Is a Prying Journalist." Catherine Keener is a magazine interviewer who shares stories of lost love with Dev Patel's successful start-up guy. Is it too late to go back and right a past romantic mistake? Andy Garcia costars.
2. “Take Me As I Am, Whoever I Am." Anne Hathaway is a woman who tries to hide her bipolar disorder from everyone in her world, including a man she dates, played by Gary Carr. The episode shows her both dancing in the supermarket and unable to get out of bed.
3. “Hers Was a World of One." A gay couple, played by Brandon Kyle Goodman and Andrew Scott (the hot priest from “Fleabag"), get involved with a pregnant homeless woman (Olivia Cooke) who is willing to let them adopt her baby. It's based on a column by Dan Savage.
4. “When the Doorman Is Your Main Man." Cristin Milioti is a single New Yorker who forms an unexpected and fierce bond with her doorman, played by Laurentiu Possa.
5. “At the Hospital, an Interlude of Clarity." John Gallagher Jr. is a guy on a first date with Sofia Boutella when he accidentally cuts himself. They spend the night in the emergency room, experiencing the kind of intimacy that usually comes much later in a relationship.
6. “The Race Grows Sweeter as It Nears Its Finish." Jane Alexander and James Saito are late-in-life lovers. How is old love different?
7. “Rallying to Keep the Game Alive." Tina Fey and John Slattery are a couple in trouble — but they try to work it out on the tennis court. It's based on a piece by Ann Leary about her marriage to Denis Leary.
8. “He Looked Like Dad. It Was Just Dinner, Right?" Julia Garner is a young woman looking for approval from Shea Wigham's much older father figure. Mixed signals ensue.

Warning: Anonymity ain't what it used to be

Texto completo: Oh, Anonymous. ... we hardly knew ye.
This past week it was revealed that the unnamed senior official in the Trump administration who penned a controversial (and not entirely helpful) 2016 op-ed in The New York Times would be making an ever bigger non-name for him- or herself with the release of “A Warning" — billed as “an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency."
That original op-ed, titled, “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration," unpacked, to an ultimately unsatisfying extent, the “test" facing Trump and his presidency: “The dilemma — which he does not fully grasp —," wrote Whoever, “is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations."
Putting momentarily aside the irreparable damage already sustained by the word “many" under this president, and the likelihood that many of Trump's senior officials now spend their days searching indeed.com, the credibility of the Anonymous author was instantly declared iffy by many Times readers. Not to mention the revelations therein hardly qualified for that word: “Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back."
Jeez, tell us something we don't know. (Like your name. That would be good.)
And now, with the tease of “A Warning" — set to arrive in November unless a troupe of Freedom Caucus jokers blockade every Barnes & Noble location with a pizza party — the idea seems to be that this 272-page pot of piping-hot White House tea can simply no longer be contained, the urgency of its message demonstrated by its mode of delivery.
For as everyone knows, in the Internet age, if you want to get time-sensitive, newsworthy information out to a public who desperately needs it (i.e. a “warning"), your best move is taking a few months to write, promote, and publish an unsigned book. It's a no-brainer. And I mean that as non-figuratively as possible.
And while the blower of this particular whistle has confirmed through representation that a “substantial" amount of the book's royalties will be donated to the White House Press Correspondents' Association, the assured future generosity of Anonymous hasn't stopped the Internet from dragging his or her lack of a name through the mud.
It's no surprise that an ambiance of cowardice suffuses the White House and its ostensibly nervous knuckle-chewing denizens. What is surprising is that whoever made it to this height and wrote this book (oh, hey Kellyanne) still thinks anonymity carries some inherent clout or cachet. Those days are gone; buried in an unmarked grave.
Certainly, some of the allure that anonymity once enjoyed is a vestige of history — or, prehistory — when anonymity was the natural state of any mark clawed onto a cave wall, or pressed into a clay tablet, or scratched upon some scroll bearing tales that formerly only existed as speech.
And sure, anonymity in the American political sphere also has a rich history. As one tweeter pointed out, “Common Sense was published anonymously. The Federalist Papers were published under a shared pseudonym. Many of the Founding Fathers were publishing broadsides against one another from time to time under pseudonyms. It's as American as apple pie."
Even as recently as 1996, when Newsweek writer Joe Klein was unmasked (thanks to some crack handwriting analysis by the Washington Post) as the author of the controversial (and equally shrug-worthy) Clintonian portrait “Primary Colors," he went from “For God's sake, definitely I didn't write it" to “I felt that there are times when I've had to lie to protect a source, and I put this in that category" in the course of a few short months. It was an act of bravery , you see. Not its polar opposite.
So, yes, technically there's a through-line that connects “Beowulf" with that note left on your windshield informing you that you suck at parking.
But the Internet, with its billions of unnamed accounts and armies of social media snipers, has done a real number on anonymity. We've seen it weaponized into guerrilla activism, with the amorphous group Anonymous (and its ungoverned offshoots) maintaining the most name-recognition, if you can call it that. We've seen anonymity put to cruel use on now defunct apps like Secret, Yik Yak, and Sarahah — favorites of bullies who lacked the fortitude to bully.
And authors who opt to go nameless now find themselves on equal footing with the hordes of anonymous bots and trolls clogging Twitter, the faceless commenters who traffic in untraceable abuse, and an unknowable number of other consciously unaccountable weenies. (Looking directly at you and not breaking eye contact, Pierre Delecto.)
That is, hiding in the shadows is not a good look for an aspiring author — let alone a hero. (Ever read “Beowulf"?)

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Hillary Clinton kicked off a political firestorm last week after making comments about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's presidential campaign on an Oct. 17 podcast.
Clinton's comments were initially erroneously reported as her saying Russians appeared to be "grooming" Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as a potential third-party presidential candidate. Clinton had actually suggested that it was the Republicans who were "grooming" Gabbard.
Clinton had been speaking on Democratic strategist David Plouffe's podcast in a wide-ranging interview about President Donald Trump, impeachment, and the state of the 2020 Democratic primary.
Several outlets picked up on the story, prompting a response from Gabbard on Twitter and elevating Gabbard to the forefront of a news cycle.
The problem is, however, that much of the controversy comes from a misquote of Clinton's remarks.
More: U. S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard says Hillary Clinton 'knows she can't control me'
Clinton's comments in context
Excerpts of Clinton's remarks started to go viral after the release of Plouffe's podcast, but it is important to put them in context since some of the initial reporting missed some crucial context around Clinton's remarks.
In the podcast, Clinton had talked about how "they've got their eye on somebody" in the Democratic primary and are "grooming her," followed by how "she's the favorite of the Russians. " Out of context, it would appear that Clinton was referring to Russians "grooming" a candidate.
They're also going to do third party. I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who's currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far, and that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset. Yeah, she's a Russian asset, I mean totally. They know they can't win without a third party candidate.
However, in the section of the podcast before those remarks, Clinton had been discussing the Republican Party's attempts to defeat Democratic presidential candidates and her concerns that a third-party candidate would take away votes in close races from a Democratic candidate, as some Democrats believe Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein did in 2016.
Gabbard responds to Clinton
On Oct. 18, as Clinton's misreported comments started to pick up traction, and several news outlets published stories on her remarks, Gabbard shot back on Twitter, calling Clinton the "queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long. "
Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang defended Gabbard, saying she "deserves more respect and thanks than this. "
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, a Democratic presidential candidate, also defended Gabbard, tweeting that "it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset. "
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N. J. , responded to Gabbard's tweet with a meme of his face from the first Democratic presidential debate.
Corrections
About a week after the initial controversy, several news outlets corrected the reporting of Clinton's remarks, including the version from the Associated Press used by USA TODAY.
Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill highlighted The New York Times' correction and slammed the coverage of Clinton's remarks.
"I too am tired of talking about this, but let’s again set the record straight," Merrill wrote on Twitter, using HRC to refer to Clinton. "HRC speculated that the only way the GOP is going to win in states where Trump can’t hit a 50% majority is to 1) Suppress the vote, as they do widely and routinely, & 2) Bank on the 3rd party spoiler. "
Merrill added that media reports showed Russian propaganda and disinformation networks being used to bolster Gabbard's candidacy.
Gabbard, however, has continued her criticism of Clinton and has used it as a way to rally her supporters.
In an Oct. 23 tweet, Gabbard told Clinton to "acknowledge the damage you have caused and step down from your throne. " Gabbard tweeted that quote along with a link to a website for supporters to add their names to a list criticizing Clinton.

Covering the Big Plays With a Pocket-Size Screen

Texto completo: There are many websites and tech tools for covering football nationally, Ken Belson says. (The beat doesn't hurt his fantasy team, either.)
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ken Belson, who covers football, discussed the tech he's using.
So the N.F.L. season is in full swing. What are your favorite websites or tech tools for tracking stats, scores, games and players?
Each morning, I read through a few football websites, like ProFootballTalk, that include good summaries and commentaries of the biggest stories. Since I cover the league nationally, rather than a single team, I'm looking for information about whatever story is resonating around the country. The travails of Antonio Brown are a good example. But there are any number of other leaguewide issues.
Twitter, of course, is invaluable, though you can get lost in the feeds. I subscribe to several newsletters that also summarize stories. Those pop into my inbox early in the day -- as well as plenty of email queries from my editors.
And my iPhone is with me everywhere. Sports is a 24-hour news cycle, and the phone has kept me in the loop more times than I can count. I've written entire stories on it in a pinch, including while overseas.
What about your favorite tech tools for finding out things that the N.F.L. doesn't want you to know?
This depends on what I'm working on. When the details of the concussion settlement -- in which the league settled claims that it concealed what it knew about the dangers of repeated hits to the head -- were being hashed out in court, I often checked the docket of the federal court in Philadelphia. The administrator of the settlement also posts information online.
Sources also send cases they've filed or research they've published. Sports Litigation Alert is also a great storehouse of cases.
Are you a cord cutter ? Lots of people have cut the cord, but one reason people keep their cable subscriptions is to watch sports.
I still have cable at home to watch games. I've watched games on my laptop, but the screen is too small to watch for too long. I'm usually checking other games on my cellphone. I don't watch RedZone, which shows when teams are within 20 yards of the end zone.
Generally, I pick one game a weekend to watch -- usually the Sunday night game -- if I'm home. But there are so many replays and highlights, it's easy to catch up if I've missed a game that includes something notable.
Do you play fantasy football?
I've played fantasy football on and off for about 20 years, starting when I lived in Japan. When I began covering the N.F.L. full time in 2013, I joined a fantasy league with friends in the office to help keep track of which players and teams are doing well. I cover the draft in April, so I have a decent idea of who the good rookies are, and I follow the games just enough to decide who's worth drafting. But I also lean heavily on my nephew, who is in several leagues and keeps far better track of the players than I do.
And how are you doing this season?
We finished second last season out of a dozen teams. This season, we're leading our division, and our only loss was by one point. Not so bad so far. Our strategy was to focus on running backs. Our sleeper pick was Aaron Jones of the Packers.
Outside of work and sports, what tech product do you love?
I use Entrain to calculate hours of sleep to get over jet lag. And Qello, which has great vintage rock videos, something an N.F.L. friend showed me.
What's your home entertainment setup like? Is it important to you to have a fancy TV and good speakers? Are you the go-to friend for hosting Super Bowl parties?
Nothing fancy when it comes to television. I spend more time checking highlights online, especially if there is a play that is going to lead to a suspension or controversial penalties, things that I often have to write about.
I don't attend Super Bowl parties, because I attend the games. I arrive in the Super Bowl city more than a week in advance to report on the buildup to the game. By the time the game arrives, I'm relieved the long week and season are coming to an end. The game, though, goes by in a blur because I'm on deadline and spend my time typing, which leaves me little time to enjoy the game like a fan.
Is there anything that tech ruins about the sports-viewing experience?
Yes! The endless commercials and gimmicks on television ruin the sports viewing experience. So does all the artificial noise in stadiums. I find this distracting and unneeded. Fans know when to get excited. They don't need to be told.

Judges Dubious of Trump's Bid to Stop Subpoena for Tax Returns

Texto completo: During an appeals court hearing, the judges expressed skepticism about the president's bid to block a subpoena for his tax returns.
A federal appeals panel on Wednesday expressed skepticism that President Trump had a right to block state prosecutors in Manhattan from enforcing a subpoena that sought his personal and corporate tax returns for the last eight years.
The judges on a three-member panel in Manhattan peppered a lawyer for Mr. Trump with questions, expressing skepticism about the president's argument that he was immune from criminal investigation. A lower court judge earlier this month rejected Mr. Trump's claim, which has not previously been tested in the courts.
Carey R. Dunne, the Manhattan district attorney's general counsel, cited the president's famous claim that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing political support.
Mr. Dunne asked what would happen in that extreme scenario? "Would we have to wait for an impeachment proceeding to be initiated?" he said.
Later, Judge Denny Chin posed the Fifth Avenue hypothetical to William S. Consovoy, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, and asked for his view.
"Local authorities couldn't investigate? They couldn't do anything about it?" Judge Chin asked, adding: "Nothing could be done? That's your position?"
"That is correct. That is correct," Mr. Consovoy said.
The panel did not immediately indicate when it would issue a ruling, but Judge Robert A. Katzmann, the appeals court's chief judge, signaled that he and the other judges understood both the gravity of the matter and that they were unlikely to have the final word.
"This case seems bound for the Supreme Court," Judge Katzmann said early in the arguments, adding later, as the hearing wrapped up, "We have the feeling that you may be seeing each other again in Washington."
A deal struck with the district attorney's office will allow the president time to seek a speedy review of the appellate ruling in the Supreme Court on the condition that he ask that the court hear the case in its current term, which ends in June.
The district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, has agreed not to seek enforcement of the subpoena until the Supreme Court either refuses to hear Mr. Trump's case or issues an opinion, whichever comes first. Mr. Vance was present in the spectator section of the packed courtroom as the arguments took place. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan typically decides cases through three-judge panels. The panel members who heard the subpoena dispute were Judge Katzmann, Judge Chin and Judge Christopher F. Droney.
Judge Katzmann was appointed to the appeals court by President Bill Clinton. Judges Chin and Droney were appointed by President Barack Obama.
The appeal by Mr. Trump's lawyers came after a lower court judge ruled on Oct. 7 that the president's argument that he could not be investigated by a local prosecutor was "repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values."
Mr. Vance's office in late August subpoenaed Mr. Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his personal and corporate tax returns dating to 2011.
The district attorney had been investigating whether any New York State laws were broken when Mr. Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Michael D. Cohen, the president's former lawyer and fixer, for payments he made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who had said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump has denied the affair.
Mr. Trump went into federal court last month, trying to block the district attorney's subpoena. The president argued that the Constitution prevented a sitting president from being "investigated, indicted or otherwise subjected to criminal process."
The subpoena was an "effort to harass the president by obtaining and exposing his confidential financial information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law," the president's lawyers wrote.
In the appeals court on Wednesday, Mr. Consovoy told the panel, "We view the entire subpoena as an inappropriate fishing expedition not made in good faith."
After Judge Victor Marrero of United States District Court in Manhattan, in a 75-page ruling, rejected Mr. Trump's broad argument, the president's lawyers appealed to the Second Circuit.
They contended in legal briefs that Mr. Trump's claim of absolute immunity was meritorious; they said the framers of the Constitution, recognizing the need for a strong chief executive, created the impeachment process for investigating and removing a president in a manner that would "embody the will of the people."
"A lone county prosecutor cannot circumvent this arrangement," they wrote.
In court on Wednesday, Mr. Consovoy sought to paint a dramatic picture of what Judge Marrero's ruling could lead to.
"The question is not about this subpoena," he said. "It's about what would happen if all 50 states were unleashed to engage in any kind of investigations, criminal investigations of a sitting president."
The Justice Department, led by William P. Barr, also weighed in, telling the appeals panel that the case raised "significant constitutional issues."
The government is not a party to the case but has the right to provide its views.
Although the Justice Department asked that the court stop the release of Mr. Trump's tax returns and reiterated its longstanding position that a sitting president may not be charged or prosecuted, it appeared to leave open the door for Mr. Trump to be investigated by Mr. Vance's office.
The Justice Department argued that Mr. Vance should not be able to obtain the president's personal records "unless and until" it could show that the records it was seeking from Mr. Trump were central to the investigation, not available elsewhere and were needed immediately, as opposed to after Mr. Trump leaves office.
Mr. Vance's office, citing Mr. Trump's arguments in the case, told the appeals court in a brief that Mr. Trump's "core position on every one of these matters is that the United States presidency places him beyond the reach of the law."
During the appeals hearing, Judge Katzmann asked whether the court could address only whether a state may lawfully demand that a third party -- in this case, Mazars, Mr. Trump's accounting firm -- relinquish the president's personal financial records for use in a grand jury investigation while the president was still in office.
"Why can't we think about this case in a narrow sense?" Judge Katzmann asked.
Mr. Consovoy responded that one "cannot simply pretend" that such a subpoena was not "ultimately directed to the party who entrusted the custodian with those records."
Throughout the arguments, the judges returned to the president's claim of broad immunity.
"Your position," Judge Chin addressed Mr. Consovoy at one point, "is that the immunity is absolute.
"And so if the president were to commit a crime, no matter how heinous," Judge Chin continued, whether he did it before he took office or after he entered, he could not be the subject of any investigation. "That's the position?"
"Yes," Mr. Consovoy replied, adding, "Of course, Congress retains the impeachment power."

The Ojai Music Festival Rehires Its Ex-Director

Texto completo: With Chad Smith leaving to lead that orchestra, Ara Guzelimian will return as artistic director of the Ojai Music Festival.
Ara Guzelimian first attended the Ojai Music Festival, the laboratory of musical innovation in Southern California, as a teenager. In 1974, as a college student, he performed at the festival as a member of U.C.L.A.'s a cappella choir. And from 1992 to 1997, he was Ojai's artistic director.
So when the festival suddenly found itself in need of a new leader earlier this month, after its incoming artistic director, Chad Smith, was named chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, it was only natural to reach out to Mr. Guzelimian.
The festival announced on Thursday that he had agreed to take -- or retake -- the job.
"It felt a little like Odysseus coming home after all his journeys," said Mr. Guzelimian, whose post-Ojai life has brought him to Carnegie Hall, as senior director and artistic adviser, and the Juilliard School, as provost and dean, a position he had already planned to step down from next June.
Ojai's original succession plan -- for Mr. Smith to follow Thomas W. Morris, whose 16-year run as artistic director ended in June -- was upended by management upheaval at the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
It was initially announced that Mr. Smith, who had been widely admired as the Philharmonic's adventurous chief programmer, would become Ojai's artistic director for three years beginning in 2020, while keeping his job in Los Angeles. But last month the Philharmonic's chief executive, Simon Woods, abruptly left after less than two years in the position, and within weeks the orchestra announced that Mr. Smith would succeed him.
Officials at both the orchestra and the festival initially said there would be no change in Mr. Smith's status at Ojai. But that would have left him in charge of a major June festival just 75 miles away from the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its popular summer home, the Hollywood Bowl. And it was difficult to envision the chief executive of an orchestra with a $ 125 million budget finding time for another gig.
Both sides rethought the matter, and while Mr. Smith will remain in charge of next year's Ojai Festival, he will then step down.
He said in a statement that his premature departure from Ojai was "bittersweet," but that the festival "deserves the full creative energies of its artistic director and the L.A. Phil requires the singular focus of its C.E.O."
Ojai has an unusual structure: Its artistic director picks a different music director to plan the programming for each festival. The selections have included composers, conductors, singers, instrumentalists, an ensemble (Eighth Blackbird), a stage director (Peter Sellars), and even a choreographer (Mark Morris) -- and several who have sprawled over more than one of those categories, such as Pierre Boulez, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Vijay Iyer and Barbara Hannigan. The composer and conductor Matthias Pintscher is music director for next June.
Mr. Guzelimian said that his first task would be planning the season in which he returns: 2021, which is also the festival's 75th anniversary.

Texto completo: Re “Terranea Resort, in Rancho Palos Verdes, introduces new panic buttons in lead up to ballot measure” (Oct. 24):
I’m glad to see that Terranea Resort President Terri Haack has provided panic buttons to the hardworking housekeeping workers at Terranea.
The resort also claims they pay their workers at least $15 an hour. If this is true, why not codify these policies so that workers will be guaranteed this protection against sexual assault and a base pay of $15, no matter who the management is? Measure B would do just that.
Terranea has spent an alarming amount of money and energy trying to defeat this measure that they claim to already live up to. This is money that would be better spent implementing these commonsense protections and paying their workers fairly.
Terranea has been promoting their Saints and Sinners Halloween Party. In my opinion, the saints are the hotel workers who work long hours cleaning up after and waiting on hotel guests and making Terranea the place visitors love so much and are willing to pay top dollar for. The sinners? That’s for you to decide.
Ultimately, Measure B’s fate will be decided by residents of Rancho Palos Verdes. If I lived there, I would vote yes.
— Janice Hahn,

We’ve seen this before
The year is 1971. Bumbling burglars break into the Democratic campaign office to get dirt on behalf of a Republican president. The cast: Richard Nixon, H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy, Charles Colson, John Dean, Archibald Cox, a whistleblower, and the Washington Post. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
Fast forward to 2019. Bumbling Republican president shakes down the president of Ukraine to get dirt on Democrat opponent.
The cast: Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Stephen Miller, Mike Pompeo, William Barr, Robert Mueller, a whistleblower and The New York Times. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
We’ve seen this movie before. The latest news is just a preview of a sequel. In the previous movie, many of the characters ended up in prison or ignominy. So should many characters in this sequel. Exception, impeach and convict Trump.

Quitan el nombre “Trump” de pistas de hielo en Central Park de Nueva York

Texto completo: Con el inicio de la temporada de patinaje en las dos pistas de hielo en Central Park, los visitantes notarán que la marca “Trump” ya no está.
La impopularidad del mandatario Donald Trump entre muchos neoyorquinos ha llevado a que su nombre sea despojado de algunas propiedades privadas en su ciudad natal, incluido el hotel Trump SoHo -ahora llamado Dominick-, y algunos condominios de Trump Place en Manhattan.
Las pistas, dos de varias concesiones públicas que opera en la ciudad la Organización Trump -el principal vehículo comercial de la familia presidencial-, continuaron mostrando el nombre de manera prominente hasta la primavera pasada.
“Sin embargo, en las últimas semanas, la compañía realizó un cambio significativo, eliminando el nombre de Trump en silencio y sin explicación”, destacó The New York Times.
La presencia de la marca familiar disminuyó considerablemente. Desapareció por completo de los tableros.
El nombre “Trump” quedó reducido a una “T” solitaria sobre el mostrador de alquiler de patines, en letra pequeña en la parte inferior de un letrero con las horas y tarifas.
Los cambios en las pistas, reportados por primera vez por The Washington Post, no fueron solicitados ni requeridos por el Ayuntamiento, dijeron las autoridades.
La Organización Trump -que dirige las pistas Wollman y Lasker, ubicadas en los extremo sureste y noroeste del parque-, informó en el verano a los funcionarios del parque que planeaba alterar la señalización, sin proporcionar detalles ni una justificación.
Un representante de la Organización Trump no ha respondido a una solicitud de comentarios. Los ejecutivos han dicho en el pasado que la opinión pública del presidente no había afectado el negocio de la compañía.
“No hay conexión con la política y el uso de usuarios en nuestras instalaciones aquí en Nueva York”, dijo el año pasado Ronald C. Lieberman, vicepresidente ejecutivo del grupo.

Rose McGowan sues Harvey Weinstein, Lisa Bloom, more claiming 'diabolical' intimidation plot

Texto completo: Add another lawsuit to the towering pile of legal conflicts stemming from the take-down of accused sex-predator Harvey Weinstein: Actress Rose McGowan, one of his first public accusers, is suing him and his ex-lawyers alleging a "diabolical" plot to intimidate her.
McGowan and her team of Chicago lawyers announced Wednesday she filed a lawsuit in federal court in California against Weinstein, two of his high-profile former lawyers, David Boies and Lisa Bloom and their firms, and Black Cube, the London-based private intelligence firm staffed by ex-Israeli Mossad agents.
The lawsuit alleges 11 complaints, including civil racketeering, wiretapping, fraud, invasion of privacy, computer crimes, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent hiring. The suit seeks a jury trial, "treble" damages and punitive damages.
"This case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America’s most powerful men and his representatives to silence sexual-assault victims," declared the opening lines of the complaint. "And it is about the courageous women and journalists who persisted to reveal the truth. "
Julie Porter, one of McGowan's lawyers, said in a press statement that the suit details a "conspiracy" led by fallen movie mogul Weinstein and enabled by the other defendants to "intimidate and silence" McGowan and others.
"My life was upended by their actions, and I refuse to be intimidated any longer," McGowan said in the statement.
Weinstein issued a response via one of his civil attorneys, Phyllis Kupferstein, who said McGowan tried to reach a $6 million settlement with Weinstein in 2017 and was rejected.
"Once and for all, Rose McGowan will be shown to be what she is; a publicity seeker looking for money," Weinstein's statement said. "From the moment she sought a multi-million dollar payout in return for not making these baseless allegations, which we rejected, we knew that she was waiting for an opportune time to begin this. We will demonstrate that this case has no legal merit. "
McGowan, 46, is among Weinstein's first and loudest accusers. She says he raped her at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. Her public acknowledgment two decades later helped fire up the #MeToo movement in October 2017. Hundreds of women have come forward since to accuse Weinstein and scores of other entertainment figures of sexual misconduct ranging from groping to rape.
Weinstein is set to go on trial in New York City next year on sex-crime charges, including rape, stemming from encounters with two women.
Both Boies and Bloom have lately been in the news for representing multiple accusers of financier Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who killed himself in a federal jail in New York this summer while awaiting trial on new sex-crime charges. Bloom, a noted women's-rights attorney, also represented accusers of Bill Cosby.
But before that they represented Weinstein in his efforts in 2016 and 2017 to ward off major media exposes about his alleged sexual misconduct over decades, plus McGowan's own memoir, published in January 2018, which discusses her rape allegation. Black Cube was the firm Weinstein reportely hired, with Boies' help, to spy on journalists and accusers.
All of this has been in the news again recently due to best-selling books by the New York Times and The New Yorker reporters whose exposes brought down Weinstein and later won them a Pulitzer Prize.
Both Bloom and Boies later apologized for working with Weinstein.
McGowan's lawsuit alleges that Boies’ and Bloom’s efforts on Weinstein’s behalf were part of a "sprawling smear campaign to defraud, malign and marginalize McGowan, employing unlawful tactics that inflicted severe emotional distress and caused her damages. "
The lawsuit says that their alleged intimidation campaign included hiring "undercover intelligence operatives from Black Cube" who posed as women’s rights advocates and journalists to gain McGowan’s trust, unlawfully record her and acquire her unpublished manuscript.
“The complaint alleges that these defendants launched a coordinated, sophisticated attack on Rose McGowan and others who sought to tell the truth about and expose Weinstein’s misconduct in 2017,” Porter said. “This suit seeks to hold Harvey Weinstein and his team of enablers accountable for the harm that they did to our client. "
Bloom's lawyer, Eric George, said in a statement to USA TODAY that it's "inexcusable" that McGowan included Bloom in her lawsuit.
"There is simply no credible factual or legal basis for her claims against my client," his statement said. "We look forward to our day in court to set the record straight. ”
USA TODAY sought comment from Boies and Black Cube but did not get immediate responses.

Texto completo: An ex-con who allegedly killed his girlfriend's roommate used the devastation of Hurricane Sandy to cover up the 2012 crime, dumping his victim's body on a storm-ravaged beach in Queens, prosecutors said.
The deception went unanswered for seven years, until Thyron Aycock was indicted Tuesday on murder charges, prosecutors said.
Aycock, now 43, allegedly beat his victim, 32-year-old Shawn Rucker, in the head with a blunt object several times sometime between Oct. 29 and Nov. 7, 2012, then wrapped the body in a plastic garbage bag, burying him on Rockaway Beach, prosecutors charge.
Workers found his partially-buried remains days later while they were cleaning up damage from the storm.
Rucker had relocated to Queens from Baltimore not long before his killing, authorities said. His sister-in-law, Kym Ellison, told the New York Times in 2012 that he came to New York that month because he was dating someone, and he spoke to his family back home hours before the storm hit.
The charge against Aycock, who's been in and out of prison for violent crimes since 2016, came just a few days before his scheduled release from Rikers Island in a Manhattan assault.
In a statement to investigators, Aycock said he met Rucker when he moved in with a Far Rockaway woman named Tiana whom he was dating, according to prosecutors.
"I didn't care much for Shawn or the way he treated Tiana. He was always starting arguments with her and I began starting arguments with him," he told detectives Saturday, according to prosecutors.
Authorities Tuesday didn't release details of how they cracked the case.
Aycock was arraigned in Queens Supreme Court and ordered held without bail.
"The defendant, who got away with this heinous killing for years, is now in custody and faces spending the rest of his life locked behind bars," said Acting Queens District Attorney John Ryan.

HEART OF GLASS JAIME GUERRERO'S SCULPTURES SHOW THE FACES OF THE REFUGEE CRISIS

Texto completo: Jaime Guerrero wants to personalize - not politicize - the refugee crisis at our southern border.
In his native Los Angeles, the artist gave free glass blowing classes to youth in underserved communities. That's where he saw firsthand the suffering of children caught up in the ongoing immigration debates.
Now a Pittsburgh resident, he has continued to address those issues through his work with local nonprofit Casa San Jose and in a just-opened exhibition at the Pittsburgh Glass Center. Mr. Guerrero will speak about both in a free public talk at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at the center in Garfield.
The exhibition derives its title, "Cuando el Río Suena" (When the River Sounds), from a South American proverb that he links to the dangers migrants face during their journey to the United States.
Their plight is represented in life-sized sculptures of children, most made of clear, slightly frosted glass. They are both ghostly and pure. They are representationally children but characteristically their childhood is suspended. The figures are preternaturally quiet, colorless and motionless.
Two boys and two girls stand on a swath of sandy soil in front of a tall, rusting wall, alone and forlorn. Three children linger inside a fenced space reminiscent of holding pens used by U.S. Border and Customs Protection at the Mexican border.
Perhaps most telling is that we see right through them. They are as invisible, physically and metaphorically, as their real counterparts, simultaneously victims and witness.
Winged children made of milk glass represent children who have died while in border control custody. Some hover overhead, perhaps guardian angels to those still on the path.
Mr. Guerrero is among a minority of glass artists working in such large scale. The figures begin as a number of blown glass vessels - for the head, an arm, torso, leg. These are then sculpted while the glass is hot and maintained at temperature until they can be joined.
The artist, who was born in 1974, studied at California College of Arts and Crafts, Pilchuck School of Glass and with various master glass artists.
He and his family moved east to be closer to his wife's family in Buffalo, N.Y. Mr. Guerrero chose Pittsburgh because of the reputation of the glass center and the availability of its furnaces.
"He wanted a place with a glass community," said Heather McElwee, the center's executive director.
She noted that the center has to date attracted more than 50 glass artists to settle in the region.
Mr. Guerrero received a grant in 2018 from The Pittsburgh Foundation and created exhibition work during a nine-month residency at the center. He continues his work with youth in affiliation with Casa San Jose, a community resource center which coordinates actions and serves as a support base for recent Latino arrivals to the region. Director Sister Janice Vanderneck will also speak Wednesday.
Contributions made by visitors during the course of the exhibition, through Jan. 26, will be donated to Casa San Jose and Mr. Guerrero will teach a free fall class in glass blowing to youth from the organization.
Complementing the figures are a documentary and two installations that further draw the visitor into the mental and physical realm of the refugee. The New York Times documentary "Between Borders: America's Migrant Crisis" follows Honduran teens fleeing gang violence and lack of economic opportunity.
More tactile is a wall of items taken from migrants at the border. They range from T-shirts and shorts to shoes and backpacks. They include "silent shoes," rustic handmade slip-ons that cover tracks.
They are among thousands of items in the archive/collection of the ongoing photographic project "El Sueño Americano/The American Dream" by Tom Kiefer, who worked as a janitor in a southern Arizona facility.
The project began when Mr. Kiefer noticed bags of usable canned goods being tossed by U.S. border patrol agents and asked permission to take them to a food bank. He was shocked to see what else had been taken. He began saving toys, rosaries and other items, and has been photographing them since 2013.
Another wall displays 300 notes and letters in Spanish, English and other languages relating immigration experiences. Although most don't give names, they represent a range of ages and national backgrounds. About 100 are by refugee children now living in Los Angeles. The remainder are about historical immigration by Massachusetts adults who visited an exhibition by Mr. Guerrero. Here are some excerpts:
"My great grandparents left Armenia in 1915-16 to escape genocide."
"My parents were forced to leave Cuba when Fidel Castro nationalized my father's business."
"My Dad came from Bolivia. But he got deported. I haven't seen him in three years."
"Papa Smith was German but lived in Brooklyn. It wasn't until he was elderly that we learned he was Jewish and they changed his name from Goldschmidt when he came to Ellis Island."
A woman from Condor, England, said she returns occasionally to visit. "I wish to dig up soil, rock and plant into buckets and bring them back here to Los Angeles so that I can bury my hands in these and remember."
A Mexican-born writer crossed the Rio Grande with his or her mother and younger brother and were caught and placed in a "holding cell." When they were released they exited through the wrong door. "We were still on American soil. When we figured it out we called my father who was in Chicago. He sent Greyhound tickets."
Together they are reminders of the continuing story of immigration that has fed America since its beginnings. Mr. Guerrero hopes they support commonality rather than divisiveness.
"My work embraces the notion that art can influence social change. It is important to bring awareness to the moral inequities that exist in society today," he said in his artist statement.
The exhibition continues through Jan. 26 at the Pittsburgh Glass Center, 5472 Penn Ave. Garfield (15206). Hours are 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Friday through Sunday. Admission is free; a $5 donation is suggested. Information: or 412-365-2145.

Texto completo: Unless I missed something while cleaning up in the kitchen before settling down to watch the Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 15, I heard no questions asked regarding how candidates would address global warming.
That was the elephant in the debate studio that, except for a passing reference, nobody discussed. The fact that CNN dedicated a town hall forum to climate change last month is no excuse for not including this critical issue in the debate agenda.
Given that the CNN and New York Times moderators neglected to raise this issue, I was hoping the candidates themselves would inject it into the debate.
It is difficult enough for me to sustain the small steps I take daily to reduce my carbon footprint. When I hear next to nothing on the Democratic presidential stage about such a colossally important issue, I have great difficulty remaining hopeful, and not despairing, about the state of our world.

Texto completo: Imaad Zuberi's plea is not related to his donations to President Trump, but if he cooperated with prosecutors, it could have ripple effects into investigations of Mr. Trump's inauguration.
WASHINGTON -- A California venture capitalist who donated lavishly to major politicians of both parties -- from former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to President Trump -- has agreed to plead guilty to violating lobbying, campaign finance and tax laws, prosecutors said Tuesday.
Imaad Zuberi, 49, had donated lavishly to Democrats before abruptly pivoting and donating more than $ 1.1 million to committees associated with Mr. Trump and the Republican Party in the three months after the 2016 presidential election. He was the only donor named by federal prosecutors in Manhattan in a subpoena issued in February to Mr. Trump's inaugural committee, to which his California company, Avenue Ventures, had donated $ 900,000.
The charges announced Tuesday are not related to his donations to support Mr. Trump. But if Mr. Zuberi cooperated with prosecutors, it could have ripple effects into other investigations into contributions to Mr. Trump's inauguration, including of whether foreigners illegally funneled money to it in hopes of buying influence over American policy.
Mr. Zuberi was charged with making nearly $ 1 million in illegal campaign donations from April 2012 through October 2016, including some funded by foreign sources, as part of a scheme to gain access to American politicians for foreign clients. He was also charged with falsifying records filed with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act to conceal his lobbying for Sri Lanka to help burnish the country's reputation in Washington amid human rights concerns. And he was charged with failing to report and pay taxes on $ 5.65 million he was paid for the Sri Lankan lobbying campaign, much of which, prosecutors say, he diverted for his own personal use.
Mr. Zuberi, who is expected to appear in court next week to enter his guilty plea, could face a maximum sentence of 15 years in federal prison.
A spokesman for him declined to comment.
Nicola T. Hanna, the United States attorney for the Central District of California, said in a statement, "Mr. Zuberi's multifaceted scheme allowed him to line his pockets by concealing the fact that he was representing foreign clients, obtaining access for clients by making a long series of illegal contributions and skimming money paid by his clients."
The court filings submitted by prosecutors on Tuesday do not identify the political committees to which Mr. Zuberi steered the illegal donations, nor do the filings identify the lobbyists involved in his efforts or the politicians targeted by them.
The filings indicate that his efforts "generated marginal results," but noted that "some United State officials" were "willing to adopt defendant Zuberi's requested political positions or otherwise accommodate defendant Zuberi's wishes."
Mr. Hanna's office brought the charges against Mr. Zuberi in cooperation with the Justice Department divisions enforcing campaign finance laws and the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
The act, known as FARA, requires Americans to disclose detailed information about any lobbying or public relations work they do on behalf of foreign governments and political entities. It has become an increasing enforcement priority for the Justice Department since the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign to help Mr. Trump.
John C. Demers, the assistant attorney general in charge of the division that oversees FARA, said in a statement on Tuesday that Mr. Zuberi made false statements in his FARA filing.
"Mr. Zuberi attempted to deceive our elected officials and the American public on behalf of Sri Lanka," he said. "The Department of Justice treats these crimes with the gravity that they deserve and will continue to aggressively identify, investigate and prosecute FARA violations."

Texto completo: The secretive Justice Department inquiry into the Trump-Russia investigation's origins now includes former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, and British ex-spy Christopher Steele.
U.S. Attorney John Durham, whose investigative portfolio recently expanded to include events from the launch of the inquiry in 2016 through the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller in 2017, has taken overseas fact-finding trips. But Durham's focus on the actions taken by specific individuals makes his mission look like it could transform into a criminal investigation. And the line of questioning Durham has taken with potential witnesses — some in line with claims made by President Trump and other Republicans — puts his efforts into sharper focus.

Brennan, a strident Trump critic, told NBC News that Durham wants to interview him and Clapper as Durham looks into the intelligence community's actions as it examined possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Brennan and Clapper led the Obama administration's intelligence agencies when some Republicans allege the CIA illicitly ensnared members of the Trump campaign using informants, though Democrats have dismissed this. Brennan and Clapper played leadership roles in the intelligence community’s assessment of Russian election interference in 2016.

Brennan told NBC News he was “very comfortable with everything” he had done and complained he didn’t know what the inquiry’s legal basis was, calling Durham’s actions “bizarre.”

But Durham's actions aren't out of left field. Attorney General William Barr upset Democrats in April when he said “spying did occur” on the Trump campaign, and President Trump gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” related to the origins of the Trump-Russia inquiry in May. Barr selected Durham to be his right-hand man soon after.
Durham also asked about Strzok both writing and signing the documentation which launched the FBI's Trump-Russia counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 and launching the investigation over a weekend, an unusual series of actions. The New York Times cited former officials who defended the now-fired special agent, saying he spoke with leaders at the FBI before opening the investigation and did so on a Sunday because former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe instructed him to quickly fly to London to speak with two Australian diplomats who provided the information that prompted the investigation.

Australian diplomat Alexander Downer tipped off the bureau that Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos told him the Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos was allegedly told about this Russian “dirt” by the mysterious Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, whom Mueller said had ties to the Russian government, but whom some Republicans claim has ties to Western intelligence. Downer was prompted to tell the FBI about his conversation with Papadopoulos by Wikileaks' release of Democratic National Committee emails.
Durham has not yet interviewed Strzok, McCabe, former FBI Director James Comey, or former FBI general counsel James Baker.
Durham is speaking to witnesses about Steele, the former MI6 agent whose dossier was used to obtain secret surveillance warrants against Trump campaign associate Carter Page, and Durham wants to know why the FBI used unverified information in its filings with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, according to the New York Times. Sources reportedly said Durham expressed skepticism about the use of Steele’s dossier and worried the FBI exaggerated Steele’s importance to obtain the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants.
The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the DOJ and the FBI made extensive use of Steele's salacious dossier. The opposition research firm Fusion GPS was hired by Clinton's campaign and the DNC through the Perkins Coie law firm, and Fusion GPS then hired Steele. Clinton’s campaign received briefings about Fusion GPS's findings during 2016, and watchdog groups allege the campaign purposely concealed its actions from the Federal Election Commission. Steele’s Democratic benefactors, his desire for Trump to lose to Clinton, and the flaws with his dossier weren’t revealed to the FISA court.
DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation into FISA abuse wrapped up in September, and the New York Times reported Horowitz reviewed an assessment that MI6 handed over to the FBI which said the former spy “was honest and persistent but sometimes showed questionable judgment in pursuing targets that others viewed as a waste of time.” Horowitz’s report is expected in the coming days.
Durham also intends to interview CIA analysts and officials involved in the Russia investigation, prompting some to seek legal representation, and NBC News reported tension between the CIA and the DOJ over what classified information he should have access to. Durham has already talked to two dozen current and former FBI agents as part of his effort, according to the New York Times.
DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the department was exploring the extent to which “a number of countries” played a role in the Trump-Russia investigation, and Barr and Durham reached out to the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia. The DOJ has taken efforts to distance itself from the actions of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, whose endeavors in Ukraine are a central focus of the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry and whose associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested in New York.

Hillary Clinton is the best thing that could have happened to Tulsi Gabbard

Texto completo: Tulsi Gabbard was rightly incensed last week when Hillary Clinton falsely labeled her a “Russian asset.” But the smear has helped Gabbard’s struggling campaign far more than it hurt her — a point Gabbard has used to her advantage.

While the Hawaii Democrat expressed indignation, as did several of the other Democratic presidential hopefuls tired of Clinton’s continued attempts to insert herself into the political scene, she was also quick to take advantage of Clinton’s blatantly false allegation and general lack of popularity.

“People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my ‘political career.’ They said, ‘Clinton will never forget,’ that she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and in the media, will make sure that you are destroyed,” Gabbard says in a new campaign video. “They’ve tried to destroy my reputation and my lifetime of service because I stood up to them.” Tweet“If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone,” Gabbard continues. “And, in fact, that’s exactly the message they want to get across to you, that if you stand up against Hillary and the power party brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.”

Gabbard’s message — that the party establishment doesn’t care about the disillusioned voters in “flyover” states — is a message that resonated in 2016 among Republicans, and it now has the potential to do the same among Democrats in 2020. Ironically, Gabbard’s anti-elitism campaign resembles Trump’s. Their policies might differ, but the populist sentiments supporting their platforms are the same.

Clinton’s smear gave credibility to that message, which is exactly what happened in 2016. What exactly did Clinton expect? Has she forgotten the effect her "deplorables" insult had on Trump's campaign? It’s almost as if Clinton is a walking shill for the kind of national populism she detests.

Gabbard’s campaign is still at the rear of the pack, but she did gain nearly 2 points in Iowa after Clinton’s smear surfaced. Gabbard will likely ride this fame as long as she can. And why shouldn’t she? It’s working.

Gabbard might not be a Russian asset, but Clinton certainly seems to be Tulsi’s.

Senators hopeful about deferred maintenance bill

Texto completo: Billions of dollars in deferred maintenance of National Park Service roads and facilities might get a boost from revitalized legislation in Congress that North Dakota's U.S. senators hope will become law.
The National Park Service ties the backlog largely to limited resources for addressing aging infrastructure while visitation at parks has reached records, including in North Dakota.
U.S. Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer, both R-N.D., are among 42 co-sponsors of the Restore Our Parks Act. The bill would distribute up to $1.3 billion every year to reduce the deferred maintenance. That money would be derived from 50% of energy development revenue off federal lands. The bill would have to be renewed after five years. 
Hoeven said supporters of the bill might try to garner more support by combining it with so-called "lands bills," or state-specific legislation for public lands, such as two bills passed in 2018 allowing homeowners on Patterson Lake near Dickinson and the Jamestown Reservoir to purchase their lots from the federal government.
Hoeven and Cramer in interviews with the Tribune said they see a better chance to pass the bill than with similar legislation that failed in 2018, given the new bill's bipartisan support throughout the Senate and from the White House and conservation groups.
"I'm hopeful this year with the idea that we could get it over to the House and then they get it passed," Hoeven said.
"This is the time to get it done, I think," Cramer said.
The bill is in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, chaired by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.
It's hard to say how the bill will progress. There's a similar House bill, too, for which U.S. Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., is one of 318 co-sponsors.
"Legislation like the 'Restore Our Parks Act' is the type of creative solution that can help relieve our deferred maintenance backlog and help us fund necessary upgrades and repairs so that more Americans can have a safe and memorable experience enjoying recreational opportunities while visiting our country's national treasures," Interior senior adviser/spokesperson Carol Danko said.
To-do list
About $50 million of the $12 billion nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance is in North Dakota. As of September 2018, Theodore Roosevelt National Park had about $46.8 million, while the smaller Fort Union Trading Post near Williston and Knife River Indian Villages carried about $2.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
Cramer said deferred maintenance has a "cascading effect."
"Whether it's a pothole or a leak or shingles on a rooftop, anything, it only gets worse year to year," he said.
Visitation has surged at Theodore Roosevelt National Park in recent years. The park saw about 750,000 visitors in 2018, up from 580,000 in 2015, or 29%.
Part of that boost could be from increased media attention. The New York Times ranked the park as No. 5 on its "52 Places to Go in 2016" feature. The park's North Unit is near Watford City, where the population has ballooned in recent years due to the Bakken oil boom. 
"A major component" of the park's backlog is roads, according to Eileen Andes, chief of interpretation and public affairs.
Andes has said the park's road maintenance is a "constant issue" given the erosive geology of the Badlands. Aging structures are another concern.
A number of projects are underway to address needed work, funded by park entrance fees.
Andes said the park is removing outdated comfort stations in its two campgrounds to modernize the facilities and improve accessibility.
The stone shelter at River Bend Overlook in the park's North Unit had its shingles replaced and its masonry repaired.
The shelter offers panoramic views of the colorful Little Missouri Valley and is one of the most photographed structures in North Dakota, Andes said.
Stabilization and rehabilitation of buildings at the South Unit's Peaceful Valley Ranch are set to begin in spring 2020. The historic dude ranch once was headquarters for Depression-era federal work programs such as the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps.
The ranch dates to 1885 and also once was headquarters for the park and home to a horseback riding outfit.
Two campsites in the North Unit's Juniper Campground also are closed after eroding due to flooding of the Little Missouri River. Andes said fees could also fund their replacement.
"Maintenance of park facilities and infrastructure is going on constantly, and we have large and small projects," she said.
In a slump
U.S. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt visited the park with Hoeven, Cramer and Gov. Doug Burgum in early October. They and Park Superintendent Wendy Ross showed him a slumped section of roadway along the park's 36-mile scenic loop drive. Water eroding under the roadway led to the slump in mid-May.
The slumped section, near the colorful Badlands Overlook, led to the closure of 6 miles of the scenic drive.
"That isn't really deferred maintenance. That's a failure of the road. That's a failure of the road that means that we can't use it," Hoeven said.
Bernhardt called the slumped roadway, where the ground is still moving, "obviously a project in immediate need," but he didn't offer a time frame to fix it. Hoeven hopes the roadway will be repaired next year and was glad the Trump Cabinet member could visit the site.
"It's always good to get these guys out here to see it and make your case," he said.
Ross also was pleased Bernhardt could visit the park to see and hear about its needs. She previously said the park would be in touch with Interior about options for fixing the road, which will be assessed for repairs to come through the Federal Highway Administration.
Cramer pointed out two bison herds and a Badlands vista the group saw while driving the closed section -- scenery the public can't experience and enjoy.
"I think it's a pretty good example of how you rob the public of really what they're paying for when you have transportation problems like that," he said.

Texto completo: Correction: A prior version of this article misstated the percentages of support for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. The former vice president’s is 18% and the senator’s is 17%.
You can never underestimate the value of a political debate. Just ask South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who recently passed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on his way to third place in the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Buttigieg has vaulted himself into the top tier of candidates on the back of a convincing debate performance, according to today’s Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll of 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers.
Here’s where the race stands in Iowa: Former Vice President Joe Biden (18%) leads Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (17%), with Buttigieg capturing 13%, Sanders receiving 9%, and billionaire Tom Steyer, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, and California Sen. Kamala Harris all tied at 3%. A considerable 29% of likely Democratic caucusgoers remain undecided.
The difference between Suffolk/USA TODAY’s summer and fall Iowa polls is more than seasonal: It is a dramatic turnaround for 37-year-old Buttigieg, who more than doubled his second-tier 6% summer standing.
Even more impressive for Buttigieg is how those who watched the CNN/New York Times debate last week would align their support if the caucuses were held today. Among only debate watchers, Buttigieg topped the entire Iowa field with 19%, followed by Biden and Warren (tied at 17%), Sanders (9%), and Klobuchar (6%). Both Buttigieg (39%) and Klobuchar (28%) were seen as debate winners last week.
Buttigieg appears to be getting some traction in his age category when compared to the septuagenarians in the top tier. In the poll, Buttigieg (16%) led Warren (15%), Biden (13%), and Sanders (8%) among Iowans ages 36-55 years.
If the economy becomes a central issue in the presidential race, the Suffolk/USA TODAY poll reveals that Buttigieg may also have an edge. Among Democratic caucusgoers who said the economy is the most important issue affecting their support, Buttigieg topped the field yet again with 20%, followed by Biden and Warren, tied at 11%.
The difference between our last Iowa poll in late June and today’s poll shows the pure impact that a political debate has on candidate viability, aside from daily press releases, clarifications, and policy positions. Back in the summer, Harris had vaulted into the number two spot in Iowa. She was second only to Biden, after engaging him directly in the highly watched first Democratic debates, which took place right before Suffolk fielded that poll.
In the two weeks following the debate, Harris held firmly in second place behind Biden in most of the other public polling. But the Harris campaign, perhaps because of the mid-July timing or a lack of preparation, failed to maximize her meteoric rise in the polls and keep their candidate in the top tier.

The Suffolk/USA TODAY poll suggests that there may be a bit of debate fatigue in the works: In June, 64% of likely caucusgoers said that they watched at least one of the two debate nights. For the most recent debate, viewership dropped by about half, with only 37% of poll respondents tuning in, even though all 12 candidates shared one stage in one night. One wonders where Buttigieg would stand in the Iowa caucuses today if the debate viewership had been at the June level.
Buttigieg may follow in the footsteps of Harris’ summer swoon, but his campaign is now touting that he has more campaign offices in the state of Iowa than any other Democratic hopeful. It’s hard to say whether Buttigieg’s recent upward move in our poll is due more to his debate performance or his newly formed widespread field presence in Iowa.
In the meantime, Buttigieg is one of the two top second choices among all the candidates. Both Warren (22%) and Buttigieg (14%) led in this important category. It is a key metric in Iowa, where caucusgoers whose candidate’s support is below 15% at their caucus location must choose another candidate.
The big wildcard is how (and how many) independents (“no party”) will end up caucusing as Democrats, once they’ve changed party registration prior to the caucus. With no competitive Republican caucus, independents in Iowa may wish to be counted in the Democratic caucus. In the poll, Buttigieg was tied with Biden (13%), with Warren (7%) and Sanders (5%) trailing. A whopping 40% of independents were undecided, despite declaring their intention to participate in the Democratic caucus in the poll.
Debates, age, the economy, viability, field presence, and second choice votes. So many wildcards left to play out in the Hawkeye state, and so little time.

RALEIGH - North Carolina Theatre recently announced the casting for its November production of "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years," playing November 8-17 at Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts.
Raised in Raleigh, trailblazing African American a c t i v i s t s , sisters and best friends, Sadie and Bessie Delany - both over 100 years old - take audiences on an inspiring and entertaining journey as they recount the stories of their lives. From growing up on what is now Saint Augustine's University as the daughters of a former slave to integrating a New York suburb during the Harlem Renaissance, the sisters did it all.
Written by Emily Mann, the play was adapted from the New York Times bestselling book, "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years." Directing is Tia James, an actor, teacher and director, and now a faculty member of UNC Professional Actor Training Program.
A vocal coach and company member of PlayMakers R e p e r t o r y Company, James has been seen on Broadway in The Merchant of Venice and served as the associate artistic director for The Shakespeare Academy @ Stratford. She has directed over a dozen plays, including Hamlet, Othello, and The Mystery Plays at NYU Graduate Acting Program.
The leading roles of Sadie and Bessie Delany will be portrayed by Gayle Turner and Lakeisha Coffey, respectively. Turner previously starred on Broadway in The Wiz as Dorothy, and has performed in numerous regional productions, including The Wiz and Smokey Joe's Café.
Coffey, a St. Aug's graduate and Triangle-area based actress, has performed locally with various theatre companies since 2006. She was a part of the creative development team for the inaugural Bull City Black Theatre Festival in March 2018 in Durham, and she is also a founding member of Bulldog Ensemble Theater.
Coffey has starred in numerous local theatre productions, but NC Theatre and Theatre Raleigh patrons may remember her from the new works reading of Peace of Clay earlier this year.
Having Our Say will be performed in A.J. Fletcher Opera Theater. Visit nctheatre.com to purchase tickets or call (919) 831- 6941. For groups of 10 or more, call (919) 831-6941 x6949.

Clinton suggests Russians grooming Democrat for 2020

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Thursday the Russians are currently "grooming" a Democrat running in the presidential primary to run as a third-party candidate and champion their interests.
The comment appears to be directed at Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who has been accused of being cozy with Russia in the past.
"I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate," Clinton said, speaking on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe. "She's the favorite of the Russians."
Clinton never names Gabbard, but there are only five women running for President - Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and author Marianne Williamson - and none of the other woman have been accused of being boosted by Russia.
"They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far," Clinton said.
Gabbard responded on Twitter Friday afternoon to Clinton's comments.
"Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain," she tweeted.
"From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation," she added. "We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know - it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose."
"It's now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly."
Responding to Gabbard's attacks, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said, "Divisive language filled with vitriol and conspiracy theories? Can't imagine a better proof point than this."
Asked earlier if the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard in her comment, Merrill told CNN, "If the nesting doll fits."
"This is not some outlandish claim. This is reality," Merrill said. "If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation."
Gabbard, in a late August interview with CNN, ruled out a third-party bid.
"I will not," the Hawaii Democrat told CNN. "No, I have ruled that out."
Earlier in the week, Gabbard tried to fight off the charge that she is being pushed by Russian interests.
"Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears," Gabbard said, referring to a recent story that said she is being backed by Russians on Twitter. "This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable."
Clinton also accused Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate in both the 2012 and 2016 elections, of being a "Russian asset."
"Yes, she's a Russian asset, I mean, totally," Clinton said. "They know they can't win without a third-party candidate."
Stein's campaign, which earned nearly 1.5 million votes in the 2016 election, was part of Russia's meddling efforts, according to a host of congressional reports, including a Senate Intelligence Committee report that indicated Russian social media efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election included messaging in support of Stein.
A summation of the report's findings on "comprehensive anti-Hillary Clinton operations" said while the group's assumed Twitter personas had some pro-Clinton content, "the developed Left-wing Twitter personas were still largely anti-Clinton and expressed pro-Bernie Sanders and pro-Jill Stein sentiments."
Stein, who had dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015, has also compared Russian interference in the 2016 election to American overseas efforts.
"I think it would be naive to think that Russia did not try to interfere." But, she said, "Certainly that's what the United States does," though she added, "that's not to justify it."
"Interference is wrong and it's an assault against democracy, and it should be pursued, but (the United States) should pursue it knowing that we do it, too." - (CNN)

The phrase "Spokane's own" comes to mind as Timothy Egan returns for a stop on his book tour.
A Washington native - born in Seattle, raised in Spokane, Timothy Egan has a Husky pedigree with a degree from the University of Washington. Brought up with a love for the Pacific Northwest that was instilled by his mother, Egan became a reporter for the Seattle Post Intelligencer.
He got his break to work as a Pacific Northwest correspondent for the New York Times in 1991 during one of the worst oil disasters in American history - the Exxon Valdez spill - and he's been writing for it ever since. In 2001, Egan shared the Pulitzer Prize with fellow New York Times reporters for the project "How Race Is Lived in America."
Here's a quick rundown of his work that is interspersed between his bi-weekly opinion column for the New York Times
"A Pilgrimage to Eternity: From Canterbury to Rome in Search of a Faith" (2019)
This personal story melds a journey over the ancient trail of Via Francigena and a history of Christianity.
Reviews are in: "A pilgrimage to find religion - or truth, or the way - that pleasingly blends memoir, travelogue and history."
"The Immortal Irishman" (2017)
New York Times Bestseller, winner of 2017 Montana Book Award
An epic story of a legendary Irishman leaving you wondering how on earth all of these things could possibly happen to one person. File this one under difficult to believe but true: the story of Thomas Meagher (1823-1867), an Irishman radicalized by the famine who became a hero on three continents.
Meagher led a failed uprising against British rule, was then banished to Tasmania for life, but then moved to New York to become one of the most famous Irish Americans. Fighting for justice was in Meagher's lifebook, so he joined the U.S. Army during the Civil War, rising to the rank of brigadier general. There is even a Currier & Ives print depicting one of his successful battles.
Meagher later moved to Montana, where he was acting governor at the request of President Andrew Johnson. Meagher then died under mysterious circumstances. Records indicate that he fell overboard while sick - or drunk - traveling by steamboat down the Missouri River. Egan suggests Meagher may have been murdered.
"Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher" (2012)
Carnegie Award for Best Fiction
The name of Edward Curtis (1868-1952) is eponymous with American Indian photography, but how did that evolve? In 1896 while running a Seattle photography studio, Curtis photographed Chief Seattle's impoverished daughter Angelina (Kick-is-om-lo). Curtis was astounded that she was living in poverty in the city named for her father.
Photographing this population of original Americans consumed his life, and Curtis then made it his life's mission to photograph and chronicle Native Americans all over the country. His marriage fell apart as he traveled and photographed thousands of images of North America's indigenous citizens sponsored by enthusiasts J.P. Morgan and Theodore Roosevelt. His endeavor is referred to as the "largest anthropological enterprise ever undertaken."
"The Big Burn: Teddy Roosevelt and the Fire That Saved America" (2010)
A Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award winner and the Washington State Book Award
Bicyclists and hikers in the Northwest know the hiking trails along the Idaho-Montana border that skirt the worst forest fire in history. The Great Fire of 1910 scorched 3 million acres and killing as many as 100 people of the 10,000 gathered by the forest rangers to help fight the tumultuous force of nature. The magnitude of this fire, although devastating, also was a turning point in forest management in the United States under the leadership of outdoorsman President Theodore Roosevelt and chief forester Gifford Pinchot. Conservation was an unheard-of concept, and out of this disaster, Roosevelt and Pinchot were motivated to create ownership of the forest in every U.S. citizen.
"The Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl" (2006)
2006 National Book Award for Nonfiction and the Washington State Book Award - featured prominently in Ken Burns' 2012 documentary "The Dust Bowl"
Ten long years of agriculture-destroying drought and dust plagued the United States during the Depression, particularly the states of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska and Colorado, the area referred to as the Dust Bowl. The magnitude of one of the greatest agricultural natural disasters in American history is chronicled by following a dozen families and their survival.
"The Winemaker's Daughter" (2004)
Egan's facts find their place in his first novel as the New York Times noted: " A good read showcasing Mr. Egan's lived-in sense of place, as well as his knowledge of wine culture." The story centers around Brunella Cartolano, an architect who strives to save the family vineyards in the arid wine country east of Washington's Cascade Mountains.
"Lasso the Wind - Away to the New West" (1999)
Winner of the Mountains & Plains Independent Booksellers Association Award. A New York Times Notable Book of the Year.
A classic road trip across the county includes the American West - though not perhaps all of the places that Egan visits in "Lasso the Wind." In his quest to capture the old and new stories of the area, Egan dissects a new location in each chapter - encompassing travel, history, geography, culture and geology of the area.
"Breaking Blue" (1992)
An unsolved murder case for 54 years slowly unraveled as a diligent student and Spokane cop writing his master's thesis on the 10 previous sheriffs of Pend Oreille County discovered a 1955 deathbed statement. Forget about quick resolution of today's "Live PD," this story weaved through multiple secrets as witnesses between the ages of 80 and 90 years old came forward to confess what they knew of the cover up of town marshal George Conniff's murder. (Characters in Spokane's history are hardly lacking. You may recognize the more things change, the more they stay the same.)
"The Good Rain - Across Time and Terrain in the Pacific Northwest" (1991)
Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award winner
Considered one of the essential books on the history of the Northwest, Egan retraces the travels of Theodore Winthrop, one of the areas first travel writers, to discover what has changed in the 100+ years since Winthrop's own book was written.

Texto completo: It was remembered as Rudy Giuliani's finest moment.
It was the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2001. The Twin Towers were gone. Thousands dead, many thousands more presumed killed. The United States, and New York City in particular, was gripped with fear.
Giuliani, in the final months of his eight years as mayor of New York City, was discussing the attacks at a press conference. All eyes in the nation, maybe the world, were on him.
"The city's going to survive, we're going to get through it," said the grim-faced mayor. "It's going to be a very, very difficult time. I don't think we yet know the pain we're going to feel when we find out who we lost. But the thing we have to focus on now is getting the city through this and surviving and being stronger for it."
Eighteen years later, Giuliani was in a very different mode as he embarked on a media blitz to defend President Donald Trump amid the escalating Ukraine scandal. The former mayor accused Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts of providing "distorted" coverage and called former Vice President Joe Biden "Slimy Joe." He performed a mock impersonation of U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. He sparred with liberal radio host Christopher Hahn on Laura Ingraham's Fox TV show.
"Shut up, moron. Shut up. Shut up," Giuliani told Hahn. "You don't know what you're talking about, idiot."
To some who have known him for decades, that's the same Giuliani they remember.
"He was always a malicious f---," said Fernando Ferrer, the borough president of the Bronx from 1987 to 2001.
But to many others, the Rudy Giuliani of the Donald Trump era — first as a campaign surrogate and now as the president's personal attorney and investigator — has been far from the calm and measured figure who helped lead the nation through the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. He has embraced the president's "witch hunt" language and been widely mocked for his erratic and sometimes contradictory television appearances.
His aggressive defense of Trump in the face of impeachment has left many Americans, including some of his own former campaign and mayoral staff, wondering how "America's Mayor" has gambled his legacy to serve as an attack dog for a deeply unpopular president and push a widely discredited claim that has become the focus of a House impeachment inquiry.
Giuliani's role as Trump's arch-defender has also raised questions about the business dealings of a man who once pleaded poverty but since entering private life has amassed millions through speeches, security and legal services and, according to reports, relationships with Russian oligarchs, Ukrainian investors and the Qatari government.
Now Giuliani, once known as a corruption-busting prosecutor who brought down mob figures, is being investigated for his overseas business dealings by the Southern District of New York, the office he once commanded. Two Ukrainian-born associates of Giuliani's, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were indicted last week on charges of funneling foreign campaign contributions to a Super PAC supporting Trump.
Parnas and Fruman also helped connect Giuliani with figures in Ukraine in his quest to dig up dirt on Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden, according to multiple reports.
Giuliani, who could not be reached for comment, was not charged and has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
Giuliani seen as both great defender and 'conspiracy nut' Reactions from Giuliani's former associates about his new role as Trump's defender-in-chief run the gamut from dismay to full-throated support. Giuliani has squandered the sense of goodwill he engendered after he led the city following the 9/11 attacks, one camp says. The other says the ex-mayor is doing the job the media won't: exposing corruption among Democrats and revealing that the years-long investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential race was a witch hunt targeting Trump.
"He's not doing anything that he hasn't done his whole career," said longtime Giuliani ally and former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, who in 2010 was sentenced to four years in federal prison after admitting he used his position to get a company to pay for renovations of his home. "He's very aggressive. He's a very smart attorney. He is defending his client the best way he sees fit. If I was in the president's position, I wouldn't want anyone else in that position over him."
Walter Mack is an attorney who worked under Giuliani in the U.S. attorney's office as chief of its organized crime unit, and later as a deputy police commissioner during Giuliani's first term as mayor. Giuliani ousted him from both jobs. Giuliani canned him the first time after Mack openly criticized him for seeking too much publicity, which The Village Voice's Tom Robbins in 2006 compared to "trying to tell Donald Trump to stay out of tabloid gossip columns."
Giuliani's mayoral predecessor, David Dinkins, hired Mack as deputy police commissioner in 1994, a gig he lost one year into Giuliani's mayoralty. Mack still remembers being dispatched twice, but said he's not going to criticize his former boss.
"I think he's taken some risks but you do that as a defense lawyer for a client," Mack said. "You take risks if you think it's going to serve your client's interests ... His job is to defend the president."
Ken Frydman counts himself among the former Giuliani associates who is now appalled at his behavior. Frydman, press secretary for Giuliani's 1993 mayoral bid, went public with his disenchantment in an Oct. 7 op-ed in The New York Times criticizing Giuliani's defense of Trump.
Giuliani "cleaned up the city" and made it safer, creating a legacy that is at risk now because of his representation of Trump, Frydman said. In his media appearances defending the president, Frydman said, Giuliani is not acting like the mayor he knew.
"He sounded like Trump and he looks like a right-wing conspiracy nut. He's shuffling papers and he's screaming and he's yelling," Frydman said in an interview. "The guy I worked with was measured and a master of message control and discipline."
Mack, while defending Giuliani, echoed Frydman's thoughts on how Giuliani appears when he's defending the president on Fox News. If he ran into Giuliani today, Mack said, he'd ask him whether he's OK.
"I'm concerned about him," Mack said. "I think some people are worried about whether he's too much into this."
Kerik brushed aside any worries about Giuliani's state of mind.
"I know Ken thinks he's lost his f---ing mind," Kerik said. "But in reality, as somebody that's talked to him regularly, I probably talk to him every other day, I don't see anything different about him other than the fact that he's much more vocal today."
A 'mean man' Giuliani, who made headlines as a mob-busting, tough-on-Wall Street prosecutor after he was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1983, captured New York City Hall in 1993 by ousting Dinkins (who had defeated Giuliani four years prior). He was the first Republican elected mayor of the city in nearly 30 years.
Democrats who dealt with him during his mayoral term do not share Frydman's sentiment that Giuliani has changed since his days at Gracie Mansion.
Council members who served during Giuliani's reign say they are flummoxed by this idea that the Giuliani they see on Fox News defending Trump is a different Giuliani than once led New York City.
"Rudy's a mean man," said Sal Albanese, a Brooklyn councilman for 16 years. "He's been a mean man, unethical man, a liar, his entire career."
Albanese and Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president ticked off a list of controversies they said show Giuliani's true character: falsely alleging a youth commissioner appointed by his predecessor of a crime; hiring the unqualified son of a political buddy to run the city's Housing Development Corporation; myriad divisive comments about the city's black community; and hiring Kerik.
Albanese acknowledged Giuliani seems "more unhinged" now, but said the Rudy he sees on Fox News is the same Rudy he tussled with at New York City Hall.
"His core is still there," he said. "The ends justify the means, authoritarian streak, constantly lying, distorting, dissembling — that was always there. And unfortunately, he's got Trump's ear."
Ruth Messinger is the former Manhattan Borough Council President who unsuccessfully challenged Giuliani in the 1997 mayor's race. Messinger said Giuliani's former associates who see a change in him now remember his corruption-busting early days as mayor, and his steady leadership in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, but not much in between. From the last year of his first term through his second, Messinger said, Giuliani did not use his political skills for the good of New Yorkers.
"The idea of a crusader, somebody against corruption, somebody who's determined to shake things up and produce results, was not a throughline for his years as mayor," Messinger said.
National spotlight after 9/11 Giuliani, who won his first mayoral race in 1993 in a squeaker then won re-election by a wide margin, saw his popularity dip toward the end of his second term as mayor. In 1998, a New York Times/CBS News poll said nearly two-thirds of New York City voters approved of Giuliani's job performance. By April 2000, his job approval dropped to 45% in the same poll.
The 9/11 attacks brought Giuliani national recognition and he saw his approval rating skyrocket. He became a national star, and for a while he was the front-runner to win the Republican nomination for president in 2008, leading John McCain by 17 points in a November 2007 Wall Street Journal poll.
But his campaign to win The White House was a disaster, with Giuliani conceding the important early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire to focus instead on winning Florida. He finished third there and ended his campaign.
His popularity has flipped since his high point after the Sept. 11 attacks, when 61% of people polled by NBC and the Wall Street Journal viewed him as "very positive." Now just 12% view him as "very positive," according to the poll.
Frydman described Giuliani as a "Diet Coke and pizza guy" when he worked for him. But since leaving office, he has been much more indulgent.
In 2001, in the middle of his divorce from Donna Hanover, Giuliani claimed through a lawyer that he had just $7,000 in assets. His wealth has grown considerably since then. This summer, legal proceedings for Giuliani's third divorce, from Judith Giuliani, revealed he spent $7,131 on fountain pens alone, according to the New York Times.
Giuliani's rise from the financial ashes was fueled by his post-mayoral consulting firm and his highly lucrative speech-giving gigs. Between January 2006 and February 2017, he earned $9.2 million from those gigs, according to the financial disclosure form he filed in advance of his ultimately failed 2008 presidential bid.
In May 2006 alone, he made $1.3 million total from 20 speeches to the City of Winnipeg, Shore Memorial Health Foundation, Merrill Lynch & Co. and more.
Giuliani owns or co-owns numerous luxury properties in New York and Florida.
He purchased a 10th floor apartment on East 66th Street for $4.77 million in 2002, the year before he married Judith. The couple spent $3.2 million in 2004 to build a mansion in Southampton, property records show. The four-bedroom home overlooks the Southampton Hunt & Polo Club.
Their two Palm Beach homes are a few miles from Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club. The Giulianis bought a two-bedroom condo at Palm Beach Towers for $410,000 in 2004 and a two-bedroom condo on South Lake Street Drive set them back $1.4 million in 2010.
The Lake Street Drive condo is on the market for $3 million.
At 75 years old, Giuliani is most likely in his final act in public life. It may be his biggest and, depending on how the impeachment inquiry turns out, could overshadow his achievements as mayor. But he is most likely to have his legacy tied to Trump, said Fred Siegel, a former political adviser to Giuliani who wrote about him, "The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York, and the Genius of American Life."
"The other things are there — the reduction in crime, the reduction in welfare, his achievements as a prosecutor. But this is a whole other ball of wax, to use a tired expression. The whole future of the country is on the line," said Siegel, now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. "It's hard to imagine it's not going to have profound impact on how we see him down the road."

More people should know about the Katherine Small Gallery and bookshop — a treasure of a spot specializing in graphic design and typography — and their latest exhibit, “Matthew Carter 's Top Ten (minus one)," is good reason to stop in. Carter, a MacArthur-winning Cambridge (England) born, and Cambridge (Mass) dwelling type designer, designed, among other things, the masthead and type for this very paper (the original hand-drawn lettering for the Globe's masthead is on display at the gallery now), as well as the type for the New York Times, and familiar fonts including Georgia and Verdana. If you're lucky, Carter himself might drop in while you're there, as happened to this correspondent on a rainy October morning. With humility and humor he walked through the alphabet portfolio he designed, a glorious collection of lowercase letters that you can take home for $20k. Looking at the o, for example – a simple, bold velvety black donut – he remarked, “The simplest letters are the hardest. There's no where to hide." Even if Carter's not there, invite the kind gallery-bookshop owner and acclaimed designer Michael Russem to show you. The portfolio — and the space itself — defamiliarizes part of the visual world we so often take for granted, our a's and b's and c's. The show runs through January 25 and it's at 108 Beacon Street in Somerville. Visit ksmallgallery.com for more information.
Meeting of the minds
The annual Concord Festival of Authors has taken place for more than a quarter-century, and continues this year through the end of the month, with a number of readings, events, workshops, and discussions. On Sunday, take the Wayside Walk in Literary Concord, exploring the neighborhood where the Alcotts, Emerson, and Hawthorne lived and worked; Sunday evening, Sigrid Nunez (“ The Friend ") gives the keynote speech. On Tuesday, take a Mindful Haiku Workshop; on Wednesday, join award-winning memoirist Grace Talusan (“ The Body Papers ") for a Memoir Matters Workshop. Whitney Scharer (“ The Age of Light ") and Christopher Castellani (“ Leading Men ") will talk historical fiction on Wednesday evening. And on Saturday, Harvard professor and anti-slavery authority John Stauffer will receive the Miller Award for Excellence in American History. And next Sunday, short story master Peter Orner will discuss the form. In the following week, look for events with Marjan Kamali (“ The Stationary Shop ") and Lewis Hyde (“ A Primer for Forgetting "). For more information and a complete schedule visit concordfestivalofauthors.org.
Interesting developments
Dedham-based poet Sarah Dickenson Snyder's third collection of poetry, “ With a Polaroid Camera " (Main Street Rag), out earlier this month, moves faraway and home again. Muscular and lyrical, her lean lines explore the wide world with a haiku-style simplicity that belies the force of what flows between, behind, and under her words. The natural world is given sensitive attention, and Snyder brings mystery to the simple things: “Seaweed, the sea/ deepening,/ a man with a smile, a naked/ chest, two arms—/ the blue kayak/ and a dog/ in the small hole/ where a person could have been." From Rwanda, Rishikesh, Luang Prabang, and Otuschi, to the small downstairs bathroom wallpapered with lines from Shakespeare, to the squirrels and rhododendrons in the yard, Snyder knows that the sweep of history, the triumphs, the massacres, our hearts thumping in sorrow and joy, all fall below the “the same sun,/ the same rain."
Coming Out

“Making Comics" by Lynda Barry (Drawn & Quarterly)
“The Queens of Animation: The Untold Story of the Women Who Transformed the World of Disney and Made Cinematic History" by Nathalia Holt (Little, Brown) (all Cq)
Pick of the Week
Devon at Newtonville Books recommends “ Fly Already " by Etgar Keret: “These stories are as playful and whimsical as they are deeply thoughtful. In Keret's trademark brevity he weaves narratives that make you think/laugh/cry, and that never fail to surprise you. (Plus, the cover is too fun to resist.)"

Tainted Alcohol Not to Blame for Tourists' Deaths

Texto completo: The Caribbean country was thrown into a crisis this year by a spate of tourist deaths. The F.B.I. finding has bolstered Dominican authorities' claim that the deaths were natural.
The F.B.I. ruled out poisoned alcohol as the cause of two American tourists' deaths in the Dominican Republic in May, bolstering the country's findings that a spate of tourist deaths this year were not the result of foul play, a State Department spokesperson said on Friday.
The Dominican Republic's economy relies in part on drawing visitors to its beach resorts, and the country became engulfed in a crisis this summer when the families of multiple American tourists said their loved ones had died under suspicious circumstances. Several had sipped alcohol before their deaths, leading to one theory that tainted drinks were to blame.
The revelation Friday seemed to lend some support to what the Dominican authorities, despite a flood of negative news coverage, had argued: that the deaths, while tragic, were not occurring at an unusual rate. Tourists die on vacation every year, and the State Department has maintained that there has not been an uptick in reported deaths.
F.B.I. investigators did not give their own assessment of the cause of the deaths. They assisted the Dominican Republic National Police by conducting toxicology tests for three cases, including what to many seemed the most suspicious deaths: a couple from Maryland, Nathaniel E. Holmes and Cynthia A. Day, who died overnight in the same hotel room in La Romana.
The F.B.I. ruled out methanol poisoning from alcohol for the deaths, the State Department spokesperson said.
The Dominican authorities had earlier found no evidence of foul play or violence and said the cause of the deaths was respiratory failure brought on by fluid in the lungs, known as pulmonary edema.
Steven E. Bullock, a lawyer for the couple's family, said in response to the F.B.I. results that his clients' deaths still warranted further review.
"You had a couple that died of the same ailment at the same time, and they want to say that it's natural causes," Mr. Bullock said with a scoff. "I think there's something for us to continue to look into."
A relative of Miranda Schaup-Werner, 41, of Allentown, Pa., whose death in La Romana the F.B.I. also assisted with investigating, referred questions to a lawyer who did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.
More than 2.7 million Americans visit the Dominican Republic each year.

Texto completo: For Press Democrat photographer Kent Porter, Oct. 17, 1989, started out as another day at the ballpark.
Hired by the newspaper two years earlier, Porter, a 27-year-old who grew up in Lake County, had shot scores of Giants games at Candlestick Park and was set up that fateful day for the third game of the World Series against the Oakland A’s.
By day’s end, Porter had — at great personal risk and with abundant perspiration — nailed a photograph of two cars trapped in the collapse of the upper span on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, 7 miles from the ballpark that was demolished in 2015.
Snapped up by the Associated Press, the photo was published around the world and was the first of four Porter photos to make the front page of the New York Times, which owned The Press Democrat from 1985 to 2012.
It is, Porter said, “a ho-hum photo of a car stuck on a bridge,” lacking a clear human figure photographers typically rely on to establish scale.
But, he said, “I was in the right place at the right time to make the right picture.”
When the magnitude 6.9 temblor struck at 5:04 p.m., Porter bolted from the stadium, shot some images of broken glass on the streets of the Financial District, then drove to the Ferry Building intent on getting to the ruptured span.
Police had closed the bridge, so Porter set out on foot and wound up running most of the way east to Treasure Island, with two cameras over his shoulders, three lenses in a fanny pack and 30 rolls of film in a pouch on his belt. To evade roadblocks, Porter three times resorted to climbing over the bridge railing and scaling the exposed ladders between the two decks, with nothing between him and the bay water far below.
The ladders have since been enclosed by locked steel brackets.
At Treasure Island, he met a truckload of sailors, wearing blue jeans and blue shirts, which matched Porter’s attire. They gave him a white cap and peacoat to blend in and delivered him to the broken edge of the upper deck, which had dropped like a trapdoor amid the shaking that did $6 billion in damage.
“I walked right up to the split,” he recalled, pressed for time as daylight was dimming.
With a man holding his belt from behind, Porter leaned over the edge, bracing his camera against the bridge to keep it steady. “I’m shooting away,” he said, while doubting his safety in the event of an aftershock.
He had no way of knowing what was on the film as he made his way back to the AP photo trailer parked at the stadium.
All eyes in the crowded trailer fixed on him, in a sweat-soaked shirt, and Porter’s first thought was the photos were poorly exposed and he had blown it completely.
Then Peter Leabo, the AP photo editor in San Francisco, shook his hand and said, “Helluva photo.”
Jodie Steck, then the PD’s photo editor, hugged him and said, “It’s international. People are calling and asking about it.”
The iconic photo never won any awards, but Porter has many in a career of covering wildfires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and riots.
And the story of how he got that shot on the Bay Bridge is “one I’ll tell until the day I die,” he said.

Texto completo: Los Angeles vs. Los Angeles, Part One … of many.
Yes, it’s finally on. Ever since the Clippers moved here in 1984, people have pushed the notion of an intracity rivalry, but between owner Donald Sterling’s farcical bumbling and the Lakers’ majesty, there never was one.
Now there is. You could argue there has been one for years with the Clippers going 23-5 against the Lakers the past seven seasons, but it’s not about winning games in the regular season. It’s about which team(s) can go deep into the playoffs, the only thing that counts here … and it could wind up being “both of them.”
In any case, I expect to write about 20 or so Lakers-Clippers updates.
I know, why so few?
Hey, the season is only 25 weeks long or I would do more.
It’s not just the local teams, fans and press girding for excitement.
Until recent years, New York was the capital of NBA writers, with access to league officials leading to scoops for media heavyweights, starting with the New York Post’s Pete Vecsey, who invented the breezy notion of NBA columns with his slashing, news-hound style.
Vecsey retired to be replaced by … no one. Instead of capitalizing on the opportunity, the Post’s struggling rival, the New York Daily News, laid off NBA columnist Mitch Lawrence, as well as star Knicks beat writer Frank Isola, who tripped adroitly into an on-air role at ESPN.
Now with the Knicks as squalid as the Sterling-era Clippers, East Coast media outlets are sending flights of NBA correspondents west.
The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis notes a line of newly minted, L.A.-based NBA writers. The New York Times and Washington Post each have one, as do NBA.com and Fox.com. The Athletic has six writers and podcasters based here. ESPN has a veritable bureau focused on the NBA with Rachel Nichols, Ramona Shelburne, Dave McMenamin, Baxter Holmes, Kevin Arnovitz and Ohm Youngmisuk.
Los Angeles, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay told Curtis, has become “Hemingway’s Paris of NBA media dorks.”
As for wrinkles, the dorks will have plenty to keep themselves occupied.
The Lakers want to go back to being the Lakers of Old … which they haven’t been in this decade, missing the playoffs the past six seasons while averaging 55 losses.
Their immediate challenge is securing Anthony Davis, who refused to commit himself beyond this season upon arrival. (“I have one year here, so I’m going make the best of this year. And when that time comes around in the summer or, you know, whenever the season’s over – hopefully, around, you know, mid-June, after we just had a parade and I need a couple days to think – then we can talk about that.”)
At 26 to Kawhi Leonard’s 28 and Paul George’s 29, Davis was the prize of the summer – or would have been with any assurance of keeping him – representing a bridge to a future that would enable the Lakers to recruit more stars to join him, as LeBron James recruited A.D. to join him.
So, Lakers fans wouldn’t want to see anything go too wrong this season.
You know, the way things went despite the arrival of James last season.
The Clippers conquered respectability, averaging 52 wins over the past seven seasons. Their challenge is legitimacy in a market in which the Lakers long ago raised the standard to championship-or-bust.
Now the Clippers directory starts with owner Steve Ballmer, GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, heading a staff of young officials whom other teams keep trying to steal.
Their Blake Griffin-Chris Paul-DeAndre Jordan trio that unraveled two seasons ago was a star-studded show, just not good enough to reach the Western Conference finals.
It remains to be seen how far the less glamorous, more efficient Kawhi-PG-Lou Williams-Montrezl Harrell nucleus gets, but they look like legitimate contenders (and NBA GMs appear to agree).
It also remains to be seen if the Clippers can peel off Lakers fans.
It never has happened, but there has never been an opportunity like this.
Harry Bluebond, a die-hard Lakers fan, notes he will have more interest in the Clippers with “so many pieces in place and with a great infrastructure from Ballmer to Frank to (Coach) Doc (Rivers) to Kahwi, George, Lou, Montrezl.”
On the other hand, Bluebond has seen Lakers owner Jeanie Buss “passing on Jerry West when I knew he wanted back in with the Lakers as a consultant,” to Magic Johnson quitting, to LeBron’s denouncing Daryl Morey’s use of freedom of speech regarding the Hong Kong protestors, noting, “It will take a little time to settle back with the Lakers.”
Now to see if this will again be their town. It’s a tale of one city, but whose?

Resumen: "Modern Love," inspired by the popular New York Times column of the same name and premiering Friday, Oct. 18, looks at love in all of its complicated forms, with each episode brought to life by an impressive cast, including Anne Hathaway, Cristin Milioti, Gary Carr, Catherine Keener, Andy Garcia, Tina Fey, John Slattery and Sofia Boutella. The opening episode, titled "When the Doorman Is Your Main Man," introduces us to young New York singleton Maggie (Milioti), whose everyday comings and goings are observed by her apartment building’s doorman, Guzmin (Laurentiu Possa). A subsequent episode, titled "Take Me as I Am, Whoever I Am," deals with mental illness as told through the story of Lexi (Hathaway), a bipolar woman we meet as she’s going food shopping at 7 a.m., dressed to the nines and feeling so good about herself there is a production number complete with leaping dancers going on behind her.

Texto completo: Amazon anthology series explores ‘Modern Love’ in its many forms Love, it is said, can come in many forms.
There is romantic love, love between a parent and child and between best friends. And then there are a good many that are harder to define. And a few are explored to entertaining effect in a smart new comedy anthology series dropping this week on Amazon.
"Modern Love," inspired by the popular New York Times column of the same name and premiering Friday, Oct. 18, looks at love in all of its complicated forms, with each episode brought to life by an impressive cast, including Anne Hathaway, Cristin Milioti, Gary Carr, Catherine Keener, Andy Garcia, Tina Fey, John Slattery and Sofia Boutella.
The opening episode, titled "When the Doorman Is Your Main Man," introduces us to young New York singleton Maggie (Milioti), whose everyday comings and goings are observed by her apartment building’s doorman, Guzmin (Laurentiu Possa). He’s a former Albanian sniper with a protective streak and an eye for character, and what he sees in some of Maggie’s dates, he doesn’t like. And he tells her so.
"I was really touched by the nuance of it," Milioti says of the storyline. "And it wasn’t romantic love. It was a love you couldn’t put your finger on. And I was really touched by her, too, because I feel like there’s multiple love stories that go on within it. It’s her and the love with the doorman, platonic but also father/daughter, also something you can’t quite put your finger on. ...
"And then I think ... it’s a love story between her and herself," she continues, "that she tried to conform to be what other people wanted her to be, like on all those failed dates, dumbing herself down and going out with guys who weren’t even listening to her. And she makes this really brave decision and she sees it through and she comes into her own."
A subsequent episode, titled "Take Me as I Am, Whoever I Am," deals with mental illness as told through the story of Lexi (Hathaway), a bipolar woman we meet as she’s going food shopping at 7 a.m., dressed to the nines and feeling so good about herself there is a production number complete with leaping dancers going on behind her. There, she encounters Jeff (Carr), a nice guy who shares her sense of humor. They hit it off and agree to go out on a date. And then her disorder asserts itself.
"It’s this huge block in Lexi’s life," Hathaway says, "and she talks about that. She talks about just needing one person, just one person to accept all of her. And that’s really what we all, I think, want. And she gets it. She doesn’t get it from the person that, I think, any of us expect her to get it from in the beginning of the episode. But that one person giving her the space, being patient, being compassionate, and being a true, loving person in her life changes everything for her. It gives her hope and gives her a future."

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
MARC-ANDRÉ HAMELIN at Carnegie Hall (Oct. 22, 8 p.m.). Hamelin has always relished performing the most technically challenging of piano music, and there is plenty of it in this recital, with pieces by Scriabin, Prokofiev, and Samuil Feinberg. But this Canadian pianist has recently been recording more canonical works, including a fine account of Schubert's final sonata, the last work on the program here. Schubert has long been a specialty of another pianist who is in town in the coming week, Paul Lewis, but the British pianist's 92nd Street Y recital (Oct. 24 at 7:30 p.m.) focuses instead on composers he plays with equal insight: Haydn, Brahms and Beethoven.
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
INTERNATIONAL CONTEMPORARY ENSEMBLE at N.Y.U. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts (Oct. 18-19, 7:30 p.m.). The program for these concerts by our most important new-music ensemble comprises two recent works by George Lewis: "Soundlines: A Dreaming Track," a monodrama based on diaries kept by the conductor Steven Schick during a 2006 walk from the United States-Mexico border to the Bay Area, and "P. Multitudinis," derived from Spinoza.
212-998-4941, nyuskirball.org
VIJAY IYER at Miller Theater (Oct. 24, 8 p.m.). Miller continues to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its composer portraits with this look at an artist who sits easily at the intersection of jazz and classical, as a composer, pianist and more. Prime of place is "Trouble," a piece that is part of the enterprising violinist Jennifer Koh's New American Concerto commissioning project, but there are also performances of "Crisis Modes," "The Law of Returns" and "Song for Flint," in its world premiere. Iyer and Koh are joined by the Knights.
212-854-7799, millertheatre.com
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Oct. 18-19, 8 p.m.; Oct. 22, 7:30 p.m.). Unsuk Chin won the Philharmonic's Marie-Josée Kravis Prize for New Music in 2018, earning her $ 200,000 and a commission. While we wait for that, starting this weekend there's a chance to hear "Su," a concerto for sheng, a Chinese mouth organ, which premiered in 2009; Wu Wei is the soloist. Guesting on the podium is Susanna Malkki, who also conducts Haydn's Symphony No. 22 and Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra." At the end of the coming week (Oct. 24 at 7:30 p.m., through Oct. 26), Stéphane Denève takes the baton for programs that include Jennifer Higdon's "Blue Cathedral" and Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, with Emanuel Ax.
212-875-5656, nyphil.org
[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
'ORFEO ED EURIDICE' at the Metropolitan Opera (Oct. 20, 3 p.m.; Oct. 24, 8 p.m.; through Nov. 10). Perhaps of all the composers whose work we overlook today, Christoph Willibald Gluck has a claim to have been the most influential. Hear why with these all too rare performances of his take on the Orpheus myth, in Mark Morris's production from 2007. Jamie Barton sings Orfeo opposite the Euridice of Hei-Kyung Hong; Hera Hyesang Park is Amore. Mark Wigglesworth conducts.
212-362-6000, metopera.org
TAKACS QUARTET at the 92nd Street Y (Oct. 18, 7:30 p.m.; Oct. 20, 3 p.m.). News flash from the string quartet front: Geraldine Walther, the violist for the past 14 years of this unceasingly excellent quartet, is hanging up her bow and retiring next year. And what a way for her to start saying goodbye, with this cycle of the complete quartets of Bartok, the odd-numbered ones on Friday, evens on Sunday.

Texto completo: The automation obsession is an escapist fantasy.
One of the less discussed parts of Tuesday's Democratic debate was the exchange that took place over automation and how to deal with it. But it's worth focusing on that exchange, because it was interesting -- by which I mean depressing. CNN's Erin Burnett, one of the moderators, asked a bad question, and the debaters by and large -- with the perhaps surprising exception of Bernie Sanders -- gave pretty bad answers.
So let me make a plea to the Democrats: Please don't go down the robot rabbit hole.
Burnett declared that a recent study shows that "about a quarter of U.S. jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years." What the study actually says is less alarming: It finds that a quarter of U.S. jobs will face "high exposure to automation over the next several decades."
But if you think even that sounds bad, ask yourself the following question: When, in modern history, has something like that statement not been true?
After all, in the late 1940s America had about seven million farmers and around 12 million production workers in manufacturing. Machinery could and did take over much of the work those Americans were doing -- and people at the time wondered where the new jobs would come from. If you think that concerns about automation are somehow new, bear in mind that Kurt Vonnegut's novel "Player Piano," envisioning a dystopian future in which machines have taken away all the jobs, was published in ... 1952.
Yet the generation that followed was a golden age for American workers, who saw dramatic increases in their income, with many entering a rapidly growing middle class.
You might say that this time is different, because the pace of technological change is so much faster. But that's not what the data say. On the contrary, worker productivity -- which is how we measure the extent to which workers are being replaced by machines -- has lately been growing much more slowly than in the past; it rose less than half as much from 2007 to 2018 as it did over the previous 11 years.
Which makes you wonder what Andrew Yang is talking about. Yang has based his whole campaign on the premise that automation is destroying jobs en masse and that the answer is to give everyone a stipend -- one that would fall far short of what decent jobs pay. As far as I can tell, he's offering an inadequate solution to an imaginary problem, which is in a way kind of impressive.
Let me also give a shout-out to Joe Biden, who echoed Yang's talk about a "fourth industrial revolution." More on that in a minute.
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
Elizabeth Warren questioned Burnett's premise, saying that the principal reason we're losing jobs is trade policy that has encouraged jobs to move overseas. This claim was slammed by the fact-checkers at The Associated Press, who declared that automation was the "primary culprit" in manufacturing job loss between 2000 and 2010. As it happens, Warren was more right than the supposed fact-checkers; reasonable estimates say that trade was responsible for a large share of manufacturing job loss in the decade before the Great Recession.
Warren was surely wrong to suggest, however, that changing trade policy would do much to bring good jobs back. She got onto much sounder footing when she moved on to her wider agenda of tackling inequality and the power of the wealthy.
The best answer, as I said, came from Sanders. No, I don't support his proposed job guarantee, which probably isn't workable. But he was right to say that there's plenty of work to do in America, and right to call for large-scale public investment, which even mainstream economists have been advocating as a response to persistent economic weakness.
Why? Because the persistent weakness -- yes, we have low unemployment at the moment, but thanks only to extremely low interest rates, and we're very poorly prepared for the next recession -- isn't about automation; it's about inadequate private spending.
So what's with the fixation on automation? It may be inevitable that many tech guys like Yang believe that what they and their friends are doing is epochal, unprecedented and changes everything, even if history begs to differ. But more broadly, as I've argued in the past, for a significant part of the political and media establishment, robot-talk -- i.e., technological determinism -- is in effect a diversionary tactic.
That is, blaming robots for our problems is both an easy way to sound trendy and forward-looking (hence Biden talking about the fourth industrial revolution) and an excuse for not supporting policies that would address the real causes of weak growth and soaring inequality.
So harping on the dangers of automation, while it may sound tough-minded, is in practice a sort of escapist fantasy for centrists who don't want to confront truly hard questions. And progressives like Warren and Sanders who reject technological determinism and face up to the political roots of our problems are, on this issue at least, the actual hardheaded realists in the room.
Other Democrats should follow their lead. They should focus on the real issues, and not get sidetracked by the pseudo-issue of automation.

House Republicans aim to force vote on Schiff censure

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rep. Andy Biggs will attempt to force a vote on his resolution to censure House Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff on the House floor this week, having initiated the process Wednesday.
Biggs’ censure effort has the backing of House Republican leaders – an uncommon alliance between the party’s establishment and the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.
The censure resolution includes allegations that Schiff purposely misled the public in his comments on the Intelligence Committee’s interactions with a whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry.
“Whereas these actions of Chairman Schiff misled the American people, bring disrepute upon the House of Representatives, and make a mockery of the impeachment process, one of this chamber’s most solemn constitutional duties,” reads the resolution.
Biggs brought up his proposal Wednesday as a privileged resolution, a proced- ural move that gives the measure precedence over the regular order of business and allows a resolution to leapfrog or interrupt other pending matters before the chamber.
The House has two legislative days to decide when the chamber would debate and vote on Biggs’ privileged censure resolution.
The proposal alleges what Republicans say is a pattern of misleading and concealed information on the impeachment inquiry from the public and other members of Congress.
“Whereas, according to a New York Times article on October 2, 2019, Chairman Schiff’s committee staff met with the whistleblower prior to the filing of his complaint, and staff members communicated the content of the complaint to Chairman Schiff,” the resolution reads.
“Whereas Chairman Schiff concealed his dealings with the whistleblower from the rest of the Intelligence Committee, and when asked directly in a television interview whether he had any contact with the whistleblower, he lied to the American people and said, ‘We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.’”
The resolution also takes aim at Schiff’s characterization of a phone call between President Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president during a recent Intelligence Committee hearing.
A censure is a formal, majority vote in the House on a resolution disapproving of a member’s conduct, generally with the additional requirement that the member stand in the well of the chamber and receive a verbal rebuke and reading of the resolution by the speaker.
A total of 23 members have been censured in the House for misconduct ranging from using insulting language to assaulting other lawmakers. More recently, censures have stemmed from behavior such as payroll fraud, sexual misconduct and financial improprieties.

Texto completo: For years, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been working diligently to court Chinese regulators to open the country’s door for Facebook. To show his sincerity, Zuckerberg has gone to such lengths as picking up Mandarin, visiting China seven times in five years, and literally leading a run in front of Beijing’s Tiananmen Square (in 2016). And yet, his business efforts have never followed through.
But none of that matters now. After everything that has happened, the Facebook chief has decided that Facebook doesn’t operate in China—not because it’s not allowed to, but because he doesn’t want it to.
SEE ALSO: How Mark Zuckerberg’s New Worst Enemy Enabled Facebook’s Success
In a public address about freedom of speech on Facebook at Georgetown University on Thursday, Zuckerberg identified anti-freedom regimes, like that of China, as one of the main threats to spreading American values to the future global internet.
“China is building its own internet focused on very different values [than that of the U.S.]. And now it’s exporting their vision for the internet to other countries,” Zuckerberg warned.
“Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values… A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top 10 are Chinese,” the Facebook CEO explained to his audience. “We are beginning to see this in social media, too. While our services like WhatsApp are used by protests and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these same protests are censored, even here in the U.S.”
“Is that the internet that we want?” he added passionately. “This is one of the reasons we don’t operate Facebook, Instagram or any of our other services in China.”
After a flashing moment of awkwardness in the room, Zuckerberg walked back his rhetoric a few steps and contended that he had wanted Facebook to have a presence in China, “because I believe in connecting the whole world, and I thought maybe we could help create a more open society.”
“But we could never come to an agreement on what it will take for us to operate there. And they never let us in,” he said.
However, while none of Facebook’s consumer-facing platforms are available in China, the company has tangled ties with businesses in the country through other channels that have generated billions of dollars in revenue.
According to a New York Times investigation in June last year, Facebook had data-sharing agreements with at least four Chinese tech firms, including Huawei, the No. 1 national security threat on Washington’s watch list, since at least 2010.
Facebook severed ties with Huawei following the exposè, but maintained the other three contracts with Lenovo, Oppo and TCL.
A separate Times report in February revealed that Facebook also plowed advertising dollars from China. Through a local agency, the tech giant would put up about 20,000 ads for Chinese companies each day , helping them reach its 2.3 billion users globally. These advertising clients contributed $5 billion in revenue to Facebook in 2018, according to the report, about 10% of Facebook’s global sales.

Team Beto desperate to deny that their candidate endorsed door-to-door gun confiscation

Texto completo: Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke should probably coordinate his campaign message with his campaign team. Because they do not seem to be on the same page right now, especially in regards to his proposal to have agents of the state forcibly confiscate millions of firearms.
On Wednesday, after what will probably be his last debate appearance, the flailing 2020 Democratic candidate appeared on MSNBC to discuss his euphemistically named “mandatory gun buyback” program, fielding questions about the legality and the practicality of his plan.
“What’s the next step for the federal government there?” Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough asked, suggesting a “rancher in Texas” as an example of someone who refuses to comply with O’Rourke’s confiscation plan.
“I think just as in any law that is not followed or flagrantly abused there have to be consequences or else there is no respect for the law,” O’Rourke responded. “So, in that case, I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else [emphasis added].”
That seems clear enough. But Lauren Hitt, who works rapid response for the former Texas congressman, wants to make you think that you just don’t understand what he really means when he says it.
“If someone is publicly, flagrantly stating that they refuse to comply with the law, as in Joe's scenario, of course, there will be legal consequences. This is how it works with any law. Republicans are usually pretty in favor of that concept,” she tweeted this week in an attempt to clean up her boss’ public remarks.
“Beto couldn't have been more clear last night, but for my Republican friends, this is how a buyback works: After the law is passed, people would be expected to turn in their assault weapons in exchange for payment,” she added. “If they did not, and they bring those weapons into public space or if a police officer discovers them in the course of their regular duties, the officer would take that assault weapon into custody.”
Silly me for thinking something else when O’Rourke himself said “there would be a visit by law enforcement” should someone not comply with his mandatory, enforced-by-law program. Silly me for taking him seriously when he said Tuesday during a Democratic debate in Ohio that “there will be other consequences from law enforcement” if a person is found to be noncompliant with his “buyback” program. Silly me for taking him seriously when he declared during a yet another Democratic debate in response to a question about whether his plan would require that the state forcibly confiscate AR-15 and AR-15-style rifles, of which there are an estimated 16 million, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47."
Tweet
You’re just not getting it, Hitt insists. O’Rourke is not talking about door-to-door confiscation.
“Beto would not send officers door to door to collect weapons — just as we do not send the IRS door to door to collect taxes,” she said. But then, just try not paying taxes — if you file a return but refuse to pay what you owe, then the IRS has a way of showing up and seizing your assets.
Hitt added, “With any law in this country, there are a few people who may not comply, but the overwhelming majority of Americans do voluntarily comply with our laws, even when they don't like them, and we have every reason to expect that Americans would do the same with a buyback program.”
Perhaps O’Rourke should have her do all the talking from now on. She seems to be better at it than he is.

Tom Steyer spent $109,000 per second he spoke during 2020 presidential debate

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio — Tom Steyer failed to make a splash in his first Democratic presidential primary debate despite spending the equivalent of $109,000 per second he spoke on the stage.
The 62-year-old billionaire hedge fund king-turned-impeachment activist had the least amount of speaking time of the 12 candidates during Tuesday's debate, about 7 minutes, while most other candidates got 12 minutes or more to answer moderator questions and make their points.
Steyer, who has pledged to spend $100 million of his own money on his presidential bid, gave his campaign a whopping $47.6 million from his July launch through the end of September and raised slightly over $2 million from other individuals. The campaign spent $47 million on operating expenses, more than twice what top third-quarter fundraiser Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders spent: $21.3 million of the $25.2 million he raised.
“I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House,” Steyer said during his first comments of the night, a clear planned applause line. After an awkward pause, the audience politely clapped.
Much of the conversation about Steyer’s debate performance on social media consisted of jokes about his tie selection — a red plaid design that evoked comparisons to Scotch tape brand’s distinctive plaid packaging.Tweet“When it's your first debate performance, the last thing you would want people ever to do is focus on something like that, kind of a physical appearance thing that some could find distracting,” University of Michigan debate coach Aaron Kall told the Washington Examiner. “You want to be the focus on the substance.”
Steyer entered the Democratic presidential race later than every other candidate and has much lower name recognition than most others. But despite those challenges, Steyer secured his spot on the debate stage in part by spending millions of dollars on television and digital ads and utilizing voter contact information from activist groups that he founded, Need to Impeach and climate group NextGen America.
Facebook and other advertising data previously showed that Steyer’s campaign had spent around $10 million on ads before qualifying for the October debate, but Steyer’s Federal Elections Commission filing revealed the full extent of his massive spending.
Those on Steyer’s team argue that the ads keep him competitive and that other candidates reap benefits from earned media mentions. His campaign also points to polling progress in early voting states: Morning Consult found this week that he is in fourth place with 8% among voters Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada, though he is at 1% nationally.
The large investment brought little benefit on the national stage. Steyer’s $47.6 million amounted to about $109,000 per second he spoke on the stage.
Steyer did have some bright spots in his first debate performance. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar highlighted his commitment to a progressive tax code. “Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,” she said.
“He benefited because a lot of the debate discussion was about impeachment,” Kall said. “But I thought that he could have better contrasted himself with the president because they do share a lot of similarities, you know, talking about why maybe he would give the president maybe the toughest time on a general election debate stage, because they're both billionaires.”
Steyer will get another chance to make his case on a national stage. He has qualified for the November debate, which will likely have fewer candidates.

Nicholas Kristof: Adam Schiff is the congressman Trump wants you to hate

Texto completo: The paradox of Adam Schiff is this: He is depicted by some Republicans as a fanatical partisan, with President Donald Trump suggesting that he is a “radical left” “lowlife” who should be arrested for treason, yet in real life Schiff is a cerebral and mild-mannered moderate.
But perhaps there’s a logic to Trump’s venom: Schiff’s mild persona conceals a relentless determination. That’s why he’s a marathoner and a triathlon athlete. It’s also how he first received attention, as a dogged young federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who won a conviction — after two failed trials led by other prosecutors — against an FBI agent accused of spying for Russia for sex and money.
Now he’s again investigating alleged Russia-related wrongdoing by a federal employee, only this time the employee is the president.
Trump and his supporters are trying to “Pelosify” Schiff. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., is calling for a censure of Schiff for pursuing “a witch hunt in a fantasy land.”
All this is bizarre. Schiff has not even come out for impeachment, saying that such decisions should await the investigation, although he is blunt about describing Trump as a danger to the country. Schiff was chosen to lead the impeachment inquiry precisely because of his reputation not as a bomb-thrower but as a reasonable lawyer who will oversee a meticulous inquiry.
“If that makes me appear as a partisan, I’m willing to accept that,” Schiff told me in a long conversation before an audience at the 92nd Street Y in New York. “The way I view it, my role is to defend our democracy at a time when it is deeply at risk.”
Schiff grew up in Massachusetts, Arizona and California. His father was a garment salesman who later owned and operated a lumber yard, and his mother was a real estate agent. At Stanford, Schiff was both pre-med and pre-law but finally decided that law school would be more useful for a political career. His parents, hoping for a doctor, were aghast.
After Harvard Law School, Schiff worked as a prosecutor, dabbled in politics and began writing screenplays — he’s still writing them. In 2000, he defeated Rep. James Rogan, a Republican in Los Angeles County who had been deeply involved in the impeachment of Bill Clinton two years earlier. If anybody understands that impeachment can create political vulnerabilities, it’s Schiff.
In Congress, Schiff gravitated toward national security issues. He was active in trying to address the genocide in Darfur, identified with the Blue Dog group of moderate Democrats and joined the House Intelligence Committee — one of those nonglamorous places where hearings are often closed and there are few chances for grandstanding.
On Capitol Hill, Schiff is known as a slightly goofy nerd who recites endless lines from the movie “The Big Lebowski” and gamely tries his hand once a year at stand-up comedy. He’s also renowned for his wife’s name, Eve; Adam and Eve are teased for their failure to name their kids Cain and Abel.
Charles Glovsky, Schiff’s cousin, told me that friends are always advising Schiff to buy nicer suits or less decrepit shoes, but that he isn’t interested. “Not motivated by money at all,” Glovsky said.
These days, Schiff said, he’s trying to proceed as fast as possible with the impeachment investigation, but he resisted my attempts to pin him to a timeline. “When you consider how much we have learned in the last three weeks, it’s breathtaking,” he said. “It’s terrifying.”
He said that his committee is investigating whether there is a recording of the call between Trump and Ukraine’s president, either in the U.S. or in Ukraine. “We are determined to find out,” he said.
Schiff was particularly scathing about Attorney General William Barr. “He’s the second-most dangerous person in the country,” Schiff said. “In his own way, he’s as much of a threat to the rule of law as the president.”
I asked if the House might, in a bid to compel testimony, exercise its “inherent contempt” authority and send the sergeant-at-arms out to arrest people and lock them up in the Capitol. Schiff said he had ruled this out but was considering fining those who refuse to cooperate.
He acknowledged some missteps, including misleading comments about his committee’s contact with the whistleblower. I argued that we might be better off if hearings were public; he responded that initial hearings need to be closed to keep witnesses from knowing what others have said, but he added that “all these transcripts are going to be made public.”
“There are still people with an open mind,” he said. “And those are the ones I’m trying to speak to.”
The larger issue, he said, is that democracy throughout the world is under threat. “This is bigger than Trump: It started before Trump; it won’t end with Trump,” he said. “The bigger picture is democracy is hanging in the balance, and we remain its best hope.”

Texto completo: El jefe interino del gabinete del presidente Donald Trump, Mick Mulvaney, reconoció este jueves en una conferencia de prensa que Estados Unidos detuvo la ayuda a Ucrania después de solicitar a este país que investigara a un servidor del Comité Nacional Demócrata . Mulvaney quitó hierro al asunto y negó que esta solicitud tuviera relación alguna con Joe Biden o su hijo Hunter.
“ Lo hacemos todo el tiempo con nuestra política exterior “, dijo el jefe de gabinete para justificar que el gobierno haya s olicitado a Ucrania algo a cambio (quid pro quo) de la ayuda estadounidense a otros países . Mulvaney se refirió específicamente al pedido de Trump para que su homólogo ucraniano investigara a un servidor del Comité Demócrata Nacional (CDN) .

“¿Me habló (Trump) en el pasado sobre la corrupción relacionada al servidor de CND? Absolutamente. No hay duda de eso. Y por eso fue que frenamos el dinero”, dijo Mulvaney a los periodistas de la Casa Blanca. El jefe del gabinete de la Casa Blanca dijo también que una de las principales preocupaciones de Trump era “ investigar qué fue lo que ocurrió en 2016 “, en referencia a la corrupción en Ucrania.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, effectively confirmed the main premise of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry on Thursday, telling reporters that aid was held back from Ukraine in part to prod the country to investigate Democrats https://t.co/Uep9uueYlf
— The New York Times (@nytimes) October 17, 2019
Mulvaney reconocía con sus palabras que Trump había detenido la ayuda a Ucrania, en parte, para presionar al país a investigar al servidor demócrata . Sin embargo, poco después Mulvaney se retractó de sus palabras y dijo que el corte de la financiación no condicionaba a Ucrania a indagar una supuesta interferencia en las elecciones de 2016 y acusó a la prensa de “malinterpretar” sus palabras para “avanzar en una caza de bruja […] contra el presidente Trump”.
“Déjenme ser claro, no hubo absolutamente ningún quid pro quo entre la ayuda militar ucraniana y cualquier investigación sobre las elecciones de 2016″, aclaró a posteriori. “El presidente nunca me pidió retener nada de dinero hasta que los ucranianos hicieran algo relacionado con el servidor”. Mulvaney insistió en explicar que la única razón por la que detuvieron los fondos de seguridad fue para revisar que otras naciones estaban implicadas en acabar con la corrupción.

Texto completo: Guest Opinion
Now that California has passed a law (Fair Pay to Play law) providing in 2023 for the hiring of agents to negotiate payment of advertising for college athletes, expect other states to follow suit so that athletes and their colleges are not disadvantaged by California colleges and universities.
New laws should not shower college students with instant cash, but it's complicated.
College athletes are encouraged to finish earning their degrees coupled with the full ride they accept with a college or university to trade the athlete's prowess for full payment of tuition, books, room and board intended to confer a complete education that will allow the student-athlete an opportunity for future economic gain after the athlete's sporting experience is finished. Each student-athlete would be able to market his or her name, image and likeness and "monetize that," according to California's governor. Only a small percentage of college athletes turn pro, and the student's athletic achievement should be secondary to the education received.
As state legislatures, (currently North Carolina, Washington and Colorado) ponder the proper way to fashion payments in school to student-athletes in order to stay competitive with California's recent action, legislators should couple payments to athletes with a mechanism that doesn't destroy the existing scholarship program employed by most colleges. Having student-athletes complete their education should be paramount to money. Perhaps holding an athlete's financial benefits in a university trust until after graduation would allow student-athletes to prosper financially while simultaneously providing for their educational future.
The fear is that scholarships would be dropped for all in favor of revenue sharing with colleges. This is in contrast to the millions paid to coaches and colleges that prosper off the sweat equity of athletes who make the coach and university look good, although the athlete under NCAA rule is not allowed to financially prosper as their coaches and university can.
Several coaches and colleges have argued against the new compensation rule, including Washington State football coach Mike Leach, who recently signed a reported $20 million contract extension, and Gonzaga Athletic Director Mike Roth.
Clemson football coach Dabo Swinney, who signed a $10 million per year coaching deal with Clemson, argues that "the collegiate model is a beautiful thing." He opposes collegiate salaries because they would do away with the collegiate model. Though the NCAA makes about $1 billion each year, it has opposed the California law. Swinney believes that college athletes today have money, and that paying players would be "a train wreck." Though Swinney grew up poor in Alabama, he tries to instill in his players that football "creates opportunities."
Others have opined on the law. NBA superstar LeBron James endorses it. USA Today supports the California law. The Los Angeles Times supports the Pac-12 embracing the California law. The New York Times ran a story on the California law, stating that some universities make more than $100 million each year. The NCAA has formed a committee to study the issue.
There's a further provision for legislators to consider if they're looking for legislative measures to enact. The university could hold an athlete's funds in trust until graduation or if the athlete turns pro after attending college; he/she would forfeit the trust fund to the university in favor of a pro salary.
In any event, the funds should be held in trust by the university for all student-athletes and the student's scholarship should take priority, especially to assure completion of a college education. That may be a way to discourage student-athletes from adopting the "one-and-done" policy - attending one year of college and turning pro to take advantage of big money and the athlete's good one-year record as some colleges have experienced. The athlete may earn big money, but soon, without a college degree, the athlete is adrift.
The Pay for Play California law has engendered strong feelings among fans, coaches, colleges and the NCAA, but change in compensation provisions for athletes was probably inevitable, considering the massive amounts of money earned by coaches and colleges. The best way for colleges and athletes to address the controversy is to embrace it thoughtfully and adopt legislation that will satisfy critics.
If, as Swinney and GU basketball coach Mark Few assert, today's athletes have money and want for little, then putting endorsement money in trust and having an athlete forfeit college endorsement money if he/she turns pro and has substantial earnings makes good sense, recognizing that the student-athlete's first priority should be getting a quality college education.

Truth about sinking of USS Eagle finally comes out

Texto completo: Some stories are more moving than others when it comes to shipwrecks. This one has really hit home, as in shockingly. Read on ...
On April 23, 1945, the USS Eagle sank off the coast of Maine near Cape Elizabeth. She was towing a practice target for bombers from the nearby Naval Air Station Brunswick.
According to a July 20 article in The New York Times:
"This ship was part of a class of submarine chasers built by the Ford Motor Co. to combat German U-boats in World War I, but saw their first substantial action in World War II."
There were 62 crew members aboard. The mood was light, somewhat relaxed as the men knew World War II was winding down. The word was out that U-boats were close to the Atlantic Coast. What good would it do the Germans to shoot down a submarine chaser, but call attention to the U-boat? After all, seamen on both sides were weary after a long war.
Five miles offshore the German U-853 found its target, the USS Eagle 56, and destroyed her. Only 13 men lived to tell their stories. The Navy's official records listed the cause of sinking as a boiler explosion.
If so, then why did my birth mother (June Kern Davies Williams) tell me 29 years ago that her first husband, and love of her life, Bob Davies, was on the Eagle when it was hit by a German U-boat? Who had she talked to? Survivors? Naval officials? Her mind was very clear about this; the Navy was wrong.
A Court of Inquiry had been formed on April 23, 1945, consisting of U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Felix Gygax; Lt. Cmdr. William Coolidge, naval reserve; and Lt. Cmdr. Norman Kaufman, naval reserve. The purpose was to:
"Make a thorough investigation into all the circumstances connected with the aforesaid loss, the causes thereof, damages to property there from, injuries to personnel, and the responsibility therefore.
"The court will include in its findings a full statement of the facts it may deem to be established."
The Court of Inquiry was held at the First Naval District North Station Office Building in Boston. Eleven pages of questions were asked of the witnesses who were men from the Eagle's base at Grand Trunk Pier in Portland, Maine, and the survivors. Most of the survivors, when asked where they thought the explosion had come from, declared that it had come from outside the ship. Lt. j.g. John P. Scagnalli told the Court of Inquiry that he "felt the explosion was from outside inwards. It was very similar to a depth charge explosion."
Numerous questions were asked about the ship's boiler, but the survivors had similar testimonies, stating that the explosion had been caused by "something outside the ship."
The USS Eagle sank in 15 minutes in 300 feet of water. The testimony recorded that the deceased men had died immediately; the survivors were able to swim away from the ship. This tragedy occurred less than a month before the war ended. In retaliation, the German U-boat 853 was sunk by the Americans two weeks later.
Until she died in 2019, June Kern Davies Williams insisted the Eagle had been torpedoed. Reticent to talk about her teenage pregnancy, giving up the baby for adoption and the loss of her husband, no one ever questioned her further. The official version was still that the boiler explosion caused the sinking.
No one could determine the exact location for 75years. Eight civilian divers finally found the USS Eagle 56 . The group was composed of diving and sonar experts. Ryan King, a member of the team photographers, told The New York Times that "When you see a 4-inch deck gun, you know you're not dealing with a fishing boat. The Eagle is located down in a rocky cavern at the bottom of the Atlantic. Experts took their findings to the Navy. The site is not for recreational divers, and is protected by federal law as a war grave.
Historian and lawyer Paul M. Lawton from Warren, Massachusetts, had been interested in finding the ship for two decades after hearing about it from two friends whose father had died aboard when the ship was torpedoed. Gary Kozak lent his knowledge as an expert in side-scan sonar, searching for five years with no luck. Three of the survivors were interviewed, but no new clues were revealed. Photographer Ryan King dove the site and did much of the photography which identified the lost ship.
"The Hunt for Eagle 56" is a three-part documentary produced by the Smithsonian Channel. It is well worth watching. Questions outnumber answers at times. Why did the Navy insist a boiler had exploded when survivors thought and had seen both the submarine and a torpedo? Could there have been a cover up for some reason?
The official finding of the Eagle marks the first time in the history of the Navy that such a correction has ever been made. The official cause of the sinking of the Eagle has been changed to being torpedoed by a German U-boat.
Docents at the New Jersey Maritime Museum are extremely well informed in various parts of our state's maritime history. They have had experiences diving, antique postcard collecting, researching wrecks, writing and are experts in many fields. Now this author has found that her birth mother actually lived the sinking of the Eagle at the age of 21 when her husband of two years died aboard the ship less than a month before the official end of World War II.
What story will be uncovered next? On your next visit to the NJ Maritime Museum bring us your stories; we want to hear them. And we will tell you some of ours. NJ Maritime Museum, 528 Dock Road, Beach Haven, open Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Weekdays by appointment, call 609-492-0202.

Law Firm Sues Netflix Over 'The Laundromat'

Texto completo: The law firm, Mossack Fonseca, objects to the way the film portrays them as villains at the center of a web of illegal offshore activities.
The Panama-based law firm that helped some of the world's wealthiest people establish offshore bank accounts and was the source for a trove of leaked documents known as the Panama Papers has sued Netflix over its depiction in the Steven Soderbergh film "The Laundromat."
In 2016, journalists from a German newspaper obtained 11.5 million documents from the law firm, Mossack Fonseca, that exposed how some of the world's most prominent politicians, business leaders and celebrities may have used offshore bank accounts and shell companies to conceal their wealth or avoid taxes. The reporting that resulted is the basis for the Netflix film, starring Meryl Streep as a widow whose husband's death on a boat tour leads to her discovery of shady offshore dealings traced back from the tour operator's bogus insurance company.
In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday in Federal District Court in New Haven, Conn., the law firm and its partners -- Jürgen Mossack and Ramón Fonseca -- objected to their portrayal in the film as "ruthless, uncaring and unethical lawyers" who engaged in money laundering, tax evasion and other criminal activities to benefit the wealthy. In the film, which will be available for streaming on Friday, Mr. Mossack is played by Gary Oldman and Mr. Fonseca by Antonio Banderas. Mr. Soderbergh directed the film.
The lawsuit objects to the film's characterization of Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca as villains profiting from tragedies like the death of the widow's husband, making reference to dialogue in the film's trailer saying "it all goes back to this law firm Mossack and Fonseca." It references Mr. Oldman and Mr. Banderas wearing "flamboyant gold colored suits" with bow ties and "laughing sinisterly."
"The magic makes for a great story, to be sure, but the innuendo created is destructive and unfair," the law firm claimed in court papers. "It is a moneymaker for Netflix but an irreparably harmful money-loser for the plaintiffs."
Netflix declined to comment on the substance of the lawsuit, but the company filed a motion to dismiss it on Wednesday.
The law firm has sued Netflix for libel, invasion of privacy and trademarks violations, arguing that the law firm's logo is placed in scenes that "allow viewers to associate it with very serious criminal and unethical behavior." It is asking a judge to order that Netflix stop the film from being released for streaming. The film was already screened at film festivals in Venice and Toronto and has been released in a few theaters.
The story behind the Panama Papers and its moneyed cast of characters was almost certain to provide fodder for film or television. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which organized coverage of the document trove in newspapers including The New York Times, said at the time that the documents revealed the offshore accounts of 140 politicians and public officials, including several individuals with close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin. The documents named King Salman of Saudi Arabia, relatives of President Xi Jinping of China and the father of David Cameron, the former prime minister of Britain. The coverage of the documents led to the resignation of Iceland's prime minister, David Gunnlaugsson. According to the consortium, the reporting has led to the recovery of more than $ 1.2 billion in penalties and back taxes in at least 22 countries.
According to court papers filed by the law firm, not all of the people implicated in the Panama Papers leak were technically clients of Mossack Fonseca. The firm said its role was to create companies and sell them off, but that they should not be painted as the villains if their clients ultimately sold those companies to "end users who were exposed as criminals."
In court papers, the firm argues that wide release of "The Laundromat" could result in additional investigations in Panama, where Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca had been jailed for several months and are now out on bail but confined to the country. It asserts that the film could taint jurors in New York, where the law partners are under investigation by the F.B.I., though they have not been charged. The firm, which had dozens of offices around the world, has been investigated by law enforcement authorities in several countries over accusations of connections to money laundering.
The film is based on the 2017 book "Secrecy World" by the journalist Jake Bernstein, who draws from the Panama Papers to detail a secretive financial system and recounts how Mossack Fonseca was exposed. Court papers name Mr. Bernstein, who is listed as an executive producer on the film, as someone who should have known the "falsity of the message" at the center of the film and called it out. Mr. Bernstein, who did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday, is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
H. Jefferson Powell, a professor and director of the First Amendment Clinic at Duke Law School, said that because the Panama Papers case was a matter of such intense public interest, a successful libel suit would most likely have a high bar to clear.
Mossack Fonseca's lawyers would have to prove that the filmmakers presented a false portrayal of the firm while knowing it was inaccurate, or with reckless disregard for whether it was true, Mr. Powell said.
If the filmmakers had reasons to think the activities depicted in the movie were true, he said, "then this lawsuit will fail."

Texto completo: What could Beijing want with Tulagi, where Allied forces fought a bloody battle with Japan in World War II? Some fear military ambitions.
SYDNEY, Australia -- The island of Tulagi served as a South Pacific headquarters for Britain then Japan, and during World War II, its natural deepwater harbor made it a military gem.
Now, China is moving in with plans to effectively take control.
Under a secretive deal signed last month with a provincial government in the Solomon Islands, a Beijing-based company with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party has secured exclusive development rights for the entire island of Tulagi and its surroundings.
The lease agreement has shocked Tulagi residents and alarmed American officials who see the island chains of the South Pacific as crucial to keeping China in check and protecting important sea routes. It is the latest example of China using promises of prosperity to pursue its global aspirations -- often by funneling money to governments and investing in local infrastructure projects that critics call debt traps for developing nations.
"The geography tells you that this is a good location," said Anne-Marie Brady, a China scholar at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. "China is expanding its military assets into the South Pacific and is looking for friendly ports and friendly airfields just like other rising powers before them."
Beijing's ambitions in the South Pacific have economic, political and military ramifications.
The region is rich in natural resources, and China's investments have provoked worries in the United States and Australia that the projects could give Beijing an opening to establish a military foothold for everything from ships and planes to its own version of the Global Positioning System.
China is also pushing to end the region's status as a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan. The Solomons cut ties to Taipei and allied with Beijing just a few days before the Tulagi deal. A second Pacific nation, Kiribati, followed suit the same week.
Even compared to previous Chinese development deals in nearby countries -- including a wharf in Vanuatu, whose terms were not publicly released for years -- the Tulagi agreement is remarkable for both its scope and lack of public input.
The renewable 75-year lease was granted to the China Sam Enterprise Group, a conglomerate founded in 1985 as a state-owned enterprise, according to corporate records.
A copy of the "strategic cooperation agreement," obtained by The New York Times and verified by two people with knowledge of the deal, reveals both the immediate ambitions of China Sam and the potential -- just as in Vanuatu -- for infrastructure that could share civilian and military uses.
Signed on Sept. 22, the agreement includes provisions for a fishery base, an operations center, and "the building or enhancement of the airport." Though there are no confirmed oil or gas reserves in the Solomons, the agreement also notes that China Sam is interested in building an oil and gas terminal.
These are just the explicit possibilities. The document also states that the government will lease all of Tulagi and the surrounding islands in the province for the development of "a special economic zone or any other industry that is suitable for any development."
The provincial governor who signed the deal, Stanley Maniteva, could not be reached for comment. Noting that laws and landowner rights would be respected, he told local reporters this week that the agreement had not been completed.
"I want to make clear that the agreement does not bear the official stamp of the province so it is not official and formalized yet," he said.
But many residents of Tulagi, an island of a little over 1,000 people, are taking the signing of the document to mean it is a real agreement, and outrage has quickly set in.
"They cannot come in and lease the whole island like that," said Michael Salini, 46, a business owner on Tulagi who is helping organize a petition to oppose the China Sam agreement.
"Everyone is really scared about the possibility of China turning the island into a military base," he added. "That is what really scares people -- because why else do they want to lease the whole island?"
A military installation would carry strategic and symbolic significance. Some American officials believe China's efforts in the region echo the period before and during World War II, when Japan wrested control of island assets, which were won back in turn by American and Australian troops in bloody battles.
But it is also a matter of feasibility: China goes where there's value and interest. With the United States pulling back in much of the world under President Trump's America First policy, Beijing is often knocking on doors left open.
Some American and Solomon Islands officials note that Chinese businesses and officials have cultivated local politicians for years with bribes and gifts like luxury trips to China and Singapore. In a poor country of 600,000 people with a national Parliament of 50 members, it doesn't take much to tilt debate, they argue.
"What worries me much more about the new Chinese engagement, be it political or economic, in the Pacific is the way in which this engagement is taking place, being lubricated by elite capture and corruption," said Jonathan Pryke, a Pacific islands expert with the Lowy Institute in Sydney. Though patronage and corruption have long been a challenge, he added, "this engagement has certainly taken it to a whole new level."
The prime minister of the Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, visited China earlier this month. Photographs from the trip showed him smiling with China Sam executives.
The visit carried a whiff of victory for Beijing. It followed a failed lobbying effort by Australia and the United States to keep the Solomons loyal to Taiwan and the alignment that began when American Marines dislodged Japanese troops from Tulagi and Guadalcanal in 1942.
Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, visited the Solomons in June -- the first official visit by an Australian leader in a decade. He announced an infrastructure program worth up to 250 million Australian dollars, or about $ 168 million, in grant financing over 10 years.
Vice President Mike Pence also pressed Mr. Sogavare to hold off on deciding about Taiwan, promising infrastructure investments and making plans for an in-person discussion in September around the time of the United Nations General Assembly.
But Mr. Sogavare then announced the severing of ties with Taiwan, and Mr. Pence canceled the meeting.
Still, some argue that the United States could revive support.
"It's not too late in the game," said Phillip Tagini, a mining executive who served in the Solomons as a prime minister's adviser from 2012 to 2015. "At this stage we don't have the history with China to say we can trust them."
After an election in 2006, rioting and violence broke out amid allegations that money from Chinese businessmen had rigged the results. Protests also greeted Mr. Sogavare's election win in April, with demonstrators marching toward the capital's Chinatown to register discontent.
"Separate from China's agenda is the risk of destabilizing a vulnerable society," Professor Brady said.
But the tangible effects of the deals being struck now, some say, could win over even the skeptics.
"The fact is, people in the Solomons are going to see infrastructure from China, and when they see these things happening they are going to say, 'Wow, this is what we were waiting for,"' Mr. Tagini said. "If the Americans are going to come, they need to choose where their impacts are going to be seen. They need to be seen."

Texto completo: COLUMBUS, Ohio — In the fourth round of Democratic debates, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke engaged in one of the most personal exchanges of the entire primary with a fellow Democrat, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The issue — whether or not the government should have a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons — elicited face-to-face tension that had been previously playing out on the campaign trail.
When asked about how he intended to implement his mandatory buyback program, O’Rourke essentially said he believed Americans “will do the right thing” and turn in the weapons.
“I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law,” he said. “We don't go door-to-door to do anything in this country to enforce the law.”
“If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47 — one of these weapons or war — or brings out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them,” he added. “If they persist, then there will be other consequences from law enforcement. But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law.”
Buttigieg, who has been critical of O’Rourke’s proposals on this front, jumped on O’Rourke for not fleshing out this plan.
“Congressman, you just made it clear you don’t know this is actually going to take weapons off the streets,” he said. “If you can develop the plan further, we can have a debate about it. We can’t wait.”
Buttigieg added that Democrats ought to focus on policies like universal background checks and an assault weapon ban, rather than a confiscation policy.
“We cannot wait for purity tests,” he added. “We have to just get something done.”
O’Rourke argued that these policies are not mutually exclusive and said Democrats should “not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups ... to do what's right.”
That remark brought out a fierce response from Buttigieg, who is a combat veteran and openly gay man.
“The problem isn’t the polls. The problem is the policy,” he said. “And I don't need lessons from you on courage — political or personal.”
O’Rourke responded, charging Buttigieg’s criticisms as “a slap in the face” to gunshot victims.
The other Texan in the race, former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro implicitly criticized O’Rourke on his gun policy, saying he was opposed to mandatory buybacks.
“Folks can’t define it,” he said. “And if you’re not going door-to-door, then it’s not really mandatory.”
Castro then brought up the weekend police shooting of Atatiana Jefferson in her Fort Worth home.
“A cop showed up at two in the morning to her house where she was playing video games with her nephew,” Castro said. “He didn’t even announce himself. And within four seconds he shot her and killed her through her own window ... I’m not going to give police officers another reason to go door-to-door in certain communities because police violence is also gun violence.”
Earlier in the night, O’Rourke went after Democratic frontrunner U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. While answering a question on tax policy O’Rourke criticized Warren’s lack of clarity on how she will pay for various policy proposals like Medicare For All.
“We need to be focused on lifting people up, and sometimes I think Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting the country against the other, instead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together around those solutions,” he said.
He later followed up, saying the Massachusetts senator “has yet to describe her tax plan,” and whether not average Americans will see a tax increase.
Warren responded, saying she was “shocked” that anyone would view her policies as punitive.
O’Rourke was not the only candidate who critiqued Warren for not stating whether she will raise taxes. Since the last debate, Warren has outpaced former Vice President Joe Biden in several recent polls. As such, she was the magnet for other candidates’ criticisms.
Buttigieg had a similar exchange with her earlier in the debate, and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota pushed back against Warren’s Medicare for All proposals.
After the O’Rourke exchange, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey implicitly fired back against him, arguing that Democratic candidates ought to avoid “tearing each other down.”
Early in the debate, O’Rourke and Castro, were largely absent from long stretches of discussion Tuesday night. The exclusions on the part of the CNN and New York Times moderators was indicative of their lower status in polling and momentum in this race.
The two men are in a fight for political survival. Neither Texan has met the polling threshold to qualify for the fifth debate, to be held in Georgia on Nov. 20.
The rest of the Democratic lineup included U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

In a relationship with 'Modern Love'

Texto completo: In the first episode of the likable new anthology series “Modern Love," Cristin Milioti plays Maggie, a single New Yorker whose apartment doorman acts like a guard. When she arrives home with dates, the stiffly uniformed Guzmin — played with a masterfully cryptic deadpan by Laurentiu Possa — stands like a sentry at the building entrance, his disapproval clear. His protectiveness appears threatening, like he's a mobster. We never see Maggie's parents, as the half-hour called “When the Doorman Is Your Main Man" unfolds amid the city grid; just Guzmin, his severe cap, and his portentous face.
I love it that the Amazon series, available Friday, starts off with a tale that's not about conventional romance. While the eight half-hours of “Modern Love" have the sparkling feel of urban romantic comedy, they're about the very many faces of love out there in the world — between lovers, yes, but also between friends, between people tossed together by circumstance, between a birth mother and the gay couple adopting her baby. “When the Doorman Is Your Main Man" shows, with wry warmth, how you can find fierce devotion and shelter in unexpected corners of a cold, bustling city of strangers. You can't always predict who is going to fill a familial role in your life, and in your heart.
The adaptation of the New York Times column of the same name was created by Irish writer-director John Carney of “Once" and “Sing Street," and he brings just the right touch to almost every episode (he wrote and directed most; the other writers and directors include Sharon Horgan, Emmy Rossum, and Dan Savage). OK, so there's a bit of corniness here and there; the charm of the whole project makes its excesses tolerable, as does the swiftness of the storytelling. Carney & Co. consistently keep the focus on the protagonist's point of view, without elaborate side detours or embellishment, just like in the newspaper columns. Each half-hour knows exactly what it's about and goes there elegantly. You could say that the show is the “Twilight Zone" of love, without all the science fiction, oppressive doom, and broken watches, of course. It's a collection of small stories that share a broad theme, as well as a city that only seems to hinder love.
There were two episodes that didn't take off for me, for one reason or another. Much as I enjoyed watching Tina Fey and John Slattery as a couple on the verge of splitting, the static episode, called “Rallying to Keep the Game Alive," relies too heavily on the tennis metaphor that, in the original newspaper piece by Ann Leary, wife of Denis Leary, works well. And an episode in which a young woman (Julia Garner) seeks approval — but not romance — from a much-older man, fails, to a cringing effect, to make its meaning clear. That's the nature of anthology shows; they are usually uneven, and you get to start afresh with each new chapter. And unlike Amazon's “The Romanoffs," Matthew Weiner's extremely uneven anthology of hour-long-plus episodes, the misses pass by briskly.
The only truly edgy episode is called “Take Me as I Am, Whoever I Am," and it stars Anne Hathaway as a bipolar woman named Lexi who has kept her diagnosis to herself. We see her dancing and singing glamorously in choreographed scenes set in the supermarket, as she rides a manic phase. And then we see her unable to get out of bed, lying her way through absences at work, profoundly depressed. Can Lexi ever find love? Will she explain to the man she just met the reason for her erratic behavior? I found the episode absorbing and moving, as a woman braving her illness alone reaches her breaking point. I also liked a far lower-stakes episode starring Dev Patel as a tech wiz and Catherine Keener as the magazine interviewer who schools him on lost love and regret.
By now it's probably clear that “Modern Love" is not for viewers who can't suspend their cynicism for a few hours. There is plenty of earnestness afoot, even when it's lurking just under the surface, and there are a few happy endings, too. For me, it felt like a holiday from all the more demanding narratives on TV right now, a pleasing distraction from brooding superheroes, toxic media moguls, and an endless number of crimes that always need solving.
MODERN LOVE

A healthy fear of China

Texto completo: "I have seen the future, and it works," the left-wing journalist Lincoln Steffens famously declared, after observing Bolshevik Russia in its infancy. What was intended as a utopian boast soon read as a dystopian prediction - but then eventually, as Stalinist ambition gave way to Brezhnevian decay, it curdled into a sour sort of joke. By the time the Soviet Union dissolved, even the people inclined to defend the "ideals" of Marxism tended to acknowledge that as a system for managing an advanced economy and running an effective government, the one thing Soviet communism definitely didn't do was work.
Today, though, there is a palpable fear in the liberal West that Beijing is succeeding where Moscow failed, and that the peculiar blend of Maoist dogmatics, nationalist fervor, one-party meritocracy and surveillance-state capitalism practiced in the People's Republic of China really is a working alternative to liberal democracy - with cruelty sustained by efficiency, and a resilience that might outstrip our own.
This fear is stoked by a growing realization that the "Chimerica" project, our great integration of markets and supply chains, has had roughly the opposite effect to the one its U.S. architects anticipated. Instead of importing liberal ideas into China and undermining the Politburo's rule, the Chimerican age has strengthened Beijing's policy of social control and imported totalitarian influences into the officially free world.
A crucial mechanism for both trends is the internet, once hailed as a great liberator and now revealed as something rather different - a surveillance engine that the NKVD could only dream about, a machine that induces its users to trade privacy for entertainment and distraction, and a panopticon whose global expanse exposes anyone who wants to do business in China to the manufactured consensus of Chinese nationalism, the grievance politics of the Politburo.
China's influence within U.S. industry is evident well beyond the online realm, of course. But its successful censorship of U.S. businesses generally involves websites, app stores, social media. It's not a coincidence that the National Basketball Association's supine behavior toward China in the past week - from what is supposedly the most progressive and politically engagé of the American professional sports leagues - followed from a general manager fleetingly expressing support for the Hong Kong protesters on Twitter. Likewise when China induced Marriott to fire a luckless $14-an-hour worker recently, it was for seeming to endorse Tibetan independence by "favoriting" a tweet. Having figured out how to tame their internet, the Chinese are intent on using commercial power to tame ours.
How afraid should this make us? One possibility is that just as Chimerican optimism was once delusional, so now Chimerican fears are overblown. The Chinese regime has capabilities that outstrip Soviet Russia, but deep weaknesses as well. China's demographic picture is potentially disastrous, its economic surge may be leveling off, many of its best and brightest are eager to depart, and it has more to lose than America from constant trade brinkmanship, a trans-Pacific Cold War footing. As with fears of Japanese dominance in the 1990s, some Sinophobes may overrate the internal strength of the Chinese model, the permanence of its ascent.
But one can believe that China may be somewhat weaker than it looks and also believe that the fear of the People's Republic is a healthy thing for Americans to cultivate. For one thing, our policy approach to Chinese power clearly needs adjustment, and yet there are many high-dollar reasons for our elite to protect their Chimerican entanglements - with "elite" here including not only the influence-peddlers of D.C. and Silicon Valley, but also figures like Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, whose professional obligations induced him to draw shameful analogies between America's sins and Chinese totalitarianism this week.
Given those elite incentives, the only way our China policy will be permanently adjusted is if the outrage that bubbled against the NBA in recent days becomes a permanent factor in U.S. politics, a sentiment that cannot be ignored.
Then, too, a palpable fear of China as a different, darker model for high-tech modernity could be a useful brake our own potential slide in their direction. Not that we are ever likely to reach the fullness of Xi Jinping Thought and Uighur re-education. But there are clear tendencies within our own society - the evaporation of privacy and the rise of online mobs, the power of "inner party" oligarchies and the consolidation of tech giants, certain radical ambitions among progressives and certain authoritarian flirtations on the right - that converge with the Chinese model of oligarchy, surveillance and ideological control.
Given these tendencies and drifts, the bipartisan, pan-ideological outrage over the NBA's spinelessness is genuinely encouraging. There is a cliché that in fighting an enemy you become much more like them, but the reverse is just as often true. For a divided, balkanized America, it might take the looming-up of a rival power, the rise of a dark but all-too-plausible alternative, to remind us of who we are, and what we do not want to be.

Texto completo: A bidding war may be about to begin for Barneys New York, the beleaguered luxury department store chain that declared bankruptcy in August and became a cautionary tale of retail hubris and the death of shopping as we once knew it.
One buyer could mean the liquidation of all of the retailer's stores, while another could preserve at least some of the Barneys shoppers know today.
On Tuesday, Authentic Brands Group, the owner of over 50 brands including Nine West, Nautica and Hickey Freeman, made a formal $ 264 million offer for Barneys that was accepted by the store's lenders. That began an auction process that will take place over the next week. At least one other bidder has declared intent: a consortium of New York investors led by Sam Ben-Avraham, the co-founder of the streetwear brand Kith and owner of a group of trade shows.
The two represent starkly different visions for Barneys' future, and reflect the shift in fashion that has taken place over the last decade. The rise of contemporary and then streetwear brands reshaped consumer wardrobes and shopping patterns, as elitism was trounced by accessibility, and brick-and-mortar emporia went from being magnetic landmarks to millstones weighing down the bottom line.
The bankruptcy judge, Cecelia G. Morris, will issue her ruling on the bids on Oct. 24.
A.B.G., which has annual revenues of $ 10 billion, has a deal with Hudson's Bay Company, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, to license the Barneys name if it acquires the retailer. According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, A.B.G. plans to continue running the Barneys digital operation, while Saks would potentially use the Barneys name for private label collections or shop-in shops. Saks's involvement would add a gloss of cutting-edge luxury to the Fifth Avenue retailer, allowing it to further consolidate power over the luxury department store market.
While A.B.G. has said it would try to keep Barneys stores open, especially the Madison Avenue flagship, it is prepared to close all seven of them if better rental agreements cannot be reached. It has already lined up the Great American Group to run liquidation sales. No mention was made in its offer of what would happen to current employees.
A.B.G. is essentially betting that the future of retail lies with the abstract values of brand names rather than in-person shopping experiences.
Mr. Ben-Avraham and his group, which includes his brother, Uzi Ben-Abraham (owner of the real estate company Premier Equities); Ron Roman (Bergen Logistics); Khajak Keledjian (founder and former chief executive of Intermix); Ron Burkle (Yucaipa Companies, the private equity firm that is already an investor in Barneys); and Andrew Rosen, plans to keep at least two of the remaining seven Barneys stores open, including the Madison Avenue flagship with its nine-floor footprint. It would retain at least some of the current management.
In an interview, Mr. Ben-Avraham said a team was in negotiations with all of the Barneys landlords, though no agreements have been reached. He said his group had raised $ 70 million in equity, with plans to raise up to $ 150 million, and had secured commitments for at least $ 200 million in debt financing.
His bet is that combining his brand of downtown cool with Barneys' uptown chic will create a new kind of community destination. "Our specialty is creating environments people want to be part of," he said.
Originally rumored to be the first, or so-called stalking-horse, bidder, Mr. Ben-Avraham said that he had decided to wait until he had all his financing in place. He said he was committed to trying to save the brand, which he called one of his "inspirations."
Lawyers for Barneys were still working to finalize an agreement with its first formal bidder on Tuesday, according to a 10-minute hearing at the bankruptcy court in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. The lawyers said that they were working with buyers to "keep open the option" of a bid that would avoid liquidation and preserve jobs. They also said that it was possible that certain stores would keep operating under the terms of the initial bid.
"We expect to work through those remaining issues soon so we can have a signed purchase agreement as soon as possible," a lawyer for Barneys said at the hearing. "These are not easy negotiations and there is a lot of posturing and pressure going on, but our options are relatively limited at this point."
Neither A.B.G., which is run by its founder, Jamie Salter, nor Mr. Ben-Avraham has experience operating large department stores.
A.B.G., which bought the intellectual property of Sports Illustrated for $ 110 million in May, has built a global business on managing brand names, including the celebrity estates of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe. In 2016 it teamed up with the mall owners Simon Properties and General Growth and two liquidators to buy Aeropostale out of bankruptcy, a deal that could serve as a model for the proposed arrangement with Hudson's Bay.
A.B.G. recently sold the right to publish Sports Illustrated to a digital company, which laid off a significant percentage of the publication's staff this month.
Mr. Ben-Avraham began his career in the mid-1990s with the specialty boutique Atrium, a store that sold Nudie jeans next to Ralph Lauren, before founding Kith in 2011 with the designer Ronnie Fieg. It is both a multibrand retailer and one of the best-known streetwear lines.
Barneys was founded by Barney Pressman in 1923. Over the course of three generations of family ownership, it evolved from an off-price men's suiting outlet into a symbol of a certain kind of New York style: unabashedly elitist and very expensive. It grew to encompass women's wear, homewares and children's wear, and was famous for its rows of black apparel and ability to crown rising fashion stars.
It became a victim of its own mythmaking, however, and declared bankruptcy in 1996. It changed hands several times after that, and was sold in 2012 to Richard Perry and his hedge fund, Perry Capital. Mr. Perry has by all accounts been an absentee owner in recent years, and has not been involved in the bankruptcy proceedings despite holding a 72 percent stake in the company and a seat on the retailer's board.
Mr. Perry closed his hedge fund in September 2016 and has returned the vast majority of clients' money; Barneys is one of the remaining investments it is working to unwind. Josh Hechinger, a spokesman for Mr. Perry, declined to comment.
Barneys reported sales of about $ 790 million last year, with 30 percent of that coming from e-commerce, according to its bankruptcy filing. The company, which had 2,300 employees when it filed for bankruptcy, said that the 15 stores it planned to close posted losses of $ 14.2 million last year.
The luxury chain's challenges came to a head this year, culminating in "a liquidity crisis" by the summer. Its rent obligations jumped by $ 12 million while sales plummeted and vendors started refusing to ship inventory unless they were paid cash on delivery, according to the retailer's bankruptcy documents.
Whether such concerns are resolved by the potential new owners' plans is an open question. Others mentioned as potential bidders include Hilldun Corporation, the fashion financing company, and Mercury Group, a Russian retail and real estate group that owns TsUM department store and the Phillips auction house, according to two people with knowledge of the plans, who said they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Texto completo: The actress entered a minimum-security federal prison camp in California on Tuesday to begin serving her 14-day sentence, her representative said.
The actress Felicity Huffman reported to a minimum-security federal prison camp in the San Francisco Bay Area on Tuesday to begin serving a 14-day sentence for her role in the college admissions scandal, according to a representative for Ms. Huffman.
The Federal Correction Institution in Dublin, Calif., about 40 miles east of San Francisco, consists of a low-security facility housing 1,052 female inmates, and an adjacent minimum-security satellite camp with 175 more female inmates, now including Ms. Huffman.
The camp is based in an old prison facility, but like most federal minimum-security camps, it allows the inmates considerable freedom. Security is so low, in fact, that inmates have sometimes walked right out of the camp, though such incidents are rare. The cells are left unlocked, according to a Bureau of Prisons official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly. The camp houses many white-collar criminals, but also holds gang members and drug couriers, including some who are serving multiyear sentences, the official said.
A Bureau of Prisons office in Grand Prairie, Texas, generally makes decisions about where federal inmates will be housed. At the request of Ms. Huffman's lawyer, the judge who sentenced Ms. Huffman recommended that she be designated for "a facility commensurate with her security level closest to Dublin, California."
In May, Ms. Huffman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for paying a consultant $ 15,000 to cheat on her daughter's SAT exam. She was the first parent to be sentenced in the sprawling college admissions scandal. Generally, federal sentences of less than a year are not reduced for good behavior, so Ms. Huffman is expected to stay for the full two weeks.
In the prison camp where she is being housed, inmates sleep in bunk beds. Generally, there are two women to a cell, but it was not clear whether Ms. Huffman would have a cellmate.
According to the camp's online handbook, inmates are awakened each day at 5 a.m. Each inmate is responsible for making her bed according to posted regulations, and for sweeping and mopping her cell floor.
All of the inmates are required to work, the prison bureau official said, and people with very short sentences often work in food service. The official said that inmates generally work for at least five or six hours each day.
Inmates wear jumpsuits to work, and then generally change into shorts or sweat clothes that they can buy at the facility's commissary.
Inmates are allowed to have radios, and they have access to computers. They are not allowed to have phones, which are considered contraband and can land someone in a special housing unit, where inmates are sent for punishment.
There are zumba and yoga classes, according to the official. The handbook says sunbathing is prohibited, but the official said that the rule was not always enforced, and that some inmates do sunbathe.
Although the camp has had a reputation in the past as a cushy "Club Fed," the official and a second Bureau of Prisons official said that staffing shortages have made it less safe than it had been.
An investigation by The New York Times last year revealed that federal prisons across the country were dealing with rising violence and contraband problems as staffing at the facilities had dwindled. Some prisons, including the Dublin facility, are so pressed for guards that they have regularly compelled teachers, nurses, secretaries and other support staff to step in and help.
In June 2017, the warden at the Dublin prison complex said in a memo to workers that the prison had only 76 percent of the staff it needed, so he would be compelled to call upon other workers to fill in.
Despite the staffing problems, the camp has recently undergone some improvements, according to the Bureau of Prisons official. In the past couple of months, the official said, the camp's track and baseball field were refurbished, and a new volleyball court and horseshoe pit were constructed, along with a new tent and benches. The official was not sure whether the improvements were related to Ms. Huffman's assignment to Dublin, but said that many of them were in areas that are visible from a hill near the camp where journalists tend to gather when high-profile inmates arrive.

'Clipping coupons': Biden says he would eliminate capital gains tax before correcting himself

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden issued an instant correction during a dramatic moment in the Tuesday night debate in Ohio.
During a fiery back-and-forth between billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the 78-year-old former vice president defended his plan to tax the wealthy by hiking the current capital gains tax. He rejected the idea of demonizing wealthy Americans but got tripped up when he laid out his plan to restructure the U.S. tax code.
"Demonizing wealth ... I talked about how you get things done. The way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea, we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax," Biden said, before immediately changing his tune. "I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5%. I would double it, because, guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market make, in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said, who is a school teacher and a firefighter?"
Biden's misstep at a key moment in the Tuesday night debate was just one in a series of speaking errors he has made since rocketing to the head of the pack of 2020 Democrats. Biden has recently been under fire for his son Hunter's time on the boards of foreign companies that greatly enriched him personally. Hunter Biden, 49, said on Tuesday that he didn't believe he would have qualified for the positions if his father had not been vice president.
"It is impossible for me to be on any of the boards that I just mentioned without saying that I am the son of the vice president of the United States," Hunter Biden said in an exclusive Tuesday interview on ABC. Once the clear Democratic front-runner, Joe Biden's poll numbers have dropped dramatically in recent weeks.

Texto completo: Doce de los candidatos demócratas que se enfrentan para postularse como rival de Donald Trump en las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 se enfrentan hoy en un debate celebrado en la Universidad de Otterbein, en Ohio.
El debate presidencial de los demócratas este lunes está organizado por la cadena CNN y el diario The New York Times y puede ser el último de cuatro de los candidatos. La cifra de candidatos es récord para un debate de este tipo . En el siguiente debate, el de noviembre, hasta cuatro de ellos podrán perder su oportunidad de enfrentarse en público a sus competidores.
Julián Castro, el único representante latino, es uno de ellos. A él se unen la representante hawaiana Tulsi Gabbard, la senadora de Minnesota Amy Klobuchar y el exrepresentante demócrata Beto O’Rourke. Si estos cuatro candidatos no se esfuerzan al máximo esta noche, probablemente no participen en el próximo debate.

Texto completo: White House Roundup
WASHINGTON - Amid growing chaos in Syria, President Donald Trump has ordered all U.S. troops to withdraw from the country's north to avoid an "untenable" conflict between Turkey and U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday.
The approximately 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria are not leaving the country entirely, Esper told CBS' "Face the Nation."
Esper said he spoke to Trump on Saturday night amid growing signs that the Turkish invasion, which began Wednesday, is growing more dangerous.
"In the last 24 hours, we learned that they (the Turks) likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned - and to the west," Esper said.
Trump, in a tweet Sunday, said: "Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?"
Esper said he would not discuss a timeline for the U.S. pullback, but said it would be done "as safely and quickly as possible."
Schiff: Secret testimony aims to keep Trump in the dark
WASHINGTON - House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., defended holding testimony behind closed doors in the impeachment inquiry he's heading up against President Donald Trump, likening this phase of the investigation to a "grand jury."
"We want to make sure that we meet the needs of the investigation and not give the president or his legal minions the opportunity to tailor their testimony and in some cases fabricate testimony to suit their interests," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation."
Schiff said they may call some or all of the witnesses to return to testify in public later, though that might not include the whistleblower who triggered the impeachment fight in the first place.
While Trump and some of his Republican allies have hoped to unmask the official and question him or her, Schiff said his priority now is to protect the whistleblower and said they don't need the person's testimony to find out what happened on the phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
NYT: Violent parody video shown at Trump resort
WASHINGTON - A graphically violent parody video, shown last week at a meeting of President Donald Trump's supporters at his Doral Miami resort, depicted a likeness of the president shooting and stabbing his opponents and members of the news media in a church, the New York Times reported.
In the video, Trump's critics and media members are portrayed as parishioners fleeing his gruesome rampage. The fake Trump strikes the late Sen. John McCain in the neck, hits and stabs TV personality Rosie O'Donnell in the face, lights Sen. Bernie Sanders' head on fire and shoots or otherwise assaults people whose faces are replaced with news organization logos.
The video includes the logo for Trump's 2020 campaign.

Biden's son to leave Chinese firm's board

Texto completo: Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, the former vice president and a Democratic presidential candidate, intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company by the end of the month, according to a statement from his lawyer.
Hunter Biden's lawyer, George Mesires, said in a statement Sunday that Biden would resign from the company, BHR, an equity investment fund manager.
The statement added that if Joe Biden were to be elected president, his son would “agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies."
The role of the younger Biden in foreign companies has been a source of political grist for President Trump, who this month publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens' role in companies there.
In the statement, Mesires explained the role of Hunter Biden as an independent board member of Burisma, the largest independent natural gas producer in Ukraine. He earned $50,000 a month on the board of the company.
As vice president, the elder Biden pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who US representatives warned was soft on corruption and whose office oversaw investigations into the gas company's owner. No evidence has surfaced that the vice president, who was carrying out policies of the Obama administration, was motivated by his son's business interests.
Still, Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have used the connection to attack the elder Biden, a political ­opponent who is running for president as a Democrat.
“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine," Trump said in a recent interview with reporters.
Trump has his own troubles related to Ukraine. In July, he urged the Ukrainian president in a phone call to investigate the Bidens. The House has started an impeachment inquiry into that call and whether Trump used his role as president to influence the 2020 election.

Pompeo accuses reporter of working for the DNC
Nancy Amons, a longtime investigative reporter at Nashville's WSMV, had just seven minutes to interview Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while he was in town Friday to speak to a group about religious freedom. So Amons didn't waste any time, telling the secretary she was going to "start right away with the tough stuff."
Then, in an exchange that has been described as "gutsy," "relentless," and "a master class in journalism," Amons pressed Pompeo on the latest news in the Trump-Ukraine scandal. She questioned him about the resignation of one of his senior advisers and the ouster of a former US ambassador to Ukraine. She asked three times whether he met with Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani while in Warsaw, and he refused to say.
Undeterred, Amons inquired about text messages showing that US diplomats believed a relationship between Trump and Ukraine's president was contingent upon the country investigating his political rivals. That's when Pompeo lost his cool.
"You've got your facts wrong," he told Amons, shaking his head. "It sounds like you're working, at least in part, for the Democratic National Committee."
Pompeo was in Nashville to speak at a conference held by the American Association of Christian Counselors. As former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified before Congress that she was ousted as a result of pressure from Trump, the secretary of state joked to the group that it was "a heck of a day not to be in Washington."
While in Tennessee, Pompeo sat for interviews with local reporters, including Amons, who has worked for WSMV for more than three decades and produced investigations that have led to federal indictments and state probes. Some speculated that Pompeo was expecting easy questions when he sat down with her.

Louisiana governor forced into runoff with Republican
In a bid to recapture the governor's mansion, Republicans in Louisiana mounted an aggressive challenge to Governor John Bel Edwards, and on Saturday, the party succeeded in forcing the incumbent Democrat into a runoff election against a businessman who has never held political office.
Edwards had hoped to emerge with more than 50 percent of the vote in Saturday's jungle primary, where candidates from across the political spectrum compete against one another. But Edwards, a conservative Democrat, narrowly missed an outright victory.
Instead, Edwards, who took 46 percent of the vote Saturday, will face the businessman, Eddie Rispone, a conservative Republican who has aligned himself with President Trump and who cast himself as an outsider to politics, in a general election Nov. 16. Rispone received 27 percent of the vote.
Edwards has appeared especially vulnerable in a state that Trump won by 20 points in 2016 and where the president made a last-minute push for the Republican challengers at a rally Friday night. The Republican Governors Association had classified Louisiana as a potential “top pick-up."
Still, Edwards, a West Point graduate and the son of a sheriff, has managed to remain palatable among a conservative electorate by underscoring his distance on many issues from the rest of his party. He has pointed to his antiabortion stance and has been vocal in defending his record on protecting gun rights.
During the campaign, he also boasted of his role in closing a $2 billion deficit he inherited from his Republican predecessor, Bobby Jindal.
In televised debates and on the campaign trail, Edwards faced off with a pair of Republicans who competed against each other as much as they did the incumbent; Rispone challenged Representative Ralph Abraham, whose congressional district covers sections of the northeastern and central parts of the state.
Abraham received just shy of 24 percent of the vote.
Rispone, who with his brother founded an industrial engineering, construction and maintenance company in Baton Rouge, aligned himself with Trump's policies, particularly on immigration, and attacked Abraham for being, in his view, inconsistent in his support for the president.

Bruce LeFavour, 84, Who Pioneered Nouvelle Cuisine

Texto completo: As a restaurateur, he was in the vanguard of moving from rich French fare to more fish and seasonal, locally sourced fresh produce.
Bruce LeFavour, an eclectic, self-taught American cook who, on nothing more than three years in Europe and an innate appreciation of perfect ingredients, helped craft the early California cuisine movement, died on Oct. 4 at his home in Port Townsend, Wash. He was 84.
His death was confirmed by his daughter Cree LeFavour, who said his health had been declining since he had a stroke in 2015.
Mr. LeFavour (pronounced Le-FAVE-er), whose education in French food began in the late 1950s when he left Dartmouth for the Army and was stationed in France, would go on to open three restaurants across the United States. His first, in 1965, was in Aspen, where he developed a version of nouvelle cuisine before either the cooking style or the ski town had caught on among the nation's elite.
He opened his last in Northern California in 1981 during a decade that saw Wolfgang Puck, Mark Peel and a host of other chefs refine the notion of a thoughtful but casual culinary approach based on California's pristine ingredients. It was a movement that Alice Waters began when she opened Chez Panisse in 1971.
Inventive over the stove and hyper alert to any visual flaws on his plates before they left the kitchen, Mr. LeFavour much preferred to be called cook, rather than chef.
All his restaurants were off the beaten track. And yet, as Marian Burros, the longtime food writer for The New York Times, wrote in 1986 of his Paragon restaurant in Aspen, "It was the best the town had to offer and would have been equally successful in New York or San Francisco."
The Paragon, which he ran from 1965 to 1974, managed to be both a hippie haven for counterculture royalty -- the gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson was a frequent patron -- and a top-notch go-to classic for foodies.
"It is possible that the most imaginative menus in America per capita can be found in this little town 200 miles from Denver," Craig Claiborne, the influential restaurant critic for The Times, wrote during a visit to Aspen in 1969.
With its French-inspired menu, French waiters and French wines aging in its cellar, the Paragon was at the top of Mr. Claiborne's list. For dinner, he started with a delicately seasoned quiche Lorraine. He then attacked the wild boar, expertly cooked with crisp skin, "the flesh tasting much like tender roast pork."
Despite rave reviews, Mr. LeFavour kept his restaurants only as long as they held his interest.
As Aspen grew, he became restless and moved his family to central Idaho, where he opened a restaurant at the storied Robinson Bar Ranch, north of Sun Valley.
There he raised chickens, rabbits, ducks, pigs, and sheep, grew his own vegetables, made his own butter and cooked his own version of French cuisine.
"He was spoiled by the freshness and quality of the ingredients at the ranch," his daughter Cree said. "We had eggs that had been under the hen two minutes before."
That was good training for his next move, to the Napa Valley, where his restaurant, Rose et LeFavour, was an early adopter in California's nascent farm-to-table movement.
He supported local farmers, who in turn grew what he asked for. He would bring them seeds that yielded unusual varieties of carrots and beans. A neighbor, a retired Chicago detective whom he referred to only as Mrs. Herb, raised snails for him.
When local farmers began growing arugula in the early 1980s, they had no idea how much to charge for it. The well-traveled Mr. LeFavour told them that in Europe, it cost the same as a pack of cigarettes. The farmers then pegged their arugula prices to the cost of Mr. LeFavour's Lucky Strikes.
Three days a week, he drove an hour to Berkeley to buy fish at the Monterey Fish Market and dreamed up his menus on the drive back.
"He always said, 'Shop first and see what's available,"' his daughter recalled, "'then plan your menu second."'
Bruce LeFavour was born on Oct. 25, 1934, in Amsterdam, N.Y. His father, William Bruce LeFavour, was publisher of The Amsterdam Evening Recorder, which had been in his family for generations.
His mother, Harriett (Walden) LeFavour, a homemaker, died when Bruce was 11. He later attended boarding school at Phillips Academy Andover, where, he often said, he received an excellent education and learned to think critically. He graduated in 1953 and headed to Dartmouth.
In the summer of 1955, he joined a 900-mile canoe expedition across the harsh Barren Lands of Arctic Canada with five other young men. Known as the Moffatt expedition, after their leader, Arthur Moffatt, it became a notorious example of bad planning as they squandered their time, ran low on provisions, capsized in frigid waters and lost Mr. Moffatt to hypothermia. The others were lucky to survive.
Various accounts have been written of the harrowing journey. Mr. LeFavour wrote his as a novel, but it was never published.
He returned to Dartmouth, then dropped out before his scheduled graduation in 1957 and enlisted in the Army. After Army Language School, he worked as a counterintelligence officer in France, where he said he began his real education.
In 1961, after leaving the Army, he flew to Aspen for a friend's wedding and planned to return to France but was awed by the mountains and stayed. He married Patricia Saaf in 1963 and they had two daughters.
With no visible means of support, they decided to open the Paragon, though they had no restaurant experience.
"Though patrons did not realize it at the time," Ms. Burros wrote, "Mr. LeFavour was cooking a personalized version of what became nouvelle cuisine."
He carried that tradition to Idaho. But soon he was itching to move to California, while his wife wanted to stay. They sold their ranch to the singer-songwriter Carole King and were divorced soon after.
He settled in St. Helena, 65 miles north of San Francisco, in the heart of Napa wine country. He and Carolyn Rose, his partner, opened Rose et LeFavour.
There, Mr. LeFavour refined his French influences by cooking with locally sourced raw ingredients.
"That was the start of the California cuisine movement," said Joyce Goldstein, an author and chef who owned Square One, a restaurant in San Francisco.
He also was among the first to incorporate Asian elements into his dishes. He bought out Ms. Rose in 1986, then shuttered the restaurant the next year.
In 1990 he married Faith Echtermeyer, a photographer, with whom he traveled extensively. They hiked the French trail system and in 1999 collaborated on a book "France on Foot."
She survives him. Besides his daughter Cree, he is also survived by another daughter, Nicole LeFavour; a sister, Sidney LeFavour; and two grandchildren.
Ms. Goldstein remembered him as an unpretentious man who loved working in the kitchen.
"He wasn't out to get written up in magazines," she said. "He was not a glory boy. He was a cook. To me, the highest compliment you can give a chef is to say he was a good cook."

Can a Negro League stadium rebirth revive distressed Paterson, N.J.?

Texto completo: Headnote Restoring Glory
PATERSON, N.J. - There used to be a ballpark here, at the corner of Maple and Liberty. Baseball royalty once rounded the bases, and city residents once packed the stands.
Now defaced with graffiti, Hinchliffe Stadium looks like a blighted lot about to be razed. Weeds and trees have uprooted the bleachers, and asphalt and trash cover the infield.
"This is a stadium that unfortunately has symbolized the decay and decline of the city," Andre Sayegh, the city's mayor, said. "It's sad. And it speaks to the trajectory of Paterson. What we're trying to do is put Paterson back on the map, and part of that is restoring the stadium to its previous glory."
Hinchliffe, vacant since 1997, is one of the few stadiums from the Negro leagues still standing. An architectural gem and a symbol of perseverance amid racial injustice, it became a casualty of this economically distressed city's more pressing needs. After multiple failed attempts to fund its revival, a ninth-inning save seemed unlikely.
Until now.
After much debate in the past several months, a proposal to transform Hinchliffe into a multisport facility, primarily for children and high school teams, cleared its last local hurdle recently when City Council members approved the development plan.
Construction is expected to begin next year, in time for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Negro leagues. Once home to the New York Black Yankees and the New York Cubans, Hinchliffe was host to such players as Monte Irvin, Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, Cool Papa Bell and Paterson's own Larry Doby, the first Black player in the American League.
Previous efforts to bring the place back to life faltered, leaving residents, even young ones, fatalistic about its future. "When this place is fixed, I'll be 40," 14-year-old Saleh Ahmed said.
Across the street from Hinchliffe, Ahmed and other immigrants from Bangladesh regularly gather for games of cricket. Though the Art Deco stadium looms large, the boys know nothing of its place in history. To them, it's another abandoned lot, albeit one with a National Historic Landmark plaque nearby. The locker rooms, which once housed Hall of Famers and prep all-stars, are now spooky corridors of neglect. Ahmed once had to retrieve a ball hit into the stadium. "It was so scary," he said.
"If you were born in the 1990s, you would have no recollection of that stadium and what it means to the community," said Vaughn McKoy, the city's business administrator. That's why he thinks an exhibition gallery to honor the Negro leagues players who called Hinchliffe home, which is a part of the restoration plan, is so important: "To tell the story of the stadium," he said, "and what it means to the community."
In the 1930s and '40s, the game flourished here as segregation kept Black players out of the major leagues. In 1933, the stadium's first complete baseball season, Hinchliffe hosted the Negro leagues equivalent of the World Series. The next year, the New York Black Yankees made the stadium their home.
After Jackie Robinson broke Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and Doby followed three months later with the Cleveland Indians, the doors finally opened for players of color, lessening the necessity of Negro leagues.
Beyond baseball, Hinchliffe lived a full life, hosting boxing, auto races and headliners such as Duke Ellington and Abbott and Costello, who actually could have been on first during their performance. (Lou Costello grew up in Paterson.) The city launched its fireworks displays from the stadium.
Hinchliffe, which is owned by the school system, became a source of civic pride. Generations of high school athletes played on its field, and the Thanksgiving Day football game between the city's rival high schools was revered.
Even Doby, who started his Hall of Fame baseball career by trying out at Hinchliffe, treasured the memories of his high school football days there more, according to his son. "I'd ask my father to tell me stories about baseball, and all he wanted to talk about was football on Thanksgiving Day between Paterson Eastside and Central High School," Larry Doby Jr. said. He added, "He would talk about how the whole town would show up."
When the stadium fell into disrepair in the 1990s and closed in 1997, part of Paterson died, too. Now the stadium's rebirth is the centerpiece of a proposal to revitalize Paterson through state tax credits. The $76.7 million project, with $31.4 million allocated to Hinchliffe, includes plans to build housing, a restaurant, a parking garage and the gallery, which the mayor envisions as an East Coast version of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.
Remembering the struggles the players faced is especially relevant today, said Raymond Doswell, a vice president for the Kansas City museum. "It's a shame that there had to be a Negro league in the first place. It's a tragedy of American history."
Paterson, New Jersey's third-largest city, is also one of its most diverse - with 72 ethnic groups represented, some 40 languages spoken and a vibrant food scene. Despite this tapestry, and the history lessons the stadium provides, intolerant comments marred the City Council's handling of the proposal. Michael Jackson, the council's vice president, who was a Bethune-Cookman quarterback after playing at Hinchliffe, opposed the restoration, saying it would not provide the economic growth that tax credits are supposed to kindle. He preferred a plan to build a sports arena and hotel to create more jobs and boost the city's tax base.
"How does the stadium provide economic revitalization?" Jackson said. "It doesn't. You can't make money off the kids."
At a recent council meeting, he used the phrase "Jew us down" when referring to the developer's plans and past city deals. When rebuked by the mayor, a political opponent who is Arab-American, Jackson, who is Black, responded, "Like you've never used the N-word before." Later the councilman posted a noose on his Facebook page, leading to interpretations that he was comparing the criticism of his anti-Semitic comment to a lynch mob.
It has been 22 years since cheers rose from Hinchliffe, and if the City Council had voted down the plan, as it did initially, the opportunity to develop it using state tax credits would have disappeared. As Sayegh said, "There's no Plan B."
In the end, the proposal moved forward. The state is expected to sign off on the plan this month. Once construction begins next year, the project must be completed in two years, the state has stipulated.

Texto completo: The House's push to impeach President Trump is rooted in allegations leveled by Tallahassee author Peter Schweizer, who runs a think tank co-founded by Steve Bannon and backed by conservative donors and Trump supporters.
"Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends" – which shot to No. 1 when it was released March 2018 – provided the basis for Trump's attacks against ex-Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter and his business dealings in the Ukraine.
But it appears to have backfired, providing fuel for House Democrats in their impeachment investigation.
"The irony is that the target was supposed to be the Bidens, not the president," Bloomberg political columnist Joshua Green told NPR's Fresh Air this week.
The impeachment investigation has zeroed in on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelesky, where Trump urged him to "do us a favor" and investigate the Bidens.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son," Trump is quoted as saying.
The CIA whistleblower wrote in his report that Trump was using the power of his office to pressure a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election.
Schweizer, a senior contributor at the conservative Breitbart website once run by former Trump advisor Bannon, said in a recent op-ed piece that he didn't think what Biden's son did was illegal but raises the specter of undue influence. He devoted equal space to questions about Elaine Chao, the secretary of Transportation who is married to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell.
Schweizer is the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a not-for-profit research organization based in Tallahassee that he co-founded with Bannon in 2012. It has received millions in support from the Koch Family's Donors Trust and from the Mercer Family Foundation, a nonprofit that funds many conservative organizations. Rebekah Mercer is listed as a director of GAI.
GAI's mission statement is to "investigate crony capitalism, misuse of taxpayer monies, and other governmental corruption or malfeasance."
Schweizer, who has lived in Tallahassee since 1994, did not return a call or text message seeking comment for this story, but told the Democrat last year in an article about the book, "We have eight researchers and 16 employees, not all of them in Tallahassee."
Those researchers use forensic tools and specialized databases to research the financial connections of the families of the powerful, he said. It took over a year to get the main facts of the Biden narrative, and still left a lot of questions unanswered, he said.
"Secret Empires" delves into the extremes politicians will go to enrich themselves while in office, according to a New York Times book review. An Amazon synopsis says that children of powerful politicians go into business with people who want to curry favor with their influential parents.
Included are stories about McConnell and Chao and a multi-million dollar gift from her father. The House oversight committee is investigating allegations that she used her office to benefit her family's shipping business.
It also talks about Hunter Biden's business dealings while his father was vice president under Barack Obama. It delves into a $1.5 billion private equity deal involving Hunter Biden and a bank owned by the Chinese government, as well as his business association with Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company.
In a recent Bloomberg column, Green makes the case that "Secret Empires" is a "political hit job" that follows the same game plan as "Clinton Cash," which Bannon used to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016.
"Looking ahead to 2020, it wasn't hard to foresee that a moderate, two-term vice president like Joe Biden, popular across the party, was likely to run for president and be a good bet to win," Green said. "Nor was it difficult for GAI to turn up examples of ethically questionable behavior by Biden's family members and publish the information in Secret Empires."
But Secret Empires didn't have the same impact with mainstream media as "Clinton Cash" had, Green said.
Trump was impatient to advance the story he believed would damage Biden, so he tried to get his lawyer Rudy Giuliani to get the new Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens, Green said.
Giuliani told CNN that "a well-regarded investigator" had brought Hunter Biden's story to his attention, Green said.
Schweizer told Green it wasn't him. "I don't know Rudy and I've had no contact with Trump or the White House," he told Green.

Texto completo: "Desde el advenimiento del Ciudadano Kane, de Orson Welles, no aparecía en la industria un hombre igual de desconocido dispuesto a redefinir el arte de hacer películas para siempre".
Esta reflexión de Jon Ronson, crítico de The Independent, definió la irrupción de Quentin Tarantino a las grandes ligas de Hollywood, gracias a la que es considerada su obra maestra, Tiempos Violentos (1994).
Y aunque dos años antes el cineasta ya había sorprendido al mundo con su ópera prima, Perros de Reserva (1992), fue su segundo filme el que realmente le otorgó el estatus de autor cinematográfico.
"Es difícil entender que Tarantino, un talento mayormente autodidacta, que pasó sus años formativos atendiendo un videoclub, nos presente un trabajo con tanta profundidad, inteligencia y originalidad como éste.
"Es indiscutible cómo se posiciona con esta película en la lista de los mejores realizadores americanos de la historia", señaló Janet Maslin, crítica de The New York Times.
Desde su presentación al mundo el 21 de mayo de 1994 en el Festival de Cine de Cannes, donde se alzó con la Palma de Oro, Tiempos Violentos se convirtió en un trancazo de taquilla y crítica.
Fue nominada a siete Óscares, incluyendo Mejor Película (sólo ganó Mejor Guión Original); lanzó a su estudio, Miramax, al Olimpo de Hollywood, e inspiró a toda una generación de cineastas jóvenes.
Para cuando estrenó comercialmente en varias partes del mundo, el 14 de octubre de 1994, el apellido Tarantino ya era por todos conocidos y su estatus de culto apenas comenzaba a invadir a los cinéfilos.
"Quentin me dejó leer los primeros tratamientos del guión de Tiempos Violentos y ninguno de los dos sabíamos en lo que se iba a convertir.
"En ese entonces, el público no estaba preparado para ver una cinta tan bien escrita y poderosa. Sigo pensando que está adelantada a su tiempo", consideró Robert Rodríguez, amigo de Tarantino.
Estudiada y alabada hasta el día de hoy, tanto por su estructura narrativa y su polémica violencia, como por su música y su infinidad de "easter eggs", Pulp Fiction (su título original) sigue dando de qué hablar.
¿SABÍAS QUE? El legado del filme se ha extendido hasta el día de hoy en cine y televisión.
- La cinta forma parte del registro fílmico de la Librería Nacional del Congreso de Estados Unidos.
- Series como Community, Saturday Night Live, Los Simpson y Padre de Familia la han parodiado.
- Tiene 92 por ciento de "frescura" y críticas positivas en el sitio especializado Rotten Tomatoes.
- Ocupa el 95 en la lista de las Películas Más Importantes de la Historia, del American Film Institute.
- Robert Rodríguez, Guy Ritchie, Kevin Smith, Martin Scorsese y Dario Argento son fans de la cinta.
- Se utiliza la palabra "fuck" 265 veces a lo largo de toda la película.
- Existen hasta ahora siete ediciones distintas de la cinta en formato casero.
- La espada de "la Novia" en Kill Bill, el bat de "Bear Jew" en Bastardos Sin Gloria y el martillo de Calvin Candie en Django Sin Cadenas... todos aparecen en escenas de Tiempos Violentos.
- En 1997 se estrenó Plump Fiction, una comedia que parodiaba las cintas de Tarantino y Oliver Stone.
MILLONARIA 213,928,762 recaudó en taquilla en todo el mundo
8,500,000 fue el presupuesto de la cinta.
5,000,000 fue el salario total del reparto
2,500,000 copias vendidas del soundtrack

America's greedy millionaires and billionaires The Trump tax cuts gave the most help to the people who needed it least. And they are still begging for more.

Texto completo: The results are in. The Trump tax cuts resulted in most families saving so little that majorities continue to insist they see no difference in their paychecks. But one very small group made out spectacularly.
According to figures put together by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, detailed in their soon-to-be-released book, "The Triumph of Injustice," and reported in The New York Times last Monday, last year the 400 richest Americans "paid a lower total tax rate - spanning federal, state and local taxes - than any other income group." One impact? Income inequality is at record levels while wealth inequality in the United States is approaching that of Third World countries.
This, however, is still not enough for the richest Americans. Like the starving Oliver Twist, they want some more. They continue to prioritize their wealthy-to-extremely-wealthy bottom line over our welfare and what we stand for as a country.
Even as President Trump melts down in public, tramples long-standing alliances, destroys the integrity of our political and regulatory systems, denies the reality of climate change, and inflicts cruelties on the poor and desperate on a seemingly daily basis, the big money remains most concerned about their own bottom lines and the possibility of Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren winning the Democratic presidential nomination.
One prominent Democratic donor told The Washington Post he would refuse to vote if Warren were the nominee going up against Trump. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg claimed a Warren victory would be an "existential" crisis for the social media giant. Wall Streeters and corporate superstars rant about Sanders and Warren so much, they sound all but unhinged - billionaire private equity investor Stephen Schwarzman recently complained, "Maybe Bernie Sanders shouldn't exist."
Some of our complainers sound as if they stepped out of a Gilded Age satire. Wall Street Journal columnist John Stoll found yacht and boat manufacturers - already bleeding financially as a result of the Trump tariff wars - stumping for Trump because higher taxes could "slow demand for high-dollar boats." (I'll remember that while I'm pondering my soaring bills for health care, housing and my children's college education.)
The reason for these rants? Both Sanders and Warren are proposing not just significantly increased taxes on wealth, but crackdowns on big-money influence in politics and big businesses' power over all of us. Last Monday morning alone, Sanders, still off the campaign trail while recovering from a recent heart attack, called for banning all corporate contributions to funding the Democratic National Convention and presidential inauguration events, while limiting individual donations to $500 for the latter. As Sanders pointed out, Facebook and a number of other companies gave more than $1 million to the party's 2016 convention.
As for Trump's 2017 inauguration, it smashed records at $106 million. Also last Monday morning, Warren released a plan to end financial conflicts of interest among the judiciary, a complement to other proposals to crack down on corporate lobbying, and overall government and business corruption. Both senators have said they will crack down on private equity and break up Facebook.
Beginning in the 1980s, short-term shareholder value became the be-all and end-all, something that almost certainly not so coincidentally befitted the people in charge, who received the bulk of their ever-increasing pay in that form. (Yes, Sanders has a plan to fight that, too.) That money allowed them an ever greater influence in our culture, economy and politics, celebrated as people of unique genius and insight. It's a selfish, shortsighted way of thinking but one that's been ascendant for the better part of 40 years. The result? Those Trump tax cuts.
While it's understandable that someone with few or no dollars to spare will ponder which candidate is better for their personal finances, it's reprehensible that this is the position of these wealthy whiners. They'll be fine with less in their bank accounts or even one or two fewer zeros off their net worth statement. They can afford to think about the moral and long-range implications of their choice. What should concern them is a would-be strongman in the White House. Unstable, boastful, erratic, ignorant rulers are not a sign of a country climbing to greater heights but of one descending to ever deeper depths.

Texto completo: We asked readers about their college experience, and what they wish they had known sooner both inside and outside the classroom. We heard from hundreds of students and former students across the country and in Canada. The answers have been edited and condensed.
Outside of the classroom, what do you wish you had known?

In the way that my acquiring a disability put into perspective the ways in which perfectionism was guiding my academic path, so do I wish that I had sought balance outside of the classroom in college. When I returned to school after my leave, I found in the peers around me stories and experiences at times more educational than those found in textbooks.
At community colleges, and in an online degree completion program, everyone's lives had altered from "the path." We were thrown hurdles and had to adapt, find workarounds, wait, try, resolve. Yet there we were, in one classroom -- a patch-worked bunch of learners committed to sticking out life's turns in pursuit of education.

Forgive yourself for the many mistakes you may make along the way, and be kind and supportive to yourself; in acknowledging your own imperfections and process, you may find similarities in other people that help you build meaningful relationships.
As for the activities or hobbies you wish to try out, go for it and at least you wouldn't have to wonder about what could have been. Of all the places to explore your interests, college is among the best; look around you, and try opening some of those regular (probably daily) email newsletters once in a while.

Do whatever you can to graduate with as little debt as possible. Take a year here and there to just earn and save, take a co-op program, whatever you can do. Your possibilities on graduation get a lot more interesting if you can hit them without a huge debt-monster riding on your shoulders.

I overestimated, for better or worse, the amount of people in higher education who were there to pursue knowledge and truth. As someone who was driven by these, I began to see my internal compass as an asset.
As I watched intelligent people give up dreams, leave programs, it opened up places and opportunities that I dreamed of being in. For better or worse, I started recognizing my own intelligence to the point where I wasn't even looking at what others were doing.

If you act like you're supposed to be somewhere, people probably won't question you. Don't be afraid to go places by yourself. Take advantage of opportunities that interest you, regardless of what others think -- whether that be a guest speaker or a party. People admire those who aren't afraid to go out by themselves (as long as they let friends know where they're going and stay safe)

It's O.K. if it takes a long time to make friends. You're comparing the depth of friendships you've had over 12 years at home and new friends you're only making a couple semesters into college. It's normal not to feel as close to anyone at college as at home. It'll come.
Inside the classroom, what do you wish you had known?
Wade Shimoda, Honolulu , M.I.T.
I wish I had known how to study. I did well in high school, but apparently I didn't have to study that much to do well, relative to how much I had to study in college just to do O.K. It took me a while to figure out how to study, and to this day, I don't know if I ever truly figured it out.

Advice-givers aren't joking when they tell you to network with professors. The kids who start early see exponential growth in available opportunity. The later you start, the less you reap. Some kids find the prospect easy, others find it difficult.
Worried about being too green and wasting your professor's time? Reframe the problem. Their job is to teach, yours is to learn. Do your job.

I wish I had known that it's O.K. to not go straight to university. When I graduated high school, I felt lost and alone getting a job and starting community college while all my friends left for their universities and got to live in dorms. I made myself miserable with worry that I was behind and missing out. But community college changed my life for the better, and I want other people to know it's O.K. to take a nontraditional path.

I wish I would've known the academic resources on campus that were offered to students. In particular, multicultural students. Sometimes, well, the majority of the times, we fall between the cracks academically. There's general academic advising and tutoring across the campuses nationwide. However, most campuses don't have a safe haven (academically) for a student who identifies outside the most represented group on campus, white students.
This barrier we face innately projects fear or intimidation to reach out and access services that may or may not be offered on campus.

I believe it is important for every college student to figure out what their "call" is in life, whether it be medicine, politics, or business. Once this is determined, everything else will come naturally.

Take some classes to expand your mind, like philosophy, literature, theory. I had a good, practical education within my major and minors, but I wish I used the time and space to just think a little more deeply.

I wish I had known how to separate my learning from my grades. My educational experience became profoundly better and more enriched when I learned how to start learning for the sake of learning, and not for the sake of monotonously turning in an assignment for the grade I would get in return.

Tina Yu, Boston, University of Michigan
I wish I had known to take more "leap-of-faith" classes -- classes outside of your comfort zone, or classes that don't have anything to do with your major but sound incredibly interesting. I often think back and wish I had taken more of these quirky classes that intrigued me, because while you generally know what to expect out of Econ 101, can you really say that same thing about a class like DNA Origami, Hula, Practical Botany, or Apocalyptic Media?

Amanda Starkey, Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich., Ferris State University and University of Detroit Mercy
I am a first-generation college grad. When I was in my early years at college, I assumed everyone else was so much smarter than me, and that for whatever reason I wasn't good enough to reach for the program I really wanted.
Now, I'm excelling at my career with a B.S. and M.A. under my belt. I wish I would have had more faith in my ability to achieve great things. I would have gone to medical school like I always dreamed.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Elizabeth Warren is playing a game of dare with Facebook.
The Democratic presidential candidate bought a political ad on the social network this past week that purposefully includes false claims about Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and President Trump to goad the social network to remove misinformation in political ads ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
The ad, placed widely on Facebook beginning on Thursday, starts with Ms. Warren announcing "Breaking news." The ad then goes on to say that Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg are backing the re-election of Trump. Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor the Silicon Valley company has announced their support of a candidate.
"You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not," Ms. Warren said in the ad.
In a series of tweets on Saturday, Ms. Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, said she had deliberately made an ad with lies because Facebook had previously allowed politicians to place ads with false claims. "We decided to see just how far it goes," Ms. Warren wrote, calling Facebook a "disinformation-for-profit machine" and adding that Mr. Zuckerberg should be held accountable.
Ms. Warren's actions follow a brouhaha over Facebook and political ads in recent weeks. Mr. Trump's campaign recently bought ads across social media that accused another Democratic presidential candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., of corruption in Ukraine. That ad, viewed more than five million times on Facebook, falsely said that Mr. Biden offered $ 1 billion to Ukrainian officials to remove a prosecutor who was overseeing an investigation of a company associated with Mr. Biden's son Hunter Biden.
This past week, the Biden campaign demanded that Facebook, Twitter and YouTube take down the ad. Facebook refused, telling the Biden campaign that it would keep the Trump ad up because of its belief that statements by politicians add to important discourse and are newsworthy, even if they are false. Twitter and YouTube have also kept the ad online.
Ms. Warren's false ad on Facebook is now set to escalate her growing feud with the world's biggest social network.
Ms. Warren has turned into a vocal critic of tech companies and their power. She has called for behemoths like Facebook and Google to be broken up. In a leaked audio recording published this month of a meeting that Mr. Zuckerberg had with Facebook employees, he was heard saying that Facebook would sue if Ms. Warren were to enact the breakup plan as president. In response, Ms. Warren doubled down, saying that America needed to "fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy."
This month, Ms. Warren's campaign also sent an email seeking donations with the subject line "re: Mark Zuckerberg." And at a rally in San Diego, as she talked about the power of huge corporations, she told the crowd, "Break them up. And yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I'm looking at you."
For Facebook, the situation is tricky. The social media company has struggled in recent years with what to allow and disallow on its site, especially after revelations that Russian operatives used the platform during the 2016 presidential election to post disinformation to inflame the American electorate. Facebook has moved to clamp down on false content. Yet when the company removes or buries messages, ads, photos and videos, it is often called out for bias and censorship. Facebook has faced particular wrath from conservatives, who have said the social network intentionally suppresses what they say.
"Facebook believes political speech should be protected," a spokesman for Facebook said on Saturday. "If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech."
Ms. Warren's campaign declined to comment on Saturday beyond her Twitter thread and Facebook ad.
Truth in social media advertising is likely to become a bigger issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to speak about Facebook's political speech policies this coming week at Georgetown University.
Presidential candidates have been spending huge sums on ads on Facebook and other social media platforms to reach voters. Some campaigns have focused on advertising specifically on Facebook given its sheer size -- it has more than 2.2 billion users worldwide -- and the ability to spread ads and content cheaply and quickly across the platform.
Like her rivals for the Democratic nomination, Ms. Warren has spent a significant amount of money on Facebook advertising, which is a crucial way to reach potential grass-roots donors. Over all, her presidential campaign has spent more than $ 3.3 million on Facebook ads, according to numbers disclosed by the company.
Unlike the social media companies, some cable outlets have refused to run the false Trump campaign ad that said Mr. Biden acted corruptly in Ukraine. CNN and NBCU, which declined to run the ad, said it violated their standards. Some broadcast networks across the nation have run the ad, including in early voting states.
Late on Saturday, Facebook tweeted a response to Ms. Warren. The company said broadcast stations had aired the Trump ad more than 1,000 times as required by law and that the Federal Communications Commission didn't want broadcast companies censoring speech. "We agree it's better to let voters -- not companies -- decide," Facebook said.

Heirs of omission: Who’s in, and not in, a will

Texto completo: These past few weeks we’ve been discussing “omissions” (you can decide whether these are errors or sins). As an estate planning attorney, I instantly think of “omitted heirs.” And you may think, “huh?”
An omitted heir is a person who would have inherited by law but was not mentioned in a will or trust. A related concept is “pretermitted heir”– someone who was born to, adopted by, or married to the deceased after the date of the will. Both situations have legal consequences, which may or may not have been intended.
Occasionally, I meet with a client who intends to disinherit a child. We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
* The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.
* The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
* The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

Anthony Davis sprains thumb, Lakers look tired in loss to Nets in China

Texto completo: The start of the sequence was something fans had been craving for months: As Anthony Davis corralled a defensive rebound, he sent an outlet pass sailing past the halfcourt line to a streaking LeBron James.
James ran under the rim for the lay-up … and missed it. He got his own rebound … and missed again right under the hoop.
Multiple blown lay-ups on one play is unusual to see from the 34-year-old star, but then again, it’s been an unusual trip.
Fatigue was the predominant trait of the Lakers in Saturday’s 91-77 loss to the Brooklyn Nets, the second of two exhibition games played under fraught geopolitical circumstances in China. The weight of international travel, atypical drama and playing their second game in three nights seemed to slow the Lakers down in Shenzhen: They scored just 36 points in the first half, looking listless against a Nets team that didn’t even suit up its best player, Kyrie Irving.
The most relevant portion of the night ended with some discouraging news: Davis, who made his first start at center in the team’s third preseason game, sprained his right thumb on a block. The Lakers ended up pulling him after one quarter, setting him up on the bench with a fresh wrap, and the new franchise centerpiece finished with just 6 points on 2-for-7 shooting.
The Lakers announced after the game that Davis would undergo diagnostic testing upon his return to Los Angeles, joining Kyle Kuzma, Quinn Cook and Jared Dudley as players who have been laid up with ailments recently.
No one else picked up the slack. James also played just one quarter, finishing with four assists and six points on 2-for-7 shooting including his misses near the basket. While team sideline reporter Mike Trudell shared that James spent much of the second half interacting with Chinese fans – thawing some of the chill that had set in earlier in the week between the NBA and the host country – he did little on the court to sate them.
The role players that have sparked some intrigue early did little to help blunt the impact of the star power outage. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Avery Bradley combined for 25 points, but required 25 shot attempts. Rajon Rondo, who started for the second consecutive game, had no assists and four turnovers in 16 minutes. JaVale McGee stood out in the first two exhibitions – on Saturday, he had a much more down-to-earth performance (9 points, 3 rebounds, 2 blocks). As a team, the Lakers shot just 33 percent, including 5 for 32 from 3-point range.
The small lineup with Davis at center struggled to create offense, but the Nets also struggled to score as well. After one quarter, a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by Alex Caruso had kept the Brooklyn lead to just 20-19 in a rock fight. While Davis has famously wished to play less center, he was a brutally efficient rim protector, getting a pair of blocks despite his injury.
Caris LeVert (22 points) helped pull Brooklyn back in pole position, putting on a well-rounded display after missing most of Thursday’s 114-111 Nets win that provided much more suspense. Taurean Prince added 14 points.
The Lakers were to fly back immediately Saturday, scheduled to reach Los Angeles late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. While the NBA decided Friday to not make media available for the rest of the trip, it seemed safe to assume the Lakers and the league welcomed the end of a whirlwind week that started with a flurry of outrage over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeting in support of Hong Kong protests against the government.
The NBA has been under fire from both sides, as Chinese businesses pulled sponsorships and state-run television decided to blacklist the games. Back in the United States, the president was among the notable critics of the league for bowing to foreign interests. Shenzhen is just north of Hong Kong, giving rise to some concern that the Lakers’ second exhibition could have more tension than the first, but The New York Times reported that the Chinese government had asked the media and public to tone down the fiery rhetoric earlier in the week, soothing some of the angst.
The Lakers will play their first preseason game at Staples Center against the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. It’s unclear if any players will sit out on a short turnaround after a flight halfway across the globe.

Texto completo: Hoy abrió al público una plataforma de observación de vidrio en el piso 102 del Empire State Building que ofrece vistas de 360 ​​grados de la ciudad, en un ambiente sin paredes.
La apertura marca el comienzo de lo que los diseñadores llaman la “Experiencia del Observatorio”, resultado de cuatro años y $165 millones de dólares en renovaciones destinadas a resolver las largas colas y la congestión para hacer más atractiva la visita al edificio más famoso de Nueva York y quizá EEUU.
Después de ingresar, ahora a través de la calle 34 en lugar de la 5ta Avenida, los visitantes pasan por la fascinante arquitectura art deco y un modelo de 24 pies del edificio antes de acceder a una exhibición de 10 mil pies cuadrados sobre la historia del edificio abierto en 1931.
La exhibición dinámica y digital impulsa a los visitantes hacia los ascensores que transportan, en 55 segundos, a la cubierta del piso 86.
Los visitantes pueden ir al piso 102 pagando $20 dólares adicionales. Una variedad de beneficios, como tours privados y pases sin colas también están disponibles en paquetes que cuestan hasta $460, describió el New York Times.
“Es, simplemente, una vista inigualable”, dijo el jueves Jean-Yves Ghazi, presidente de Empire State Realty Trust, la compañía propietaria del edificio.
“Somos el punto en el mapa que mantiene unida a esta ciudad”, agregó. “Hay mucho significado aquí. La altura no es el marcador; se trata del estatus icónico de este lugar”.
El mirador en el piso 102 ofrecerá a grupos de unas 55 personas la oportunidad de ver Nueva York desde el panorama más alto de 360 ​​grados en la ciudad , destacó Ghazi.
El observatorio es completamente transparente. Los que se atreven pueden mirar directamente a las calles de abajo.
“Nunca ha habido un mejor momento para darle una nueva mirada” a la ciudad, escribió James S. Russell, recomendando que hasta los neoyorquinos y turistas que han subido al mirador del Empire State deberían volver ahora a redescubrirlo.
* ¿Cuáles son los 10 rascacielos más altos de Nueva York en la actualidad?
* Nueva York tendrá la terraza panorámica más alta del hemisferio, con piso transparente en Hudson Yards

Texto completo: President Donald Trump on Saturday acknowledged news reports that his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani may be under investigation by federal investigators, calling the reported probe "shameful. "
"So now they are after the legendary 'crime buster' and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani," Trump wrote in a tweet. "He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!"
Trump's comments came after news broke Friday in The New York Times that federal prosecutors are investigating Giuliani for potential lobbying law violations as it relates to his work in Ukraine. The Times, citing two anonymous people "familiar with the inquiry," reported the probe focuses on Giuliani's efforts to "undermine" former U. S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie L. Yovanovitch, who testified before three House committees Friday in the impeachment inquiry of Trump.
Trump told Fox News on Saturday that Giuliani is still his attorney, a day after answering that question at the White House by saying he didn't know.
"Yes," Trump told Fox in response to a question about whether Giuliani was still his attorney. "He's a great gentleman he was a great mayor. "
So now they are after the legendary “crime buster” and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019
The investigation of Giuliani is also, the Times reports, linked to Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Ukrainian-born business partners arrested Wednesday in connection with alleged schemes to funnel foreign money to U. S. political campaigns. Parnas and Fruman helped Giuliani meet former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko as the president's personal lawyer pushed for an investigation into Trump's political rival Joe Biden.
The impeachment inquiry of Trump, which is tied to the president's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rivals like Biden, has drawn attention to Giuliani and whether his activities in Ukraine violate a federal law that requires Americans who work on behalf of foreign governments to register with the Justice Department.
Giuliani defended himself against such a crime by claiming to the Times he was working for Trump, not a foreign government.
“Look, you can try to contort anything into anything, but if they have any degree of objectivity or fairness, it would be kind of ridiculous to say I was doing it on Lutsenko’s behalf when I was representing the president of the United States,” Giuliani told the Times.
Giuliani said Saturday that he has had no contact with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, but he said any such scrutiny was likely politically motivated.
“No, nothing but leaks,” Giuliani said. “It’s a political attack, otherwise why leak it. If it’s an appropriate law enforcement investigation, you try to keep it secret so the subjects aren’t alerted. ”
Trump and Giuliani: Donald Trump distances himself from Rudy Giuliani: 'He has been my attorney'
Jon Sale, a former Watergate prosecutor whom Giuliani hired to represent him in the impeachment inquiry, told USA TODAY on Friday that he’s not aware of an investigation into Giuliani. He said Giuliani has not been contacted by investigators in New York.
Representatives for Manhattan U. S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman did not immediately respond to inquiries from USA TODAY. A spokeswoman for the U. S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York declined to confirm Friday if Giuliani is under investigation, only saying that the probe into Parnas and Fruman is ongoing.
Giuliani declined to comment on his dealings with Parnas and Fruman, saying they are his clients and much of their communications are bound by attorney-client privilege.
On Friday, Yovanovitch – a career diplomat – spent hours on Capitol Hill giving a deposition for House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.
In her opening remarks, Yovanovitch said she was told by a high-ranking agency official "that the president had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador. "
The State Department official "added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the Summer of 2018," according to her statement. "He also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause. I departed Ukraine for good this past May. "
Trump indeed pulled Yovanovitch from her Ukraine ambassador post in May.
Giuliani told a Ukrainian journalist that Yovanovitch was "removed . . . because she was part of the efforts against the president. " Giuliani further targeted Yovanovitch in a packet of "disinformation" that he gave to State Department officials earlier this year. The dossier was full of debunked allegations and political smears targeting the president’s perceived enemies, and it eventually made its way to lawmakers leading the impeachment probe.
After a briefing on the Giuliani dossier by the State Department's chief watchdog, the three chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry said it raised "troubling" new questions about efforts inside and outside the Trump administration to target Yovanovitch and others.
Trump attempted to distance himself from Giuliani on Friday, casting doubts on whether the former New York City mayor was still his lawyer.
Asked whether Giuliani remained his personal attorney, Trump said: “I don’t know. ”
“I haven't spoken to Rudy,” Trump told reporters as he was leaving the White House for a political rally in Louisiana. “I spoke to him yesterday, briefly. He's a very good attorney and he has been my attorney, yeah sure. ”
Giuliani told USA TODAY shortly afterward that he’s still Trump's lawyer. “He hasn't told me otherwise,” he said.

Ignore portents of doom

Texto completo: The Competitive Enterprise Institute has published a new paper, "Wrong Again: 50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalyptic Predictions." Keep in mind that many of the grossly wrong environmentalist predictions were made by respected scientists and government officials. My question for you is: If you were around at the time, how many government restrictions and taxes would you have urged to avoid the predicted calamity?
As reported in The New York Times (August 1969) Stanford University biologist Dr. Paul Erhlich warned: "The trouble with almost all environmental problems is that by the time we have enough evidence to convince people, you're dead. We must realize that unless we're extremely lucky, everybody will disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years."
In 2000, Dr. David Viner, a senior research scientist at University of East Anglia's climate research unit, predicted that in a few years winter snowfall would become "a very rare and exciting event. Children just aren't going to know what snow is." In 2004, the U.S. Pentagon warned President George W. Bush that major European cities would be beneath rising seas. Britain will be plunged into a Siberian climate by 2020. In 2008, Al Gore predicted that the polar ice cap would be gone in a mere 10 years. A U.S. Department of Energy study led by the U.S. Navy predicted the Arctic Ocean would experience an ice-free summer by 2016.
Peter Gunter, professor at North Texas State University, predicted in the spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness: "Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions. By the year 2000, 30 years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine."
Ecologist Kenneth Watt's 1970 prediction was, "If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000." He added, "This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age."
Mark J. Perry, scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan's Flint campus, cites 18 spectacularly wrong predictions made around the time of first Earth Day in 1970. This time it's not about weather. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated that humanity would run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold and silver would be gone before 1990. Kenneth Watt said, "By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate ... that there won't be any more crude oil."
There were grossly wild predictions well before the first Earth Day, too. In 1939, the U.S. Department of the Interior predicted that American oil supplies would last for only another 13 years. In 1949, the secretary of the interior said the end of U.S. oil supplies was in sight. Having learned nothing from its earlier erroneous energy claims, in 1974, the U.S. Geological Survey said that the U.S. had only a 10-year supply of natural gas. However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2017, there were about 2,459 trillion cubic feet of dry natural gas in the United States. That's enough to last us for nearly a century. The United States is the largest producer of natural gas worldwide.
Today's wild predictions about climate doom are likely to be just as true as yesteryear's. The major difference is today's Americans are far more gullible and more likely to spend trillions fighting global warming. And the only result is that we'll be much poorer and less free.

Prince Estate to Trump: Don't Play 'Purple Rain'

Texto completo: The estate said that despite an agreement last year not to use Prince's music, the song was played at the president's rally on Thursday night in Minneapolis, the singer's hometown.
The estate of Prince, the musician who died in 2016, pushed back against President Trump's campaign on Thursday night after the artist's song "Purple Rain" was played at a Trump rally that night in Minneapolis, the singer's hometown.
On a Twitter account set up to celebrate the life of the singer, the estate said that Jones Day, the law firm that has represented Mr. Trump in election law matters and continuing lawsuits, had agreed last October that the campaign would not use Prince's songs at rallies and other events.
The estate posted a letter it said it had received from Jones Day last year. "Without admitting liability, and to avoid any future dispute, we write to confirm that the Campaign will not use Prince's music in connection with its activities going forward," the letter said.
The estate said on Twitter that despite that understanding, "Purple Rain" had been played at the Minneapolis rally. "The Prince Estate will never give permission to President Trump to use Prince's songs," it said.
A representative for Jones Day was not immediately available for comment on Friday.
Other artists have asked the Trump campaign not to use their music, including Rihanna and Axl Rose, and the wording in the Jones Day letter resembled one also sent to representatives of Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith, who had objected to the playing of his music at Trump events.
Such requests are not unusual for politicians and the arenas where they drum up support. Usually, music rights agencies advise campaigns to buy blanket licenses so they can play music in the agencies' catalogs wherever they are. Arenas where politicians appear often have a blanket license that allows the venue to play any song in an agency's catalog.
Sometimes artists find that their music has slipped through into an event for a politician they do not support. In 2018, Pharrell Williams sent a letter to the president after the song "Happy" was played at an event on the day of the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh.
But the group that hosted the event, the National FFA (Future Farmers of America) Organization, said its organist had played the song without any input from the campaign, The New York Times reported.

Apple pulls app used by Hong Kong protesters

Texto completo: Chinese state media had accused U.S. tech giant of enabling demonstrators
HONG KONG - In the space of a week, Apple made a trio of changes to its phone software in Hong Kong that pleased the Chinese government but irked human rights advocates.
First, it removed the emoji for the flag of Taiwan, which China doesn't recognize, from its operating system. Then, it banned media outlet Quartz, which had offered readers detailed accounts of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. And on Wednesday night, it banned the HKmap.live app, which identified police locations, offering protesters a way to avoid the violent crackdowns underway.
It was Apple's second reversal on HKmap.live, which it initially rejected and then allowed to appear in its App Store. The latest about-face came after the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, said in a blog post this week that the app had "betrayed the feelings of the Chinese people." The article accused the app's anonymous developer of harboring malicious motives and queried whether Apple was an accomplice of "rioters."
Removing the HKmap.live app "is just the latest incident of Apple caving to the Chinese government's political pressure," said Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Hong Kong's Beijing-backed authorities have intensified a crackdown on demonstrators, who have taken to the streets to push for democracy and oppose Beijing's tightening grip on the semiautonomous financial hub. The unrest has become increasingly violent in recent weeks, posing the most direct challenge to the rule of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Apple, which depends on access to cheap labor in China to manufacture its devices, has a long history of capitulating to the Communist Party there. In 2017, it removed virtual private networks, which allowed Chinese citizens to freely use the Internet, from its App Store in China. That same year, it removed the New York Times app at the request of the government. In 2018, it moved Chinese citizens' iCloud accounts from U.S. servers to Chinese ones, giving the government there easier access to the data. Apple has said it is simply complying with local laws.
Apple's move comes as U.S. businesses find themselves under pressure from China's government over actions or statements perceived as contrary to the narrative of the ruling Communist Party. The pressure is particularly acute when it involves sensitive political issues such as the Hong Kong demonstrations.
In recent days, the National Basketball Association found itself the target of a furious nationalist backlash from Beijing after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters. Blizzard Entertainment, meanwhile, suspended a professional gamer for a year for reportedly shouting "Liberate Hong Kong!" during an interview. Chinese tech giant Tencent owns a 5 percent stake in Blizzard's parent company, Activision Blizzard.
The tension has highlighted some U.S. firms' dependence on China while raising questions about their willingness to compromise on values such as freedom of expression to continue doing business in the country, where authorities tolerate no criticism of the ruling party. The experience also has shown the Chinese government's preparedness to punish foreign companies that don't toe its line.
In Hong Kong, other U.S. companies have found themselves on the opposite side of the coin. Starbucks outlets have been targeted by pro-democracy demonstrators because the Seattle-based chain's local franchisee, Maxim's, is seen as backing the Chinese government's stance against the protests.
Hong Kong police didn't respond immediately to a request for comment Thursday about their purported role in the HKmap.live app's removal.
The app used crowdsourced information to publicize the locations of riot police, traffic disruptions, deployment of tear gas and other incidents related to the protests.
In a statement late Wednesday, Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said the company was contacted by "many concerned customers in Hong Kong" about the app. It investigated immediately and then "verified" with the Hong Kong police that the app had been used to "target and ambush police" and threaten public safety, adding that the program violated its rules.
Sainz declined to answer exactly what the customers in Hong Kong were concerned about, or whether the police offered any evidence of a crime being committed.
Wang, of Human Rights Watch, said Apple's statement was "rather disingenuous," because the Hong Kong police ultimately take orders from Beijing, she said. "We all know the Hong Kong government is not independent of the Chinese government. The reason Apple did it is because Apple has so much financial interest in China."
Sainz declined to comment on whether any evidence was provided by the Hong Kong police.
To be sure, some protesters have resorted to violence in Hong Kong, but Wang said that it was somewhat laughable to think anyone would need an app to find police to ambush. Police can be found in Hong Kong by simple going out to dinner, she said. On the other hand, peaceful protesters are facing violent crackdowns from police, she said, giving them good reason to try to avoid them.
In a statement on Twitter on Thursday, the app's developer said there was no evidence that it had been used to target police or threaten public safety. It stressed that moderators deleted comments that encouraged criminal activity.
Apple's move, it said, was "clearly a political decision" designed to suppress freedom and human rights in Hong Kong.

Texto completo: Marlon James' novel "Black Leopard, Red Wolf," an epic fantasy about a bounty hunter on the trail of a mysterious boy, on Tuesday was named one of the five fiction finalists for the National Book Award.
James, who won the Man Booker Prize in 2015 for his novel "A Brief History of Seven Killings," is up against two debut authors, Kali Fajardo-Anstine, for her story collection "Sabrina & Corina," and Julia Phillips, for her novel "Disappearing Earth," about two sisters who are lured into a stranger's car and disappear in Russia's remote Kamchatka Peninsula. The two others, both of them previously Pulitzer finalists, are Susan Choi, for "Trust Exercise," and Laila Lalami, for "The Other Americans."
The nonfiction finalists include "Solitary," the memoir of Albert Woodfox, a man who served more than four decades in solitary confinement, and "The Yellow House," Sarah M. Broom's memoir of her New Orleans family and how its members were scattered after Hurricane Katrina. They will compete with Tressie McMillan Cottom's "Thick: And Other Essays," Carolyn Forche's "What You Have Heard Is True: A Memoir of Witness and Resistance" and David Treuer's "The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present."
The finalists in translated literature include works originally written in Arabic, Finnish, French, Hungarian and Japanese.
All of the winners will be announced Nov. 20 at an awards ceremony in New York City.

Texto completo: My son came home from school the other day vexed.
His fourth-grade class was planning a party and the teacher suggested Chick-fil-A. The other children were ecstatic. My son panicked.
“We don’t eat Chick-fil-A,” he told me.
Which is true. He’s long heard me rant about the company, which has taken a strong stand against same-sex marriage. Our gay friends deserved equal treatment, even from a fast-food joint, I told my son, and he took it to heart.
But now, his reaction to the class party made me regret all those times I vented about Chick-fil-A or Hobby Lobby or any of the other organizations that comprised my boycott list.
Like all parents, I want my children to reflect our family’s values. But more than that, I want them to be critical thinkers who assess the facts, weigh both sides and draw their own informed conclusions about an issue even if they disagree with Mom and Dad. And I certainly didn’t want my son to skip a class party over Chick-fil-A.
The line between moral education and indoctrination is a thin one. Maybe we’d crossed it.
I commiserated with a friend, whose son ran on a pro-immigration platform for his kindergarten class president campaign. The other candidates promised ice cream and slime parties and to not talk when the teacher is talking.
Her son’s campaign poster read (spelling corrected): “If I was a president, I would change the world and make sure that Donald Trump would not make a wall.”
We got a kick out of it and I thought her son’s moral grounding was admirable. She did, too. But she also wondered, like me, if too much political talk works against us in the long run.
The research bears this out. At first, children of politically active partisan parents adopt the ideals of their parents, found a 2013 study in the British Journal of Political Science. But as they become adults, these children are more likely than others to abandon those ideals and embrace the opposing side. Turns out, early indoctrination only gets you so far.
In our house, we watch the news and read articles from the New York Times and Atlantic magazine to both children, even to the 4-year-old. The kids come with me to the polls on voting day and when I canvass the neighborhood for a candidate. They know democracy takes work, and we all need to roll up our sleeves.
But nuance is an acquired perspective, and frankly, some of us never learn it. For children, grasping nuance and context and concept is nearly impossible, which is why they fixate on concrete representations of our beliefs – walls and Chick-fil-A.
For my son to truly understand why I don’t eat Chick-fil-A, he’d have to understand our country’s founding vision under the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, centuries of intolerance and repression backed by government policy, Stonewall, capitalism, collective action, economic boycotts and corporate responsibility. And then he’d have to accept the reality that even if he skips the class party, Chick-fil-A may still stand against our gay friends.
But I had to try. In the long run, raising a child without critical thinking skills would be far worse for our democracy than eating Chick-fil-A.
Together, my son and I read articles about Chick-fil-A, how the company had used funds from its charitable foundation to oppose same-sex marriage and to support wonderful programs for communities in need. We talked about boycotts and how we as consumers can withhold our dollars to effect change in a company’s policies. We discussed whether this dynamic changes if someone else – say, his fourth-grade teacher – buys Chick-fil-A.
My son thought long and hard. In the end, he said, “I don’t think I can eat it.” I promised to pack him a lunch. And if it turns out he can’t resist the chicken nuggets, that’s okay too. He can save the lunch for another day.

Texto completo: President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani is under investigation for his work in Ukraine.
Giuliani, 75, has attempted to gather evidence of criminal activities by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter while also trying to persuade foreign governments to help them dig up dirt.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating if he broke lobbying laws in his dealings with Ukraine, the New York Times reported Friday night. The investigation is tied to the arrests of two of Giuliani's clients who were helping him in his investigation, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. The two individuals were arrested on campaign finance-related charges.
The investigation is focusing on Giuliani's efforts to undermine Marie Yovanovitch, the American ambassador. She told House impeachment investigators Friday during her testimony that Trump got rid of her over "unfounded and false claims," according to Politico.
Yovanovitch, who was mentioned in the famous Trump-Ukraine phone call, was appointed to the post by President Barack Obama in 2016 and recalled by Trump in May.

‘Well, now there’s 12’: Biden grouses about crowded 2020 Democratic debate stage

Texto completo: Joe Biden expressed anxiety about a large number of candidates appearing in the upcoming Democratic presidential debate.
“The deal was, well, no more than 10 people on the stage for three hours. Well, now there’s 12. They’re supposed to, if more than 10, they’re supposed to divide it into two. At least if you had a debate with five other people you might actually get a chance to say something. But I’m going to try to be more declarative, but not argumentative,” Biden said at a high-dollar Los Angeles fundraiser, according to a pool report.
The 12-person October debate stage on Tuesday will be the largest ever. Democratic debates in June and July featured 20 candidates over two nights, and only 10 candidates qualified for the September debate.
Biden voiced frustration about short time allotments to give complicated answers, particularly on questions about his record.
“But, so, when someone says, you know, you know, ‘Are you still beating your wife?’ And, and I go, ‘I have a long explanation,’ and they say, 'You got 30 seconds to answer.’ And you say, ‘No. And then, wait a minute, what’d I just say? No, I’m not still beating my wife.’ But so, I’ve had, I’ve had some difficulties on knowing to counterattack,” Biden said.
In previous debates, California Sen. Kamala Harris attacked Biden for working with segregationist senators in the 1970s to oppose busing desegregation, and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand criticized a 1981 Biden op-ed that argued a child tax credit would result in the "deterioration of family."
“One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive,” Biden said. “Which is good, I’m not complaining, I’m a big boy.”
Though 12 candidates have qualified for the October debate, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard on Thursday threatened to boycott it. The Democratic National Committee and "corporate media" are "attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic," Gabbard argued.
CNN and the New York Times host the October Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday at Otterbein University in Ohio.

Timothy Egan: Mormons to the rescue?

Texto completo: In order to understand the Republican Party today, you have to understand religion. Donald Trump may be the most unreligious president ever — an undisciplined force of corrosive evil. And yet he tweets comparisons to himself as the Messiah and bullies his way around the world with the blind support of white evangelical Christians.
But the one religious faith that is the most heavily Republican is also somewhat disgusted with Trump. Barely half the members of the American-grown Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints approve of his presidency.
And therein lies the best chance, though it’s very much a long shot, to remove Trump from office. Wait! Mormons — forged from a polygamous theocracy in the Rocky Mountain West, tainted by decades of institutional racism and still very much opposed to marriage equality — to the rescue of the Republic? Maybe.
We know that the rule of law, the Constitution’s granting of “the sole power of impeachment” to the House, is toilet paper to many congressional Republicans. When Trump said Article II of our governing blueprint “allows me to do whatever I want,” and almost no members of his party begged to differ, you could see what was ahead. Banana Republicans rule.
Expelling Trump will be decided by appeals to our better angels. At this moment, those angels with the most influence are Mormons with an R on their jerseys. Mormons believe that the Constitution, which doesn’t mention God except in the document’s date, to be divinely inspired.
And yes, that means our nation turns its lonely eyes to Mitt Romney, the Utah senator, former Republican presidential nominee and most prominent face of his faith on the planet. In order to understand Romney you have to understand his Mormon beliefs.
With their missionary experience, and a fast-growing Latino membership, Mormons are appalled at Trump’s anti-immigrant cruelties. On family values, many of them actually walk the talk — which explains why just 14% of Utah voters viewed Trump as a good role model.
I would say “We are all Mitt Romney now” after he was scorched by Trump for lashing out at the president’s gangster foreign policy. Except that Romney himself famously said that 47% of Americans are moochers who would never vote for him for president. Irony alert: Romney ended up with 47% of the popular vote.
And it was another Mormon senator, the unfortunately named Jeff Flake of Arizona, who led an earlier charge against Trump. This week, Flake, who has since left the Senate, tweeted, “Fellow Republicans, where is the line?”
That will be the central question before the Senate. It would take 20 Republicans, along with everyone in the Democratic caucus, for the Senate to reach the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump. The winless New York Jets have a better shot at the Super Bowl.
The political calculation will guide some, but not all. There are already breaches in the Fox News firewall, and a stunning 28% of Republican voters in one recent poll favor the impeachment inquiry.
Playing to the larger moral issues is where the Mormon charge will be crucial. Another Mormon senator, Mike Crapo of Idaho, has kept an open mind thus far. And an independent presidential candidate from 2016, Evan McMullin, has been a principled Mormon critic of Trump’s lawlessness.
“Remember that Trump will tear down anyone who rightfully challenges him,” McMullin said this week. “Unable to lead with honor, all he has left is to make everyone seem as rotten as he is.”
The rot among the collaterally rotten is already deep. White evangelicals — having looked the other way while the Stable Genius, showing his “great and unmatched wisdom,” put kids in cages, praised neo-Nazis, sucked up to murderous dictators and betrayed our beleaguered allies the Kurds — are gone, lost to the dark side.
Most despicable of all, Dallas pastor Robert Jeffress has suggested that impeaching Trump could cause a “Civil War-like fracture” in the country. Jeffress has also said terrible things about Jews, Mormons and Catholics — the kind of hate talk that has not kept him from being one of Trump’s closest evangelical advisers.
You have to believe that most Republicans in Congress know Trump has violated his oath of office. But most of them are also cowards. That goes for some Mormon Republicans, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, a former Trump critic, now an enabler. For them, the old line from J.R. Ewing is apt: “Once you give up your integrity, the rest is a piece of cake.”
Romney has never caved, though he nearly joined the Trump administration as secretary of state. In 2016, he called Trump “a fraud” whose promises “are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.”
With Trump’s Ukraine betrayals, Romney has signaled that he will be a ballast of conscience for Republicans in the Senate. His seat is safe till 2024. He has nothing to lose. At long last, he has a chance to make history — for his faith, and his country.

Texto completo: Malawi At Liwonde National Park, a new tool is preventing poaching. Created after an elephant census discovered that nearly a third of the continent’s elephants were killed between 2007 and 2014, EarthRanger can predict locations where poachers are likely to strike next. Poacher cams use algorithms to distinguish human movement and send pictures with GPS coordinates to EarthRanger and park staff. In the two years that EarthRanger has been building and using its database, poaching in Liwonde has drastically dropped. In an interview with NPR, an EarthRanger designer predicts that within two years technological improvements will help the park stop poachers before they can even fire a shot. (NPR)
Cambodia In January, workers in Cambodia’s largest export industry will get a pay raise. Clothing and footwear workers are scheduled to receive a 4.4% raise from $182 to $190 a month. The industry employs 800,000 people in about 1,000 garment and shoe factories across the country. Negotiations among the union, workers, and the government brought about the raise. The European Union continues to monitor Cambodia for human and labor rights violations. Cambodia is one of a number of developing nations that has a deal with the EU for access to its markets. In 2018, Cambodia shipped nearly $10 billion worth of products to the United States and Europe. (The Associated Press)
Australia Starting next year, the country’s capital will be powered by 100% renewable energy. Canberra will be the first city outside Europe to achieve this milestone. Also, the Northern Territory has committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has faced criticism, however, for his stance on climate change; observers say more must be done to protect the Great Barrier Reef. Mr. Morrison did not participate in this year’s Climate Action Summit during the United Nations General Assembly. (The Australia Institute)
Gabon Norway is giving Gabon $150 million to protect its rainforests. Gabon has 90% forest coverage and contains 12% of the world’s second-largest rainforest. It’s also home to more than half the continent’s forest elephants. For almost 20 years, the country has taken steps to preserve its natural resources by creating more than a dozen national parks. This United Nations-led partnership with Norway will further Gabon’s efforts. The national forest minister says the government will be able to create more jobs while preserving natural resources. (Africa News)
United States For the first time, New York’s 136-year-old Metropolitan Opera will stage an opera written by a black composer. Terence Blanchard’s “Fire Shut Up in My Bones” will debut in an upcoming season. The opera is based on a memoir written by a black journalist. The Met’s general mana­ger told a reporter for The New York Times that they are looking to improve their diversity of voices. (The New York Times)

Texto completo: In the 1970s he was part of a much-talked about prime-time TV series as well as a somewhat subversive Sunday morning Bible show for children.
Marshall Efron, an actor and humorist who was a core figure in two of the quirkiest television shows of the 1970s, "The Great American Dream Machine" and the children's program "Marshall Efron's Illustrated, Simplified and Painless Sunday School," died on Sept. 30 at the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, N.J. He was 81.
His longtime writing partner, Alfa-Betty Olsen, said the cause was cardiac arrest.
At a time when "Gunsmoke," "Bonanza" and "Marcus Welby, M.D." were among television's top-rated shows, Mr. Efron made an idiosyncratic entry into the viewing public's consciousness as a parody of a consumer affairs reporter on "The Great American Dream Machine," a hodgepodge of a series that premiered in January 1971 on PBS, then newly formed and still known as the Public Broadcasting Service.
It was a freewheeling mix of short comic films, cartoons, musical acts, humorous sketches, investigative journalism and opinion pieces, and Mr. Efron, 5-foot-5 and weighing well north of 200 pounds, cut a distinctive figure on it. The New York Times once called him "the big man daintily wielding a satirical sledgehammer." Another time, the newspaper described him as "the plump elf with the crab grass mustache."
In one bit, Mr. Efron riffed on the United States Department of Agriculture's grading of olives. "Which is the biggest -- the giant, the jumbo or the extra large?" he asked.
In another, he parodied a cooking show by trying to prepare a Morton's frozen lemon cream pie using the arcane, somewhat dubious-sounding ingredients listed on the box.
"Now we're going to food starch modified," he said midway through, shaking a white powder into his bowl. "What are the modifications? No one knows." The bit ended with him holding up a Morton's pie and saying, "No lemons, no eggs, no cream, just pie."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The show, produced by National Educational Television and WNET in New York, lasted only two seasons. But it was much talked about in its day, and the list of soon-to-be-famous faces who turned up on it includes Chevy Chase, Henry Winkler, Albert Brooks and Penny Marshall.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Efron quickly returned to television in an altogether different vein with the "Painless Sunday School" program, which turned up on CBS's Sunday morning lineup in late 1973. On that show, he single-handedly enacted stories from the Bible. In one episode, he was both David and Goliath. If the show was somewhat subversive for religious fare, it wasn't disrespectful.
"Everybody thinks we outraged the fundamentalists, but it's not true," Ms. Olsen, who wrote the show with Mr. Efron, told The Boston Globe in 1981. "We received awards from church groups, and letters saying Sunday schools were using our show as part of their studies."
Mr. Efron was born on Feb. 3, 1938, in Los Angeles to Jacob and Ida (Plotkin) Efron. His father was an accountant, and his mother was a homemaker. He grew up facing issues familiar to countless young people.
"School wasn't much fun for me," Mr. Efron told The Times in 1971. "I was short and fat, a lousy athlete, always the last to be picked for teams. The better team would get me as a handicap."
"I started being funny as a kid to avoid being pushed around," he added.
He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1959, then earned a master's degree in English at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1964. After an aborted run at law school he tried teaching, but he also began working with the International Theater Workshop in Los Angeles. Soon he was acting there and in the Bay Area.
In 1967 he moved to New York, and the next year he was on Broadway, playing several small roles in "The Great White Hope." He also began doing satirical radio spots for the listener-supported radio station WBAI. During the 1968 student protests at Columbia University, he and his fellow humorist Paul Krassner (who died in July) pretended to be students and said they had taken over the station; some listeners who didn't get the joke are said to have called the police.
Mr. Efron eventually got his own weekly program on the station, "A Satirical View," and soon Al Perlmutter and Jack Willis, the executive producers of "Dream Machine," came calling. "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In" and, in England, "Monty Python's Flying Circus" had already experimented with fast-moving, absurdist variations of the variety show format, and "Dream Machine," adding music and political content to the mix, was a forerunner of "Saturday Night Live," which made its debut in 1975.
By the time "Dream Machine" appeared, Mr. Efron had also begun acting in movies, including the first feature by a young director named George Lucas, the science fiction thriller "THX 1138" (1971). He would continue to act and do voice work in films and television throughout his career. His voice credits included the series "The Smurfs" and "The Biskitts" in the 1980s and the animated films "Ice Age: The Meltdown" (2006) and "Horton Hears a Who!" (2008).
He is survived by a sister, Mary Efron.
Mr. Efron was a car fanatic. In the early 1970s his decorating scheme at his apartment on East 10th Street in Manhattan included the grill from a 1937 Ford truck.
"My dream of success has always been to have a new Cadillac on my own grease rack," he told The Times in 1971.
In 1981 he reflected on his "Sunday School" series, which ran from 1973 to 1977 and was rebroadcast into the 1980s.
"I don't think we felt we were getting away with anything," he said. "If you look at the Bible as it's written, there is wit, a humor, a freshness, a liveliness to it. Those people who think it's grim are wrong."

Texto completo: Warhol's death in New York after undergoing surgery put him at the center of a lawsuit, but a later investigation suggested he and a hospital had not been at fault.
Bjorn Thorbjarnarson, a New York surgeon who famously treated the shah of Iran and Andy Warhol before becoming a central figure in a widely publicized lawsuit over Warhol's death after surgery in 1987, died on Oct. 4 in Warren, N.J. He was 98.
The death, at a care facility, was confirmed by his daughter Lisa Enslow.
Dr. Thorbjarnarson was one of the foremost experts on surgeries of the biliary tract -- involving the liver, gall bladder and bile ducts -- when he was called to remove Warhol's infected gallbladder in 1987 at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he worked for virtually his entire career. (Ms. Enslow said he had treated other famous patients as well, including Johnny Carson, the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and the artist Ellsworth Kelly.)
Dr. Thorbjarnarson (who pronounced his surname thor-bee-ON-a-son so that it would be easier for his American colleagues to master) completed the operation on Warhol without incident, and Warhol seemed stable as he recovered in a private hospital room. But his condition deteriorated overnight, and he died in the early hours of Feb. 22 at 58. At the time, many newspapers characterized the operation as "routine."
That April, the New York State Health Department released a report concluding that Warhol's treatment had been inadequate. The Manhattan district attorney's office soon mounted an investigation, but it found insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges.
Warhol's estate continued a private investigation, however, and in 1991 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the hospital (now known as NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center) and individuals involved in his care. At a trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan that year, the estate's lawyers argued that doctors and nurses had neglected Warhol's postoperative care and given him an unsafe amount of intravenous fluids.
"We are saying that Warhol died from internal drowning," Steven Hayes, a lawyer for the estate, told The New York Times in 1991.
Lawyers for the hospital, as well as for Dr. Thorbjarnarson and Dr. Denton S. Cox, the attending physician and Warhol's longtime doctor, contended that Warhol had been well enough to watch television and make telephone calls from his hospital room as he recovered. An autopsy gave the cause of death as cardiac arrhythmia, which the hospital argued was related to Warhol's poor health and not caused by medical error or negligence.
Glenn Dopf, the doctors' lawyer, said in his opening statement at the trial that there was no evidence of fluid overload. "It's bunk, baloney and a fantasy," he said.
Dr. Cox said Warhol's condition had been precarious when he entered the hospital. He said that he first diagnosed a gallstone in Warhol in 1973, but that Warhol had refused to undergo surgery because of a fear of hospitals that dated to 1968, when he was shot by the radical feminist Valerie Solanas.
The hospital settled with Warhol's estate a few weeks after the trial began. Dr. Thorbjarnarson retired in 1989, and maintained to the end that the hospital's treatment of Warhol had been proper.
Three decades after Warhol's death, an investigation by Dr. John Ryan, a medical historian and retired surgeon, supported the hospital's version of events.
"This was major, major surgery -- not routine -- in a very sick person," Dr. Ryan told the art critic Blake Gopnik, the author of a forthcoming biography of Warhol, for a 2017 Times article about the Ryan investigation.
Dr. Ryan found that Warhol had a family history of gallbladder problems, had been badly ill for at least a month, and had been dehydrated and emaciated before he underwent surgery.
Dr. Thorbjarnarson said that Warhol was so terrified of the hospital that he pleaded with him to treat him at home, Mr. Gopnik wrote.
"Dr. Thorbjarnarson refused Warhol's entreaties and found himself justified three days later, when the sick man was at last on the operating table," Mr. Gopnik said, adding, "The surgeon found a gallbladder full of gangrene."
Dr. Thorbjarnarson had earlier been in the news when Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran, journeyed to Manhattan for lymphatic cancer surgery in October 1979, months after he was deposed in the Iranian revolution.
Dr. Thorbjarnarson led a team of surgeons in removing the shah's gallbladder, a portion of his liver and several gallstones blocking a bile duct -- all under highly unusual circumstances.
"Armed guards controlled the traffic to the patient's room, and all blinds were always down," Dr. Thorbjarnarson wrote in a letter in response to "The Shah's Spleen: Its Impact on History," an article in The Journal of the American College of Surgeons, in 2010. "Threatening calls were received by nurses attending, but none to me. Outside, the hospital was surrounded by a howling mob, controlled by barricades, calling for the shah's head."
The shah survived the surgery and left New York after some weeks of recovery. But his condition worsened -- his spleen was removed in Egypt near the end of March 1980 -- and he died that July.
Bjorn Thorbjarnarson was born on July 9, 1921, the seventh of eight children of Thorbjorn Thordarson and Gudrun Palsdottir, in the village of Bildudalur in the remote Westfjords region of northwestern Iceland. His father was a doctor who visited distant patients on horseback; his mother was a homemaker.
Bjorn went to a boarding school in the city of Akureyri in northern Iceland, to which he traveled by fishing boat or on horseback, his family said. He graduated from the University of Iceland's medical school in 1947, trained in the Icelandic countryside and then moved to New York.
He began working at New York Hospital in 1948, studying under Dr. Frank Glenn, a surgeon who treated the shah in the early 1950s. In the '50s Dr. Thorbjarnarson served in the Navy for two years. In 1955 he married Margaret Brown, a nurse he had met at the hospital. She survives him.
In addition to his wife and his daughter Lisa, he is survived by three other daughters, Kathryn Thorbjarnarson and Kristin and Gudrun Bjornsdottir; 11 grandchildren; and 20 great-grandchildren. A son, Paul, died in 1996, and another son, John, a renowned expert on crocodilians, died in 2010.

Texto completo: Violence against Jews is on the rise, but it doesn't fit easily into the country's polarized political climate.
BERLIN -- On Wednesday a gunman attacked a synagogue in the eastern German city of Halle while 51 Jews, including a group of young Americans, were inside observing Yom Kippur. When he found the door locked, he killed two people nearby and fled. The man filmed his assault and streamed it live on the internet. Journalists who have seen the video say that the man can be heard rambling anti-Semitic slurs. The police have arrested a suspect and confirmed that he is a 27-year-old German.
The episode, coming on the holiest day of Judaism, has the country reeling. Could Germany have anticipated this anti-Semitic assault? Has Germany, of all countries, failed its Jewish community?
German right-wing extremism is dangerous, deadly and growing. There were about 1,200 far-right racist hate crimes committed in Germany in 2017, according to police statistics; a year later, the number was 1,664. In June, a local politician in the state of Hesse, Walter Lübcke, was assassinated at his home by a right-wing extremist (who first confessed the crime and later renounced it after changing lawyers).
This is not a recent phenomenon: Earlier this year prosecutors tried two men and a woman associated with the right-wing terrorist group Nationalsozialistische Untergrund (National-Socialist Underground). The group was discovered in 2011. By then, they had killed 10 people.
The police, Germany's interior secret service and independent experts find that right-wing-extremists have only become more dangerous in recent years. Their numbers are growing and they seem more prone to committing violent crimes.
Much of the violence is aimed at recent immigrants, but anti-Semitic crimes in Germany have surged, too. In April, Holger Münch, head of Germany's national police, said that the country experienced 1,800 anti-Semitic crimes in 2018, a 20 percent rise from 2017. Violent crimes against Jews rose from 28 in 2017 to 48 in 2018, according to statistics from Germany's domestic intelligence service. Several Jewish organizations, like the American Jewish Committee in Berlin, say that the real number is probably higher.
So why are so many people shocked by the Halle attack? It's not that Germany's political class isn't sensitive to the concerns of the country's Jewish population. But it is still the case that when it comes to concerns about far-right hate crimes, the nation's attention was focused elsewhere. Why?
One reason is that the most gruesome crimes that have caught the public attention were directed at immigrants, mostly with a Muslim background, or were crimes connected to the immigration crisis. Mr. Lübcke, the politician murdered in June, was known for his pro-immigration views, and nine of the 10 victims of the N.S.U. were from immigrant families (the 10th victim was a police officer).
But there's more to it than that. As in other countries, German politics are increasingly polarized, with a sober assessment of the facts overtaken by a quick search for easy places to lay blame.
These days, whenever a crime occurs in Germany, social media heats up quickly, as both right-wing-populists and liberals immediately claim the event as a building block in their respective ideological struggles. The far-right Alternative for Germany party is constantly searching for "evidence" to support its belief that immigration is a threat to German society. Liberals, in contrast, look for evidence to exculpate immigrants and cast blame on the right.
A woman and her son are pushed in front of a train in Frankfurt? What's the nationality of the perpetrator? A man is shot on his porch in Hesse? Was he pro-immigration? It was no different yesterday, after the news of the assault in Halle broke. Was this Arab or German anti-Semitism? seems to have been the first question for many, instead of: what really happened and how could it have been prevented?
In this vain struggle, one group often goes missing: Germany's Jews. The rise in anti-Semitic violence does not fit easily into either narrative; the social media attention is more muted, and the events tend to pass with little comment.
Anti-Semitism in Germany is complicated. We know that a number of recent attacks on Jews were committed by immigrants, many of them from the Arab world, but there is disagreement on how many. Mr. Münch, the head of the national police, says that 90 percent of the anti-Semitic crimes committed in Germany last year were committed by right-wing extremists. The American Jewish Committee in Germany disagrees, saying that many of these crimes have been miscategorized and are actually the work of immigrants.
Liberals historically have stood beside German Jews, but in doing so they worry they might undermine their pro-immigrant bona fides. They are therefore loath to question Mr. Münch's numbers, even as the far right tries to exploit Arab anti-Semitism for its own benefit. Which means that even when anti-Semitism is recognized, it is only as a political tool to achieve some other end.
On Wednesday evening, Chancellor Angela Merkel rushed to the New Synagogue in Berlin to grieve with the city's Jewish community. Her sympathy, and the country's, is sincere. For all its recent changes, Germany has not forgotten what happened here, and the additional horror that accompanies anti-Semitism in Germany.
Hopefully, this sympathy will last longer than the next few days and even lead to a new awareness: Germany's Jews are increasingly a target of violence and aggression. Germany, of all countries, needs to protect them.

Texto completo: David Foster Wallace, the brilliant oddball behind Infinite Jest, has been accused of abusing fellow writer Mary Karr. Charles Dickens cast off his wife (and mother of his ten children) after leaving her for a younger woman. Woody Allen has been accused of molesting his adopted daughter.
Should we stop paying attention to these artists’ work? This is the question plaguing academia right now, as the age-old debate over separating the art from the artist is being relitigated through a social justice lens. While an increased attention to the issue of sexual assault permeates our conversations, should we still pay attention to all these men accused of mistreating women?
This week, writer Emma Goldberg asked as much in the New York Times, wondering, “Do Works by Men Toppled by #MeToo Belong in the Classroom?”
Several academics weighed in, including Clare Hayes-Brady, a professor of American Literature at University College Dublin. “Shakespeare abandoned his family. Norman Mailer stabbed his wife,” she said. “We don’t love the people we love because they’re morally virtuous.”
Others weren’t so sure, with some railing against Woody Allen films and some scrapping Wallace from their syllabus. The scales in academia now often tilt toward censorship, or at least toward letting students opt out of certain discussions if they find themselves "triggered."
If we refuse to have these discussions, however, we may miss the point of literature. By censoring authors whose works have already immersed themselves in the culture or found their place in the literary canon, we’re not punishing them. We’re hurting ourselves.
“To address these questions, we need to ask first why we read,” Karen Swallow Prior, an author and professor of English at Liberty University, tells me in an email. “If we read for learning and pleasure, then we understand a work of literature or art to have an existence connected to but separate from its creator. But increasingly, literature, like many things, has been overly politicized.”
Identity politics would try to make the contents of authors' lives inseparable from an evaluation of their works. Yet while authors' pasts are important to understanding the substance of their creations, any moral bleakness should not lead readers to scrap their books altogether. Wallace might have been sexist, but that doesn't mean Infinite Jest has less to tell us about ourselves. If we understand Wallace's failings, perhaps it tells us more.
But unfortunately, many literature professors no longer feel this way. “Readers are seen as tainted by what they read rather than being able to gain mastery over it,” Prior explains. “By rejecting the opportunity to even make such judgments, however, we diminish our ability to make such intellectual and aesthetic judgments.”
A trend toward elimination of "problematic" authors is not only unhelpful; it's entirely impractical. Prior asks: When are authors simply sleazy, and when do their actions take them beyond the pale? Which gatekeepers have the moral authority to decide? The line is not only not worth drawing, it’s also impossible to draw.
Of course, professors assigning books by living authors might want to encourage students to purchase used copies of books to avoid putting cash into morally reprehensible writers' hands. In that case, “we do need to let our informed consciences be guides,” Prior says. But “this is a completely different judgment from one that might be made about the value of their work and the insights it offers to human experience.”
There are plenty of artists we could “cancel” if we liked: Renoir, Roald Dahl, even actors such as John Wayne. The rise of #MeToo and a greater social consciousness about sexual assault and other trespasses presents readers with an opportunity to understand the fuller legacies of the ill-behaved artists who inform our lives.
It means we ought to have this discussion, but it also means that we must continue to engage with art that has permeated our culture, however imperfect its creators may be.

Impeachment is really about the 2016 and 2020 elections, and liberals are even admitting it

Texto completo: It shouldn’t be news to anyone that the move by House Democrats to impeach President Trump has never been a serious exercise in loyalty to the Constitution. But it’s nice to see that some liberals are admitting it openly.
The New York Times on Thursday published an op-ed by Cornell law professor Josh Chafetz about the measures Democrats should take to force the White House to play along with its own political homicide. But perhaps inadvertently, Chafetz blurted out that the process will have been a waste if it isn’t done before the 2020 election.
“Courts could expedite proceedings to an extent, but thus far they have shown themselves in no hurry to render final judgments in these disputes,” he wrote. “And a court ‘victory’ coming in 2021 or 2022 is no victory at all for the House.”
That’s interesting. I thought this was about checks and balances, abuse of power, and, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put it, Trump’s “betrayal of our democracy.” Do liberals still believe that or is there an expiration date on those ideals, and that just happens to coincide with the 2020 election?
On CNN, lawyer and impeachment expert Ross Garber stated the obvious. “Impeachment is a big deal,” he said Thursday. “It is about sort of undoing an election.” Anchor John Berman made sure to put a stop to that kind of talk, though. “I don’t think so. I think that phrase in and of itself is misleading,” he said, before informing viewers how elections really work. “The election chooses the vice president, definitionally, in the Constitution they make sure there’s continuation of power as was decided in the election.”
Yeah, I don’t know what that means either. But as fate would have it, loud CNN liberal Angela Rye had just said the previous evening that in fact, everything about the impeachment proceeding was for the purposes of correcting the results of 2016.
“The 2016 election wasn’t fair,” she blurted out.
None of this is to say that it wasn’t obvious all along that impeachment would be the natural course of action for Democrats still upset that Trump is president. But at least many liberals are willing to say it aloud.

Nicholas Kristof: When China comes for Pooh Bear

Texto completo: What happens when China’s enforcers come after Winnie-the-Pooh?
Will we reluctantly hand over Pooh Bear? Really sorry about this, Winnie, but China’s an important market!
Winnie-the-Pooh has been banned in China online and at movie theaters because snarky commentators have suggested that he resembles the portly President Xi Jinping. But these days Xi doesn’t want to censor information just in his own country; he also wants to censor our own discussions in the West.
That’s the backdrop to China’s hysterical reaction to a tweet by Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets’ general manager, sympathizing with Hong Kong’s pro-democracy demonstrations.
When the NBA moved into China in the early 2000s, it made a plausible argument that engagement would help extend our values to China. Instead, the Communist Party is exploiting NBA greed to extend its values to the United States.
China is also forcing American Airlines to treat Taiwan as part of China, and it bullied Mercedes-Benz into apologizing for quoting the Dalai Lama. It made Marriott fire an employee for “wrongfully liking” a tweet by an organization that favors Tibetan independence.
There’s not much we can do about a dictator like Xi bullying his own citizens, but we should not let him stifle debate in our country.
Let me interrupt this diatribe, however, for important context. Those of us who criticize Xi must also have the humility to acknowledge that child mortality is now lower in Beijing than in Washington, D.C., that China has established new universities at a rate of one a week and that Shanghai’s public schools put our own school systems to shame.
So, yes, let’s stand up to Chinese bullying — and speak up when China detains at least 1 million Muslims, in what may be the biggest internment of people based on religion since the Holocaust. But let’s also note that China has helped lift more people out of poverty more quickly than any nation in history. With China, it’s always helpful to hold at least two contradictory ideas in our heads at the same time.
Xi’s anxiety about the internet, religion, Hong Kong protesters, even Winnie-the-Pooh underscores his own insecurities. Xi seems terrified that real information will infiltrate the Chinese echo chamber, undermining his propaganda department’s personality cult around a benign “Uncle Xi.”
We can exploit Xi’s fear to gain leverage — and maybe to chip away at Chinese nationalism just a little bit — with three steps.
First, raise China’s blocking of outside news sites and social media platforms as a trade issue before the World Trade Organization. In a new book, “Schism,” about China and global trade, Paul Blustein explains how the U.S. could join with other countries to make such a trade case based on the WTO agreement. Trade experts aren’t sure the case would succeed, but it’s worth trying.
A second step the United States should take is to invest more in internet circumvention technologies to help ordinary Chinese vault the Great Chinese Firewall and read uncensored news. The U.S. spends more than $700 million a year on broadcast programs to sometimes-obscure parts of the world but only tiny sums to help citizens of closed countries access the free internet.
Richard Stengel, a former undersecretary of state who was involved in these programs, told me that he generally agreed that the U.S. should invest more in circumvention technologies. “It aligns with American values,” he said. “I’d be in favor.”
Some American officials I’ve spoken with worry that this would enrage Xi. Yes, it might. Frankly, it’s also not clear that many Chinese want to access the outside internet, for they don’t much use tools like Ultrasurf and Psiphon that already enable them to do so (with a bit of difficulty).
Those are fair concerns, but I worry even more about the rise of nationalism in China inculcated in part by the Communist Party’s education system and propaganda machine. I’ve seen over the decades how a freer flow of information eventually can liberate minds and peoples, and the world would be better off if that process unfolded in China.
Then there’s a third step, still more delicate and dangerous: The U.S. intelligence community should gather information on the corruption in the Xi family that has allowed it to amass a huge fortune — with a hint that if China undertakes a brutal crackdown of Hong Kong or an assault on Taiwan, this information will slip out. This is what Xi fears most, and we shouldn’t pass up that leverage.
I love China and believe in engaging it. We should try to work out a trade deal and cooperate on issues from climate change to drug trafficking. But let’s push back when Xi tries to stifle free discussion not only in China but also in America.
Otherwise, if American business continues to kowtow, some day there may be a knock on the door, and there’ll be “Uncle Xi” sternly asking us to hand over Pooh Bear.

Trump's lawyers draw a legal cloak around him

Texto completo: You can't investigate him. You can't indict him. And you can't impeach him. That's what President Trump's lawyers have been arguing in various venues, as they seek to build a 360-degree defense around him. Legal scholars warn it would put him above the law.
Trump's lawyers, private and governmental, have argued that the controversial, divisive Republican cannot be investigated or indicted because impeachment is the proper route to address alleged misdeeds by the president.
At the same time, they've argued this week that the current impeachment process is partisan and invalid.
Steven Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas Law School, pointed it out in a tweet Tuesday afternoon.
“Trump Administration: The reason why a sitting President can't be indicted is because the Constitution expressly creates an alternative, political process for presidential misconduct," Vladeck wrote.
“Also Trump Administration: That alternative process is too political and entirely illegitimate," he wrote.
“Not for the first time, they are indeed asserting that the President is above the law," Lisa Kern Griffin, a professor at Duke University School of Law, wrote in an e-mail.
Trump's private lawyers in federal court in New York have argued that one reason he should be immune from all criminal investigations is that those investigations were the province of a Congress with the power of impeachment, not law enforcement officials.
“The Constitution's assignment of the impeachment power to Congress and its supermajority requirement for removal ensure that 'the process may be initiated and maintained only by politically accountable legislative officials' who represent a majority of the entire nation," the lawyers wrote, citing previous legal writings.
The lawyers also said the decision to terminate the president's electoral mandate is “more fittingly handled by the Congress than by a jury."
Judge Victor Marrero, in a decision this week, rejected their attempt to shield Trump's tax returns from Manhattan state prosecutors. “Neither the Constitution nor the history surrounding the founding support as broad an interpretation of presidential immunity as the one now espoused by the President," he said.
Impeachment also received a shout-out from Attorney General William Barr when, before he assumed his current post, he penned a memo as a private citizen critical of the Trump-Russia investigation being conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
“Every four years the people as a whole make a solemn national decision as to the person whom they trust to make these prudential judgments. In the interim, the people's representatives stand watch and have the tools to oversee, discipline, and, if they deem appropriate, remove the President from office," he wrote.
“Thus, under the Framers' plan, the determination whether the President is making decisions based on 'improper' motives or whether he is 'faithfully' discharging his responsibilities is left to the People, through the election process, and the Congress, through the Impeachment process. The Framers' idea of political accountability has proven remarkably successful, far more so than the disastrous experimentation with an 'independent' counsel statute," he wrote.
But that was then and this is now — and the House has plunged into an impeachment inquiry, which Trump's lawyers also oppose.
White House legal counsel Pat A. Cipollone, in a letter Tuesday to House Democratic leaders, announced a shutdown of the other avenue to investigate Trump, dismissing the impeachment investigation as “illegitimate" and saying the entire executive branch would refuse to cooperate with it.
“As you know, you have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process," the letter said. “Your highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people."
In his eight-page letter, Cipollone said “the President has a country to lead" and he “remains focused on fulfilling his promises to the American people."
The letter came after the Trump administration had already been blocking congressional testimony by various officials and refusing to hand over documents, including his tax returns and financial records.
Trump has long held an expansive view of executive power and has cited Article II of the Constitution, which defines the powers of the executive branch, as a catchall that gives him wide latitude.
“Article II allows me to do whatever I want," Trump said in a June interview with ABC News.
Legal scholars criticized Cipollone's letter as short on legal substance and long on politics.
Ilya Somin, a professor at Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, joked in a Facebook post that the Trump administration's legal reasoning made him wonder “whether the White House counsel was sick the day they taught law at law school."
Michael J. Gerhardt, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, told The Washington Post that the White House letter amounted to “a bunch of political talking points" with a “completely backwards" interpretation of the Constitution.
The Constitution gives the House the “sole power of impeachment" and does not prescribe how the process should unfold, said Gerhardt, author of “Impeachment: What Everyone Needs to Know."
Frank Bowman, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Law who is the author of “High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump," wrote on the justsecurity.org forum that the letter was “simply put, a public relations exercise. The legal arguments it intersperses between insults to members of the House Democratic leadership and appeals to the President's base voters are without foundation."
“The bottom line is that the White House letter is neither more nor less than a list of invalid excuses to defy the legislative branch in its exercise of a power expressly granted by the Constitution," Bowman wrote.
Griffin, the Duke University School of Law professor, said in an e-mail, “I would not call the White House letter 'lawyering.' "
She, like other legal experts, said the letter is off base in demanding that the president have the rights of a criminal defendant at a trial. The impeachment in the House, which would lodge allegations against Trump, is not a criminal trial, the experts have noted.
“Where it goes astray is in asserting that the President has all of the rights of a criminal defendant at trial in the context of a constitutional process that is (1) reserved to the legislative branch and (2) about making allegations rather than trying a case. Should there be a full trial in the Senate — and that proceeding might be severely circumscribed by [Senate majority leader] Mitch McConnell — then the President's lawyers would have the opportunity to call and question witnesses."
Griffin noted Mueller felt he could not indict a president because of a Department of Justice policy.
“That leaves only impeachment to remedy both serious abuses of power and outright crimes. But now the President will not participate because impeachment does not sufficiently resemble a criminal trial? That makes no sense," she said.
“The President's allies are also suggesting that this should be resolved by voters. But election interference is the essence of the alleged misconduct. And what happens if a second Trump term reaches new heights of lawlessness? There will be neither congressional oversight nor electoral jeopardy to check it. Seems like a dangerous assertion," she said.

Texto completo: THURSDAY
Eyes on You
Chase Rice took an unusual path to country stardom, having been a high school football player, a member of a Jimmie Johnson Sprint Cup Series pit crew and a cast member on "Survivor: Nicaragua" in 2010.
His country career started that year with the release of his first studio album, "Friday Nights&Sunday Mornings," and he got a boost in 2012 when his co-write of "Cruise" became a monster hit for Florida Georgia Line. His own single, "Ready Set Roll," went to No. 5 on the country charts in 2013.
The tour that brings him to Stage AE, North Shore, comes after hitting the Top 5 once again with the single "Eyes on You" from an album that will follow 2017's "Lambs&Lions."
"Having a song like 'Eyes On You' connect at this level has taken our live show to another level," he said in a statement. "Every night I have to take a minute and film them singing the words back to us on stage."
Jon Nite and Chris DeStefano open the show. Doors at 7 p.m. Tickets are $35; ticketmaster.com.
Good to Be Bad
Plenty of 'DVE listeners may never have encountered Hank Williams, Bo Diddley and John Lee Hooker if it hadn't been for George Thorogood and the Destroyers.
The 68-year-old blues rocker from Delaware brought new life to old music with his sonic covers of songs like "Move It On Over," "Who Do You Love" and "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer."
Thorogood, who doesn't play these parts as much as other classic rockers, brings the "Good To Be Bad: 45 Years of Rock" tour to the Palace Theatre in Greensburg at 7:30 p.m. Tickets start at $45; thepalacetheatre.org.
FRIDAY-SATURDAY
Golden Puppets
The buzzy off-Broadway hit "That Golden Girls Show! A Puppet Parody" comes to Pittsburgh for three shows, and it can't get here soon enough for some fans. Within days of the announcement, it was close to selling out.
Really, people still can't get enough of the 1980s sitcom and Dorothy, Sophia, Blanche and Rose, who live out their golden years with "cheesecake, laughter, Jazzercise, shoulder pads, sex and the elegant art of the quick-witted put-down" (with strong adult language and themes).
It's at the Byham Theater, Downtown. $25-$50 at trustarts.org.
FRIDAY AND SUNDAY
PSO's 'Eroica'
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra music director Manfred Honeck has described Beethoven's Symphony No. 3 "Eroica" as a "dance symphony with dramatic inventiveness, full of new elements that had never been heard before."
Last year, the PSO's recording of it in Heinz Hall, hailed by The New York Times as "the most interesting and innovative Beethoven recording since these forces set down the Fifth and Seventh Symphonies," was nominated for three Grammy awards.
It is on the program this weekend at Heinz Hall, Downtown, with Sibelius' "The Swan of Tuonela" and baritone Matthias Goerne singing songs of Schubert and Strauss.
Times are 8 p.m. Friday and 2:30 p.m. Sunday. Tickets are $20 to $98; pittsburghsymphony.org.
FRIDAY-SUNDAY
Magic moments
The 60th annual Fort Ligonier Days, commemorating the Battle of Fort Ligonier during the French and Indian War fought in 1758, takes over the quaint town this weekend with more than 200 craft booths and 30 food booths.
There will be a parade on Main Street around the Diamond at 11 a.m. on Saturday, battle re-enactments, and a variety of live music, including a concert by Jay and the Americans ("Come a Little Bit Closer," "Cara Mia," "This Magic Moment") at 6:30 p.m. Saturday. Sunday begins with a 5K walk/run at 8:30 a.m.
For more details, go to fortligonierdays.com.
Monster mash
It's a Classic Monster weekend at the Carnegie Science Center, North Shore, where the The Rangos Giant Cinema and ScareHouse have joined forces for a series of movies on the 4K screen, plus surprise appearances from ScareHouse cast members.
This weekend's schedule goes back more than a half-century with 1954's "The Creature From the Black Lagoon 3D" (5 p.m. Friday, 10:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. Saturday and 1:30 p.m. Sunday).
From 1931 comes "Frankenstein" starring Boris Karloff and Colin Clive (7 p.m. Friday, 12:15 and 5:15 p.m. Saturday, and noon and 5 p.m. Sunday) and "Dracula" starring Bela Lugosi (8:30 p.m. Friday, 1:45 and 7 p.m. Saturday, and 10:30 a.m. and 3:15 p.m. Sunday).
Admission for each film is $9.95; carnegiesciencecenter.org.
SATURDAY
Carrie in the round
The Cry Pretty Tour 360 "cements her entertainer of the year status," Billboard says of Carrie Underwood's production that finally arrives at PPG Paints Arena, Uptown.
The Grammy-winning pop-country star is touring behind "Cry Pretty," her sixth album since breaking out on "American Idol" in 2005. She will joined in the center of the arena floor by an eight-piece band in a two-hour show with 19 video projection screens, 15 stage elevators and more than 400 moving lights.
Along with big hits like "Jesus, Take the Wheel," "Before He Cheats" and "The Champion," Underwood runs through a medley of country classics and other favorite songs.
Maddie&Tae and Runaway June open the 7 p.m. show. Tickets are $54 to $91; ticketmaster.com.
Mozart's 'Don'
Pittsburgh Opera, opening its 81st season, puts a 1950s film noir spin on Mozart's seminal "Don Giovanni" at the Benedum Center, Downtown.
The production, mixing comedy and tragedy, features Metropolitan Opera Award winner Rachelle Durkin as the victimized Donna Anna and former resident artist Craig Verm as the womanizing title character who leaves a trail of broken hearts.
The black and white costumes and set pay homage to classic film noirs like "Double Indemnity," "The Third Man," "Out of the Past," "Kiss Me Deadly" and "The Big Sleep."
It opens at 8 p.m. Saturday and continues 7 p.m. Tuesday, 7:30 p.m. Oct. 18 and 2 p.m. Oct. 20. Tickets start at $14; kids and teens ages 6-18 are half-price; pittsburghopera.org.
Johns at CMOA
"An Art of Changes: Jasper Johns Prints, 1960-2018," a survey of 90 works by the aritst over six decades, premieres at the Heinz Galleries of The Carnegie Museum of Art, Oakland.
Johns, finding the link between abstract expressionism and pop art, debuted his paintings of flags and targets in 1958 and won immediate acclaim. His work appeared in four Carnegie Internationals in the 1950s and 1960s, and he won the top Carnegie Prize twice.
This exhibition - of work in intaglio, lithography, woodcut, linoleum cut, screen printing and lead relief - was organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. It runs through Jan. 10; cmoa.org.
Folk legend
The Calliope folk music season opens at Carnegie Lecture Hall in Oakland with Buffy Sainte-Marie, whose career goes all the way back to 1964.
Sainte-Marie, who was born on the Piapot Plains Cree First Nation Reserve in Saskatchewan, Canada, debuted with "It's My Way!" and went on to also become a visual artist, educator and social activist.
She hit the Top 40 charts once, in 1972 with the song "Mister Can't You See," but he had her songs recorded by the likes of Janis Joplin, Elvis Presley, Donovan and Joe Cocker. In 1983, she won an Oscar for co-writing "Up Where We Belong" from the movie "An Officer and a Gentleman."
Her most recent release was 2017's "Medicine Songs," which included updated versions of some of her older songs.

Texto completo: Choose between two terrors: an apocalypse in the final season of "Supernatural" on CW or a creepy doll in "Annabelle: Creation," airing on Syfy.
What's on TV
SUPERNATURAL 8 p.m. on CW. When the 14th season of this long-running fantasy series ended, three of its main characters -- Sam (Jared Padalecki), Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Castiel (Misha Collins) -- were left standing in a graveyard, surrounded by zombies. So the fact that the new 15th season is also the show's final one may not bode particularly well for them. That undead death trap was one element of an apocalypse set into motion; can the heroes fight it off, or will the end of "Supernatural" also mean the end of its world?
ANNABELLE: CREATION (2017) 8 p.m. on Syfy. When it comes to horror movies, no characters are necessarily safe. But if a character's occupation is "doll maker," chances are high that he or she is going to get a pretty close look at the evil at hand. Such is the case for Samuel (Anthony LaPaglia), the doll maker in this movie, which takes place in the 1940s. Years after the death of their only daughter, Samuel and his wife, Esther (Miranda Otto), have agreed to take in a young nun and a group of girls who have been forced out of their orphanage. As this is a prequel to the 2014 killer-doll movie "Annabelle" (itself a spinoff of "The Conjuring"), that generosity does not beget happy results. The film's director, David F. Sandberg, "proves a master of the flash-scare, a nifty choreographer of precipitous timing and striptease visuals," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "But he's also adroit with more leisurely horrors, like the snap-crackle-pop of the murderous shade flexing for the kill, or the slow animation of a sacklike scarecrow into a toothy obscenity."
What's Streaming
BIG MOUTH Stream on Netflix. Andrew Goldberg ("Family Guy") and Nick Kroll's lavishly filthy, proudly off-center animated series about a collection of suburban monsters and pubescent teenagers is back for a third season. The show's characters are voiced by a cadre of comics, including Kroll, John Mulaney, Maya Rudolph, Jordan Peele, Jessi Klein, Fred Armisen and Jenny Slate; its hilariously cringey moments are many.
MEGAN LEAVEY (2017) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. A human-animal relationship is formed on the battlefield in this biographical drama from the director Gabriela Cowperthwaite. Based on a true story, the film stars Kate Mara as a young woman who joins the Marines near the beginning of the Iraq war. She eventually becomes the handler of a bomb-sniffing dog, with whom she forms a close connection. The movie portrays "a somewhat idealized view of military service, especially for women," Neil Genzlinger wrote in his review for The Times. "But the war isn't really the point here; the relationship between a woman and a dog is." He wrote that the movie tells a remarkable true story "with a minimum of manufactured sentiment."

Nissan Finds No Evidence Of Impropriety By an Executive

Texto completo: TOKYO -- Nissan on Wednesday cleared the senior executive in charge of its legal department of "inappropriate involvement" in the investigations surrounding Carlos Ghosn, the company's former chairman, after a series of reports about possible conflicts of interest.
In a statement, Nissan said Hari Nada -- who is expected to be a key witness against Mr. Ghosn in his trial over financial wrongdoing -- would remain a senior vice president and continue to report to its acting chief executive, Yasuhiro Yamauchi.
Mr. Nada's supervision of the company's legal department and security office, as well as other roles, was transferred to Hitoshi Kawaguchi, an executive vice president, the statement said. Mr. Nada was given an added title as senior adviser overseeing special projects.
Nissan said it had "found no evidence of inappropriate involvement by Nada in the internal investigation into executive misconduct led by former chairman Carlos Ghosn and others." The statement added that "the change is aimed to avoid undue suspicion and to enable him to focus on important tasks for the company, such as forthcoming legal action."
A spokeswoman for Nissan declined to elaborate on that legal action.
Mr. Nada has agreed to an immunity deal with Japanese prosecutors in return for providing evidence against Mr. Ghosn, who was detained by the authorities in Tokyo in November and later charged with financial wrongdoing. Mr. Ghosn, who awaits trial on bail, has said he is innocent of all charges.
After Mr. Ghosn's arrest, Mr. Nada continued to oversee matters related to allegations of misconduct at the company, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.
Mr. Nada's involvement was discussed at length during a board meeting on Tuesday, with some members seeing his new responsibilities as an attempt to sideline him, according to people familiar with the discussion. The company was unlikely to take strong action against him because of his status as a whistle-blower and his cooperation with prosecutors, one of the people said.
On Tuesday, Nissan's directors decided to overhaul the company's top management, appointing a new chief executive, operating officer and vice chief operating officer in hopes of giving the company a fresh start after a tumultuous year. Beyond the Ghosn arrest, Nissan has experienced plunging profits, diminished sales and the exit of its chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, over a separate overpayment issue.
Concerns about Mr. Nada's role at the company have increased in recent weeks after several media accounts about pay irregularities at Nissan. The Times has reported that Mr. Nada received around $ 280,000 in improper payments from stock-based compensation in 2017.
The findings were detailed in a report by a law firm hired to investigate pay-related problems at Nissan. Nissan recently said Mr. Nada had received less money than the law firm found in its review, but the company declined to elaborate. Nissan also said some of the employees who received the wrongful payments were "unaware that improper methods were used."
In April, Mr. Nada recused himself from all matters related to the investigations into misconduct at the company, according to people familiar with the situation. Two senior lawyers repeatedly raised concerns that Mr. Nada still wielded influence over those matters. One has since left the company, and another was removed from handling any legal work related to misconduct allegations.
Ben Dooley reported from Tokyo, and Liz Alderman from Paris.

How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Vivian Yee and Hwaida Saad, who report on the Middle East and are based in Beirut, Lebanon, discussed the tech they're using.
Vivian, you were previously a New York metro reporter and a national immigration reporter. How has your use of tech changed in covering the Middle East?
Vivian: Living in Beirut, I'm lucky I can still get access to most of the same tech products I used back in the United States. The internet isn't censored the way it is for some of our colleagues in other parts of the world, for instance, although the quality of my internet connection in Lebanon leaves something (O.K., a lot!) to be desired.
But I cover a region where many governments control the internet and monitor communications to a degree that would be unimaginable to anyone living in the United States. In Egypt, for instance, certain websites considered independent or critical of the authorities were blocked when I tried to follow their coverage of a referendum I reported on.
When it comes to countries like Syria, the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia, I have to consider whether I could get someone in trouble with the government for touching on sensitive topics in online or phone conversations.
It's also not easy to get journalist visas or press credentials in many of those countries. That means I have to do a lot of interviews from Beirut -- via WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram or Facebook Messenger -- instead of going to see the people, as I would normally try to do in the United States, or simply calling them.
The reporting restrictions have made me sensitive about the tech I carry with me on reporting trips. As a precaution on my visit to Syria, where I strongly suspected the authorities would track my movements and keep tabs on my communications, I took a new phone without any personal data on it.
And because we have to do so much reporting from afar, my whole understanding of social media has changed thanks to watching how Hwaida keeps in touch with Syrians online, as she'll explain.
It isn't just monitoring Twitter for eyewitness accounts and photos, though we do some of that. A steady stream of newsy updates, photos, videos and commentary from Syrian civilians and activists flows into my phone through groups on WhatsApp, Facebook and other services -- sometimes so much of it that it feels more like navigating white-water rapids. I've been learning not only to try to keep up with it, but also to sift what seems credible from what sounds like rumor or hearsay.
Hwaida, you've covered the civil war in Syria since 2011. How have the tech tools that you've used for that evolved over the past eight years?
Hwaida: When I joined The Times in 2007, my laptop and my mobile phone and landline were almost the only tools I used for reporting. Back then, social media wasn't widely available in Syria. Facebook was banned, but people used it discreetly.
After 2011, Syrians started to find different ways to communicate with the media. So I activated my Facebook account and created a Skype account.
Syrian activists began trying to mobilize international and domestic support for protests against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt in 2011 also inspired Syrian activists, who drew on the same tools and methods used by other Arab activists. They posted videos to YouTube, created Twitter hashtags and attempted to portray a rising nonviolent Syrian protest wave through online media. With the absence of journalists on the ground, social media and the internet proved essential to the international coverage of Syria.
I've now used almost every single communication technology to reach Syrian contacts, from satellite phones to Skype to YouTube to Twitter to WhatsApp to Facebook. I used them to chat with people I never thought I would reach.
You had some issues being blocked by WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook. Why?
Hwaida: I joined about 150 WhatsApp chat rooms, including Islamic State ones that became super active -- in order to do my reporting. I was blocked by WhatsApp more than once because I was violating its terms by joining ISIS-related groups, which are generally barred on the service.
Unfortunately, WhatsApp didn't have special rules for reporters, though I tried to explain the nature of my work. Luckily, I managed to get my WhatsApp account back after promising to leave all the suspicious rooms. It wasn't an easy decision since the rooms were vital to tracking ISIS-related news.
What kind of internet access do Syrian citizens have amid the civil war?
Hwaida: An exceptional amount of what the outside world knows -- or thinks it knows -- about Syria's nearly nine-year-old conflict has come from videos, analysis and commentary circulated through social networks. Many journalists and Syrian activists believe that the internet radically changed the ability of the regime to carry out monstrous acts of violence.
Syrians inside Syria have joined almost all social tools to communicate with the outside world. The majority prefer to communicate via Facebook and WhatsApp, then Telegram and Signal for security reasons. Twitter remains popular. But not all parties and factions use social media for similar activities and purposes.
Outside of work, what tech products are you obsessed with?
Vivian: I'm a millennial who recently left all my friends and family in the United States to move to a place where I didn't know anyone, so even though I have real concerns that Instagram is proving fatal to my self-esteem and my attention span, I can't go without it. It's the only quick, convenient, vivid way to keep track of how my people in America are doing, or at least what they're eating and where they're going on vacation. (Or maybe that's just how I justify my Instagram addiction.)
Before I moved, I never quite understood what VPNs were for, but I want to thank whoever invented them for helping me watch certain TV shows that stream only on the American versions of Netflix and Amazon -- that is, when my internet is cooperating.
This will be nothing new to regular travelers, but I'm also utterly dependent on a portable phone charger (in my case, a Jackery power bank) and a pair of Bose noise-canceling earbuds.
Other expatriates I know swear by Kindles and other e-readers to download new books they can't get overseas, and to carry a library with them across continents and multiple flights, which makes a lot of sense. I, incurably and incorrigibly, am still hauling physical books around.

Texto completo: A new book-length study on the tax burden of the ultrarich begins with a startling finding: In 2018, for the first time in history, America's richest billionaires paid a lower effective tax rate than the working class.
"The Triumph of Injustice," by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley, presents a first-of-its kind analysis of Americans' effective tax rates since the 1960s. It finds that in 2018, the average effective tax rate paid by the richest 400 families in the country was 23 percent, a full percentage point lower than the 24.2 percent rate paid by the bottom half of American households.
In 1980, by contrast, the 400 richest had an effective tax rate of 47 percent. In 1960, that rate was as high as 56 percent. The effective tax rate paid by the bottom 50 percent, by contrast, has changed little over time.
The analysis differs from many other published estimates of tax burdens by encompassing the totality of taxes Americans pay: not just federal income taxes but also corporate taxes, as well as taxes paid at the state and local levels. It also includes the burden of about $250 billion of what Saez and Zucman call "indirect taxes," such as licenses for motor vehicles and businesses.
The analysis, which was the subject of a column Monday in the New York Times, is also notable for the detailed breakdown of the tax burden of not just the top 1 percent but also the top 0.1 percent, the top 0.01 percent and the 400 richest households.
The focus on the ultrarich is necessary, Saez and Zucman write, because those households control a disproportionate share of the nation's wealth: The top 400 families have more wealth than the bottom 60 percent of households, while the top 0.1 percent own as much as the bottom 80 percent. The top 400 families are a "natural reference point," Zucman says, because the IRS publishes information on the top 400 taxpayers as a group, and other sources, such as Forbes, track the fortunes of the 400 wealthiest Americans.
The relatively small tax burden of the super rich is the product of decades of choices - some deliberate, others the result of indecisiveness or inertia - made by American lawmakers, Saez and Zucman say. Congress has repeatedly slashed top income tax rates, for instance, and cut taxes on capital gains and estates. Lawmakers also have failed to provide adequate funding for IRS enforcement efforts and allowed multinational companies to shelter their profits in low-tax nations.
But the tipping point came in 2017, with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation, championed by President Trump and then-House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), was a windfall for the wealthy: It lowered the top income tax bracket and slashed the corporate tax rate.
By 2018, according to Saez and Zucman, the rich were already enjoying the fruits of that legislation: The average effective tax rate paid by the top 0.1 percent of households dropped by 2.5 percentage points. The benefits promised by the bill's supporters - higher rates of growth and business investment and a shrinking deficit - have largely failed to materialize.
Not all economists accept Saez and Zucman's analysis. It is based in part on their previous work, along with French economist Thomas Piketty, on the distribution of wealth and income in American society. Other economists have generated estimates of that distribution that show smaller disparities between the nation's haves and have-nots. Saez, Zucman and Piketty have defended their research and maintain that their methods are the most accurate.
On the question of tax burden, Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University who chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, noted that Saez and Zucman did not include refundable tax credits, such as the earned-income tax credit (EITC), in their analysis.
The credit, which is intended to encourage low-income families to work, "is part of the tax code," Furman said. A person who paid $1,000 in federal income taxes and then received a $1,500 credit would have a total federal tax burden of -$500, but Furman said that under Saez and Zucman's analysis, that person would instead show a burden of $0. That result would make total tax burdens at the lower end of the income spectrum appear higher than they are.
"The best estimates indicate that the tax system is progressive - with the rich paying a higher tax rate than everyone else," Furman said.
Zucman countered that his and Saez's analysis considers the EITC and other credits like it as transfers of income, akin to food stamps or jobless benefits, rather than tax provisions.
"If you start counting some transfers as negative taxes, it is not clear where to stop," he said via email. "Do you treat the EITC as a negative tax? veterans' benefits? medicaid? defense spending? . . . There's no clear line and the results become arbitrary."
There is general agreement among economists, however, that the tax burden of the rich has fallen considerably in recent decades.
"The rich definitely pay less in taxes than they did in the past and less than they should," Furman said.
The bulk of Saez and Zucman's new book explores how that happened, and how the trend might be reversed.

Pondering Chaco drilling

Texto completo: Though he fondly remembers his first visit to ancient sites in the Four Corners region, U.S. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt would not say whether he planned to extend a one-year moratorium on oil and gas drilling at Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
In a wide-ranging interview with
The New Mexican on Tuesday, Bernhardt -- who heads the federal agency of some 70,000 employees that is charged with protecting about 500 million acres of public land -- pointed out that he issued the moratorium on oil and gas leasing rights in the first place.
"Well, that moratorium exists because I put it in place," he said. "I grew up in Rifle, Colo., and the first national park that I remember going to was Mesa Verde. It was an inspirational moment in my own learning, and it just made me ask the question, 'Who are the Anasazis, and what does this mean?' And I had no idea what to expect going to Chaco, but I was stunned at the significance of the properties we looked at. They are phenomenal."
But Bernhardt, who noted there are ongoing efforts in Congress to include another moratorium in unfinalized budget legislation, added: "There are also members of these Pueblos and tribes that are concerned that depending on where we draw the line, it could affect their own mining interests."
The park near Chaco Canyon is considered an epicenter of Native heritage and includes fragile archaeological ruins. It has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management -- which Bernhardt oversees -- reversed course in February, deciding to no longer offer about 1,500 acres at an oil and gas lease sale in March. It was the third time the Trump administration had planned to sell parcels near Chaco Canyon and then deferred the leases.
The 50-year-old Bernhardt, in Santa Fe on Tuesday to speak at an oil and gas conference, touched on a variety of subjects in a 30-minute interview, lauding the decision to move BLM headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Grand Junction, Colo. He also defended his ethical integrity against criticism about his past as an oil and gas lobbyist amid an inspector general probe into complaints from eight Democratic senators and other groups. The criticism follows a New York Times investigation detailing how Bernhardt continued to push for a policy pursued by a former lobbying client.
"Look, I've been employed by the United States government substantially longer than I've been employed by any oil and gas company or any other client," Bernhardt said. "But more importantly, I'm a lawyer who fully and appropriately understands that I'm here to serve the public. And that's the only reason I took and engaged in this public service.
"And to do so, I have certain rules that I have to comply with. And I am rigorous in my compliance. I am meticulous. But I do have a policy view, and that policy view is shaped by my view that I fully support President [Donald] Trump's policies and visions for conservation, stewardship and for resource development. And I'm gonna get up every day and do that. And there are people that fundamentally don't like that, and so they'd like to weaponize ethics. But at the end of the day, I know what the rules are, and I follow them."
U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., a consistent Bernhardt critic who voted against his nomination, said he's confident Congress will approve language within budget bills to continue protecting the Chaco site.
After Tuesday's event at Santa Fe Community College, Udall criticized Bernhardt over the ethics inquiry and for assisting in rolling back President Barack Obama-era methane regulations. He also slammed the secretary's push for oil and gas drilling on public lands and not doing enough to thwart climate change.
"His department has a mandate through the law to be protecting the ecosystems and protecting the environment, and he's not doing that," said Udall, whose father, Stewart Udall, served as interior secretary from 1961-69 under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. "So he's really failed."

Texto completo: Here are a few recipes that make use of fall spices in a variety of different ways.
These first three recipes come from The Spice & Tea Exchange of Lancaster, and use some of the company’s autumnal spice blends and other seasoning and sugar products.
COCOA SPICED PUMPKIN PANCAKES
Ingredients:
• 1/2 teaspoon Himalayan salt
• 3 teaspoons Pumpkin Pie Spice Blend (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, pumpkin powder, cloves, orange zest and star anise)
• 1 tablespoon Dark Cocoa Sugar (cane sugar with dark cocoa)
• 1 tablespoon granulated maple syrup
• 2 cups all-purpose flour
• 2 teaspoons baking powder
• 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
• 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
• 1 cup pumpkin puree
• 1/4 cup light brown sugar
• 1 large egg
• 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
• 1 1/2 cups whole milk
Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, chocolate chips, salt and Pumpkin Pie Spice Blend in a large bowl. Set aside.
Beat together in a large bowl (or a stand mixer with whisk attachment) pumpkin, brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil and milk.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, folding in slowly until completely incorporated. Do not overmix.
Cook in a large grease skillet over medium heat.
About 1/4 cup of batter will be needed for each pancake. Pancakes will need to be cooked about 3 minutes per side or until cooked through.
Serve sprinkled with Dark Cocoa Sugar and granulated maple syrup or with maple syrup.
BAKER’S SPICE BLEND ALMONDS
Ingredients:
• 2 cups whole unsalted almonds
• 2 tablespoons of Baker’s Spice Blend (cinnamon, allspice, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom, star anise)
• Pinch of Himalayan sea salt
• 1 teaspoon agave syrup
• 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Directions:
Bake almonds at 350 degrees for 7 to 8 minutes, stirring once or twice, until golden and fragrant.
Let cool completely.
In a medium bowl, combine the spice blend and the salt, and set aside.
Place almonds in another medium bowl and set aside.
In a small saucepan, heat agave syrup and vanilla extract until runny — or microwave for 10 seconds — and pour over almonds.
Pour agave mixture over the almonds and quickly stir and combine completely. Quickly combine the agave-coated almonds with the spice blend mixture, tossing gently until the almonds are dusted with the spice blend mixture.
Store in air-tight jar or container.
CARAMEL APPLE PORK CHOPS
Ingredients:
• 2 teaspoons Spice & Tea Exchange Lamb & Pork Seasoning (a blend of rosemary, garlic, kosher salt, parsley, savory, black and white pepper, oregano)
• 3 tablespoons Salted Caramel Sugar (turbinado sugar, sea salt and a caramel flavor blend)
• 1 teaspoon Autumn Harvest Spice Blend (maple syrup, cinnamon, turbinado sugar, garlic, onion, kosher salt, ginger, allspice, cloves)
• 4- to 6-ounce boneless pork loin chops
• 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
• 2 tart apples, unpeeled, cored and sliced thin
• 2 medium onions, thinly sliced
• 3 tablespoons pecans, tasted and chopped (optional)
Directions:
Season the pork chops with lamb and pork seasoning.
In a large skillet, melt butter. Add pork chops. Cook over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, then turn chops and cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until pork reaches an internal temperature of 145 F.
Remove chops from pan and plate. Cover to keep warm.
Add apple and onion slices to the skillet. Cook over medium heat until onions are caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir in Salted Caramel Sugar and Autumn Harvest Spice Blend, and mix until well blended and the sugar is dissolved.
Spoon apple and onion mixture over pork chops. Sprinkle with pecans.
This recipe, designed to put that store-bought pumpkin spice flavor into your coffee at home, comes from the Austin American-Statesman.
HOMEMADE PUMPKIN SPICE CREAMER
Ingredients:
• 16 ounces heavy whipping cream, divided
• 1/4 cup maple syrup
• 3 tablespoons pumpkin puree
• 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
• 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
• 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
Directions:
Whisk 1/2 cup of cream, syrup, pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice in a microwave-safe bowl.
Heat the mixture for about 30 seconds in the microwave and then whisk.
Heat again for another 30 seconds and whisk. Add the vanilla extract, sweetened condensed milk and remaining whipping cream. Whisk until well combined.
(You can also do this by shaking the mixture in a large container with a lid.)
Strain with a fine colander at least once and then store in the refrigerator until you’re ready to use it.

SPICED PUMPKIN PIE
Total time: 3 hours, plus chilling
Makes 8 servings
Ingredients:
For the crust:
• 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
• 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
• 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
• 2 to 4 tablespoons ice water, as needed
For the filling:
• 1 cup heavy cream
• 1 cinnamon stick
• 2 petals from a star anise pod (not the whole pod)
• 1 whole clove
• 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
• 1 teaspoon cardamom pods
• 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
• 1 3/4 cups pumpkin or butternut squash purée (homemade or from a 15-ounce can)
• 3/4 cup dark brown sugar
• 2 large eggs
• 2 large egg yolks
• 2 tablespoons dark rum
• 2 teaspoons ground ginger
• 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
• 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
Directions:
Make the crust: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.
Using your fingers, rub in the butter until it is the size of peas. Drizzle in water until the dough comes together when squeezed.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Working a palm-size chunk at a time, use the heel of your hand to smear the dough across the work surface.
Continue until all the dough has been smeared, then gather it all together, flatten into a disk, and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate; fold the edges over and crimp. Prick crust all over with a fork and chill for at least 30 minutes.
Heat oven to 425 F. Line chilled crust with foil and pie weights, then bake for 15 minutes. Remove foil and bake until pale golden, 5 to 10 minutes longer.
Transfer to a rack to cool. Lower oven temperature to 325 F.
Make the filling: In a medium pot, combine the cream, cinnamon stick, star anise petals, clove, fresh ginger, cardamom and peppercorns, and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat, cover, and let steep for 1 hour. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl.
Whisk in pumpkin, brown sugar, eggs, yolks, rum, ground ginger, salt and nutmeg.
Pour into par-baked shell, transfer to a baking sheet, and bake until crust is golden and center is slightly jiggly, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool completely before serving.

Texto completo: Can we not do this again, please? Can we not magnify some purported fault or misstep of a Democratic presidential candidate and make it seem like it's as big a deal as the daily — no, hourly — assaults on truth and decency and the Constitution committed by President Trump?
False equivalency, after all, is one of the ways we got into this mess. (It's weird how Hillary Clinton's purported crimes of having a private e-mail server and potentially hiding official communications are suddenly so much meh when Trump, his advisers, and his family appear to be doing it, isn't it?)
In this week's installment of Have We Learned Nothing: The controversy over whether Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren was really let go in 1971 from her teaching job in a New Jersey public school because she was pregnant. The story is a staple of Warren's stump speech: Once it became clear she was pregnant, her principal wished the young special needs teacher luck and sent her on her way.
The attempted gotcha, in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, cited minutes from school board meetings at the time showing that Warren's job contract was renewed, and that the board later accepted her resignation “with regret" to cast doubt on her claims.
As if Warren could be telling the truth only if the record had shown school officials admitted to canning her for being pregnant.
None of the records unearthed contradict Warren's version of events: Her contract was renewed when she was four months' pregnant, but she was let go when she was visibly pregnant, at six months. She did not always talk about being discriminated against because she wasn't always comfortable sharing that part of her story, she told CBS News. The network also interviewed another teacher who worked at the school at the time, who confirmed that women were required to leave when they were five months' pregnant.
Also, every woman on the planet knows of somebody who suffered a similar fate, and not just way back in the 1970s, before there were laws to protect pregnant women.
But never mind all of that. Trump's bootlickers have sprung into action, accusing Warren of deception and character flaws. The Democrat had been “caught lying," the RNC shrieked. Meanwhile, their own candidate shambles around with his pants on fire all day, every day.
Of course, the truth barely matters anymore. Just ask Joe Biden, forced to defend himself repeatedly against the bald, demonstrable lies Trump and his allies are telling about the former vice president's attempt to fight corruption in Ukraine.
Some voters will cling to the notion that Warren lied about what happened to her in 1971. What's galling is, there's no way to avoid giving the trumped-up scandal oxygen: The president and his allies send the lie up, and even those who debunk it amplify it.
Even more galling: Warren is in the same position as thousands who have paid a professional price for their pregnancies but battle to prove it. Few employers come out and admit they're firing somebody because of a pregnancy — especially since federal and state laws were enacted to outlaw the practice. That doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
“If something is illegal and somebody wants to do it anyway, they will find a way to do it without explicitly making a statement that admits liability," said Rebecca Pontikes, a Boston labor attorney.
Pontikes has seen employers load extra work on pregnant employees in physical jobs in an attempt to force them out. Nearly 31,000 pregnancy discrimination charges were filed with federal and state agencies between 2010 and 2015, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families.
A February New York Times investigation found that pregnancy discrimination remains rampant in corporate America, with employers sidelining pregnant women and mothers, passing them over for promotions, and firing them when they complain. In the most egregious cases, employers admitted they viewed pregnant women differently. But most employers are smarter than that.
They discriminate against pregnant women in ways that are harder to prove, forcing them into the very position Warren is in now: Having to piece together a case from imperfect records, while those who benefit most from the discrimination try to undermine her credibility.
Let's not play right into their hands.

Sturgill Simpson releases blazing new rock record

Texto completo: Listeners hungry for Sturgill Simpson's familiar croon better keep feasting on the old stuff – because the Kentucky songwriter's new album trades country comfort for all-out helping of rock 'n' roll grime.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer. Instead, he ventures deep into the underbelly of fuzzy, futuristic guitar rock.
Simpson recorded "Sound & Fury" at Michigan's McGuire Motor Inn, working alongside bandmates Bobby Emmett, Chuck Bartels and Miles Miller. John Hill, known for his work with Portugal. The Man and Cage The Elephant, co-produced the album.
And, if Simpson tapping into a no-nonsense dystopian soundscape wasn't enough, Simpson teamed with leading names in anime to team the 40-minute stack of new tunes with a Netflix film of the same name.
How's the album sound? And what can you expect from the Netflix film? Here's what we know about "Sound & Fury."
'Sound & Fury,' the album Simpson's 10-track "Sound & Fury" follows the subtle country storytelling of 2016's "A Sailor's Guide To Earth," which earned the major label newcomer international acclaim – including an unexpected nomination for Album of the Year at the 2017 Grammy Awards (he'd fall to Adele, but brought home Best Country Album that year).
As outlined in a New York Times profile earlier this month, Simpson found "Sound & Fury" by way of Nashville nonconformity, worn-down months on the road ("There was a point in 2017 where I thought I was just going to just go away," he said) and the immobile weeks after a sinus surgery that led him to rediscover the music of his formidable years.
In his time recovering from surgery, Simpson told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that he turned to hip-hop, the Cars and Black Sabbath, each influencing the rip-roaring sound that boils with audacity and swagger on "Sound & Fury."
A cathartic output, Simpson told the Times he wanted it to hit "like a Wu-Tang record." From the article:
"I could've very easily probably made the same record five times by now and just gone right down that middle lane and played it safe, and I'd have $80 million in the bank," Simpson said, dryly. "And I'd probably be hanging from a (expletive) rope on one of these trees over here by now, you know what I mean? So it's not worth it."
The result? A sonic onslaught that explores galaxies between genre.
Simpson blurs between disco itches and gritty guitar scratches on the album. There's the groove of instrumental opener, "Ronin;" The slick, funky flair of "A Good Look;" southern-soaked bombast with closer "Fastest Horse In Town;" and an ode to longing, reflective guitar-pop with six-minute album standout "Make Art Not Friends."
On the subtly spacey "Mercury In Retrograde," Simpson sings to the dog-and-pony show that once greeted his rising success: "They come back stage and on my bus, pretending to be my friend/ Shaking hands behind grandstands, wearing the same 'ole grin."
The songs come from "a weird spot," Simpson told Lowe earlier this year – including his distaste for the industry behind the art.
"It is a dirty toxic industry," he said. "And I wanted to express a lot of that."
'Sound & Fury,' the film A 41-minute "Sound & Fury" anime epic, now streaming on Netflix, puts colorful (and unapologetically violent) context to the album.
Simpson, a Navy veteran once stationed in Japan, enlisted acclaimed creative Jumpei Mizusaki to direct, with "Afro Samauri" creator Takashi Okazaki serving as character designer.
The film draws blood-soaked lines between good and evil, a tension illuminated by dystopian chemicals and city-sprawling guerrilla warfare.
It took about $1.2 million to produce, the Times reported and follows "hegemonic structures, politics, corruption, greed – you know, things that usually lead to really (expletive) music," Simpson said.

Beware of Automated Hiring

Texto completo: It won't end employment discrimination. In fact, it could make it worse.
Algorithms make many important decisions for us, like our creditworthiness, best romantic prospects and whether we are qualified for a job. Employers are increasingly using them during the hiring process out of the belief they're both more convenient and less biased than humans. However, as I describe in a new paper, this is misguided.
In the past, a job applicant could walk into a clothing store, fill out an application and even hand it straight to the hiring manager. Nowadays, her application must make it through an obstacle course of online hiring algorithms before it might be considered. This is especially true for low-wage and hourly workers.
The situation applies to white-collar jobs too. People applying to be summer interns and first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs have their résumés digitally scanned for keywords that can predict success at the company. And the company has now embraced automated interviewing.
The problem is that automated hiring can create a closed-loop system. Advertisements created by algorithms encourage certain people to send in their résumés. After the résumés have undergone automated culling, a lucky few are hired and then subjected to automated evaluation, the results of which are looped back to establish criteria for future job advertisements and selections. This system operates with no transparency or accountability built in to check that the criteria are fair to all job applicants.
As a result, automated hiring platforms have enabled discrimination against job applicants. In 2017, the Illinois attorney general opened an investigation into several automated hiring platforms after complaints that a résumé building tool on Jobr effectively excluded older applicants. The platform had a drop-down menu that prevented applicants from listing their college graduation year or year of a first job before 1980.
Similarly, a 2016 class-action lawsuit alleged that Facebook Business tools "enable and encourage discrimination by excluding African-Americans, Latinos and Asian-Americans but not white Americans from receiving advertisements for relevant opportunities." Facebook's former Lookalike Audiences feature allowed employers to choose only Facebook users demographically identical to their existing workers to see job advertisements, thus replicating racial or gender disparities at their companies. In March, Facebook agreed to make changes to its ad platform to settle the lawsuit.
But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Under federal law, employers have wide discretion to decide which qualities are a "cultural fit" for their organization. This allows companies to choose hiring criteria that could exclude certain groups of people and to hide this bias through automated hiring. For example, choosing "lack of gaps in employment" as a cultural fit could hurt women, who disproportionately take leaves from the workplace to tend to children and ailing family members.
Automated hiring has now evolved past simple résumé parsing and culling. According to one lawsuit, a college student with a near-perfect SAT score and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder found himself rejected over and over for minimum-wage jobs at supermarkets and retail stores that were using a personality test modeled after a test used to diagnose mental illness.
How do we make sure that automated hiring platforms do not worsen employment discrimination?
The first step is to pass laws that let plaintiffs bring suits when they have experienced bias in an automated hiring system. Federal law requires a plaintiff to prove either disparate treatment (that is, "smoking gun" evidence of intentional discrimination) or disparate impact (statistical proof that a group of applicants, for example, racial minorities or white women, were disproportionately rejected for employment). It's hard for applicants, though, to get either type of proof because employers control the data in hiring platforms.
We should change the law to allow for a third method for plaintiffs to bring suit under the "discrimination per se" doctrine. As I describe in a paper, this new doctrine would allow for the burden of proof to be shifted to the employer.
So when a plaintiff using a hiring platform encounters a problematic design feature -- like platforms that check for gaps in employment -- she should be able to bring a lawsuit on the basis of discrimination per se, and the employer would then be required to provide statistical proof from internal and external audits to show that its hiring platform is not unlawfully discriminating against certain groups.
We need a federal law that would mandate data retention for all applications (including applications that were not completed) on hiring platforms and that would require employers to conduct internal and external audits so that no groups of applicants are disproportionately excluded. The audits would also ensure that the criteria being used is actually related to job tasks.
This idea has precedence in federal law: Occupational Safety and Health Administration audits are recommended to ensure safe working conditions for employees. Employers that subject their automated hiring platforms to external audits should also receive a certification mark, that would favorably distinguish those employers in the labor market. This type of auditing and certification system recognizes that job applicants should be able to make informed choices about which hiring platforms they will trust with their information.
Unions can help to ensure that automated hiring platforms are fair. Through collective bargaining, unions can work with employers to determine what criteria are actually relevant for determining job fit. Unions can also make sure that applicant data retained by automated hiring platforms is protected, and that it is not sold or transferred to workers' detriment.
To be sure, human decision-making is clouded by bias. But so is automated decision-making, especially given that human biases can be introduced at any stage of the process, from the design of the hiring algorithm to how results are interpreted.
We cannot rely on automated hiring platforms without adequate safeguards to prevent unlawful employment discrimination. We need new laws and mandates to achieve that goal.

Texto completo: The debate over President Trump's fitness for office amid the House-led impeachment inquiry has put renewed scrutiny on national security officials who served in his administration to speak out, even as the president ramps up efforts to discredit the investigation as a "deep state" plot to destroy him.
Over the past week, several former officials have spoken critically of Trump's conduct and his foreign policy, lending weight to the picture of a president motivated by political interests with little regard for policy expertise, legal boundaries or institutional restraints.
Although the critiques have not all directly addressed the focus of the House investigation - Trump's request that Ukraine investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden - they have added to the case being made by the president's critics that he is putting U.S. security at risk.
Recent remarks by former national security adviser John Bolton and former State Department presidential envoy Brett McGurk - along with an open letter from a large group of national security figures including some who served under Trump - represent the latest clash between the president and the experts charged with keeping the nation safe.
Trump has feuded with the national security community since many in the Republican establishment opposed his candidacy in 2016. And throughout the investigation into Russian interference in that election, the president sought to disparage U.S. intelligence agencies as a part of a politically motivated campaign to sabotage his presidency and sought to target some who spoke against him as partisan foils.
Those who have come forward since the Ukraine impeachment inquiry was announced said they are determined to make clear that Trump's conduct falls well outside the institutional boundaries of the presidency.
"What is happening currently is not normal," said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, who served as a U.S. intelligence officer on Russia and Eurasia before stepping down in 2018. "This represents a deviation from the way that these institutions regularly function. And when the institutions don't work, that is a national security threat."
She was among 90 national security veterans who signed an open letter published Sunday in support of the anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint that Trump had acted improperly in asking the Ukranian president to investigate Biden in a July phone call.
Trump has attempted to intimidate other government officials into not cooperating by casting those who offered information to the whistleblower as "close to spies." The open letter emphasized that the whistleblower "is protected from certain egregious forms of retaliation."
White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump's critics have seized on criticism from ex-officials as evidence that Democrats have more than enough material to justify the impeachment proceedings against him and to try to remove him from office.
McGurk, the former special envoy charged with coordinating the global campaign against the Islamic State, issued a scathing series of tweets Monday calling Trump "not a Commander-in-Chief" for his abrupt decision to order U.S. troops out of northern Syria. The move could put Kurdish forces, longtime partners in the fight against ISIS, in jeopardy.
Trump makes "impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation," said McGurk, who registered similar concerns in December when he resigned in protest.
His critique was met with widespread approval on social media, garnering nearly 50,000 likes, as prominent anti-Trump voices called on other former administration officials - most prominently former defense secretary Jim Mattis - to speak out in a similar vein.
Mattis also resigned in December in protest of Trump's policy on Afghanistan and Syria, but he has refrained from presenting an unvarnished public critique despite publishing a book in August on his Pentagon service.
"Where is General Mattis?" Joe Lockhart, who served as White House press secretary during President Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings , wrote on Twitter. Nicolle Wallace, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote that consensus among GOP national security experts and elected officials is that the country would be severely damaged by a second Trump term.
"This would be the moment to say that out loud," she urged.
Some former officials have been reluctant to weigh in part over fears it could muddy public perception of the national security institutions.
"In some ways, doing that reinforces the narrative of some hostile deep state and people just point to that by saying, 'You see? We told you. They were there all along,' " said a former high-ranking State Department official who left the agency last year. This person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, felt conflicted about speaking out broadly against Trump after having served inside the administration.
But the former official acknowledged that Trump's attacks on government agencies are unprecedented and expressed dismay over remarks last weekend from Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), a prominent Trump ally, that he does not trust the FBI or CIA.
Roberta Jacobsen, who stepped down as U.S. ambassador to Mexico in 2018, conceded that ex-career officials publicly opposing Trump could contribute to a broader perception of partisanship. But she signed onto the open letter because Trump's conduct "so violates the rules that you were brought up on and because you think it's just dangerous for the United States."
Trump's efforts to impugn the whistleblower are part of his long-standing playbook to degrade the credibility of those who criticize him. He ripped Mattis - asking "what has he done for me?" - and said he had never met McGurk. He trashed former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as "dumb as a rock" for saying in May that an unprepared Trump was outwitted by Russian President Vladimir Putin at a global summit in 2017.
Last month, Trump forced the resignation of Bolton over broad policy disagreements, then aligned himself publicly with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un over his dislike for the former White House aide. At a Washington think tank last week, Bolton eviscerated Trump's North Korea strategy as naive and dangerous, suggesting the president was preoccupied with summit-meeting photo ops with Kim. He stopped short of personally criticizing Trump.
And Trump suggested last year that some in the administration were committing treason after an anonymous senior official wrote in the New York Times that aides were quietly working to protect the country against his reckless tendencies.
Amid the impeachment inquiry, Trump has sought to close ranks, ordering a sizable reduction in the staff of the National Security Council, according to Bloomberg News. White House officials said it was an attempt to streamline decision-making.
But others interpreted the move as more evidence that a president distrustful of the government he oversees is determined to rely on his own judgment almost exclusively. As if to underscore that concern, Trump boasted Monday of his "great and unmatched wisdom" in defending his Syria decision.
Bryan McGrath, a retired naval officer who helped organize the first "Never Trump" letter in 2016, said GOP national security veterans are deliberating over how to "reengage in a big way" ahead of the 2020 election.
During his time in the Navy, he was trained that his commander "was to be obeyed," and current officers have a similar responsibility, he said. But now out of uniform, McGrath said he feels compelled to speak out.
"This is a unique, deep and long-lasting threat," he said.

Texto completo: A secret Russian intelligence unit is believed to be behind assassination attempts and a failed coup as part of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s efforts to destabilize Europe, according to Western security officials.
An attempt to assassinate a former Russian spy living in Britain and a failed coup in Montenegro were carried out by an elite group inside the Russian intelligence system, known as Unit 29155, the New York Times reported Tuesday.
Unit 29155 has operated in secrecy for at least a decade, but was only recently discovered by Western officials. It’s not known how often the group is deployed, and western intelligence officials warned they don’t know when and where the unit will show up next. The group’s existence has been so covert that even other operatives of the Russian intelligence agency, known as the GRU, were likely unaware of it, according to Western intelligence analysis.
Officers, some of whom are veterans of Russia’s wars in Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Ukraine, travel to and from European countries to carry out their operations.
Western intelligence has linked several operations to the unit. Two officers were involved in a failed coup in Montenegro in 2016 which involved a plot to kill the country’s prime minister and seize the Parliament building. The 2018 poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy, and his daughter in Britain, as well the attempted assassination of Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev in 2015 have also been linked to the group.
A retired GRU officer who had knowledge of Unit 29155 told the Times the group has expertise in preparing for “diversionary” missions, “in groups or individually — bombings, murders, anything.”
“They were serious guys who served there,” the retired officer said. “They were officers who worked undercover and as international agents.”

A WHALE WOODSTOCK IN THE PACIFIC

Texto completo: Humpback whales spend the summer in cold, high-latitude feeding areas. In the winter, when it’s time to mate, they return to the exact tropical spot where they were born. And when they get there, the males sing a tune common to that breeding ground, almost as if it’s a local jingle or a college fight song.
But a study published in Royal Society Open Science reports there’s at least one place where whales mix it up: Raoul Island, nearly 700 miles off the northeast coast of New Zealand. Humpback whales from the South Pacific tend to stop there for a few days on their way from various breeding grounds in places like Tonga and New Caledonia to their feeding ground near Antarctica.
While they’re hanging out near Raoul Island, they do something researchers hadn’t seen: Whales from each breeding ground share their songs and learn one another’s. In other words, it’s a humpback karaoke spot.
The music made by male humpback whales is rich and haunting, mixing disparate pitches and textures. These sounds are an object of fascination for experts and laypeople alike, and they have been the subject of at least one best-selling album. Researchers aren’t entirely sure why whales sing, although most agree that it has something to do with courtship. (Female humpbacks, which make interesting sounds of their own, seem to take the songs into account when choosing mates.)
The more people study humpback music, the more mysteries arise. For instance, although the male whales at a particular breeding ground all sing the same song, the songs themselves change from year to year, incorporating new elements and phrases.
After decades of analyzing the singing of South Pacific whales - one of 14 known humpback populations - scientists from the South Pacific Whale Research Consortium noticed that the whales were remixing their songs to incorporate music associated with other breeding grounds.
“The song we hear in whales in New Caledonia this year - next year we’ll hear elements of that song in the whales in Tonga,” said Rochelle Constantine, a professor at the University of Auckland and an author of the paper. “It moves from west to east.”
The researchers wondered: Where were the whales picking up these new tunes? Humpbacks don’t visit each other’s breeding grounds. And the feeding grounds, where whales from the South Pacific population are all together, are largely silent. “It’s not the month to be singing,” Constantine said. “They’re busy.”
Raoul Island, a volcanically active landmass half the size of Manhattan, is not an obvious place for a whale party. But over the past decade or so, Constantine said, Department of Conservation rangers posted there had noticed humpbacks aggregating in September and October.
“Instead of just swimming in a straight line down to the feeding grounds, which is the fastest point from A to B, they will come out of their way” to spend time at the island, Constantine said.
In 2015, she and some colleagues traveled there to figure out what they were up to.
When the researchers lowered a hydrophone, or underwater microphone, into the water, they were “quite surprised at how much song we heard,” Constantine said. The singing - which the researchers could also hear through the hulls of their boats - was not quite as loud or lusty as it generally is at the breeding grounds. But at any given moment, there was almost always at least one whale performing.
Acoustic analysis of the songs told the researchers that the singing whales were from a number of different breeding grounds, a conclusion bolstered by photo identification as well as later genetic testing. They even recorded a humpback singing two different songs, perhaps in the process of learning.
Although the sample size is small - only a few dozen whales were recorded - the authors have “clearly demonstrated a location where the cultural transmission of song may occur,” said Melinda Rekdahl, a scientist for the Wildlife Conservation Society, who was not involved with the research. She said questions remain, including why songs seem to move from west to east.
But one piece of the puzzle seems to have been placed. “The great mystery for us was: Where’s the place where they share the song?” Constantine said. “And we found it.”

Curb ugliness on the web. But how?

Texto completo: Amid social and political upheaval and the proliferation of new media and communications technologies, freedom of speech has been the subject of heated polemics. Should our conception of free speech be rethought? Do current speech norms unfairly empower some groups and silence others?
Unfortunately, much of the time, these debates reflect the mentality summed up more than a quarter-century ago in the title of a book by one of the rare true champions of freedom of speech, the late author Nat Hentoff: "Free Speech for Me, But Not for Thee."
Take an op-ed in Sunday's New York Times, dramatically titled "Free Speech Is Killing Us." Author Andrew Marantz, a writer for The New Yorker, argues that dogmatic free speech absolutism ties our hands when it comes to curbing the deadly danger of internet-fueled extremism. Marantz points to hate-driven massacres whose perpetrators were radicalized online, as well as the social media-driven campaigns of populist demagogues like Donald Trump or the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte.
Marantz agrees that "[f]ree speech is a bedrock value in this country" but argues that it must be balanced against "equality, safety and robust democratic participation." He also asserts that he is not calling for "repealing the First Amendment" or even banning offensive speech from private platforms; he just wants both politicians and the private sector to do something.
For instance, he says, Congress could fund news literacy programs, "build a robust public media," or create public alternatives to Google and Facebook. Marantz also suggests rethinking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which exempts website owners from legal liability for user-posted content, while urging tech giants to act on their own to curtail speech that can lead to violence.
But such measures would be either cosmetic or damaging. In this climate of polarization and mistrust, it's very unlikely that government-funded media could make a positive difference. Publicly funded social media platforms would have less ability to ban extreme speech than private ones because of First Amendment protections. And repealing or eviscerating Section 230 would effectively destroy freedom of speech online.
In principle, I have nothing against some speech-policing by private entities such as Google and Twitter. But such measures can also drive hateful content to less visible corners of the internet where it would be harder to monitor. And if measures against hate speech turn into suppression of debate on such thorny issues as hormone therapy for transgender-identifying children, this can inhibit discourse and deepen polarization.
Marantz suggests that our blanket rejection of legal bans on hate speech is outdated. Given evidence that hate speech laws in Europe and elsewhere have been used to suppress legitimate speech on social, religious and political issues, this is a disturbing stance. Yet it is one embraced by more and more mainstream pundits and legal scholars.
This is a dangerous trend, particularly since it is based on inflated perception of danger. While ideological zealotry has become more common, extremism-driven killings remain extremely rare.
Progressives should be wary of handing the government new powers to regulate speech when conservatives control the White House and the Senate and have a commanding presence in the federal courts. Already, some Republicans are trying to launch their own attacks on Section 230 in response to complaints that social media platforms are silencing conservatives. Meanwhile, the Heritage Foundation held a conference on whether the press should be "restrained" with stronger libel laws.
It sounds like we need free speech more than ever.

Texto completo: Massachusetts health officials on Monday revealed that a woman in her 60s from Hampshire County was the state's first known vaping-related death, the latest victim in a nationwide outbreak of potentially fatal lung ailments apparently caused by the smoking products.
An initial report indicated the woman vaped nicotine, according to the Department of Public Health, which added that it is still investigating what products she used and where she purchased them. State health officials did not identify the woman or say when she died.
The death added urgency to determine the cause of an outbreak of lung injuries related to vaping, which has led to at least 1,080 illnesses and 22 deaths nationwide reported since late August, according to federal and state officials.
The illnesses have rocked the cannabis and nicotine-vaping industries. On Sept. 24, Governor Charlie Baker banned the sale of both types of vaping devices and products for four months, the toughest measure in the country. Other states, such as Rhode Island, have banned flavored electronic cigarettes.
The Hampshire County woman was among the 121 suspected cases reported to Massachusetts health officials since Sept. 11. That's when the state started requiring clinicians to notify the Department of Public Health about patients who vaped and had otherwise unexplained lung abnormalities and worsening symptoms such as trouble breathing, ­fatigue, chest pain, coughing, or weight loss.
So far, Massachusetts has determined 19 cases in which lung injuries are confirmed to be or are probably part of the nationwide outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses.
“Today I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of a patient who had this illness," Dr. Monica Bharel, Massachusetts' public health commissioner, said in a statement. “We are investigating these cases as quickly as possible and working with our federal partners to better understand this outbreak."
Federal officials have said that most of the illnesses nationwide seem linked to concentrated marijuana oil vape products, largely those purchased from unlicensed sellers.
However, 17 percent of affected­ patients interviewed nationwide reported vaping only­ nicotine. And no single product or chemical has been linked to all cases.
The investigation has been complicated by the fact that many patients were reluctant to say they vaped an illegal drug, or one obtained illicitly, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In a statement, a spokesman for the governor said Baker was “saddened to learn that a life has been lost to a vaping-related illness." Baker pledged to continue to work with state and federal health authorities “to collect more information about what is making people sick."
Dr. Michael Siegel, a Boston University professor of community health, said that Massachusetts will have a better chance of helping consumers avoid dangerous products if it releases more information about what's causing the illnesses.
“The message that's being sent is not very clear" because of the ban on all vaping products, Siegel said.
“The message should be: 'We may not have all the answers but we do know that black-market THC cartridges seem to be at least one of the major drivers of this.' "
Baker's office has pointed to some patients' illnesses nationwide as being possibly linked to licensed cannabis dispensaries or nicotine vape products.
Massachusetts health officials last week released details for 10 of the 19 patients whose cases are at least probably linked to vaping. They were mostly female. Five were under age 20, three were 40 to 49, and two were 20 to 39.
Of the 10, five reported vaping only cannabis oils, four reported vaping both marijuana and nicotine products, and one reported vaping only nicotine.
Officials have not specified where any of the products came from.
Mayo Clinic doctors who analyzed lung tissue samples from sickened vaping patients found that the injuries appeared to be caused by undetermined toxic chemicals that damaged the lung tissue, killed cells in the airway lining and the lungs, and prompted swelling, making breathing even harder.
Dr. Jonathan Winickoff, a pediatrician who studies vaping at Massachusetts General Hospital, said people should avoid vaping all products — nicotine or cannabis-derived — because of the lack of information on the health effects of chemicals used in both types of products.
“I'd like to make sure that we don't have any further deaths in Massachusetts," Winickoff said. “The most important thing that the government officials can do is to get the word out about replacing any vaped nicotine­ products with FDA-approved nicotine."
The state is also offering free nicotine patches and gum to people who call its help line because they want to quit using tobacco.
Baker's ban has prompted a backlash by medical marijuana patients and former smokers who say they relied on vaping for health reasons. Some have driven to nearby states, while others have turned to the illicit market or to combustible cigarettes.
Baker has said he focused on input from medical experts, not the industry, for his decision.
Dr. Michael Sinha, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, said he feared that Baker's ban was pushing people into the illicit market, where products are more dangerous, and came too soon before it was clear whether legally sold products were part of the problem.
“We generally don't take these types of public health responses until we have the evidence," Sinha said. “Sure, it's fine to imagine in a vacuum if you cut off the supply, people will just stop using, but that's not what physiological dependence is."

Texto completo: The settlement concludes a case that drew national attention over its connections to Michael Cohen, President Trump's former fixer.
MIAMI -- A settlement has been reached in a Florida court case over a disputed business deal that resulted from an unusual friendship that Jerry Falwell Jr. and his wife struck with a former pool attendant at a Miami Beach hotel, court records show.
As part of the settlement, which was filed Friday in Miami federal court, Mr. Falwell will pay an undisclosed sum to a young man who claimed he had been offered an ownership stake in a gay-friendly youth hostel, the Miami Hostel, that Mr. Falwell and his wife, Becki, bought in 2013.
Mr. Falwell is the chancellor of one of the nation's largest Christian colleges, Liberty University, and one of President Trump's best known evangelical supporters.
The settlement brings to a close a case that drew national attention over purported sexually compromising photographs involving the Falwells that could have been used as leverage against them. Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer who is now in prison, has said he intervened to help Mr. Falwell with the photos.
After Mr. Cohen's involvement, the plaintiff, Jesus Fernandez Jr., said the case had forced him to change his name to Gordon Bello. His father, Jesus Fernandez Sr., who is no longer part of the lawsuit, became Jett Bello. The Bellos -- then the Fernandezes -- had filed the suit claiming the Falwells had promised them a share in the Miami Hostel. In a statement to The New York Times earlier this year, the senior Mr. Bello would not further explain the name changes, citing the pending litigation.
Mr. Falwell has denied the existence of the photographs, which Mr. Cohen discussed with the actor Tom Arnold, an anti-Trump crusader, in a secret recording. In legal filings, the Falwells denied ever promising the Fernandezes a share of the ownership of the hostel, which rents beds for as little as $ 15 a night.
The $ 4.7 million cash purchase of the hostel and its building -- including a $ 1.8 million loan from the Falwells, according to a sworn affidavit -- was a business venture with Giancarlo Granda, whom the couple befriended poolside at a Miami Beach hotel, the Fontainebleau, in 2012. Mr. Granda consulted a high school friend, the junior Mr. Bello, whose father had worked in Miami real estate for decades. (Mr. Falwell, who is not a minister, spent years as a lawyer and real estate developer.)
By the time the court case reached an impasse in late 2015, the fight had turned to the photos, several people involved in the case told The Times earlier this year. One or more people among Mr. Granda, the Bellos and their lawyers were believed to have the photos in their possession.
Mr. Cohen told Mr. Arnold in the recording that he was going to pay for the photographs and ensure no copies were kept by anyone else. He made a reference in the tape to the "pool boy," who could have been Mr. Granda. But Mr. Cohen never specified whom he planned to pay. The payoff "never happened," he added. A person close to the Falwells told The Times earlier this year that they did not know of Mr. Cohen's supposed involvement until parts of Mr. Arnold's recording were released.
Mr. Falwell's lawyer, Joshua B. Spector, did not immediately respond to a phone call and an email seeking comment on Monday. Neither did Michael L. Addicott, a lawyer for the junior Mr. Bello.
Last month, Mr. Falwell moved the case to federal court, arguing that state court was an improper venue for a lawsuit between two people who lived in different states. Mr. Falwell resides in Virginia and Mr. Bello in South Florida, where he is a legislative aide to the Miami-Dade County Commission.

The Education of Fanatical Centrists

Texto completo: Will they finally admit what the G.O.P. has become?
It's hard to believe that barely three weeks have passed since Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a mysterious subpoena to the acting director of national intelligence, demanding that he produce a whistle-blower complaint filed by someone in the intelligence community.
Since that subpoena was issued, the impeachment of Donald Trump has gone from implausibility to near certainty; I at least find it hard to see how the House can fail to impeach given what we already know about Trump's actions. Conviction in the Senate remains a long shot, but not as long as it once seemed.
And the whole tenor of our national conversation has changed. It looks to me as if we're witnessing the rapid collapse of a powerful faction in U.S. public life, one whose refusal to accept facts at odds with its prejudices has long been a major source of political dysfunction.
But I'm not talking about the right-wing extremists who dominate the Republican Party. Sorry, but they're not going anywhere. Most of Trump's base is sticking with him, while the list of prominent Republican politicians willing to call out Trump's malfeasance in clear language consists so far of Mitt Romney and, well, Mitt Romney.
No, I'm talking about fanatical centrists, who aren't a large slice of the electorate, but have played an outsize role in elite opinion and media coverage. These are people who may have been willing to concede that Trump was a bad guy, but otherwise maintained, in the teeth of the evidence, that our two major parties were basically equivalent: Each party had its extremists, but each also had its moderates, and everything would be fine if these moderates could work together.
Who am I talking about? Well, among other people, Joe Biden, who has repeatedly insisted that Trump is an aberration, not representative of the Republican Party as a whole. (Biden's refusal to admit what he was facing may be one reason his response to the Ukraine smear has seemed so wobbly.)
Some of us have been pushing back against that worldview for many years, arguing that today's Republican Party is a radical force increasingly opposed to democracy. Way back in 2003 I wrote that modern conservatism is "a movement whose leaders do not accept the legitimacy of our current political system." In 2012 Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein declared that the central problem of U.S. politics was a G.O.P. that was not just extreme but "dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition."
For a long time, however, making that case -- pointing out that Republicans were sounding ever more authoritarian and violating more and more democratic norms -- got you dismissed as shrill if not deranged. Even Trump's rise, and the obvious parallels between Trumpism and the authoritarian movements that have gutted democracy in places like Hungary and Poland, barely dented centrist complacency. Remember, just a few months ago most of the news media treated Attorney General William Barr's highly misleading summary of the Mueller report as credible.
But my sense, although it's impossible to quantify, is that the events of the past several weeks have finally broken through the wall of centrist denial.
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
At this point, things that previously were merely obvious have become undeniable. Yes, Trump has invited foreign powers to intervene in U.S. politics on his behalf; he's even done it on camera. Yes, he has claimed that his domestic political opponents are committing treason by exercising their constitutional rights of oversight, and he is clearly itching to use the justice system to criminalize criticism.
Politicians who believed in American values would denounce this behavior, even if it came from their own leader. Republicans have been silent at best, and many are expressing approval. So it's now crystal clear that the G.O.P. is not a normal political party; it is an American equivalent of Hungary's Fidesz or Poland's Law and Justice, an authoritarian regime in waiting.
And I think -- I hope -- that those who have spent years denying this reality are finally coming around.
It's important to understand that the G.O.P. hasn't suddenly changed, that Trump hasn't somehow managed to corrupt a party that was basically O.K. until he came along. Anyone startled by Republican embrace of wild conspiracy theories about the deep state must have slept through the Clinton years, and wasn't paying attention when most of the G.O.P. decided that climate change was a hoax perpetrated by a vast global scientific cabal.
And anyone shocked by Republican acceptance of the idea that it's fine to seek domestic political aid from foreign regimes has forgotten (like all too many people) that the Bush administration took us to war on false pretenses -- not the same sin, but an equally serious betrayal of American political norms.
No, Trump isn't an aberration. He's unusually blatant and gaudily corrupt, but at a basic level he's the culmination of where his party has been going for decades. And U.S. political life won't begin to recover until centrists face up to that uncomfortable reality.

Texto completo: Not all theme park rides are created equally as some Disney World visitors found out this weekend when they became stranded for hours on the brand new Skyliner gondola ride and had to be rescued by firefighters.
The unfortunate incident illustrated an unsettling theme park truth: Some rides are worse than others to get stuck on.
It’s a lot easier to evacuate from the Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean or the Mad Tea Party if the attraction malfunctions than a gondola ride dangling from a cable several stories in the sky.
Skyliner passengers were stuck for up to three hours and had to be rescued by firefighters using ladder trucks when the new aerial cable car ride malfunctioned Saturday night.
A few unfortunate theme park visitors have found out first hand that it’s much harder to evacuate an attraction when they are way up in the air on a swing tower ride or an elevated monorail. Or even worse, upside down on a looping coaster or thrill ride.
Let’s take a closer look at some recent incidents that illustrate the worst types of rides to get stranded on at a theme park.
Joker’s Jinx at Six Flags America — Two dozen riders were trapped for more than three hours in April 2017 when the launch coaster stalled on the track at the Maryland amusement park. Firefighters used a hydraulic crane to rescue the riders who were stuck 80 feet in the air at a 30-degree angle, according to Washington’s NBC4 News.
Sky Cabin at Knott’s Berry Farm — The gyro tower stopped revolving and became stuck 125 feet in the air for eight hours in December 2016 at the Buena Park theme park, according to the Orange County Register. Riders were rescued by firefighters and lowered by harness.
Monorail at Walt Disney World — Passengers were stranded for hours when the Monorail Gold line stopped on the track at the Florida theme park resort in October 2015, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Fire crews evacuated the trains by cherry picker.
Windseeker at Knott’s Berry Farm — The 300-foot-tall tower swing ride stranded riders in mid-air for nearly four hours in September 2012 at the Buena Park theme park, according to the Orange County Register. Similar incidents occurred with the Mondial tower rides during the 2012 and 2013 seasons at Cedar Point, Kings Island and Carowinds. The Knott’s ride was relocated to Missouri’s Worlds of Fun in 2014 and renamed SteelHawk.
Invertigo at California’s Great America — Passengers were stranded 80 feet in the air for more than four hours in August 2009 at the Santa Clara amusement park when the roller coaster became stuck on the lift hill. Firefighters rescued 24 riders and evacuated them down a staircase, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Invertigo was relocated to Pennsylvania’s Dorney Park in 2012 and renamed Stinger. Dorney has since retired the coaster.
King Kahuna at Kennywood — Riders were stranded upside down when a Huss Top Spin ride malfunctioned in July 2008 at the Pennsylvania theme park, according to the Associated Press. The thrill ride featured seats on a rotating platform that spun 360 degrees forward and backward between two pendulum arms. The Kennywood ride was removed after the 2009 season.
Batman and Robin: The Chiller at Six Flags Great Adventure — A lightning strike knocked out power to the New Jersey amusement park in August 2004 and stranded riders upside down 75 feet in the air on the electrically powered launch coaster, according to the New York Times. Park employees eventually eased the train down to a position where riders could evacuate. The dueling shuttle coaster was removed after the 2007 season.

'Apologist and defender of the indefensible': Former Giuliani press secretary wonders 'what happened to' him

Texto completo: The press secretary for Rudy Giuliani during his 1993 mayoral campaign wondered "what happened" to him in an op-ed in The New York Times, which was published on Monday.
Ken Frydman, who met his wife Liz Bruder during that campaign, has started facing questions internally and from friends about Giuliani's recent adventures regarding Ukraine. Giuliani, who is now President Trump's personal attorney, has spent months acting on behalf of the president while trying to convince foreign governments to investigate 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Frydman refers to Giuliani in the piece as "Trump's bumbling personal lawyer and henchman," and his "apologist and defender of the indefensible." He also said that the former New York City mayor "wasn't always like this."
The former press secretary also explained that as recently as last year he defended Giuliani and expressed his "continuing respect" for him in an op-ed in the New York Daily News, but that "friends and family constantly ask" if he's lost it.
"Fast forward to Rudy’s Ukraine misadventure. This is not Rudy vigorously defending Mr. Trump’s bad behavior," Fydman wrote. "This is Rudy, as a private citizen and personal attorney for the president, lamely acting as a shadow secretary of state and Trump enforcer by attempting to influence the 2020 election in favor of his client."
He goes on to accuse Giuliani of doing "Trump's dirty work," and of "ferocious lying for Mr. Trump," to the point that it has "forced me to re-examine his last 25 years."
Frydman concluded, "We who admired him for so long expected much more from Rudy Giuliani and his legacy."

Texto completo: Almost a decade ago, Warren Buffett made a claim that would become famous. He said that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary, thanks to loopholes and deductions that benefit the wealthy.
His claim sparked a debate about the fairness of the tax system. In the end, the expert consensus was that, whatever Buffett’s specific situation, most wealthy Americans did not actually pay a lower tax rate than the middle class. “Is it the norm?” the fact-checking outfit Politifact asked. “No.”
Time for an update: It’s the norm now.
For the first time on record, the 400 wealthiest Americans last year paid a lower total tax rate — spanning federal, state and local taxes — than any other income group. This depressing milestone has two main causes: President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cut and the long-term rise of tax avoidance by both companies and individuals.
The average tax rate on the richest 400 households last year was only 23%, down from 70% in 1950 and 47% in 1980. Why? In recent decades, the top income-tax rate and the estate tax have both fallen, and corporate taxes — which are effectively paid by shareholders — have plummeted. Middle-class and poor families, on the other hand, haven’t benefited much if at all from the falling corporate tax or estate tax, and they now pay more in payroll taxes than in the past. Overall, their taxes have remained fairly flat.
The combined result is that over the last 75 years the U.S. tax system has become radically less progressive.
The data here come from the most important book on government policy that I’ve read in a long time — called “The Triumph of Injustice,” to be released next week. The authors are Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, both of the University of California, Berkeley. Saez has won the award that goes to the top academic economist under age 40, and Zucman was recently profiled by Bloomberg BusinessWeek magazine as “the wealth detective.”
They have constructed a historical database that tracks the tax payments up and down the income spectrum since 1913, when the federal income tax began. The story they tell is maddening — and yet ultimately energizing.
“Many people have the view that nothing can be done,” Zucman told me. “Our case is, ‘No, that’s wrong. Look at history.’” When the United States has raised tax rates on the wealthy and made rigorous efforts to collect taxes, it has succeeded in doing so.
And it can succeed again.
Saez and Zucman portray tax history as a struggle between people who want to tax the rich and those who want to coddle the rich. The story starts in the 17th century, when Northern colonies created more progressive tax systems — including wealth taxes — than Europe had. The Southern colonies, by contrast, were hostile to taxation, out of a fear that taxes could undermine slavery, as historian Robin Einhorn has explained.
By the middle of the 20th century, the high-tax advocates had prevailed. The United States had arguably the world’s most progressive tax code, with a top income-tax rate of 91%. But the second half of the 20th century was mostly a victory for the low-tax side. Companies found ways to dodge taxes. Politicians cut every tax that fell mostly on the wealthy, with the justification that the economy would benefit.
The justification turned out to be wrong. The wealthy, and only the wealthy, have done fantastically well over the last several decades. The American economy just doesn’t function very well when tax rates on the rich are low and inequality is sky high. It was true in the lead-up to the Great Depression, and it’s been true recently. Which means that raising high-end taxes isn’t about punishing the rich (who, by the way, will still be rich). It’s about creating an economy that works better for the vast majority of Americans.
In their book, Saez and Zucman sketch out a modern progressive tax code. The overall tax rate on the richest 1% would roughly double, to about 60%. The tax increases would bring in about $750 billion a year, enough to pay for universal pre-K, an infrastructure program and much more. Those are the kinds of policies that do lift economic growth.
One crucial proposal is a minimum global corporate tax of at least 25%. A company would have to pay the tax on its American profits even if it set up headquarters in Ireland or Bermuda. Saez and Zucman also favor a wealth tax; Elizabeth Warren’s version is based on their work. And they call for the creation of a Public Protection Bureau, to crack down on tax dodging.
I already know what some critics will say in response — that the rich will always figure out a way to avoid taxes. That’s simply not the case. True, they will always be able to avoid some taxes. But history shows that serious attempts to collect more taxes usually succeed.
Ask yourself this: If efforts to tax the super-rich were really doomed to fail, why would so many of the super-rich be fighting so hard to defeat those efforts?

SECOND OFFICIAL BLOWS WHISTLE INDIVIDUAL OFFERS INFO ON TRUMP-UKRAINE

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - An intelligence official with "firsthand knowledge" has provided information related to President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine and is now protected from retaliation as a whistleblower, lawyers representing the official said on Sunday, confirming that a second individual has come forward in the matter.
Much is unknown about the official, who has been interviewed by the intelligence community's inspector general but has not filed a formal complaint.
But the individual has hired the same legal team as the first whistleblower. That, and the claim of "firsthand knowledge," was seen as suggesting testimony that might bolster the impeachment case against Mr. Trump and further undermine one of his main defense claims: that the accusations against him are based on inaccurate, secondhand information.
The New York Times reported on Friday that an intelligence official who has more direct knowledge of Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine than the first whistleblower, and who had grown alarmed by the president's behavior, was weighing whether to come forward. The second official was among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistleblower, one of the people briefed on the matter said.
For Democratic lawmakers seeking to build their case for impeachment, the new whistleblower could serve as an important witness for both validating what they know and potentially providing new leads for investigators. Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is leading the House's impeachment inquiry, urged other potential whistleblowers to come forward on Sunday night.
"We thank them for their courage," he said. "We thank them for their patriotism. And we hope others will follow their courageous example."
One member of the legal team confirmed on Twitter that the firm was now representing "multiple whistleblowers" but declined to say how many. The inspector general has said that to corroborate the first whistleblower's complaint, he interviewed multiple people who would be afforded protections, and it was unclear if the lawyer could be referring to those people or other people.
Since the first whistleblower emerged, the White House has tried to unmask his identity, and dismiss him as a "deep state operative" with partisan motives to "take down" Mr. Trump. The president stuck to form on Sunday evening in trying to dismiss the new whistleblower.
"Democrat lawyer is same for both Whistleblowers?" he said on Twitter. "All support Obama and Crooked Hillary. Witch Hunt!"
The president also continued to paint himself as the victim of a "deep state."
The lawyers representing both whistleblowers said the emergence of a second account should take the focus off the identities of the individuals coming forward.
"Our hope is that the focus will appropriately shift to the substance and merits of the allegations rather than the individual whistleblowers, each of whom has a legal right to remain anonymous," said Mark Zaid, one of the whistleblower's lawyers.
Mr. Zaid said the official's act of coming forward to the inspector general had secured whistleblower protections, and it was not clear if the whistleblower would file a formal complaint.
"Doesn't need to," Mr. Zaid said in a text message, adding that the person has "first hand knowledge that supported the first whistleblower."
The official has also not communicated yet with any congressional committees, Mr. Zaid said.
The first whistleblower, a CIA officer who was detailed to the National Security Council, filed a complaint in August outlining how Mr. Trump used his power to push Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the former vice president and current presidential candidate, as well as his son Hunter Biden, including in a July 25 phone call with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The disclosure of a new whistleblower, first reported by the ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on his show "This Week," appeared likely to help House Democrats' reconstruction of events, even as the White House has so far refused to comply with requests for documents related to Mr. Trump's efforts to press Ukraine to investigate a leading political rival, and any attempt to conceal his actions.
Additional details about the origins of Mr. Trump's July 25 call with Mr. Zelenskiy emerged over the weekend.
Energy Secretary Rick Perry had encouraged Mr. Trump to speak with the Ukrainian leader, but on energy and economic issues, according to Perry spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes. She said Mr. Perry's interest in Ukraine is part of U.S. efforts to boost Western energy ties to Eastern Europe.
Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly described his conversation with Mr. Zelenskiy as "perfect," told House Republicans on Friday night that it was Mr. Perry who teed up the July call, according to a person familiar with Mr. Trump's comments who was granted anonymity to discuss them. The person said Mr. Trump did not suggest that Mr. Perry had anything to do with the pressure to investigate the Bidens.

Sturgill Simpson releases blazing new rock record

Texto completo: Listeners hungry for Sturgill Simpson's familiar croon better keep feasting on the old stuff – because the Kentucky songwriter's new album trades country comfort for all-out helping of rock 'n' roll grime.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer. Instead, he ventures deep into the underbelly of fuzzy, futuristic guitar rock.
Simpson recorded "Sound & Fury" at Michigan's McGuire Motor Inn, working alongside bandmates Bobby Emmett, Chuck Bartels and Miles Miller. John Hill, known for his work with Portugal. The Man and Cage The Elephant, co-produced the album.
And, if Simpson tapping into a no-nonsense dystopian soundscape wasn't enough, Simpson teamed with leading names in anime to team the 40-minute stack of new tunes with a Netflix film of the same name.
How's the album sound? And what can you expect from the Netflix film?
Here's what we know about "Sound & Fury."
'Sound & Fury,' the album Simpson's 10-track "Sound & Fury" follows the subtle country storytelling of 2016's "A Sailor's Guide To Earth," which earned the major label newcomer international acclaim – including an unexpected nomination for Album of the Year at the 2017 Grammy Awards (he'd fall to Adele, but brought home Best Country Album that year).
As outlined in a New York Times profile earlier this month, Simpson found "Sound & Fury" by way of Nashville nonconformity, worn-down months on the road ("There was a point in 2017 where I thought I was just going to just go away," he said) and the immobile weeks after a sinus surgery that led him to rediscover the music of his formidable years.
In his time recovering from surgery, Simpson told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that he turned to hip-hop, the Cars and Black Sabbath, each influencing the rip-roaring sound that boils with audacity and swagger on "Sound & Fury."
A cathartic output, Simpson told the Times he wanted it to hit "like a Wu-Tang record." From the article:
"I could've very easily probably made the same record five times by now and just gone right down that middle lane and played it safe, and I'd have $80 million in the bank," Simpson said, dryly. "And I'd probably be hanging from a (expletive) rope on one of these trees over here by now, you know what I mean? So it's not worth it."
The result? A sonic onslaught that explores galaxies between genre.
Simpson blurs between disco itches and gritty guitar scratches on the album.
There's the groove of instrumental opener, "Ronin"; the slick, funky flair of "A Good Look"; southern-soaked bombast with closer "Fastest Horse In Town"; and an ode to longing, reflective guitar-pop with six-minute album standout "Make Art Not Friends."
On the subtly spacey "Mercury In Retrograde," Simpson sings to the dog-and-pony show that once greeted his rising success: "They come back stage and on my bus, pretending to be my friend/Shaking hands behind grandstands, wearing the same 'ole grin."
The songs come from "a weird spot," Simpson told Lowe earlier this year – including his distaste for the industry behind the art.
"It is a dirty toxic industry," he said. "And I wanted to express a lot of that."
'Sound & Fury,' the film A 41-minute "Sound & Fury" anime epic, now streaming on Netflix, puts colorful (and unapologetically violent) context to the album.
Simpson, a Navy veteran once stationed in Japan, enlisted acclaimed creative Jumpei Mizusaki to direct, with "Afro Samauri" creator Takashi Okazaki serving as character designer.
The film draws blood-soaked lines between good and evil, a tension illuminated by dystopian chemicals and city-sprawling guerrilla warfare.
It took about $1.2 million to produce, the Times reported and follows "hegemonic structures, politics, corruption, greed – you know, things that usually lead to really (expletive) music," Simpson said.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Sturgill Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer.

Texto completo: A former bank employee, the Italian singer appeared more than 240 times with the Metropolitan Opera, in 27 roles.
Marcello Giordani, a heartfelt, stalwart and, at his best, inspired tenor who was a fixture at the Metropolitan Opera and other major houses around the world, died on Saturday at his home in Augusta, Sicily. He was 56.
The cause was a heart attack, his manager, Katherine Olsen, said.
Mr. Giordani appeared more than 240 times with the Met in 27 roles, including in two company premieres, five new productions and the opening nights of two seasons.
When he opened the 2006-7 season, the first of Peter Gelb's tenure as general manager, in Puccini's "Madama Butterfly," Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Giordani sang "with full-bodied Italianate passion; warm, rich tone; and clarion top notes."
"Clarion" and "passion" were adjectives often used to describe Mr. Giordani at the height of his powers, in the early 2000s. He "sang like a god" in a 2002 concert performance of Cilea's "Adriana Lecouvreur" at Carnegie Hall with Opera Orchestra of New York, Anne Midgette wrote in The Times. It was, she added, "a rock-solid performance at an ideal pitch of fortissimo passion."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Marcello Guagliardo was born on Jan. 25, 1963, in Augusta, a small town on the eastern coast of Sicily. He was the youngest of four sons of Santina, who was a housewife, and Michele, who had been a prison guard but by then owned a gas station. (Soon after starting his international career, Mr. Giordani adjusted his name to be simpler to pronounce and spell.)
When he finished school, Mr. Giordani worked in a bank, but quickly grew bored. His father encouraged his interest in music.
"He loved opera," Mr. Giordani told The Times in 2007. "He heard me singing all the time when I was a kid. Maybe he always dreamed that one of his sons would be an artist."
Tall, handsome and fervent -- "Now there's a tenor," the star singer Neil Shicoff once marveled to Ms. Olsen -- Mr. Giordani had a success in Spoleto, Italy, with Verdi's "Rigoletto," in 1986.
His debut at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan came two years later, in Puccini's "La Bohème," as he began to sing throughout Europe. He made his American debut in 1988, singing Nadir in "Les Pêcheurs de Perles" with the Portland Opera in Oregon.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
He met Wilma Ahrens that year, when she was working for the presenter at an engagement in Lucerne, Switzerland; they married two years later. She survives him, as do their two sons, Michele and Gerard Andre, and his three brothers.
"I learned my profession onstage," Mr. Giordani told The Times. "I didn't have a musical background. I had no conservatory training. I don't play an instrument."
That lack of firm technical grounding soon began to haunt him, and by the early 1990s, he was having vocal problems. "The tenor voice should be like sunshine," Mr. Giordani told The Los Angeles Times in 1998. "My voice was sounding old already, too dark."
Mr. Giordani began a new training regimen, under the guidance of the prominent teacher William Schuman, that salvaged his natural talent.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"The first thing he did was open my body and let me trust my voice again," Mr. Giordani recalled a decade later. "In the past, my voice was my enemy. But for 10 years, it's been my best friend."
Mr. Giordani remained committed to fostering healthy voices and careers; in the early 2010s, he established the Marcello Giordani Foundation to nurture young singers.
He made his first appearance with the Met in the summer of 1993, in Donizetti's "L'Elisir d'Amore," as part of the company's series of concert operas in city parks. The big tenor aria, "Una furtiva lagrima," was, Alex Ross wrote in The Times, "a stirring display of direct emotion."
His debut at the Met's Lincoln Center home came two years later, in "La Bohème." He quickly established himself in the ardent lover leads in touchstones of the repertory, mostly Italian works by Verdi and Puccini, but also as Lensky in Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin," the title character in Berlioz's "La Damnation de Faust," Énée in that composer's "Les Troyens," Des Grieux in Massenet's "Manon," Don José in "Carmen" and, aptly, the Italian Singer who makes a cameo in Strauss's "Der Rosenkavalier."
In Opera News magazine, David J. Baker praised Mr. Giordani's "controlled, sensitive and robust singing" in the Met premiere of Berlioz's "Benvenuto Cellini" in 2003. But while Marion Lignana Rosenberg, writing in the same magazine a year earlier, described his "ringing, brilliant" high notes in the company premiere of Bellini's "Il Pirata," she added that "there is a hardness to his tone that is ill-suited to Bellini's long, supple cantilena."
In 2008, he was the tenor soloist in a Met performance of Verdi's Requiem dedicated to the memory of Luciano Pavarotti, and, in December 2010, he starred in Puccini's "La Fanciulla del West" on the 100th anniversary of the work's world premiere at the Met, in a role sung in 1910 by Enrico Caruso.
He sang in Verdi's "Simon Boccanegra" at the Royal Opera House in London in 1997 under Georg Solti, in what turned out to be Solti's final operatic performances before his death later that year. In 2003, Mr. Giordani appeared in the Paris Opera's first production since 1863 of the original French version of Verdi's "Les Vêpres Siciliennes."
But for all his successes in opera houses, his most glorious nights may well have been his Carnegie Hall performances with Opera Orchestra of New York and its founder and conductor, Eve Queler. With that company, he sang works including "Adriana Lecouvreur," Ponchielli's "La Gioconda," Meyerbeer's "Les Huguenots" and "L'Africaine," and Rossini's "William Tell," in 2005 -- with which Mr. Giordani stopped the show near midnight with the cabaletta "Amis, amis, secondez ma vengeance." When the cheers wouldn't stop, he sang the aria again.
"I've never seen a crowd react that way," Mr. Schuman, his teacher, said in an interview. "A true riot broke out. It was like someone scored the winning touchdown at the Super Bowl. He was capable of incredible things."

Texto completo: Ginger Baker, who helped redefine the role of the drums in rock and became a superstar in the process, died Sunday in a hospital in southeastern England. He was 80.
His family confirmed his death in a post on his official Twitter account.
Baker drew worldwide attention for his approach to the drums, as sophisticated as it was forceful, when he teamed with guitarist Eric Clapton and bassist Jack Bruce in the hugely successful British band Cream in 1966.
Keith Moon of The Who was more uninhibited; John Bonham of Led Zeppelin — a band formed in 1968, the year Cream broke up — was slicker. But Baker brought a new level of artistry to his instrument, and he was the first rock drummer to be prominently featured as a soloist and to become a star in his own right. Clapton praised him as “a fully formed musician” whose “musical capabilities are the full spectrum.”
Both as a member of the ensemble and as a soloist, Baker captivated audiences and earned the respect of his fellow percussionists with playing that was, as Neil Peart, the drummer with the band Rush, once said, “extrovert, primal and inventive.” Baker, Peart added, “set the bar for what rock drumming could be.”
But Baker, who got his start in jazz combos and cited the likes of Max Roach and Elvin Jones as influences, bristled when the word “rock” was applied to his playing. “I’m a jazz drummer,” he told the British newspaper The Telegraph in 2013. “You have to swing. There are hardly any rock drummers I know who can do that.”
Baker’s appearance behind the drum kit — flaming red hair, flailing arms, eyes bulging with enthusiasm or shut tight in concentration — made an indelible impression. So, unfortunately, did his well-publicized drug problems and his volatile personality.
Baker, who by his own count quit heroin 29 times, was candid about his drug and alcohol abuse in his autobiography, “Hellraiser,” published in Britain in 2009.
He recalled driving from Los Angeles to San Francisco while on tour with the band Blind Faith in 1969 and being more amused than surprised when he heard a report on the radio that he had died from a heroin overdose.
Of a later tour, he wrote, “In 1983-84, I formed the Ginger Baker Trio with guitarist John Simms and bassist Ian Macdonald and we did a tour that included Malta, Spain and Germany; but I can’t remember anything about it due to the fact that I was drinking so heavily.”
He was also, by all accounts, not a very likable man. Journalists who interviewed him tended to find him uncooperative at best, confrontational at worst. The hostility between Baker and Bruce, which sometimes led to onstage altercations, was the stuff of rock legend. The 2012 documentary “Beware of Mr. Baker” — the title taken from a sign outside the house in South Africa where he was living at the time — begins with footage of Baker physically attacking the film’s director, Jay Bulger.
“If they’ve got a problem with me, come and see me and punch me on the nose,”Baker said in that film. “I ain’t going to sue you; I’m going to hit you back.”
But if he was difficult to deal with, his talent was impossible to ignore. As A.O. Scott of The New York Times noted in his review of “Beware of Mr. Baker,” Baker’s music was ultimately “the only reason anyone should take an interest in him.”
Peter Edward Baker — he became known as Ginger during childhood because of his red hair — was born on Aug. 19, 1939, in the Lewisham area of southeast London, to Frederick and Ruby (Bayldon) Baker. His father, a bricklayer, was killed in action during World War II.
Drawn to the drums at an early age, Baker talked his way into a job with a traditional-jazz combo when he was 16 despite his lack of professional experience. Before long, he was well established on the London jazz scene. He also had a heroin habit that would dog him for decades.
In 1962 Baker joined Blues Incorporated, one of the earliest British rhythm-and-blues bands, beginning his contentious but musically rewarding association with Bruce. When organist and saxophonist Graham Bond left that band in 1964 to form his own group, the Graham Bond Organisation, Baker and Bruce went with him.
Two years later they teamed with Clapton, whose work with The Yardbirds and John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers had made him one of Britain’s most celebrated guitarists, to form Cream.
Performing a repertoire that mixed original compositions with radical reinterpretations of old blues songs, Cream was an instant sensation. Within two years, the band went from nightclubs to stadiums and released four albums, whose total sales were estimated at $35 million. But in 1968, at the height of its success, Cream disbanded.
One reason for the breakup was the continuing animosity between Baker and Bruce. Another, Baker later said, was the extreme volume at which Clapton and Bruce played.
“For the first 18 months it was great,” he said in 2013. “But things got too bloody big and too bloody loud. They kept piling these huge Marshall speakers one on top of another. That’s why my hearing’s wrecked.”
Baker’s next band was, on paper, even bigger than Cream: Blind Faith, in which he and Clapton joined forces with singer, keyboardist and guitarist Steve Winwood, known for his work with the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic. (The less famous Ric Grech was the bassist.) Hopes were high, but Blind Faith imploded after one album and one tour, the victim of excessive hype and conflicting egos.
Following the similarly brief life of his next band, Ginger Baker’s Air Force, a jazz-rock outfit with a saxophone section, Baker led a peripatetic life and stayed largely out of the spotlight.
He spent much of the 1970s in Lagos, Nigeria, where he built a recording studio and became immersed in African music, performing and recording with singer, songwriter and political activist Fela Kuti. He also developed a love for polo that over the years would prove almost as costly as his drug habit: He drove himself into debt more than once buying and importing polo ponies.
In the ensuing decades he was in and out of various bands, ranging from the hard-rock group Masters of Reality to a jazz trio in which his high-profile sidemen were guitarist Bill Frisell and bassist Charlie Haden. He was also in and out of financial trouble and moved frequently, living in England, Italy, LA and South Africa, where he settled in 1999 and stayed until returning to England in 2012.
Baker and the other members of Cream were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. The band reunited for concerts in London and New York in 2005 and received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2006.
Whatever hope there might have been for another reunion ended when Jack Bruce died in 2014.
Baker was married four times. He is survived by his wife, Kudzai Baker, a nurse from Zimbabwe with whom he lived in Kent, England, and three children: Nettie Baker, who has written several books about her relationship with him; Leda Baker, a business analyst; and Kofi Baker, a drummer. All were born in the 1960s during Baker’s first marriage to artist Liz Finch.
In 2013, although he had serious health problems, Baker toured and recorded with a quartet whimsically named the Ginger Baker Jazz Confusion. Interviewed that year on the BBC television program “Newsnight,” he claimed to have “lost everything six or seven times in my life” and suggested that the motivation for his return to music was more financial than artistic.
“I thought I’d retired,” he said. “Managed to sort of outlive my pension, as it were, so I had to go back to work.”
Asked in that same interview how he would like to be remembered, he paused for a moment and then gave a one-word answer:
“Drummer.”

PowerPoint's productivity problem The slides might make your team dumber

Texto completo: Most business tools can be used either well or badly.
Email can speed interoffice communications, or it can overwhelm with too much information. Spreadsheets can make calculations easier or they can be riddled with hard-to-find errors. Word processing can create attractive, easy-to-read documents or, well, Comic Sans.
When used well, such tools make an organization smarter, more creative, and able to make better decisions. When used poorly, they do the opposite. The classic misuse of email, SPAM, for example, creates visual and mental noise.
Most productivity tools have these two sides. But PowerPoint is different. When used poorly, PowerPoint makes an organization dumb. When used well, PowerPoint makes that organization even dumber. Let me explain.
(Note: by "PowerPoint" I mean the Microsoft product and its clones.)
Every description of PowerPoint best practices suggests using PowerPoint to make your presentation more vivid, alive and entertaining. A common way to do this is to animate your graphs, so that the bars grow into their final position, right before your audience's eyes. Cool, eh?
Well, it turns out that animated graphs lead to bad decision-making. Robert Cialdini, professor emeritus of psychology and marketing at Arizona State University, and author of the classic business bestseller "Influence: the Psychology of Persuasion" (www.influenceatwork.com), showed three groups of people performance statistics for a fictional high-school football player named Andrew. He then asked each group to rate Andrew, as a player, from one to seven.
The first group received a hard-copy table of statistics, the second group got a hard-copy of a bar graph, and the third group were shown a PowerPoint presentation with animated graphs. The first two groups rated Andrew a 4.5 and five respectively. The group that saw the animated graphs rated the Andrew a six.
Cialdini repeated the experiment using sports fans who were more experienced at understanding such statistics. The first two groups came up with the same number. The group shown the animated graphs rated Andrew as high as the novices had done, as a six.
In other words, this "best practices" PowerPoint technique fooled even experts into giving a higher rating. As the New Yorker summarized, "PowerPoint seems to be a way for organizations to turn expensive, expert decision-makers into novice decision-makers."
A similar study of PowerPoint usage at the University of Houston that was published in "Computers & Education" found that "students performed worse on quizzes when PowerPoint presentations included non-text items such as pictures and sound effects."
Another study at Purdue University, also published in "Computers & Education" found that "students retained 15% less information delivered verbally by the lecturer during PowerPoint presentations."
Yet another study, this one from Harvard, showed that having words on a screen while you're talking has no effect, positive or negative, on comprehension or retention, rendering your efforts to create the presentation completely wasted.
Are you seeing the pattern here? PowerPoint isn't helping, regardless of how it's used. So what gives?
The root problem with PowerPoint is the way it encourages you to think, says Edward Tufte, an expert on information design. According to a New York Times article summarizing Tufte:
"Microsoft's ubiquitous software forces people to mutilate data beyond comprehension. For example, the low resolution of a PowerPoint slide means that it usually contains only about 40 words, or barely eight seconds of reading. PowerPoint also encourages users to rely on bulleted lists, a 'faux analytical' technique... that dodges the speaker's responsibility to tie his information together."
Or as Tufte himself put it: "PowerPoint induces stupidity, turns everyone into bores, wastes time, and downgrades the quality and credibility of communication."
In other words, PowerPoint makes your organization dumber.
That's why, incidentally, PowerPoint is so excellent as a sales tool (as opposed to a productivity tool.) PowerPoint dumbs the customer down, making them more likely to make a buying decision based on bells and whistles rather than actual information.
The alternative
If you want your organization to get smarter rather than dumber, here's what you do:
*Ban PowerPoint from your workplace. That's for all internal meetings but especially when people from outside your organization are trying to sell you something.
*Start every meeting with a group reading. Prepare a short document summarizing the issues, providing some analysis, and defining the decision on the table.
*Writing a briefing document (as opposed to slapping down bullet points) forces people in your organization to think their ideas through, before expending everyone else's time on them. It also makes your meetings shorter and more to-the-point.
That strategy comes, BTW, from Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos. So if you're still clinging to PowerPoint, you might consider that maybe Jeff Bezos knows more than you when it comes to making an organization smarter.

Texto completo: There’s no way that Mike Pompeo actually venerates Donald Trump. I doubt he even likes the president much.
Pompeo graduated first in his class at West Point decades ago, a feat that suggests enormous reserves of discipline, a profound respect for tradition and a talent for self-effacement when the circumstances warrant it. Trump possesses none of those qualities.
Pompeo is an evangelical Christian, steeped in the very dictums that Trump has spent a lifetime mocking with both his words and his deeds. And Pompeo has long believed in the importance of American military intervention abroad, the kind of activist role that Trump railed against during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
In fact Pompeo, who was then a congressman from Kansas, supported Marco Rubio — and publicly praised him, while disparaging Trump, just before the state’s Republican caucus in March 2016. As Susan Glasser of The New Yorker recalled in an excellent recent profile of Pompeo, he sounded an alarm that Trump would be “an authoritarian president who ignored our Constitution.” He urged Republicans to come to their senses and resist the lure of the surging Trump campaign. “It’s time,” he said, “to turn down the lights on the circus.”
But the lights continued to burn bright, so Pompeo just put on a clown suit, put away his ethics and finagled a big role under the Big Top.
He had plenty of company in that transformation. It’s the wonder of the Trump era and one of the saddest, scariest themes of the impeachment inquiry so far: the teeming crowd of sellouts and suck-ups who eagerly traded principle for position and are in some cases doubling and tripling down on that transaction, to a point where it’s fair to ask if there was ever much principle to begin with.
I’m looking at you, Lindsey Graham, who somehow decided that Trump was the new John McCain, which is like deeming tripe the new tenderloin. Hell, I’m looking at most of the Republicans in the Senate. I’m not so much looking at Attorney General William Barr, odious as his behavior has been, because it’s clear in retrospect that he never made much of a pretense of rectitude, at least not in the context of Trump. He also wasn’t on record trashing Trump, not the way Pompeo and Graham and so many others who now dutifully echo him and gaze beatifically at him were. They must have broken necks from their moral whiplash. Barr’s neck supports that big head of his just fine.
Pompeo, who first signed on as Trump’s CIA director and then flattered his way to secretary of state, is a paragon of these lackeys-come-lately, and he’s especially vivid proof of how easily and completely the lure of power can overwhelm any call to conscience.
He raised his hand for secretary of state after he’d seen his predecessor, Rex Tillerson, humiliated by Trump and fired by tweet. This was more than a year into Trump’s presidency, by which point the rationalizations of other supposedly serious conservatives who took top administration jobs no longer held water. It was clear that Trump wasn’t just a few artful nudges away from proper presidential bearing. He couldn’t be lifted up because he was too busy cruelly dragging everyone else down.
But Pompeo had a heady shot at a vaunted job that almost surely wasn’t going to come his way any other time. So he lunged for it, then demonstrated with his obsequiousness that doing good and doing right were never high on the agenda.
He wrote an op-ed article that essentially broke with his fellow Republicans to promote Trump’s view that Saudi Arabia’s butchery of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi shouldn’t give anyone pause. What are a few severed body parts among allies?
He recalled the ambassador to Ukraine just to please the president and his babbling Beelzebub, Rudy Giuliani. He listened mutely to that July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, decided to ignore what he heard and then claimed — until a few days ago — that he was utterly in the dark about any pressure on Ukraine to kneecap Joe Biden.
Had he spoken up or pushed back, he would have risked ending up on the outside, among the swelling Trump administration diaspora. He preferred the inside, with its glossier trappings and cushier thrones. He and his wife were diplomatic royalty, jetting around the world. He could bear the ache of a tongue full of tooth marks. Better to be a wretched part of history than no part at all.
The tale sounds familiar because it is. It’s the story of Faust, who sold his soul for renown, then endured the ugliness of that deal. It’s also the story of too many of Trump’s Republican enablers to count. Sure, many of them decided to prop and pretty him up, a man whose unfitness for the Oval Office was never really in doubt, out of tribal loyalty, a force far too potent in American politics today. But some rushed to him because that’s where the riches were, at least metaphorically. That’s where the fame was.
And they weren’t simply burying the hatchet with a politician who hadn’t been their preferred candidate or whose positions differed from theirs only slightly. They were dismantling the chain saw that they’d wielded in the face of a fraud whose conduct, along with some of his proposals, was antithetical to who they claimed to be.
Few people remember anymore, but just years before she became the dark empress of “alternative facts,” Kellyanne Conway was a respected, reasonably mainstream, uncontroversial Republican pollster and strategist. Just months before she joined Team Trump, she correctly labeled him “vulgar,” said that he wasn’t presidential, called him a liar and demanded his tax returns. Then he offered her the lofty job of managing his presidential campaign — and all the television airtime that came with it — and she turned herself into a kowtowing cartoon. She’ll never be seen the same way again. Was the ride really worth it?
And what was Mick Mulvaney thinking when he agreed to be Trump’s third chief of staff, having witnessed the tortures of chiefs Nos. 1 and 2? Before Trump was elected, Mulvaney called him and Hillary Clinton “two of the most flawed human beings running for president in the history of the country,” and lest you think Trump was merely collateral damage in her disparagement, Mulvaney separately called Trump “a terrible human being.” Now he calls him boss. Amazing how revulsion crumbles when relevance is in the equation.
Graham was oddly and briefly honest about this in an interview with The Times’ Mark Leibovich, framing his kinship with Trump, whom he once called “the world’s biggest jackass,” as part of his career-long quest “to try to be relevant.” This quest now involves the insistence that Trump, rather than abusing the presidency to dig up imagined dirt on a political rival, is the victim of some setup.
You can hear Graham’s version as predictably loopy illogic from a senator up for reelection next year in the deep-red state of South Carolina, but it’s more than that. It’s the fee for being able to get the president on the phone, for being invited to play golf with him, for feeling the rush of access, for getting to crow about your perch at the epicenter of the action. He and Pompeo will have insider anecdotes to last the rest of their lives. They’ll need just as long to convince themselves that they didn’t overpay.

Texto completo: Washington • Forget it, America. It’s Chinatown.
Washington, once the guarantor of American values, is a crime scene. This capital of white marble is now encircled by yellow tape, rife with mendacity, cowardice and corruption. It’s Chinatown on the Potomac.
Robert Towne, screenwriter of the 1974 classic “Chinatown,” wrote the movie as a eulogy to great things that were lost. He said that he was not conjuring a place on a map but a state of mind: the futility of good intentions.
Or, as Raymond Chandler, the premier chronicler of Los Angeles noir, once wrote: “We still have dreams, but we know now that most of them will come to nothing. And we also most fortunately know that it really doesn’t matter.”
“Chinatown” was set in 1937, right before the war. Like Jack Nicholson’s Jake Gittes, America was naive about the forces of real corruption, real evil.
Towne wrote the movie in the early ’70s, in the dark years of Vietnam, Watergate and Richard Nixon’s doomed second term. Roman Polanski directed it a few years after his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was butchered by the Manson family.
In his latest fascinating dive into Hollywood, “The Big Goodbye,” Sam Wasson dissects “Chinatown.” “What makes Chinatown so uniquely disturbing as an American metaphor is that it is so unlike the whiteness of Ahab’s whale or the greenness of Gatsby’s light,” he writes in the forthcoming book. “However illusory, these are totems of aspiration, of possibility.”
He says that “Chinatown,” by contrast, is black: It’s about terrible truths you can’t undo, about a cynical world where you can’t beat the house and money wins, where you think you’ve got it figured out and then you realize you’re dead.
Sound familiar?
The movie is a good metaphor for the Trump era, when you hope that this grotesquerie is an aberration but you worry that the bad guys have already won.
Even if Donald Trump is impeached, we know now that the Russians have figured out how to rig our elections — and our dictator-loving president doesn’t seem too disturbed about that.
What makes the metaphor so powerful is its unAmericanness. In democracy, we supposedly have the power. But in Chinatown, there’s nothing you can do. Forget it, Jake. It’s an oligarchy.
Is the impeachment inquiry the false hope, the cocky detective?
This was the week that made it glaringly clear that the president put his fragile ego, idiotic conspiracy theories and political prospects ahead of U.S. national security interests. But watching Mike Pence and Marco Rubio and the red firewall of Republican lawmakers pervert principles to protect Donald Trump elicits dread that there will be more lawlessness.
As John Huston’s Noah Cross says when Jake confronts him over his turpitude: “Most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place they are capable of … anything.”
In this desolate scenario, is Nancy Pelosi Jake?
Not really. The speaker is anything but naive. She is well aware that Mitch McConnell — an icy film noir villain if there ever was one — will snuff out any threat that Trump will be ousted. (And don’t forget, as the House demands documents from the vice president in the impeachment inquiry, if Trump and Pence have to go, we’ll have our first Madam President.)
Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio predicted that being in the White House would distill Trump to his essence. And his essence, D’Antonio says, is a dark swirl of cruelty, violence and fear. That is on disturbing display in “Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration,” the new book by New York Times reporters Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.
“Privately,” they wrote in an adaptation of the book in The Times, “the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him.”
The sordid moment where we find ourselves is at once stunning and ineluctable: the House move to impeachment, Trump’s lunatic denials about his blatant transgressions and his even more lunatic bouts of self-incrimination.
Nothing good was going to happen when the spoiled attention addict was put in a position to demand the attention — and favors — of the whole world, or else.
As The Times’ Maggie Haberman pointed out: “He has led a consequence-free life despite enormously self-destructive behaviors over time. The divorces were marriages he wanted out of. The bankruptcies impacted his lenders most, not him. All of his behavior in 2016 ended with him winning the presidency. And the Mueller obstruction inquiry ended with no definitive answer.”
D’Antonio says Trump is “a man making his own nightmare come to pass. His performance with the Finnish president was a florid demonstration of his inner self. Enraged and irrational, he was incapable of hiding his contempt, which is ever-present, and heedless of his effect on others.
“Trump doesn’t know that people who don’t confront their demons are destined to be confronted by them.”
And what is a better description of a film noir spiral than that?

Texto completo: You may, if you are old enough, recall a TV actor named Foster Brooks.
He was a guest star on such classics of boomer kitsch as "The Monkees," "The Munsters" and "The Mod Squad." But if you do remember him, it's likely for one thing only: his imitation of inebriation. Brooks made his slurring, stammering "funny drunk act" a TV staple, back when drunks were still considered, well, funny.
To recall his career is to marvel at what a difference a generation or two makes.
That era produced another TV trope that, in hindsight, seems equally bizarre: the funny sexual harasser. A hundred times, you saw it: the lecherous boss chasing the nubile secretary around the desk. A hundred times, it didn't register as anything but a joke.
And again, the memory makes you marvel at how the times, they have changed.
In their new book, "She Said," Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, The New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment story, remind us that early October contains three anniversaries, each a milestone of the progress we have - and have not - made in learning to take sexual assault seriously.
October 7, 2016: The Washington Post releases the now-infamous "Access Hollywood" video where presidential candidate Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. "And when you're a star, they let you do it," he says. "Grab them by the p---y. You can do anything."
October 5, 2018: The Senate advances the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite a credible allegation that, as a drunken teenager, he attempted to rape a then-classmate, research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford.
Between those two dates - October 5, 2017 - The Times published its report on the film producer Weinstein and his alleged assaults on women in his professional circle, including the actor Ashley Judd. Later, Gwyneth Paltrow and Annabella Sciorra would also number themselves among the accusers.
The story opened a floodgate. By the time the wave of accusations crested, it had splashed dozens of famous men: Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Mario Batali, Louis C.K., George H.W. Bush and Al Franken among them. Once-silent women found their voices under a hashtag - #MeToo.
"She Said" recounts the journalistic detective work that led to the breakthrough. It's a compelling story that leaves one pleased to see the good guys - the good "gals," really - get a win. But let us be clear on the limitations of that win. Indeed, the convergence of those anniversaries speaks eloquently to America's ongoing irresolution on matters of sexual harassment and assault. Sure, Weinstein is facing charges, but Kavanaugh went to the Supreme Court, and Trump, to the White House.
Still, the story Twohey and Kantor broke changed gender politics. Predictably, there came a backlash, increasing numbers of male managers reportedly refusing to mentor female subordinates. That would seem to open them to civil sanctions. It will be fun to watch one of them try to defend his sexism in court, perhaps before a judge with lady parts.
Elsewhere, folks just want to know, where is the line? Is it allowed to tell a co-worker you find her attractive? Can you share - or laugh at - a bawdy joke? "So much was suddenly open to question," write Kantor and Twohey.
And it is. And that is surely frustrating and difficult.
On the other hand, some of us remember when the boss chased the secretary while the laugh track howled. We thought nothing of it. Now people are wondering what's acceptable?
Maybe that's not the worst thing in the world.

A DEVELOPING PROBLEM?

Texto completo: The Knicks are facing another season of player development, but unlike last season, when a trio of rookies were handed the ball and left to find their way, there are no assurances that the development will take place during the actual games this season.
Knicks coach David Fizdale has been handed an awkward job this time around. He is tasked with developing the young players on the roster - rookie RJ Barrett, second-year players Kevin Knox, Mitchell Robinson and Allonzo Trier and maybe even former lottery pick Frank Ntilikina. But unlike last season, when there was very little public grumbling over playing time - other than Enes Kanter's nightly news briefing -- the roster has been stocked with a group of established veterans who will expect to get their minutes.
They're not stars, but they are a group of players unlike last season's reclamation projects. They have accomplished something in the league, and with only one-year guarantees on their contracts, they will be looking to play and put up numbers.
So can Fizdale accomplish both things this season? Can he utilize the veterans to follow the orders from the front office of winning games and showing a grown-up culture? And can the young players still be developed if their minutes drop? 
"At the end of the day, development should always be happening," Fizdale said. "But I do feel like this group is more ready to win a little more than last year. We're challenging them to go out and win every game they'll be playing. Through competition and fighting for your minutes and your spot, you will develop."
It's not as though Knox and Robinson and Barrett won't play. But Knox was handed the ball last season. Robinson was allowed to play through his foul trouble and mistakes. This season those minutes for Knox might belong to Marcus Morris. Robinson might lose minutes to Julius Randle or Bobby Portis. 
Asked if Knox and Robinson could see their minutes drop, Fizdale said, "That's going to be dependent on them."
But if they do, Fizdale said that doesn't mean the development will stop, adding, "Absolutely. You're fighting for your minutes in practice against talented players, we're still going to need those guys to win games. They're going to have to play well to help us win games. Their minutes will be determined on performance."
"Yeah, you can definitely develop if you're not playing as much," Knox said. "There's a lot of guys in the league that start off when they first come and don't play much at all, and then they become superstars. Stay in the gym, stay confident in yourself, working on your game in the summer, learning the offense, practice. There's a lot of guys in the league that I can name that start off not really doing much but just progress and keep developing to great superstars."
Knox started 57 games as a 19-year-old rookie last season, averaging nearly 30 minutes per game. Portis, who got a $15 million deal from the Knicks for this season, pointed out that he had to wait his turn as a rookie in Chicago. He sat out 20 of the first 24 games and started only four games all season in 2015-16.
"It was great for me having real vets around that all of them had years in the league, had been to the playoffs, had accolades," Portis said. "They were already established. Pau Gasol, obviously a two-time champion. Joakim Noah, he was a defensive player of the year. Taj Gibson, he was a great sixth man for the Bulls. So I had great veterans in front of me that really showed me the ropes, showed me how to be a good pro.
"I'm really grateful for that opportunity to have those guys. I think without those guys I wouldn't know how to do things the correct way. All those guys are real true professionals. They come in early, leave late. They showed me how to get treatments, how to keep my body up, all that. I think me going through those trials my rookie year, having to sit out the first 14, 15 games, I think that really helped build my career."
The NBA's gamble
The NBA announced this past week that the league has partnered with William Hill, the sportsbook operators. It should not come as a surprise. In 2014, NBA commissioner Adam Silver penned an op-ed in The New York Times making the case for legal gambling and has not let up in his belief that gambling is happening whether it's legal or not - and that there was plenty of money to be made by the league in expressing that reality.
While this may seem like a sensitive subject for a league that still stings from the Tim Donaghy game-fixing story from more than a decade ago, the NBA has pushed for ways to maintain the integrity of the game. That's something that Silver called for in his op-ed five years ago and something that the official league statement concluded with last week, noting, "Throughout the partnership, William Hill and the NBA will collaborate on best-in-class practices to protect the integrity of NBA games."
William Hill joins MGM Resorts, FanDuel and The Stars Group as official partners and is expected to be the first on-site sports book with the Washington Wizards coming to an agreement to open one later this season.
Brooklyn roots
While Brooklyn might be a dirty word around the Knicks' camp right now after the Nets landed the star free agents whom the Knicks were targeting, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, there was a bit of Brooklyn in the house last week with the appearance of Bernard King.
King visited to offer some advice to the young Knicks players, including Barrett and Knox. He also spent some time with Taj Gibson, who had never met King in person despite growing up in the same housing project and attending the same elementary school.
"We lived in the Fort Greene houses on Myrtle Avenue," Gibson said. "I was telling him it was good to finally meet him. He's a legend. You hear about him growing up, but I never got a chance to meet him. To be put in the same category as him being from Fort Greene and getting a chance to meet him was awesome.
"He lived on the other side from me. There's different parts of Fort Greene, three different sides to the housing [project]. And we're very competitive and we tried to build off of what he and his brother [Albert] left behind. They built a good rep and the kids tried to represent it the same way."
Gibson opted for 67 as his jersey number this season - a salute to P.S. 67, where both

Texto completo: In her new social history, “No Stopping Us Now: The Adventures of Older Women in American History," New York Times columnist Gail Collins explores how the ever-changing concept of age has affected women, for better or worse, from colonial times on. Collins was the paper's first female editorial page editor and currently writes a twice-weekly column. She speaks at 6 p.m. Thursday, October 17, at the Brattle Theatre. Tickets for that event, sponsored by the Harvard Book Store, are $6 or $32 with a book. She also speaks at 2 p.m. Friday, October 18, at the American Ancestors and New England Historic Genealogical Society at 99-101 Newbury St. Tickets are $32 and include a book.
BOOKS: What are you reading?
COLLINS: I just started “History of the Rain" by the Irish novelist Niall Williams. The first chapter is engrossing. Before that I read “The Many Lives of Michael Bloomberg," by Eleanor Randolph, a friend of mine. I love books about how cities run.
BOOKS: What are some of your favorite books about cities?
COLLINS: When I was first in New York working, I still lived in Connecticut so I would be on the train every weekend. I read “The Power Broker" by Robert A. Caro on those trips. I had never read anything like that. I've scooped up everything he's written since.
BOOKS: Do you like to read about American presidents?
COLLINS: Yes. Michael Beschloss is my mentor in all things presidential. When his last book, “Presidents of War," came out we appeared at a library together. We were the only two people who could spend an hour talking about how much we hated President James Polk. I also love Sarah Vowell. Her “The Assassination Vacation" knocked me out. She went to the sites of the assassinated presidents.
BOOKS: What did you read for research for your own book that you would recommend?
COLLINS: Lois Banner's “In Full Flower: Aging Women, Power and Sexuality" and Janann Sherman's “No Place for a Woman," a biography of Margaret Chase Smith.
BOOKS: Did you read novels while you were working on your book?
COLLINS: I wish I had. In my youth I always read novels, never nonfiction. I read Charles Dickens like a maniac. I have this love of “Nicholas Nickleby" that isn't rational. If I had to go with one though it would be “Bleak House." It so resonates.
BOOKS: Do you look for humor in your reading?
COLLINS: No, but one of my favorite people to read forever was Nora Ephron. Oh my god, I never realized how much I hated blow drying my hair until I read “I Feel Bad About my Neck." She started a book club that I was amazingly allowed to join. The first book we read was Doris Lessings's “The Golden Notebook," which we had all loved as young women. Then we hated it. What the hell?
BOOKS: What else do you like to read?
COLLINS: I have so many friends who write books that I spend a lot of time reading those. I've also been reading “Murder Off the Page," by Con Lehane, another friend of mine. He writes murder mysteries related to the 42nd Street Library. We went to college together at Marquette University in the '60s. We invited Allen Ginsberg to read his poetry and then the administration told us we couldn't have him. I spent my senior year marching around for freedom of speech, and it was the best time of my life.
BOOKS: Did joining the Times editorial page inspire any reading?
COLLINS: Howell Raines, who was the executive editor then, gave me a bunch of books by southern authors, but I can't remember the names. He wrote a book about fly-fishing, “Fly Fishing Through the Midlife Crisis," which I enjoyed but that would be the only book I would ever read about fly-fishing.
BOOKS: Has the Trump presidency inspired any reading?
COLLINS: I read “Trump: The Art of the Deal" back in the day. On my wall I have copy of a column I wrote about Donald Trump in 1992. He sent me a copy of the column with my photo and wrote on it “The face of the pig. No wonder you are so angry. I would be to." He misspelled “too." He used a Sharpie. It's exactly the Donald Trump we have come to know.

Texto completo: During the harshest months of Minnesota's long, dark winters, when it takes only a few moments for your eyes to start watering and your cheeks to begin stinging, I give up my outdoor hobbies and get creative about exercising indoors. Sometimes that means hopping on a stationary bike. But more and more I find myself turning to an entirely different landscape: virtual reality.
Pulling a ski-mask-like VR headset over your eyes drops you into a virtual world where you can watch movies, play games, and, yes, exercise. Sensors track the location of your hands, body, and head while you smash opponents as Adonis Creed in "Creed: Rise to Glory." Other apps let you dance, bike, do yoga, and meditate.
On sites like Reddit, praise abounds on the mental and physical benefits of exercising in virtual reality, often from people who had trouble making other exercise habits last. One of those VR enthusiasts, Robert Long, of Maryland, said he used VR games to improve his health and to lose more than 100 pounds, after years of managing pain resulting from two car accidents. There are many factors that contribute to weight loss, but Mr. Long's before and after pictures have generated discussions about health in forums that are usually dedicated to sedentary entertainment.
"Most people never stick to a workout, because it's not fun, and you are well aware it's a workout," said Long. "But VR has the ability to trick the mind into thinking it's a game and not exercise."
Marialice Kern, chair of the Department of Kinesiology at San Francisco State University, describes VR as an alternative form of exercise. S.F.S.U.'s wellness center offers VR fitness classes three times a week, alongside more traditional recreation options like intramural sports and a climbing wall.
"There are certain people who don't like to exercise, whether that's hiking or biking. But they love to play video games," Dr. Kern says. "Why not get both?"
While you might remember getting sweaty hopping around a "Dance Dance Revolution" pad or hula hooping in "Wii Fit," a VR headset's ability to block out the real world makes it even easier to get lost in the flow of exercise disguised as a game. Virtual reality is still niche, but a growing crop of VR games with a fitness element could inspire people to pick up a headset for the first time. Here's what to know before you get started.
Get a good headset
Whether you want to start exercising at home or you're looking to augment an existing workout routine with aerobic activity, consider getting a virtual reality headset. As a tech reviewer for Wirecutter, a product review company owned by The New York Times, I've tested dozens of VR headsets and think the $ 400 Oculus Quest is the first one that could have mass appeal. It costs about the same as a cheaper stationary bike or treadmill.
I like the Quest for workouts because it's powerful enough for most active games and also cordless, so you won't trip on any cables. I recommend trying one before buying so that it doesn't wind up with other abandoned workout gear. Oculus, which is owned by Facebook, publishes a page where you can search for local demo spots. Once you bring the headset home, don't forget to clear furniture and other obstacles out of the way. You're going to need at least a few feet of space in every direction.
Find the right games
Mr. Long and I share the same obsession: a game called "Beat Saber," which tasks you with swinging lightsabers through a series of blocks that are flying through the air. Usually set to electronic music, the levels have the same frenetic, beat-centered activity of the classic console games "Dance Dance Revolution" and "Guitar Hero." The first time I played, it took only a few songs of slashing and ducking before I realized I was sweating -- a lot.
Dr. Kern's lab measures how much energy people expend playing VR games for the Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise. The institute likens working out with "Beat Saber" to playing tennis, and it estimates that players burn 6 to 8 calories per minute. Boxing games, which involve lots of quick jabs and hops, dominate the top categories. They usually burn between 6 and 10 calories a minute.
To pick your first game, find a game description that appeals to you and then check its activity level on the VR Institute's website. Games that let you play through (and repeat) short levels give you more control over your level and length of activity. I find that whatever game you choose, the key is to commit. It's easy to pass "Beat Saber" levels by moving as little as possible. But if you commit to dramatic lightsaber swings and leaping around the room to avoid objects instead of simply leaning, you'll see faster results (and higher scores).
Fun matters
While boxing games are one of the fastest ways to burn calories, I still turn to "Beat Saber" for a quick workout. "Creed: Rise to Glory" just doesn't hold my attention the way slicing and dicing blocks does.
Matthew Farrow, a health researcher at the University of Bath in the UK, conducted one of several studies that show enjoyment and intensity of exercise increase when someone is playing a game in VR. The game used in Mr. Farrow's study challenged players to cycle along a road while avoiding trucks and police cars. The game also placed a "ghost" version of the player in the game that indicated their previous performance, allowing them to race against themselves. The study found that players worked 9 percent harder, without their motivation decreasing.
"People need to remember to try and make their exercise fun and not a daily chore," Mr. Farrow said. "This is one of the reasons why using virtual-reality games to increase exercise enjoyment is so effective. Games also offer the opportunity to set, monitor, and achieve exercise goals, which helps maintain exercise motivation."
If you're just starting to get moving, the key is to pick an exercise that can become a routine. Worry less about how many calories you are burning per minute and more about what you enjoy enough to keep doing.
Add accessories
If you're serious about getting a full workout in VR, a few accessories can help. Aaron Garcia, an American College of Sports Medicine certified trainer and coach based in the Los Angeles area, says a fitness tracker (Wirecutter has a few recommendations) can help make sure you're increasing your heart rate enough to get an effective workout. It will also give you a more reliable calorie count. Dr. Kern noted that her lab sometimes finds the built-in calorie trackers in VR games to be inaccurate.
Additionally, a weight vest or ankle weights can make VR workouts more challenging and introduce a weight-training element. Mr. Garcia recommends treating VR as just one element in a well-rounded workout regimen. Pilates, yoga, and weight training are all complementary to VR. Many of his clients join him for weight training several times a week, and then they exercise on their own at home with tools like VR.
I recommend one more accessory: disposable masks. The VR headset I use has a foam face pad, and it quickly becomes soaked with sweat. It's gross, especially considering how many friends and co-workers borrow my headset each month. A hygienic mask cuts down on the ick factor dramatically.
Mr. Garcia emphasized that no matter how you choose to exercise, you should listen to your body. If you're sore, stop. Don't push through an activity to the point of injury just because you're having fun.
"I think VR is going to be awesome," Mr. Garcia said. "For people who are sedentary, just to start doing something is so awesome. It just depends on how far you want to go with it."

Texto completo: With an admired tone, he excelled at the heart of the classical repertory and was, with more than 200 discs, one of the most-recorded pianists.
Paul Badura-Skoda, an Austrian pianist who was known for insightful interpretations of classical era repertory and who had one of largest discographies of any major pianist, more than 200 recordings, died on Sept. 25 in Vienna. He was 91.
His death was confirmed by his partner, Elisabeth Vilatte.
Though not a formidable technician, Mr. Badura-Skoda was admired for refined and elegant performances, especially of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. He was praised for the singing tone he drew from the piano, a quality he attributed to the influence of Edwin Fischer, the great Swiss pianist.
In a 1978 interview with The New York Times, he described Fischer as the "shining example" of a great pianist who could produce "the most gorgeous, powerful sounds" -- and yet who taught his students that "the piano sound deteriorates when you go above a certain dynamic level."
Though associated with the classical period masters, Mr. Badura-Skoda actually had an extensive repertory, including works by Chopin, Scriabin, Rimsky-Korsakov, Hindemith and the Swiss composer Frank Martin. Martin wrote his Second Piano Concerto, completed in 1969, for Mr. Badura-Skoda, who took the work on tour.
He grew up believing in the superiority of the modern piano over period instruments promoted by exponents of the authentic performance movement. He maintained a "prejudice," as he said in a 2017 interview with the critic Laurence Vittes in Early Music America, that "old instruments were good for museums -- or worse: to be used as heating material for your room in winter."
That prejudice was shattered when, in his early 20s, he heard the Austrian harpsichordist and fortepianist Isolde Ahlgrimm perform, including in intimate concerts at her home. Her playing revealed to him, he said, the "beauty and originality" of these instruments.
He began buying fortepianos and early 19th-century pianos, his collection growing so large that he had to acquire a house next to his in Vienna to maintain them. He is thought to be the only pianist to have recorded complete surveys of the Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert piano sonatas on both period and modern pianos. His refined approach to playing allowed him to adjust to the lighter keyboard action and gentler yet pinging sound of fortepianos.
Paul Badura was born in Vienna on Oct. 6, 1927. His father, an engineer, died when Paul was 4 months old. After his mother married Anton Skoda, a furniture dealer, he added his stepfather's surname to his own.
He began piano lessons at 6 and developed a lively curiosity about all kinds of music. He played his own transcriptions of Rossini overtures on the accordion, his stepfather's passion. He went to concerts as often as possible. He would sneak into the standing-room section of the Vienna State Opera through an obscure entry he discovered.
Though drawn to mathematics and physics, he decided on a career in music around the age of 14, when he heard Fischer perform. He wanted to enter Vienna's academy of music, he recalled, but by then, with World War II underway, the occupying Nazi government took steps to draft him into a labor corps. His stepfather intervened, however, falsely telling the head of the academy that a letter of recommendation from Hermann Göring was coming any day. In any case, Paul ended up on far-less onerous duty with a farmworker corps near Vienna, where he was able to study musical scores.
From 1945 to 1949 he studied at the Vienna Conservatory, graduating with distinction in both piano and conducting. Afterward he took master classes with Fischer in Lucerne, Switzerland, and continued to work with him for a decade.
Mr. Badura-Skoda's international career was set in motion in 1949, when, at 22, he was chosen by the eminent conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler to perform Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 22 with the Vienna Philharmonic. That engagement was followed by another invitation to perform with the orchestra, this time with Herbert von Karajan conducting.
Mr. Badura-Skoda was already well known from numerous recordings on the then-popular and affordable Westminster label when he made his New York debut in 1953 at Town Hall, attracting a full house. Though he complained about the artificiality of the recording studio, he thrived in it; by the time he was 30 he had made more than 50 recordings.
In 1951 he recorded Bach's six partitas in two sessions, one before marrying Eva Halfar, a German musicologist, and the other afterward. "So we had no honeymoon," he said in 2017. "Our honeymoon was Bach."
Mr. Badura-Skoda and his wife had four children, one of whom, Michael Badura-Skoda, a pianist, died in 2001. There was no information available on his survivors.
Mr. Badura-Skoda also did scholarly work with his wife, Eva Badura-Skoda, including jointly writing a well-received book, "Interpreting Mozart at the Keyboard," and editing Mozart concertos. They both taught in the late 1960s and 1970s at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
He had a lifelong musical partnership with the Austrian pianist Jörg Demus, who died in May at 90, with whom he played and recorded four-hand and duo-piano repertory. Together they wrote the book "The Piano Sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven."
While Mr. Badura-Skoda's playing was generally respected for its integrity and taste, some critics found it lacking in sparkle and clarity, especially during his later years. To acknowledge his 90th birthday, Deutsche Grammophon in 2017 released a 20-CD box set, "The Paul Badura-Skoda Edition," which includes many of his early Westminster recordings, among them Beethoven's five piano concertos conducted by Hermann Scherchen. That year he also gave a Beethoven recital at the Musikverein concert hall in Vienna, a program including the last three sonatas.
When asked by Mr. Vittes, the critic, if he was ready for such a demanding program, Mr. Badura-Skoda replied: "Ninety is quite a good age. I'm very well prepared."

Texto completo: The state of California is home to some of the most infamous serial killers in U.S. history — from the Manson Family, to the Freeway Killers, all the way to the Grim Sleeper.
Well, another accused killer is now awaiting trial in California. This time it’s prolific Democratic donor and West Hollywood resident Ed Buck.
Buck was finally arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies and charged with operating a drug house, as well as providing methamphetamine to a 37 year-old man who suffered an overdose at Buck’s apartment.
This incident was the third known time a man suffered a meth overdose at Buck’s home. The previous two alleged victims, Gemmel Moore and Timothy Dean, did not survive.
Days later, the feds announced that they too would be prosecuting Buck — this time on one count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death.
At a press conference, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said investigators found 10 more victims, nine of whom said Buck, “administered drugs to them or strongly encouraged them to ingest narcotics as part of agreements to be compensated for sexual services.”
The case is now generating national and international headlines; and I’m noticing that three false storylines seem to be emerging, and they need to be corrected.
First, The New York Times tried to minimize Buck’s power and influence by referring to him as “a small-time Democratic donor and political activist.”
That’s like calling Harvey Weinstein a “love-sick teenager.”
According to federal records, Buck has contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and groups, and was classified by the California Secretary of State’s office as being a “major donor.”
Before he was nicknamed ‘Dr. Kevorkian’ by his West Hollywood neighbors, Buck could have easily gone by Ed ‘Big Bucks’ with all of the campaign cash he was throwing around.
Second, it has been reported in multiple publications that the politicians and political action committees who took contributions from Buck acted quickly to distance themselves from him.
Some politicians, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Obama, still won’t say what they’re doing with Buck’s donations, even after his arrest.
In her defense, Hillary may not even know that Buck has been arrested. If she did, she might have fainted again.
Other candidates, including Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, and Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, agreed to give their Buck contributions of $2,700 and $19,400 respectively, to charity, only after the second man, Timothy Dean, died in Buck’s apartment in January.
The families of the victims, asked for the contributions to help pay for funeral expenses, but both congressmen declined.
What profiles in courage.
To date, only two elected officials donated the money they received from Buck to the victims’ families. Congresswoman Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, sent the entire $250 she received from Buck to help pay for Gemmel Moore’s funeral expenses, and West Hollywood Councilman John D’Amico made a $25 contribution toward the funeral.
Finally, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed that her office worked diligently and carefully to find and speak with witnesses over the course of the last two years so they could build a case against Ed Buck.
But the Moore family attorneys say the opposite is true. Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk wrote in a statement that, “Our team of activists had to personally escort witnesses to the LASD’s office and pressure them into recording our witnesses’ statements. We later discovered, in May of 2019, that Lacey was not even aware that these reports existed.”
Maybe prosecutors were too busy busting people for possession of plastic drinking straws to go after Ed Buck.
The reality is that Ed Buck abused vulnerable gay black men because powerful people looked the other way and enabled him.
Now that he’s finally been arrested, we shouldn’t try to minimize his power and influence, or rewrite history to make law enforcement and politicians seem as if they cared about the suffering of Ed Buck’s victims more than they actually did.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Some politicians, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Obama, still won’t say what they’re doing with Buck’s donations, even after his arrest.
In her defense, Hillary may not even know that Buck has been arrested. If she did, she might have fainted again.
Other candidates, including Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, and Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, agreed to give their Buck contributions of $2,700 and $19,400 respectively, to charity, only after the second man, Timothy Dean, died in Buck’s apartment in January.
The families of the victims, asked for the contributions to help pay for funeral expenses, but both congressmen declined.
What profiles in courage.
To date, only two elected officials donated the money they received from Buck to the victims’ families. Congresswoman Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, sent the entire $250 she received from Buck to help pay for Gemmel Moore’s funeral expenses, and West Hollywood Councilman John D’Amico made a $25 contribution toward the funeral.
Finally, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed that her office worked diligently and carefully to find and speak with witnesses over the course of the last two years so they could build a case against Ed Buck.
But the Moore family attorneys say the opposite is true. Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk wrote in a statement that, “Our team of activists had to personally escort witnesses to the LASD’s office and pressure them into recording our witnesses’ statements. We later discovered, in May of 2019, that Lacey was not even aware that these reports existed.”
Maybe prosecutors were too busy busting people for possession of plastic drinking straws to go after Ed Buck.
The reality is that Ed Buck abused vulnerable gay black men because powerful people looked the other way and enabled him.
Now that he’s finally been arrested, we shouldn’t try to minimize his power and influence, or rewrite history to make law enforcement and politicians seem as if they cared about the suffering of Ed Buck’s victims more than they actually did.

Texto completo: Hace unas semanas, un policía del estado de California tuvo que pedir refuerzos para continuar una persecución de auto debido a que su patrulla Tesla se estaba quedando sin batería.
Otra patrulla continuó la persecución eventualmente, pero los medios de comunicación malinterpretaron la noticia y sus reportes hicieron creer al público que el vehículo eléctrico quedó parado en plena persecución y dejando al sospechoso escapar, informó The New York Times.
La realidad es que el incidente no fue nada diferente a aquellas situaciones donde un auto de gasolina se queda sin combustible o se le poncha una llanta, informó el Departamento de Fremont en un comunicado, agregando que los Teslas han mostrado ser vehículos eficientes y que hay posibilidades de que se agreguen más de estos a la flota del Departamento.
El Departamento de Fremont puso a prueba algunos Teslas para patrulla el pasado marzo de este año.
En estos seis meses, los vehículos han mostrado ganarse el cariño y confianza de los policías debido a su alto rendimiento y capacidad para recolectar información.
“Estamos en las primeras discusiones sobre la expansión del programa”, explica el comunicado.
El Tesla Model S es un auto totalmente eléctrico. Puede acelerar de 0 a 60 en 2.4 segundos y cuenta con un rango de millas de 370 millas por recarga. Además tiene una alta resistencia a los impactos y alcanza una velocidad máxima de 163 millas por hora.

Trump declares legal immigrants must have health care coverage

Texto completo: Those seeking to legally immigrate to the U. S. must have health insurance, President Donald Trump declared in a proclamation he signed Friday.
"While our healthcare system grapples with the challenges caused by uncompensated care, the United States Government is making the problem worse by admitting thousands of aliens who have not demonstrated any ability to pay for their healthcare costs," reads the proclamation, which is set to take effect Nov. 3. "Immigrants who enter this country should not further saddle our healthcare system, and subsequently American taxpayers, with higher costs. "
It declares the entry of "aliens who will financially burden the United States healthcare system is hereby suspended. "
Anyone applying for an entry visa must show they will have coverage within 30 days of entering the country or that they have the money to cover "reasonably foreseeable medical costs. " It does not specify the dollar figure needed but says that a consular officer would determine if an applicant met the requirements before issuing a visa and that the secretary of state might "establish standards and procedures. "
Pompeo: Pompeo misses subpoena deadline for Ukraine documents but says State Dept. will follow law
Refugees, asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors and Iraqis or Afghans seeking a Special Immigrant Visa, and those holding visas before Nov. 3, would be exempt from the requirement.
Approved health care plans under the proclamation include employer-sponsored plans, family members' plans, catastrophic coverage, short-term coverage plans and Medicare plans. Migrants would not be able to use Medicaid plans or the subsidized plans offered on the state markets under the Affordable Care Act.
The proclamation also calls for an interdepartmental report to be submitted within 180 days on the "Financial Burdens Imposed by Immigrants on the Healthcare System. "
The text of Trump's order states that "data show that lawful immigrants are about three times more likely than United States citizens to lack health insurance. " According to a September report from the Census Bureau, 6. 8% of those born in the U. S. were uninsured in 2018, compared with 18. 9% of those born in another country.
Immigration: Donald Trump administration wants to deny green cards to migrants on public assistance
Among the foreign-born who are naturalized citizens, the uninsured rate is 8. 8%, according to the census. Slightly more than half of those born outside the U. S. are not citizens. According to a July study from the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 60% of those non-citizens entered the U. S. lawfully. Among them, the uninsured rate is 23%, the KFF study said.
Immigrants rights groups decried the president's proclamation.
"Trump is yet again pointing the finger at immigrant communities to distract us from his scandals. This latest attack on immigrants is not good for hospitals, it's not good for patients & it's not good for the health & well-being of communities across the country," tweeted the National Immigration Law Center.
"This is the Trump administration’s latest attempt to restrict immigration to only the wealthy and use economic status to discriminate instead of trying to reunite families, " said Karen Baynes-Dunning, interim president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

"Without the power to change U. S. law on his own, Trump is trying to find end runs around Congress and the legislative process to impose his will by fiat," Julie Dinnerstein, an immigration lawyer with CUNY Citizenship NOW, told The New York Times.
And the move was blasted by Democrats.
"The United States doesn’t even offer guaranteed healthcare for *its own citizens,* yet wants to demand it from people of other national origins," tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. "Hypocrisy, xenophobia, and barbarism all in one policy. "

"It seems every day the Trump Administration reaches a new low of cruelty," tweeted Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. "This rule will do nothing to help families struggling with high health care costs as a result of this Administration’s policies. "

"Donald Trump is panicking, and using cruel attacks on immigrants to distract and sow fear. Immigrants contribute more to this country than Donald Trump or Stephen Miller ever could – and their hate won’t stop us from speaking out in defense of immigrants," said former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, a 2020 presidential candidate.

— Julián Castro (@JulianCastro) October 5, 2019
Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been one of the chief architects of Trump's moves to cut immigration, both legal and illegal, into the U. S.
The new restriction is part of a broader strategy to reduce the number of immigrants entering the U. S. In August, the administration issued a rule that would allow officials to deny green cards to migrants if they believe the recipients will receive public benefits like food stamps, Medicaid or housing vouchers.
The proclamation says Trump has the power to issue such an order under sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act. One of those sections says the president can suspend "the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States" whose presence "would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. "
The same law was used to justify Trump's ban on immigration from a group of predominantly Muslim nations as well as his attempt to block migrants from seeking asylum.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Diahann Carroll, the Oscar-nominated actress and singer who won critical acclaim as the first black woman to star in a non-servant role in a TV series as "Julia," has died. She was 84.

Carroll's daughter, Susan Kay, told The Associated Press her mother died Friday in Los Angeles of cancer.

During her long career, Carroll earned a Tony Award for the musical "No Strings" and an Academy Award nomination for best actress for "Claudine."

But she was perhaps best known for her pioneering work on "Julia." Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.

"Diahann Carroll walked this earth for 84 years and broke ground with every footstep. An icon. One of the all-time greats," director Ava DuVernay wrote on Twitter.

"She blazed trails through dense forests and elegantly left diamonds along the path for the rest of us to follow. Extraordinary life. Thank you, Ms. Carroll."

Although she was not the first black woman to star in her own TV show (Ethel Waters played a maid in the 1950s series "Beulah"), she was the first to star as someone other than a servant.

NBC executives were wary about putting "Julia" on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit.

It had its critics, though, including some who said Carroll's character, who is the mother of a young son, was not a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s.

"They said it was a fantasy," Carroll recalled in 1998. "All of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family."

Not shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical "No Strings." Critic Walter Kerr described her as "a girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin."

She appeared often in plays previously considered exclusive territory for white actresses: "Same Time, Next Year," "Agnes of God" and "Sunset Boulevard" (as faded star Norma Desmond, the role played by Gloria Swanson in the 1950 film.)

"I like to think that I opened doors for other women, although that wasn't my original intention," she said in 2002.

Her film career was sporadic. She began with a secondary role in "Carmen Jones" in 1954 and five years later appeared in "Porgy and Bess," although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn't considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera.

Her other films included "Goodbye Again," "Hurry Sundown," "Paris Blues," and "The Split."

The 1974 film "Claudine" provided her most memorable role. She played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones. Carroll says she got the role after the intended lead actress, Diana Sands, became sick and insisted her friend take the role (Sands died in 1973). But Carroll said those behind the movies did not see her in the role because of her work in Julia and made her audition without makeup.

"Give me a chance. Just give me the opportunity to show you that I understand," she recalled telling them in an interview with the National Visionary Leadership Project. "I'm an actress, singer, from New York City, from the streets of New York, and I pride myself on my work ... I would like to be given the opportunity to stretch my wings."

She would end up being nominated for her Oscar, and she recalled the filming a magical experience.

"I had such a good time, I almost told them you don't need to pay me," she added.

In the 1980s, she joined in the long-running prime-time soap opera "Dynasty" as Dominique Deveraux, the glamorous half-sister of Blake Carrington; her physical battles with Alexis Carrington, played by Joan Collins, were among fan highlights. Another memorable role was Marion Gilbert, as the haughty mother of Whitley Gilbert (played by Jasmine Guy) on the TV series "A Different World."

"Diahann Carroll you taught us so much. We are stronger, more beautiful and risk takers because of you. We will forever sing your praises and speak your name. Love Love Love, Debbie," wrote actress, dancer and director Debbie Allen, who was a producer on "A Different World."

More recently, she had a number of guest shots and small roles in TV series, including playing the mother of Isaiah Washington's character, Dr. Preston Burke, on "Grey's Anatomy" and a stretch on the TV show "White Collar" as the widow June.

She also returned to her roots in nightclubs. In 2006, she made her first club appearance in New York in four decades, singing at Feinstein's at the Regency. Reviewing a return engagement in 2007, a New York Times critic wrote that she sang "Both Sides Now" with "the reflective tone of a woman who has survived many severe storms and remembers every lightning flash and thunderclap."

Carol Diann Johnson was born in New York City and attended the High School for the Performing Arts. Her father was a subway conductor and her mother a homemaker. She recalls when she was around 3 or 4, her parents took her to an aunt in North Carolina and left her in the care of her aunt, without notice, for a year She said it took a long time to forgive her parents, though she eventually did, and was there for them in their later years.

"It happened, it's over, it's done. A mature person finds a way to let go of that," she told OWN's "Masterclass in an interview a few years ago. "They did a lot of wonderful things. They lived, gave me everything they possibly could, and they passed on."

She began her career as a model in a segregated industry; she got much of her work due to publications like the black magazine Ebony. A prize from "Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts" TV show led to nightclub engagements.

In her 1998 memoir "Diahann," Carroll traced her turbulent romantic life, which included liaisons with Harry Belafonte, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Sammy Davis Jr., Sidney Poitier and David Frost. She even became engaged to Frost, but the engagement was canceled.

An early marriage to nightclub owner Monte Kay resulted in Carroll's only child, Suzanne, as well as a divorce. She also divorced her second husband, retail executive Freddie Glusman, later marrying magazine editor Robert DeLeon, who died.

Her most celebrated marriage was in 1987, to singer Vic Damone, and the two appeared together in nightclubs. But they separated in 1991 and divorced several years later.

After she was treated for breast cancer in 1998, she spoke out for more money for research and for free screening for women who couldn't afford mammograms.

"We all look forward to the day that mastectomies, chemotherapy and radiation are considered barbaric," Carroll told a gathering in 2000.

Besides her daughter, she is survived by grandchildren August and Sydney.

Texto completo: Fortunately, teens can dive into all of those topics and more at the 11th annual Texas Teen Book Festival, a daylong gathering Oct. 12 of 35 authors that both celebrates literature for young people and connects teen readers with the authors they love.
“I have had the privilege to witness the growth of the Texas Teen Book Festival from its first days as the little-festival-that-could at Westlake High School to what is now a celebration of teens and the books they love that takes over a huge swath of Southwestern University,” fest director Shawn Mauser says. “The festival has become a fixture in the reading lives of Central Texas teens, and I'm proud to have the opportunity to be a part of the team that creates that magic.
"Everyone involved in planning is passionate about connecting teens to great books in which they can see themselves and that represent the diversity of experience and culture that make up our Central Texas family.”
National Book Award nominee Erika L. Sánchez and essayist/comedian/YouTuber Akilah Hughes keynote this year’s fest, which moves to Georgetown’s Southwestern University for the first time.
“I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,” Sánchez’s first book for young adults, was a New York Times bestseller. “Daughter” follows Chicago teen Julia as she grieves her sister’s accidental death and discovers that Olga’s “perfect” veneer hid plenty of secrets, all while both detailing and exploding cultural expectations. (Opening keynote, 10 a.m., Alma Thomas Theater)
Multihyphenate Hughes, a veteran of “Pod Save America,” shares her life story in a collection of funny, incisive essays, “Obviously: Stories From My Timeline.” Her closing keynote will include presentation of the three winners of the fest’s “Fresh Ink Fiction” contest for teenage writers, judged by Austin Bat Cave. (Afternoon keynote, 3:30 p.m., Thomas theater)
Sánchez and Hughes will also speak on author panels throughout the day. Sánchez joins the “This is Us” panel, centering on books that explore the theme of family. Other panelists include Sandhya Menon, author of the body-positive romance “There’s Something About Sweetie,” and Thanhla Lai, whose “Butterfly Yellow” follows a Vietnamese girl who sends her brother to America so he can escape the horrors of war. Six years later, she too makes her way to America, and is reunited with her brother in Texas only to discover he has forgotten about their homeland. (4:45 p.m., McCombs Center Ballroom)
Hughes teams with Mary H.K. Choi and Lauren Shippen on the “What’s Your Platform?” panel devoted to authors who write for multiple outlets in addition to their books. Choi — whose “Permanent Record” weaves the distorting lens of social media into her story of celebrity romance and failure to launch — is a podcaster, comics writer and culture correspondent at HBO’s “Vice News Tonight” in addition to a novelist. Shippen’s YA debut “The Infinite Noise” sprang from her celebrated fiction podcast “The Bright Sessions.” (11:15 a.m., Thomas theater)
Technology also links the novels of the “Reality Bytes” panel, which includes Arvin Ahmadi’s “Girl Gone Viral,” about a teenage coder determined to win a VR contest to help discover the truth about her father’s disappearance. Panelist Brittney Morris’ debut is “Slay,” billed as “Ready Player One” meets “The Hate U Give,” about a teen game creator who battles backlash against her game after a real-life
murder springs from online events. (1:30 p.m., Thomas theater)
Driving change connects the books that make up “It’s Our World. Now What?” Akwaeke Emezi will showcase “Pet,” already longlisted for this year’s National Book Award; it’s a story of monsters both real and cultural. Brandy Colbert’s newest, “The Revolution of Birdie Randolph,” plumbs addiction and racial discrimination as it traces the love story between good girl Birdie and former bad boy Booker. Joelle Charbonneau’s “Verify” imagines a world in which lies don’t exist (until they do), and e.E. Charlton Trujillo brings back her award-winning “Fat Angie” in a new road-trip adventure, “Fat Angie: Rebel Girl Revolution.” (2:30 p.m., Thomas theater)
The festival also features a variety of literary-themed activities. There will be a retrospective of selected “90-Second Newbery” films, a yearly video contest in which young people create movies of Newbery-winning books in — naturally — 90 seconds. 90-Second Newbery founder James Kennedy and “Butterfly Yellow” author Lai, a Newbery honoree, host. (12:15 p.m., Thomas theater)
Returning is the iTent, which rotates interactive programs throughout the day, from making your own ’zine with Barrio Writers and Red Salmon Arts to the fourth annual Epic Reads literary costume contest to Penguin Teen Game Night. We Need Diverse Books founding member Lamar Giles, “Slay” author Morris and Caldecott honoree and Coretta Scott King award winner Christopher Myers team for an “Ask Me Anything” panel.
All authors will sign their books throughout the day at tents on the Academic Mall.

MUSIC REVIEW; It's no gala, but what a party

Texto completo: A year ago, the Los Angeles Philharmonic opened its centennial season with all hoopla all the time. There was a daylong parade followed by a free stellar concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Walt Disney Concert Hall was illuminated with spectacular video imagery. Game-changing new music was commissioned and premiered. Pop stars, jazz stars, they all were invited to the centennial party. The city became a symphony. The orchestral world had never seen anything like it.
Well, it did see something sort of like it 10 years ago, with the media circus surrounding Gustavo Dudamel's first concerts as L.A. Phil music director, his hosting of a free Hollywood Bowl concert and his leading of a Disney Hall gala of obsessive international interest.
Thursday night, the L.A. Phil opened its new season a week later than usual. For the first time in memory, there was no gala. There was no celebration of Dudamel's 10th L.A. Phil anniversary. He conducted an American program that included three crowd-pleasing works. The soloists were conventional, family even. Dudamel did not even follow through with his tradition of opening the season by premiering a newly commissioned work. On paper, it appeared business as usual for any other orchestra but the uniquely venturesome L.A. Phil.

It's a good thing concerts aren't performed on paper. Despite appearances, this was an exceptional start of the 101st season.
The program began with Samuel Barber's "Knoxville: Summer of 1915" featuring the kind of classical singer it was written for. The New York Philharmonic, on the other hand, just happened to include the comforting work on its first concert of its season. Only the New Yorkers took the surprising risk of inviting a Broadway star, Kelli O'Hara, whose intensity so surprised and impressed the New York Times' Anthony Tommasini that he ended his review saying that he's saving a place on his best-of-the-year list for her performance.
The next piece on Dudamel's program was George Gershwin's Piano Concerto in F, once more played as intended. (Saturday, the New West Symphony opens its season in Thousand Oaks with the striking idea of employing jazz musicians, the Marcus Roberts Trio, as soloists in the Concerto in F.)
Some of the seeming stodginess of the L.A. Phil has to do with circumstance. There will, in fact, be an only-in-L.A. gala. It has been postponed to Oct. 24 because that is the date of the first L.A. Phil concert 100 years ago. Dudamel and the two surviving ex-music directors, Zubin Mehta and Esa-Pekka Salonen, will appear together in the premiere of a piece written for the three conductors by the super-cool Icelandic composer Daniel Bjarnason.
The L.A. Phil did commission a piece for this week's program in an effort to include former L.A. Phil Music Director Andre Previn in the centenary celebrations. Previn died in February, having just begun the score. So Dudamel substituted the largest of Previn's recent orchestral works, "Can Spring Be Far Behind?" The night ended with Copland's "Appalachian Spring."
However unacknowledged Dudamel's 10th anniversary might have been, this modest program was ultimately all about him. His maturation over a decade has been striking. No longer the electrifying, irrepressible 28-year-old hotshot, he has become a master capable of profundity. The excitement has become taken for granted. Depth is now what pulls you in.
And a depth of sound was evident from the very first notes, the sweet entrancing of that long-ago, idyllic "Knoxville" summer. The text comes from James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family." A boy dreams. Summer sounds of barking dog and streetcar enchant. With lazy memories of warm-day picnics and warm-night quilts on the grass, family all around, the music lilts. Blue notes supply poignancy.
Julia Bullock was the soprano. Although her career is still young, she is already, I think, the most compelling dramatic singer we have on the stage. Many (OK, most) love "Knoxville" and its evocations. I don't. Though exquisite in its construction, it pries on manipulative nostalgia. But team Bullock and Dudamel went far beyond that, making notes and words speak. Somehow this no longer sounded like Barber but something intrinsically personal. For at least one listener, the performance was a miracle. Programming Gershwin's Concerto in F, with Jean-Yves Thibaudet, seems almost like not trying. Not many months go by when the L.A.-based French pianist isn't playing with the orchestra. He never lets you down, but you know what they say about familiarity. We take the flashy technique for granted, and sometimes he does too.
If your timing was right, you might have seen him tootle into the Disney garage in one of his sleek, exotic sports cars, as I happened to on Thursday. He no longer wears the red socks or much glitter onstage. On this night the glitter was reserved for his fingers.
For all Dudamel's rhythmic sense, his exuberance and his natural way with popular idioms of all sorts, Gershwin has somehow long befuddled him. Only slowly has he found his way in. That way, unexpectedly, is a radical symphonic magnificence.
The concerto began with its timpani stokes played as though an avant-garde onslaught by Xenakis, which is to say cosmic thunder. Gershwin's jazzy tunes took on Brahmsian weight and substance. Thibaudet, who happens to be a superb Brahmsian, little though he plays the composer these days, caught the spirit. Yet all the jazziness was there too. That's right, Brahms rocks.
Despite that, Dudamel never got in the way of Thibaudet's flash. The slow movement was blues of the supplest kind. The final Allegro was sheer adrenaline. It was a great performance.
Previn's "Spring," written three years ago, has the quality of an incomparable raconteur's ramble, a kind of improvisation for orchestra by a once-great improviser. He put in bits of his Hollywood days. He turned small thematic motifs around the way he did fooling around at the piano, and the way he could in conversation. The past sounded like it was flooding in. The orchestral treatment, little solos coming in and out, were the work of a natural. Previn didn't worry about whether he had something to say, he just said.
Previn did have something to say at the end. His final work, "Penelope," completed on his deathbed, is a substantial setting of a powerful Tom Stoppard text for Renee Fleming, string quartet and piano. The soprano gave the premiere in Tanglewood this summer. It is a masterpiece. Fleming comes to town next week to appear with Los Angeles Opera. Unfortunately, she hasn't managed to fit "Penelope" into her visit.
Just as Dudamel's Gershwin isn't Gershwin's super-smooth Gershwin, his "Appalachian Spring" isn't Copland's clear-and-cool-as-a-mountain-stream Copland. Dudamel finds his own extremes of mystical calm and vibrant dance. No parade required.

Overhaul of Ethanol Quotas In a 'Farmer-Friendly' Policy

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture jointly proposed new rules on Friday that would increase ethanol consumption at the expense of oil refineries to help corn and soybean farmers buffeted by President Trump's trade wars.
The plan would overhaul the system of quotas for ethanol, a fuel that is made from corn and other crops, as they blend their fuels. Its overall goal is to increase the sale of the biofuel beyond the current mandate of 15 billion gallons annually.
It also will ensure that a gasoline blend made of 15 percent ethanol will be available at the pumps already in place at most gas stations, rather than requiring the installation of new pumps. The proposal also includes trade measures to increase the access of ethanol to foreign markets.
The move is widely viewed as an effort to relieve pressure on farmers at a time when the Trump administration is escalating its trade war with China and Europe.
Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners, a research firm, said he did not expect Mr. Trump to ease up on import tariffs that have prompted retaliation against American agricultural exports. But, he said, farmers are critical to the president's re-election effort, and their anger is forcing Mr. Trump to favor grain farmers over the oil and gas industry, which has resisted fuel blends that are higher in ethanol as expensive and inefficient.
"Trade has made the president more farmer-friendly," Mr. Book said. "The trade pressures on his Midwest base have forced concessions that otherwise might not have happened, given the president's pro-fossil ideology."

Midwestern lawmakers greeted the proposal warmly. Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and a critic of the trade war, said in a statement that Mr. Trump had "listened to the concerns of farmers and biofuel providers and delivered on their behalf."
But oil-state lawmakers and oil-industry leaders were critical. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the E.P.A., issued a statement saying he believed it would lead to shuttered refineries and lost jobs. He noted that refineries employed thousands of people in Wyoming alone.
"Any plan to transfer small refineries' biofuel obligations to other refineries will do more harm than good," Senator Barrasso said.
Amid the trade wars, skepticism in the farm states remains high, in part because the administration has been behind many of the waivers granted to refiners seeking exemptions from ethanol mandates.
"Between the unsustainable trade war and extraordinarily tough weather conditions, the agriculture community in Illinois has been struggling to stay afloat amid unprecedented uncertainty," said Representative Lauren Underwood, a freshman Democrat in a district that stretches from the suburbs of Chicago into farm country.
"I'm pleased that today's announced plan will help address the hollowing out of the Renewable Fuel Standard," she said, referring to the federal rule on ethanol requirements.
Ethanol has long been mixed into some types of gasoline under the federal fuel-standard mandate, partially as a way to reduce reliance on oil, partially as a favor to powerful farm-state lawmakers. That mandate outlines how many gallons of ethanol and biodiesel refiners must blend into the nation's fuel supply each year.
Over the past two years, the Trump administration has routinely granted small refiners exemptions from the mandate.
The E.P.A. said it would begin to take comments on expanding federal biofuel requirements in the coming months and would take a final action this year to increase ethanol consumption in 2020, an election year.
"Today's agreement is the latest in a series of steps we have taken to expand domestic energy production and improve the R.F.S. program that will result in sustained biofuel production to help American farmers," Andrew Wheeler, the administrator of the E.P.A., said in a statement.
Scott Segal, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell who lobbies on energy issues, said he was skeptical that the proposal would satisfy the ethanol industry.
"With the ethanol industry, too much is never enough," Mr. Segal said. The administration really has no assurance that agribusiness won't demand more and more, just as they always have."
Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil industry, said the companies he represents were "deeply concerned" about the plan and warned that it could result in higher costs for consumers at the gas pump

Texto completo: New Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter said he was harassed outside of a Cambridge mosque Friday afternoon because of his political opposition to Turkey's president.
Kanter, a 6-11 Turkish basketball player signed by Boston this summer, posted a video to Twitter that showed him and teammate Tacko Fall outside the Islamic Society of Boston on Prospect Street, which is a short walk away from Inman Square. In the video, at least two men can be seen addressing Kanter. One of them holds a cellphone.
Kanter, who is expected to be Boston's starting center this season, is a vocal critic of Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, previously referring to him as “the Hitler of our century." Erdogan has been accused of increasingly authoritarian tendencies. In the Friday video, the Celtics player indicates the two men are his fellow countrymen who support Erdogan.
“They're actually starting a fight outside of a mosque, pro-Erdogan people," he said in the video.
Later, in a phone interview with the Globe, Kanter said he had never seen the two men before and that they cursed at him, called him “traitor," indicated that he should not be here, and made an obscene gesture at him. He said that when he and Fall, a 7-foot-7 rookie, left Friday's prayer service, the men were waiting for him outside. There, the men caused a scene, yelling and screaming at him, Kanter said.
“I told you America, this is crazy," Kanter said in the video.
Kanter told the Globe that he has tried to stand up “for human rights, democracy, and freedom" and to bring awareness of “what's really going on in Turkey."
“I'm not going to back down," he said.
He called the harassment unacceptable and said he was shocked by the incident.
“It's a mosque, it's a house of God, this shouldn't happen," he said.
Kanter said he spoke with the Celtics' security after the incident. Messages left with the Celtics were not immediately returned Friday evening.
“I shouldn't be feeling uncomfortable or insecure while critiquing anyone, but unfortunately even in America they make me feel this insecurity — can you even imagine how people in Turkey feel?" Kanter said in a statement texted to the Globe Friday night.
A Cambridge police spokesman said the department had received no formal reports regarding the incident as of 6:15 p.m. Friday.
Kanter has drawn the ire of the Turkish government for his political dissidence throughout his eight-year NBA career.
Using language like “terrorist" and “coup," the local Turkish Consulate recently tried to shut down Kanter's 50th free basketball camp of the offseason, according to Kanter and his manager. Hosted at UMass Boston last Saturday, the camp went on as planned because university officials denied the consulate's request, they said.
Over the summer, Kanter claimed another free camp was cancelled because the Turkish consultate in New York City pressured the mosque hosting the event to nix it.
Alper Aktas, the Turkish consul general in New York, denied thosee allegations, saying there were no threats and no intimidation. A spokesman for the mosque also denied the organization was bullied by the consulate.
Earlier this year, The New York Times, citing pro-government newspapers, reported Kanter was indicted on a charge of violating a law against insulting Turkey's president, and prosecutors in the country have sought an international arrest warrant for the basketball player because of his support for a Muslim cleric who lives in exile in the US.
Erdogan has accused the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of instigating a coup attempt against him. Turkish authorities have arrested thousands of people thought to be supporters of Gulen since the failed coup. Gulen has denied involvement in the attempted overthrow.
Kanter has said Turkish authorities cannot present “any single piece of evidence of my wrongdoing."
In May, when Kanter's team, the Portland Trail Blazers, were in the playoffs and there was a chance they would face the Toronto Raptors for the title, US Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, wrote to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking his government to facilitate Kanter's safe passage to and from Canada if the Blazers made the championship round, according to the Associated Press.
The Golden State Warriors swept Portland in the Western Conference finals, making the matter moot.
In March, the Associated Press reported Kanter did not travel with the Blazers to Toronto while on a road trip, fearing reprisal for his outspoken disapproval of Erdogan.
During his stint with the New York Knicks earlier in the season, Kanter did not travel for a January game in London because he feared he could be killed or attacked.
Kanter's passport Turkish passport was revoked in 2017 and he was detained in a Romanian airport before being released.
In July, Kanter met with Wyden and Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, to discuss his ability to travel outside the US for the upcoming season.

Texto completo: Headnote Raised on a farm, businessman now helps protects them
Few livelihoods offer as many paths to failure as agriculture. Throughout history, farmers have been at the mercy of nature - be it weather, pests or crop diseases - even as the survival of people and livestock depended on their success.
Growing up on a farm on the slopes of Mount Kenya, Thomas Njeru witnessed firsthand the devastating impact such setbacks had on the lives of small landholders, including his own family. His mother lectured him to work hard in school so he could one day leave the farm and land a good job in the city. Njeru followed that advice obediently - until he did not.
Today, he is a co-founder and chief financial officer of Pula, a four-year-old microinsurance firm that serves 1.7 million smallholder farms of 0.6 acres or less in 10 African countries and India.
Microinsurance - think of it as an offshoot of the microloan programs that kick-start businesses in impoverished areas - provides protection for low-income individuals who do not have access to conventional coverage.
Pula, based in Nairobi, Kenya, partners with government agencies and loan providers to cover the cost of the insurance, which is included in the price of seed and fertilizer; there is no direct charge to the farmer.
Among the coverages Pula provides is weather index insurance to cover failures of seed germination, using satellite data to determine whether there has been sufficient rainfall. Longer-term coverage, called yield index insurance, compensates farmers with replacement supplies in the event of a poor harvest.
The coverage is registered using a mobile app - already a prevalent method of transactions in much of Africa - at the farm supply dealer. Rather than settling claims with an adjuster making a traditional field visit, Pula automates the payout via text messaging.
Globally, microinsurance is a $64 billion market, but it has been slow to catch on in Africa because of logistical hurdles: Farms are tiny and often hard to reach; claims are a challenge to verify; cost is too high for subsistence growers.
Yet some of the same technology that is improving efficiency and crop yields on large farms - powerful data acquisition and satellite-enabled weather forecasts, for example - can be deployed in the developing world, using proven strategies like risk sharing across large insured groups and a nonprofit structure.
The following conversation has been edited and condensed.
Q: What would you like people to know about your work?
A: If you would have told me 10 years ago that I would be running a company that does agriculture insurance, I would not have believed you. Agriculture has not been an area that people have invested in across Africa. Many of my cousins and childhood friends still work on their farms, but they are reluctant to invest, putting in only what they can afford to lose.
The reason they don't invest is simple. The chance of them losing their money due to the vagaries of the weather is huge. Working in insurance got me to understand about probabilities of loss early on - probabilities that cause our continent to be food insecure.
Pula's mission is to give farmers confidence by providing risk mitigation. Our solutions protect a farmer's investment by pairing it with insurance. We build business cases to persuade Fortune 500 companies, seed and fertilizer suppliers, lending institutions, and governments in Africa that embedded insurance will help deliver better results for both businesses and food security.
Q: Who or what inspired you to go into your field?
A: The sad reality is that farmers are one drought or one disease outbreak away from sliding into absolute poverty. I remember during a drought year some of my friends dropping out of school - they could not come to school hungry, and their parents could not pay the school fees. The majority of families in Africa are faced with the same precarious reality.
When I began working in the insurance sector as an actuary, I realized that insurance companies in Africa largely overlooked agriculture. In fact, the penetration of agriculture insurance in Africa is less than 1%. The reason is that insurance companies' business models are not set up to serve the unique needs of smallholder farmers. I saw an opportunity to develop a new approach that could support the vulnerable smallholders.
Q: What obstacles do you face in your field?
A: Attracting great talent is a challenge for startups. The majority of talented people in Africa prefer to work for established corporations rather than take a career risk at a startup like ours.
Getting buy-in to the concept of insurance in Africa is a challenge due to low trust levels. Driving behavior change toward adopting insurance is also difficult, especially in the rural and poor households where farmers are faced with many competing demands on their finances.
Q: How do you define success?
A: At a personal level, success will be when my mother buys an insured bag of fertilizer or seed and gets a payout should she suffer an adverse event. At a macro level, success for us will be when every farmer in Africa has access to insurance. I hope that this happens in my lifetime.

Texto completo: For his next role, Will Smith will play a gangster.
Smith, 51, has signed on to play New York City crime lord Nicky Barnes in Netflix's upcoming crime drama “The Council.”
As Indiewire reports, he'll also produce the film alongside business partner James Lassiter under the Overbrook Entertainment banner.
Barnes rose to infamy in the 1970s as the leader of a New York-based crime syndicate that partnered with the Italian mafia to control much of the area's heroin dealing at the time, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Barnes' exploits earned him the nickname of “Mr. Untouchable,” a title bestowed upon him by the New York Times. He was arrested in 1978 and later became a federal informant.
Ultimately, Barnes died of cancer in 2012 — a fact not revealed until earlier this year due to his participation in the witness protection program, the Times reported in June.
This is somewhat of a departure for Smith, who has played complex characters in the past, but rarely takes on the role of a “bad guy” — although Deadshot in “Suicide Squad” is technically a bad guy, he's a hero in the end.
According to a film synopsis, “The Council” tells the story of Barnes' organization of seven African American men that operated out of Harlem in the 1970s while dreaming of a “self-sufficient and self-policing African American city-state, funded by revolutionizing the drug game.” The movie, Netflix says, “centers on the Shakespearean court intrigue” exp

Fall/Winter Medicine Cabinet Essentials

Texto completo: Jonny Bowden, PhD, CNS
Have you ever noticed that when there’s a bug around your office, not everyone gets sick? Somebody is out for 10 days, someone else for a half day and some people don’t even get sidelined at all? Think about it. They’ve all been exposed to the same germ. So, why does this happen? Part of the reason may be how they stock their fall/winter medicine cabinets.
“If your immune system is well nourished and healthy, it will withstand challenges a lot better. Those of us lucky enough to not get sick, stay healthy because our immune system is able to just bat the challenge aside. Or, at the very least, handle it and recover quickly,” says Jonny Bowden, Ph.D., CNS.
This time of year, we buy jackets and decorate our homes for the various holidays. But we often miss another important task, which is to prepare for sniffles, coughs and other minor ailments by organizing and restocking the medicine cabinet. Rather than waiting to shop until you or a family member gets sick, Bowden says it’s better to have the most effective remedies already on hand.
Start by doing the following:
“Bathroom cabinets are okay as long as they don’t get warm and steamy during baths and showers. Many products degrade when exposed to humidity and warm temperatures.”
“Toss any expired products. Many pharmacies offer safe medication disposal.”
“Lock these products in a high cabinet.”
“Now is a good time to remind yourself of any precautions. Many over-the-counter (OTC) drugs have warnings regarding their use in those who have serious medical conditions such as heart, kidney or liver disease.”
“Some products for children are dosed by weight or age. Others are not safe or recommended for children.”
Here’s what Bowden says you might want to include in your medicine cabinet makeover:
“Stock up on garlic. It’s been used since ancient times to ward off colds. I don’t recommend wearing it around your neck, but supplementing your diet with fresh garlic or garlic extract may help keep all those nasty germs away. When you use garlic for cooking, be sure to add it towards the end, and be sure to chop it up thoroughly. The active ingredient (allicin) is created by breaking down the cell walls.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 22 million school days are lost annually in the United States because of the common cold1. “When it comes to our health, antioxidants are nature’s good guys. My go-to medicine cabinet staple is black elderberry. It contains flavonoids called anthocyanins, which have a remarkable ability to stimulate the body’s immune system2. Sambucol is the original black elderberry supplement used during cough/cold season for natural immune support. Sambucol Gummies are great for kids because they are pectin-based, and contain no artificial flavors or colors. They are also free of all major allergies including gluten, nuts, soy and dairy.”
“Throat sprays with Echinacea, sage and peppermint can help. Buckwheat honey is also great for lubricating and soothing a sore throat. It contains antioxidants and nutrients that help speed healing. Buckwheat honey can be given to children age one year and over and is available in most health food stores.”
“Fall and winter are notoriously hard on skin. To help keep it moisturized, try a light layer of coconut oil after a shower to trap moisture. Always have fresh razor blades on hand so you’re not inflicting tiny scrapes, and be sure to never run out of shaving cream or gel.”
“Studies show that the very potent anti-inflammatory compounds called gingerols found in ginger can help relieve motion sickness, dizziness, nausea and gas, and soothe the intestinal tract. You can find supplemental ginger in chewables and gummies in pharmacies and health food stores.”
With these products readily available, you may be able to resolve many of your household’s typical health issues quickly and easily.

In a study published in The Journal of International Medical Research (2004), Sambucol Black Elderberry Extract was shown to reduce severity and shorten the duration of flu types A and B by up to four days. Sixty patients (29 females/31 males) ages 18 to 54 years with verified influenza were enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. On average, patients taking Sambucol recovered in 3.1 days compared to 7.1 days for those given placebo. Symptoms were also made less severe with no significant side effects reported.
Jonny Bowden, PhD, CNS, also known as “The Nutrition Myth Buster” ™ is a nationally known board-certified nutritionist and expert on diet and weight loss. He has appeared on the Dr. Oz Show, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, and CBS as an expert on nutrition and has contributed to articles in The New York Times, Forbes, The Daily Beast, The Huffington Post, Vanity Fair Online, Men’s Health, Prevention, and dozens of other print and online publications.
Dr. Jonny is the best-selling author of 15 books including The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth, Living Low Carb (now in its fourth edition), and is the co-author, with cardiologist Stephen Sinatra, of the controversial best-seller, “The Great Cholesterol Myth: Why Lowering Your Cholesterol Won’t Prevent Heart Disease and the Statin-Free Plan that Will”. His latest book, Smart Fat: Eat More Fat, Lose More Weight, Get Healthy Now! — written with PBS star Steven Masley, MD— was published by Harper Collins in January 2016.

'Not a given’: McCain Institute disputes reports ex-Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker to resign

Texto completo: A spokesman for the McCain Institute for International Leadership pushed back on reports that Kurt Volker, the former State Department special envoy to Ukraine, plans to step down from leading the group after revelations that President Trump urged Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden.
“Not happening today nor is it a given,” senior director of communications Luke Knittig told the Washington Examiner.
The New York Times reported that Volker would resign as executive director of the Washington-based research group on Friday. The report said the group’s leadership pressured Volker to step down for not being as forthcoming about his dual roles as they had wished.
A source told CNN that the institute’s leadership stood behind Volker until text messages were released that showed he was more involved in the Ukraine scandal than he led on.
Volker did not respond to a text message requesting comment from the Washington Examiner. His voicemail was full Friday afternoon. The McCain Institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Volker said in testimony to congressional investigators on Thursday that he was not aware of Trump’s efforts to get Ukraine to launch an investigation into his political rival and was not on the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to an impeachment inquiry.
Text messages released by House Democrats late Thursday showed Volker telling top Zelensky adviser Andriy Yermak that a Zelensky visit to Washington was conditional. The message was sent the morning of the July 25 conversation between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart.
“Good lunch — thanks. Heard from White House — assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow — Kurt," Volker wrote.

Chicago Democrats ignore rampant crime to target pro-life states instead

Texto completo: September was just six hours old when four people already had been murdered in Chicago. The month’s last weekend was marred by two homicides and another 17 people — including a six-month-old boy — being shot and injured.
But no, curbing the violence plaguing Chicago was not the focus of a bill introduced last week in the Illinois state legislature by Chicago-area state Rep. Daniel Didech. Instead, Didech’s bill seeks to prevent Illinois state employees from having to travel on business to states that regulate abortion. And if they do dare to cross those state lines, the bill seeks to prevent them from being reimbursed for that travel.
“I have the responsibility to protect our state employees," Didech said while introducing his bill.
State employees sometimes have to travel for conferences or training, and Didech apparently doesn’t want them to wind up in a state, such as Georgia or Missouri, that takes the sanctity of life seriously. Particularly not after Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker signed a sweeping pro-abortion law in June that removed protections for the unborn. Pritzker called his state “a beacon of hope in the heart of this nation.” It’s clear that the abortion distortion in the state starts from the top and trickles down.
Didech’s bill suggests that pregnant women would be in danger if they leave the state. For instance, he said when announcing his harebrained scheme that pregnant women who suffer a miscarriage away from home might find themselves being investigated to determine the cause of the miscarriage.
Which, of course, is nonsense.
In a New York Times story from May that ran under the sub-headline: “The possible problems of a new Georgia law,” a law professor speculated that a woman found liable for causing her own miscarriage could be charged with second-degree murder. Of course, the law does not actually say miscarriages will be investigated, but the Times found it worth including in the draconian “possible problems” the law might create.
This is the kind of hysteria that erupts in the pro-abortion community whenever a state exercises what even Roe vs. Wade itself acknowledged as a legitimate state interest: the protection of life in the womb.
After Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed the law protecting babies from abortion once a heartbeat can be detected, abortion activist and actress Alyssa Milano suggested a nationwide “sex strike.” When that failed to take off, a campaign took shape to prod film companies to give up the significant financial benefits they get from shooting movies and television shows in Georgia by boycotting the state.
That ill-fated plan kind of fell off the radar, until this past weekend, when director Tyler Perry, who has a film company in Atlanta, said he would not participate in the boycott. Didech’s proposal is more of the same kind of lunacy that garners headlines but — thankfully — accomplishes nothing.
A quick look at Didech’s Twitter feed shows him wearing Planned Parenthood pink and thanking the nation’s largest abortion profiteer for helping him protect abortion rights. This was after Gov. Pritzker had already declared Illinois the most “progressive” state in the union when it comes to killing the unborn.
How much more protection does abortion need?
Didech’s bill is another clear sign that the Democrats — once the party that said abortion should be “safe, legal and rare” — will likely no longer be satisfied until the right to life has been deleted from the Declaration of Independence itself.

Texto completo: When he isn’t raving about how the deep state is conspiring against him, Donald Trump loves to boast about the economy, claiming to have achieved unprecedented things. As it happens, none of his claims are true. While both GDP and employment have registered solid growth, the Trump economy simply seems to have continued a long expansion that began under Barack Obama. In fact, someone who looked only at the past 10 years of data would never guess that an election had taken place.
But now it’s starting to look as if Trump really will achieve something unique: He may well be the first president of modern times to preside over a slump that can be directly attributed to his own policies, rather than bad luck.
There has always been a deep unfairness about the relationship between economics and politics: Presidents get both credit and blame for events that usually have little to do with their actions. Jimmy Carter didn’t cause the stagflation that put Ronald Reagan in the White House; George H.W. Bush didn’t cause the economic weakness that elected Bill Clinton; even George W. Bush bears at most tangential responsibility for the 2008 financial crisis.
More recently, the “mini-recession” of 2015-16, a slump in manufacturing that may have tipped the scale to Trump, was caused mainly by a plunge in energy prices rather than any of Barack Obama’s policies.
Now the U.S. economy is going through another partial slump. Once again, manufacturing is contracting. Agriculture is also taking a severe hit, as is shipping. Overall output and employment are still growing, but around a fifth of the economy is effectively in recession.
But unlike previous presidents, who were just unlucky to preside over slumps, Trump has done this to himself, largely by choosing to wage a trade war he insisted would be “good, and easy to win.”
The link between the trade war and agriculture’s woes is obvious: America’s farmers are deeply dependent on export markets, China in particular. So they’re hurting badly, despite a huge financial bailout that is already more than twice as big as the Obama administration’s auto bailout. (Part of the problem may be that the bailout money is flowing disproportionately to the biggest, richest farms.)
Shipping may also seem an obvious victim when tariffs reduce international trade, although it’s not just an international issue; domestic trucking is also in recession.
The manufacturing slump is more surprising. After all, America runs a large trade deficit in manufactured goods, so you might expect that tariffs, by forcing buyers to turn to domestic suppliers, would be good for the sector. That’s surely what Trump and his advisers thought would happen.
But that’s not how it has worked out. Instead, the trade war has clearly hurt U.S. manufacturing. Indeed, it has done considerably more damage than even Trump critics like yours truly expected.
The Trumpist trade warriors, it turns out, missed two key points. First, many U.S. manufacturers depend heavily on imported parts and other inputs; the trade war is disrupting their supply chains. Second, Trump’s trade policy isn’t just protectionist, it’s erratic, creating vast uncertainty for businesses both here and abroad. And businesses are responding to that uncertainty by putting plans for investment and job creation on hold.
So the tweeter-in-chief has bungled his way into a Trump slump, even if it isn’t a full-blown recession, at least so far. It’s clearly going to hurt him politically, notably because of the contrast between his big talk and not-so-great reality. Also, the pain in manufacturing seems to be falling especially hard on those swing states Trump took by tiny margins in 2016, giving him the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote.
And while many presidents have found themselves confronting politically damaging economic adversity, Trump is, as I said, unique in that he really did this to himself.
Of course, that doesn’t mean that he will accept responsibility for his mistakes. For the past few months he has been trying to portray the Federal Reserve as the root of all economic evil, even though current interest rates are well below those his own officials predicted in their triumphalist economic projections.
My guess, however, is that Fed-bashing will prove ineffective as a political strategy, not least because most Americans probably have at best a vague idea of what the Fed is and what it does.
So what will come next? Trump being Trump, it’s a good bet that he’ll soon be denouncing troubling economic data as fake news; I wouldn’t be surprised to see political pressure on the statistical agencies to report better numbers. Hey, if it can happen to the National Weather Service, why not the Bureau of Economic Analysis (which reports, by the way, to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross)?
And somehow or other this will turn out to be another deep-state conspiracy, probably orchestrated by George Soros.
The scary thing is that around 35% of Americans will probably believe whatever excuses Trump comes up with. But that won’t be enough to save him.

Let investigator 'follow the facts' on Mueller probe's origins Outraged at how Donald Trump handled the Russia inquiry, Democrats are now acting the same way.

Texto completo: President Trump's critics are now complaining that he asked the Australian prime minister to cooperate with the Justice Department's investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe and that Attorney General William Barr has traveled overseas to ask foreign intelligence officials to cooperate with that investigation. The New York Times called it another example of "the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests."
No, it's not. The president's critics are conflating two different things: the investigation by Trump's private lawyer, Rudy Giu- liani, into Hunter Biden's business dealings, and the official inquiry by U.S. Attorney John Durham into the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. The former is opposition research activity; the latter is a criminal justice matter.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking foreign heads of state or intelligence officials to cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation. As George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley explains, "It is not uncommon for an attorney general, or even a president, to ask foreign leaders to assist with ongoing investigations. Such calls can shortcut bureaucratic red tape, particularly if the evidence is held, as in this case, by national security or justice officials."
Americans support the Durham probe. For two years, they were told by Trump's opponents that the president was "working on behalf of the Russians" and had committed "treasonous" acts that were of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." Those were serious accusations, and Americans took them seriously. They waited for special counsel Robert Mueller to tell them whether the president had indeed betrayed the country.
Then Mueller issued his report, and they found out that none of it was true. They understandably wanted answers. How did it come to pass that our government was paralyzed for two years and spent tens of millions of their tax dollars, chasing a Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory? A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll following the Mueller report's public release found that 53 percent of Americans said that "bias against President Trump in the FBI played a role in launching investigations against him," and 62 percent supported appointing a special counsel to investigate the investigation of Trump.
Instead of a special counsel, Barr appointed Durham, a career prosecutor, to lead the investigation that Americans demanded. Durham is a man of unimpeachable character who was appointed by Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the CIA's terrorist interrogation program. At the conclusion of that probe, which ended without any criminal charges, Holder praised Durham for working "tirelessly to conduct an extraordinarily thorough and complete" investigation.
Now Barr has asked Durham to bring the same tireless professionalism to his investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe. But suddenly, all those who were so eager to find out what happened in 2016 when they thought Mueller would reveal that Trump conspired with the Russians have lost interest. The same people who were outraged at Trump's efforts to discredit the Mueller probe are now doing the exact same thing to the Durham probe. Back then, Democrats insisted Trump stop criticizing the investigation and "let Mueller follow the facts wherever they lead." Now they need to heed their own advice: Stop criticizing the investigation. Let Durham follow the facts wherever they lead. If there was no wrongdoing, then there is nothing to worry about.
To be sure, Trump bears some responsibility for helping Democrats lump together Durham's official investigation with Giu- liani's partisan activities by mentioning them both on the call with Ukraine's president. There should be a firewall between the two inquiries. Instead, Trump and Giuliani have blurred those lines.
But keep in mind, it was the Democrats who told us there is nothing wrong or illegal with a presidential candidate hiring a private lawyer to conduct opposition research in a foreign country on their political opponents. After it emerged that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee had paid Christopher Steele to dig up dirt in Russia on Trump, the Democrats' defense was: That's just opposition research. Everyone does it. The biggest problem with the Steele dossier was not that Democrats paid for opposition research, but that the FBI might have used it as the basis for spying on the Trump campaign - which is part of what Durham is investigating.
Durham is no partisan actor. Despite political pressure, he cleared the CIA of wrongdoing during the Obama administration. Like Mueller, he will follow the facts wherever they lead. Maybe that is why so many Democrats are up in arms.

Texto completo: "The Blacklist" returns for a seventh season on NBC. And a series about a young superhero debuts on Netflix.
What's on TV
THE BLACKLIST 8 p.m. on NBC. If you want to end your TV show's season on a cliffhanger, having the main character get abducted isn't a bad way to do it. That's what happened at the end of the previous season of this popular thriller. The show stars James Spader as a criminal mastermind who goes by the name Raymond Reddington and who begins working with the F.B.I. to help them bag high-profile lawbreakers. Season 6 concluded with a former K.G.B. agent (played by Laila Robins) plunging a syringe into Reddington, watching as her associates put him into the back of a van and made off with one of Reddington's characteristic fedoras for good measure. The seventh season kicks off Friday, and picks up from there. "There will be an episode of 'The Blacklist' that is just fun and another that is very intense and then another that is rather ruthless and brutal," Spader told The New York Times last year. "I still love the element of surprise, even for myself."
THE HOUSE WITH A CLOCK IN ITS WALLS (2018) 7 p.m. on Showtime. A celebrated 1973 book by John Bellairs is given the Hollywood treatment here, in a family movie adaptation that stars the actor Owen Vaccaro as a boy who goes to live with his warlock uncle. That uncle, played here by Jack Black, lives in an old house that contains a magic clock hidden in its ... well, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out! Cate Blanchett co-stars as the uncle's witch neighbor; Eli Roth, better known for gory movies like "Hostel," directs. The result "doesn't have the sophistication of an adaptation like 'Hugo,"' Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The Times. "But no film in which Cate Blanchett head-butts a vivified jack-o'-lantern could be entirely without merit." To see Black look considerably scruffier (and to see him butcher the word "factotum"), see SCHOOL OF ROCK (2003), airing on Showtime before this movie, at 5 p.m.
GREAT PERFORMANCES: NOW HEAR THIS 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The composer Domenico Scarlatti is the subject of this week's episode of this classical music mini-series, which is hosted by the violinist and conductor Scott Yoo. The episode looks at how Scarlatti created a style of his own, and successfully straddled the Baroque and Classical periods.
What's Streaming
RAISING DION Stream on Netflix. This new series starts out with its young hero slowing down time over spilled milk. The hero is Dion (Ja'Siah Young), a second grader with super powers that kick in, in one case, after he trips while carrying a bowl of cereal. He'll soon need to use them in more sinister circumstances: The story, adapted from a comic book by Dennis Liu, involves Dion fighting a villain. It also devotes much of its time to the relationship between Dion and his mother, Nicole (Alisha Wainwright), who tries to determine the origin of the powers. Michael B. Jordan is an executive producer of the series, and appears in a supporting role.

Texto completo: The number of cases has risen weekly. So far, 19 deaths have been confirmed, and health officials say more are being investigated.
Illnesses and deaths linked to vaping continue to increase around the country, now totaling 1,080 cases and 19 deaths, health officials said on Thursday.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that cases had occurred in 48 states and the United States Virgin Islands. This week, Nebraska, Alabama, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia and New Jersey reported deaths, which brought the total to 19 in 16 states.
The new case count reflects an increase of 275 in just the past week. About half of the 275 were hospitalized in the past two weeks, and the rest were older cases whose link to vaping was just recognized, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the C.D.C., said during a news briefing.
She described the outbreak as "continuing at a brisk pace," emphasized that the illnesses were serious and life-threatening and called the proportion of patients hospitalized and in intensive care "just terrible."
"We know that additional deaths are under investigation," Dr. Schuchat said.
About 70 percent of the patients were male, 80 percent under 35 years old and 16 percent younger than 18, she said. Among the patients who died, the median age was about 50, and the proportion of women was higher than in the overall group of patients.
In response to the outbreak of illnesses as well as the increasing rate of teenage vaping, several states have ordered bans on flavored e-cigarettes. The Trump administration has said that it would draft a ban on flavored e-cigarettes, too.
But on Thursday, a New York appeals court ordered a temporary stay of a statewide flavor ban that was to take effect on Friday. Vaping groups had filed suit against the ban, contending that it would hurt retailers and adults who use the products. The vaping industry is also battling a more extensive ban of all vaping products in Massachusetts.
Dr. Howard Zucker, the New York state health commissioner, called the outbreak a "public health emergency," adding: "It is undeniable that the vaping industry is using flavored e-cigarettes to get young people hooked on potentially dangerous and deadly products. While the court's ruling temporarily delays our scheduled enforcement of this ban, it will not deter us from using every tool at our disposal to address this crisis."
Symptoms of the illness include coughing and breathing trouble that can become severe enough to require that patients be attached to ventilators. Some also have nausea, vomiting and fever. Many have vaped THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana; some have vaped both THC products and nicotine. Some say they have vaped only nicotine. [Maps and charts tracking the outbreak of vaping illnesses.]
It is not yet possible to tell whether the illness comes on quickly or is the cumulative effect of long-time vaping.
The exact cause of the illness is still not known, although C.D.C. officials have been referring to "chemical exposure." The culprit could be one or more ingredients in the vaping fluids, or a toxin released from the materials used to make vaping devices, which contain heated coils that vaporize fluids or other substances. Many of the ingredients in the products are unknown.
"I wish we had more answers regarding the specific harmful products or components that are causing these illnesses," Dr. Schuchat said.
She added: "I think we have the feeling right now that there may be a lot of different nasty things in e-cigarettes or vaping products, and they may cause different harms in the lungs."
In some cases, the injury to the lung tissue looks like a chemical burn, the same kind of damage that occurs from industrial accidents where chemicals spill and people inhale poisonous fumes, experts in lung pathology from the Mayo Clinic reported on Wednesday. Their findings were based on studying samples of lung tissue from 17 patients, ages 19 to 67, who became ill after vaping. Most reported vaping THC.
Medical investigators are scrambling to find the cause of the illnesses, a task made more difficult by the booming market in vaping products, some legal and many not, from sources unknown. Some are concocted at home by users themselves. All the products are a stew of chemicals, often including flavorings, oils and solvents that may react with one another when heated, to produce still more molecules that have yet to be identified.
The Food and Drug Administration is testing vaping products, and has obtained more than 440 samples from 18 states, Judy McMeekin, the agency's deputy associate commissioner for regulatory affairs said at the briefing on Thursday.
So far, she said, no single product or substance has been identified as the source of the trouble. She said that the agency was particularly concerned about black-market sources, but that it was too soon to rule out other products.
During the briefing, Dr. Schuchat was asked if THC vaping products could be considered safe if purchased from dispensaries in states that license them.
She replied: "With all the data I've been seeing, I don't know what safe is now."

Texto completo: Readers say that we are in a state of anarchy that must be remedied, and that Democrats should broaden their focus beyond Ukraine.
To the Editor:
Re "Democrats Warn Subpoena Is Near for White House" (front page, Oct. 3):
A subpoena once meant something. Now it is a useless protocol to be ignored by the Trump administration. Attorney General William Barr is an instrument of Donald Trump. Mr. Trump has essentially captured the Justice Department from the American people.
The truth we must face is that we are now in a state of anarchy.
The rule of law has been usurped by the Trump administration. This Republican-controlled Senate has allowed Mr. Trump to undermine our democracy.
They will have one last chance during the impeachment trial to stop the monster of their creation.

To the Editor:
I would like to apologize to President Sauli Niinisto of Finland for the apparent madness of the American president sitting next to him as he raged to the press (White House Memo and news article, Oct. 3) about members of Congress trying to hold him accountable for his endless degradations of the office he holds.
I ask Mr. Niinisto not to judge all Americans by this man, as he has no self-awareness.
Someday we will elect a president by popular vote, but for now we're stuck with this guy.

To the Editor:
Re "How to Win Support for Impeachment" (Op-Ed, Oct. 1):
Elizabeth Drew is right to call for several articles of impeachment rather than only one focused on the most recent abuse of power in Ukraine and elsewhere. She suggests looking to the Watergate proceedings for guidance, and the first three articles approved by the House Judiciary Committee then apply today.
I. Obstruction of Justice.
II. Abuse of Power.
III. Contempt of Congress.
Two more articles may be added without much effort:
IV. Presidential Profiteering by Illegal Emoluments.
V. Conspiracy to Violate the Campaign Finance Laws.
The Mueller report and previous court proceedings supply a factual basis for these articles. Various fact-finding committees should also forward the conclusions of their investigations to the Judiciary Committee, which can then quickly organize this information into a concise list of "high crimes and misdemeanors" to vote on and to communicate to the American people.
Eric W. Orts

The writer is a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
To the Editor:
Elizabeth Drew notes that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her allies favor a "narrow, Ukraine-based impeachment agenda" because it is "easier for the public to understand." This view reflects the usually wise trial strategy that simpler is better, because the fact finder (judge or jury) is more likely to embrace limited evidence it understands than more substantial and complex evidence that it does not.
But this usually wise trial strategy is inapplicable here, assuming the House votes to impeach, because: a) the other non-Ukraine grounds for impeachment, particularly the president's running the government as a profit center for himself and his family, are themselves simple and easily understood by the public; and b) the object of a trial in the Senate, which would follow from impeachment, will not be to persuade the fact finder (the Republican-controlled Senate), because there is no chance of conviction in that body, but instead to lay out all the simple evidence for the public and thereby hurt President Trump's re-election prospects, which remain considerable.

Texto completo: James Franco is being sued by two former students from his acting school, who accuse "The Deuce" star of "inappropriate and sexually charged behavior. "
Sarah Tither-Kaplan and Toni Gaal, who both attended Franco's now-defunct acting school Studio 4, filed a lawsuit against him in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Thursday.
The actresses accuse Franco and his partners of "sexualizing their power as a teacher and an employer by dangling the opportunity for roles in their projects," according to the lawsuit obtained by Variety and the New York Times.
Are #MeToo men ready for a comeback? Not all accused figures have slunk away in shame
In a statement to USA TODAY, Franco’s attorney, Michael Plonsker, said the actor plans to fight the lawsuit.
"This is not the first time that these claims have been made and they have already been debunked," Plonsker said. "We have not had an opportunity to review the ill-informed Complaint in depth since it was leaked to the press before it was filed and our client has yet to even be served. James will not only fully defend himself, but will also seek damages from the plaintiffs and their attorneys for filing this scurrilous publicity seeking lawsuit. "
Franco opened Studio 4 in Los Angeles in 2014 with his business partner, Vince Jolivette, who is also named in the lawsuit, in addition to Franco's production company Rabbit Bandini. The school closed in 2017.
The lawsuit claims that Franco intimidated student actors into performing sex scenes in an "orgy type setting," all while promising "false hopes of acquiring job opportunities. "
"The reality was that (Franco) was looking to create a pipeline of young women who were subjected to his personal and professional sexual exploitation," the lawsuit added.
The situations described in the suit arose during a master class in sex scenes that Franco taught at the school. The lawsuit alleges that to take Franco’s master class, students had to audition by simulating sex acts on film, which he watched to choose candidates.
It says the class began with "encouraging female student actors to appear topless, then perform in sex scenes, then orgies and gratuitous full nudity," without the careful guidelines and closed sets that are the industry standard for shooting sex scenes.
The suit alleges that Gaal was kept out of the master class for questioning its exploitative nature.
Tither-Kaplan took the class and was subsequently cast in Rabbit Bandini films, “which she now recognizes was a direct result of her willingness to accept Franco’s exploitative behavior without complaint. ”

In 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported sexual misconduct allegations against the actor by five women, including Tither-Kaplan, who also took her accusations to Twitter.
"Hey James Franco, nice #timesup pin at the #GoldenGlobes, remember a few weeks ago when you told me the full nudity you had me do in two of your movies for $100/day wasn't exploitative because I signed a contract to do it? Times up on that!" she tweeted on Jan. 7, 2018, the same night Franco won a best-actor Golden Globe Award for "The Disaster Artist. "
Gaal, the other plaintiff in the lawsuit, is coming forward for the first time.
Franco denied the previous allegations against him. USA TODAY has reached out to the actor's representative in light of the lawsuit.
Since the allegations first emerged, Franco has made few publicity appearances, but work has not seemed to slow down.
The HBO series “The Deuce,” which he executive produces and stars in, began its third and final season on Sept. 9.

'People are being held accountable'

Texto completo: In the two years since the #MeToo movement exploded and the year since Christine Blasey Ford made her allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, speaking out about sexual assault and harassment has not become easier for victims, one of Ford's lawyers said.
“It still requires an enormous amount of courage to come forward, whether you're doing it on a very public stage like Dr. Ford or even privately in your own workplace," said attorney Lisa Banks. “Because what we have always seen and what we continue to see is retaliation, backlash, threats, and intimidation against women who stand up and accuse powerful men of sexual misconduct."
What has changed, though, is the world's receptivity to such stories, as women are increasingly being heard.
Witness the action Banks and her law partner, Debra Katz, spurred in recent weeks for the women who blew the whistle on shortlived New England Patriot Antonio Brown and longtime tenor Plácido Domingo.
“I do believe that the movement has done a great deal to educate companies, employers, etc., about how corrosive it is to ignore these kind of credible allegations because the person is perceived to be a high wage earner, mission critical, too important to fail," said Katz. “People are being held accountable and that's a good thing."
On Thursday, Banks and Katz will receive “leadership awards" for their pro bono work for Ford during last year's Senate Judiciary Committee hearingproceeding Kavanaugh's confirmation. The awards will be presented at the annual fund-raiser of the Victim Rights Law Centerin Boston, which provides free legal representation to help victims of rape and sexual assault to rebuild their lives.
The lawyers, partners at Katz, Marshall & Banks in Washington, D.C., worked behind the scenes with Ford to negotiate the terms of her appearance before the committee and to prepare her for her testimony. A newly published book, “She Said," by the New York Times reporters whose story about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein launched the #MeToo movement, reveals how hesitant Ford was to come forward and how gently the lawyers guided her.
“We always told Christine that whatever she decided, we would support her and if she decided to go forward we would fight like hell for her. But if she decided that she couldn't, we respected that," said Katz. “So, it was a roller-coaster ride. But ultimately, it was just a portrait of courage that she did get herself from someone who felt like she could never, ever do this, to someone who for four hours testified under oath, and answered every question that was asked of her and did it without rancor, and did it honestly and with respect for the process."
Banks said she believed that Ford made a difference by “standing up in front of the world and sharing that information and being so brave and courageous."
“[Kavanaugh] may be sitting on the Supreme Court, and maybe that was a foregone conclusion, but it was still an important moment for our society in terms of having that conversation about what is and is not acceptable," she said.
In the two years since Weinstein was accused of serial sexual harassment and sexual misconduct — a case in which they also were involved, representing The Weinstein Company whistle-blower Irwin Reiter — Banks and Katz have handled a litany of cases, from a billionaire philanthropist accused of leveraging donations for sex, to a congressman harassing an aide he called his “soul mate."
The vibrancy of the #MeToo movement has not dulled, Katz said, pointing to the actions taken by the Metropolitan Opera and the NFL on cases involving two of her firm's clients just last week.
The NFL launched an investigation into Brown after a female artist told Sports Illustrated that Brown behaved sexually inappropriately when he hired her to paint a mural in his home — and sent threatening messages with photos of her children on a group text to her and his friends after she reported it. That followed another woman's lawsuit, filed a day after Brown was signed by the New England Patriots, accusing Brown of rape and sexual assault.
“They took action," Banks said of the NFL. “The Patriots then chose to release him. And I suppose we can quibble with whether they should have hired him in the first instance or they felt like, well, he's going to be penalized and not be able to play so it's easy for them to do. But they did it. And I think what we've seen in years past is that the NFL and the teams in the NFL haven't always done the right thing."
Last Wednesday, Banks and the artist met with NFL officials, who are continuing an investigation into Brown, though he is no longer playing in the league. The NFL also responded to his tweet that appeared to encourage fan violence against the Sports Illustrated writer who broke the story, Banks said.
Also last week, Katz was representing Patricia Wulf, one of two women who attached their names to accusations of sexual misconduct against Domingo, the renowned opera singer. Twenty women had spoken to the Associated Press about him, but the Met's general manager Peter Gelb told chorus and orchestra members all the accusers were unnamed; that they had not come forward to other news outlets; and that the AP's reporting lacked “corroboration," National Public Radio reported.
“That might have been an argument that could have been made pre-October 2017," Katz said, pointing to the launch of the #MeToo movement. “But companies just can't do that anymore. To say, well we're giving him a pass, he's denied it, and the 20 women who have come forward with a very similar account, they can't be trusted? We're just beyond the days where that's going to work." Within days, Domingo was out.
Banks and Katz have been practicing together for nearly 20 years and spun off their own firm with partner David Marshall in 2006.
Banks, who grew up in Canton, said that she originally wanted to be a player for the Red Sox; her father finally had to break it to her that they didn't take girls. “I had to be a civil rights lawyer instead to right those wrongs," she jokes.
Founded in 2003, the Victim Rights Law Center was the first nonprofit law firm in the country dedicated to the legal needs of sexual assault survivors, providing assistance with civil matters like housing — for instance, helping someone break a lease on an apartment so she does not need to remain living where she was raped.
Past honorees include Kristin Gibbons Feden, who prosecuted comedian Bill Cosby; feminist icon Gloria Steinem; and attorney and professor Anita Hill, who spoke out about sexual harassment in 1991; US Representative Ayanna Pressley; actress and activist Ashley Judd; and The Boston Globe Spotlight Team.

Sturgill Simpson releases blazing new rock record

Texto completo: Listeners hungry for Sturgill Simpson's familiar croon better keep feasting on the old stuff – because the Kentucky songwriter's new album trades country comfort for all-out helping of rock 'n' roll grime.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer. Instead, he ventures deep into the underbelly of fuzzy, futuristic guitar rock.
Simpson recorded "Sound & Fury" at Michigan's McGuire Motor Inn, working alongside bandmates Bobby Emmett, Chuck Bartels and Miles Miller. John Hill, known for his work with Portugal. The Man and Cage The Elephant, co-produced the album.
And, if Simpson tapping into a no-nonsense dystopian soundscape wasn't enough, Simpson teamed with leading names in anime to team the 40-minute stack of new tunes with a Netflix film of the same name.
How's the album sound? And what can you expect from the Netflix film? Here's what we know about "Sound & Fury."
'Sound & Fury,' the album Simpson's 10-track "Sound & Fury" follows the subtle country storytelling of 2016's "A Sailor's Guide To Earth," which earned the major label newcomer international acclaim – including an unexpected nomination for Album of the Year at the 2017 Grammy Awards (he'd fall to Adele, but brought home Best Country Album that year).
As outlined in a New York Times profile earlier this month, Simpson found "Sound & Fury" by way of Nashville nonconformity, worn-down months on the road ("There was a point in 2017 where I thought I was just going to just go away," he said) and the immobile weeks after a sinus surgery that led him to rediscover the music of his formidable years.
In his time recovering from surgery, Simpson told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that he turned to hip-hop, the Cars and Black Sabbath, each influencing the rip-roaring sound that boils with audacity and swagger on "Sound & Fury."
A cathartic output, Simpson told the Times he wanted it to hit "like a Wu-Tang record." From the article:
"I could've very easily probably made the same record five times by now and just gone right down that middle lane and played it safe, and I'd have $80 million in the bank," Simpson said, dryly. "And I'd probably be hanging from a (expletive) rope on one of these trees over here by now, you know what I mean? So it's not worth it."
The result? A sonic onslaught that explores galaxies between genre.
Simpson blurs between disco itches and gritty guitar scratches on the album. There's the groove of instrumental opener, "Ronin;" The slick, funky flair of "A Good Look;" southern-soaked bombast with closer "Fastest Horse In Town;" and an ode to longing, reflective guitar-pop with six-minute album standout "Make Art Not Friends."
On the subtly spacey "Mercury In Retrograde," Simpson sings to the dog-and-pony show that once greeted his rising success: "They come back stage and on my bus, pretending to be my friend/ Shaking hands behind grandstands, wearing the same 'ole grin."
The songs come from "a weird spot," Simpson told Lowe earlier this year – including his distaste for the industry behind the art.
"It is a dirty toxic industry," he said. "And I wanted to express a lot of that."
'Sound & Fury,' the film A 41-minute "Sound & Fury" anime epic, now streaming on Netflix, puts colorful (and unapologetically violent) context to the album.
Simpson, a Navy veteran once stationed in Japan, enlisted acclaimed creative Jumpei Mizusaki to direct, with "Afro Samauri" creator Takashi Okazaki serving as character designer.
The film draws blood-soaked lines between good and evil, a tension illuminated by dystopian chemicals and city-sprawling guerrilla warfare.
It took about $1.2 million to produce, the Times reported and follows "hegemonic structures, politics, corruption, greed – you know, things that usually lead to really (expletive) music," Simpson said.

Texto completo: The American founders institutionalized the best of a long Western tradition of representative government with the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. These contracts outlined the rare privileges and responsibilities of new American citizens.
Yet the concept of citizenship is being assaulted on the premodern side by the legal blending of mere residency with citizenship.
Estimates on the number of undocumented American residents range from 11 million to more than 20 million. The undocumented are becoming legally indistinguishable from citizens and enjoy exemption from federal immigration law in some 500 sanctuary jurisdictions. An illegal resident of California will pay substantially less tuition at a California public university than a U.S. citizen of another state.
Multiculturalism has reduced the idea of e pluribus unum to a regressive tribalism. Americans often seem to owe their first allegiance to those who look like they do. Citizens cannot even agree over once-hallowed and shared national holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July.
It is eerie how such current American retribalization resembles the collapse of Rome, as Goths, Huns and Vandals all squabbled among one another for what was left of 1,200 years of Roman citizenship - eager to destroy what they could neither create nor emulate.
Citizenship has always been
Protected by the middle classes - on the idea that they are more independent and self-reliant than the poor, but can stand up to the influence and power of the elite.
Yet until recently, we had seen a decade of stagnant wages and entire regions ossified by outsourcing, offshoring and unfair global trade. Historically, with the demise of the middle class so follows the end of constitutional government.
But citizenship also faces a quite different and even greater postmodern threat.
Many of our coastal elites see nothing much exceptional in America, past and present. They prefer the culture and values of the European Union without worrying that the EU's progressive utopian promises have been wrecked by open borders, economically stultifying regulations, and unapologetic and anti-democratic efforts to curb free expression and local autonomy.
Often, such "citizen of the world" mentalities fuel shame over the origins and traditions of America. Transnational organizations and accords on climate, criminal justice and human rights are seen as superior to their American counterparts.
A new progressive iconoclasm seeks to destroy statues, rename streets and buildings, and wipe away art that does not reflect more global values.
Does voting - the bedrock right of the democratic citizen - matter that much anymore? In California, tens of thousands of votes were "harvested" by paid campaign operatives. There was also abuse in state agencies in sending out voter registration forms to those who were not legally entitled to vote.
Lone activist federal judges frequently overturn legislation and referenda they find contrary to their own political take on legal theory - without worry that the votes of millions are canceled in a nanosecond.
Meanwhile, the proverbial "swamp" of the bureaucratic, administrative and regulatory state is so vast and unaccountable that a few clerks can harass entrepreneurs, issue edicts with the force of legislation that ruins lives, or indict, regulate or audit a targeted individual into legal bankruptcy.
In recent years, we have seen a cake maker, a video maker, and a
National security adviser so hounded by federal bureaucrats that they either were nearly bankrupted, ended up in jail or were reduced to penury through legal costs.
We still have a Bill of Rights, but many of our constitutional protections are being rendered impotent. If a rural family cannot find ammunition at the local Walmart or gun store due to organized boycotts and threats to such establishments, then the constitutional right to bear arms is not always exercisable in a practical sense.
Brett Kavanaugh was nominated, audited and confirmed by the Senate as a Supreme Court justice. But if the New York Times and cable news can relentlessly charge without proof that nearly 40 years ago he was a teenage sexual pervert, then a distinguished judge can be rendered impotent without legal impeachment.
If a student cannot safely express opposition to abortion on demand, question the global warming narrative, or object to safe spaces, trigger warnings and race-based theme houses on campuses, does it matter that there is in theory still a First Amendment?
We are unwinding at both ends. Tribalism, the erosion of the middle class and de facto open borders are turning Americans into mere residents of a particular North American region between Mexico and Canada.
Yet even more dangerously, thanks to the fiats of unelected bureaucrats and officials, along with the social media lynch mobs who boycott, harass and shame us, our constitutional rights are now increasingly optional. They mostly hinge on whether we are judged worthy by an unelected, politically correct and morally righteous elite.
In theory, American citizenship remains the same; in reality, it is disappearing fast.

Husband of the Year? Moms say it's not William H. Macy

Texto completo: It's always the mom, isn't it? Driving the carpool, rushing forgotten sneakers to school in time for gym, baking at midnight for tomorrow's teacher-appreciation breakfast.
And now, going to the clink.
Yes, it's true that Felicity Huffman committed a crime. She paid $15,000 to get her daughter a better SAT score, and in the process cheated everyone who's playing by the rules.
But now that Huffman is bracing for two weeks in federal prison while the uncharged William H. Macy plays the supportive husband — holding her hand as she walks drawn and somber into a Boston court for sentencing, writing an emotional letter to the judge (“Watching Felicity being a mother is a wonderful thing to see") — some say a second injustice has occurred.
She's being vilified and he isn't.
“It's the same jacked-up scenario of when a dad shows up at school to help in the classroom and suddenly he's a hero," said Sherry Kuehl, author of the Snarky in the Suburbs books. “Or when a dad posts a picture on social media where he's doing his daughter's hair and the Internet explodes with warm, fuzzy accolades.
“She's getting all the daughter angst," Kuehl added. “For the rest of Huffman's life, her daughter will always have the comeback of, 'Well, what about when you didn't believe in me and thought you had to lie to get me into college?' Meanwhile, the dad is sitting pretty."
(To the many dads who are in fact equal parenting partners, we'd like to acknowledge you here. Thank you!)
What's going on? Why was Huffman arrested at gunpoint by FBI agents in an early morning raid at her Los Angeles home in March, while Macy has (so far, at least) escaped charges?
Lawyers have their theories (which we'll touch on later) and moms have theirs .
Theory number one, voiced by a surprising number of women, stems from the fact that Macy, while definitely supportive, seems removed from the kids, as if he were a very nice second husband who came along when the girls were in high school.
“It seriously made me wonder whether he's the real father," said Shari Noe.
(He is.)
Noe, a Newton psychologist who helps diagnose learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders, sees many families where the mother takes on the vast majority of child rearing responsibilities, a job that starts when the kids are born and continues through the college application process.
“Not that I'm supporting her," Noe said, “but you see these moms that get uber crazy in the process."
Indeed, Huffman said as much herself in a Sept. 4 letter she submitted to US District Judge Indira Talwani. After the mastermind of the college bribery scandal, Rick Singer, suggested that she pay to have a proctor improve her daughter's SAT score, Huffman wrote:
“I couldn't make up my mind for six weeks. . . . I felt an urgency which built to a sense of panic. . . . As warped as this sounds now, I honestly began to feel that maybe I would be a bad mother if I didn't do what Mr. Singer was suggesting."
Theory number two, which is also erroneous, is that Huffman kept the caper secret from Macy. Perhaps whispering on the phone with the crooked college coach while Macy lolled about elsewhere in the mansion in ignorant bliss.
“Mothers do all sorts of things that their partners are unaware of, especially when it comes to micromanaging their children," said Michelle Ephraim, an associate professor of English at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and the mother of four.
The secrecy, she said, stems from the desire to avoid a fight with a spouse. “College admissions gets into our deepest fears and anxieties, and it's very easy to get into an argument" over different strategies, she said.
As for Macy's so-called ignorance? “I think sometimes husbands learn not to ask about things," she said. “It's a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy."
Considering their different trajectories — Huffman's next wardrobe call will be a fitting for a prison uniform while Macy is awaiting the November premiere of the 10th season of his hit show “Shameless" — the only thing that would seem fair is if he were ignorant of the shenanigans.
But as media outlets have reported, references in the prosecution's criminal complaint suggest that Macy — identified in the complaint as “her spouse" or “Spouse" — was not only aware of the plans, but a participant in at least some of them.
Seeking to explain the prosecutors' reasoning, Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor and a professor at New York Law School, told The New York Times that, “The bottom line on Macy was that he seemed to have been less involved in the conduct. There is no doubt that the conduct could have been charged, but prosecutors use their discretion all the time, and decide not to charge somebody because they consider it either unfair or not worth the resources."
Once again, mom's the one on the job!

'Chatterley' Is to Stay In Britain

Texto completo: Originally sold to a private buyer in the U.S., the book used in the obscenity trial about D.H. Lawrence's novel was acquired by Bristol University after a fund-raising campaign.
LONDON -- It was the book that challenged Britain to face its conservatism.
"Lady Chatterley's Lover," by D.H. Lawrence, with its racy depictions of sex between an aristocratic woman and her gamekeeper, was the subject of a trial in 1960 that would test the country's newly relaxed rules against obscene publications.
The publisher, Penguin Books, won the case, a victory that heralded an era of greater freedom of expression at the dawn of the 1960s. And at the center of the trial was the judge's copy of the novel, complete with the raunchy parts annotated for him by his wife.
That copy was sold to a private buyer in the United States at a Sotheby's auction in October last year, prompting fears that the item would leave the country.
But after a crowdfunding campaign and a temporary government ban on the export of the book, Bristol University announced on Monday that it had acquired the copy.
Philippe Sands, the president of English PEN, the free-speech charity that started the crowdfunding campaign, said in a statement: "The trial involving 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' was a seminal moment in the continuing struggle for freedom of expression, and the judge's copy belongs here in the U.K., a singular reminder of the road traveled and remaining."
The campaign had aimed to match the copy's auction price of 56,250 pounds, about $ 69,000, the statement from English Pen said. The appeal eventually raised £20,000 to help the university acquire the book.
A spokeswoman for English PEN said that the money raised by the university and the fund-raising campaign went to the original buyer.
The judge's copy shows significant wear and tear. The spine is chipped, some leaves are coming loose, there is a rust mark left by a paper clip on the cover, and pages are marked with notes and underlinings by the judge, Laurence Byrne, and his wife, Dorothy Byrne.
The government announced in May that it would prevent the copy from leaving Britain in the hope that a British buyer would match the auction price.
Hayden Phillips, the chairman of the independent Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art, said in a statement at the time that "the prosecution of Penguin Books for publishing 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' was one of the most important criminal trials of the 20th century."
"Judge Byrne's copy of the novel, annotated by him and his wife, may be the last surviving contemporary 'witness' who took part in the proceedings," Mr. Phillips added.
Exporting artworks and some other cultural items that are more than 50 years old requires a special license in Britain, and the review committee concluded that "the departure of the book from the U.K. would be a misfortune because of its close connection to our history and national life."
Lawrence, one of Britain's most celebrated modernist writers, did not live long enough to see "Lady Chatterley's Lover" prevail in the British courts. The book had been published in Italy in 1928 but was long banned in its unexpurgated form in Britain and in the United States. Lawrence died in 1930.
After a change in British obscenity law in 1959, Penguin Books decided to publish a paperback edition, knowing that it was likely to become a test case. The trial in London in 1960 lasted for six days, and "raised such a furor of clashing opinion as has been experienced only once or twice since the war," the writer Jan Morris noted in The New York Times after its conclusion.
The lead prosecutor, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, was mocked for the social assumptions revealed by his opening statement in which he asked: Would you "approve of your young sons, young daughters -- because girls can read as well as boys -- reading this book?"
"Is it a book that you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?" he added.
The defense brought in 35 supporters of the novel, including the writer E.M. Forster and the Bishop of Woolwich, who reportedly said that Lawrence had portrayed sexual intercourse as "an act of Holy Communion."
The jury, three women and nine men, took three hours to deliver a verdict of not guilty in favor of the publisher.
Ulrika Maude, a professor of modern literature at Bristol University, where the trial papers of Michael Rubinstein, the lawyer for Penguin Books during the case, are also housed, said in a statement: "The trial attests to the ongoing importance of literature in addressing matters that are often seen as inadmissible or taboo in mainstream culture."
The trial quickly became a commercial triumph for Penguin -- its first 200,000 copies sold out within a day, while two million copies were sold within the next two years.
The verdict also encouraged those who yearned for social change in Britain.
"Sexual intercourse began," the poet Philip Larkin wrote in his "Annus Mirabilis," "Between the end of the Chatterley ban / And the Beatles' first L.P."

Bros Meet Feminists in Vice Media's Acquisition of Refinery29

Texto completo: Vice Media, the insurgent media brand known for its arch take on youth culture and entertainment, has acquired the women's lifestyle publisher Refinery29.
The deal is valued at about $ 400 million and includes mostly stock with some cash, according to two people familiar with the transaction who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
Refinery29 publishes entertainment content aimed at women, an audience Vice lacks, and also runs a lucrative events business. The company had been looking for possible buyers for the last few years as it faced a tough business environment. The digital media industry is dominated by Google and Facebook, which together take more than 60 percent of online advertising revenue.
Nancy Dubuc, the chief executive of Vice, called the merger "a transformative day" in a note sent to the staff Wednesday.
"With this acquisition, we'll be growing our investment in premium content production across all our divisions," she added.
The deal is the second significant merger among digital publishers in recent days. Last week, Vox Media acquired New York Media, the company behind New York magazine and its online offshoots, in an all-stock transaction that surprised the industry. Last year, several media executives discussed the likelihood that they would have to join forces, in part to counter the influence of Facebook and Google.
Ms. Dubuc, the former head of the A&E cable network, has made it her goal to turn around the money-losing Vice Media. At the DealBook conference in November, she pledged that the company would be profitable "very, very quickly."
The company laid off 10 percent of staff earlier this year and consolidated several websites under the Vice.com umbrella. Ms. Dubuc has presided over several shake-ups since taking over as Vice Media's chief executive last year.
As a result of its taking on Refinery29, Vice Media will consider cutting some jobs in its business and administrative wings, but plans to add more people in the editorial and creative departments, according to the people familiar with the deal.
Vice started as a free punk magazine in Montreal in 1994. Over the years, it has largely sloughed off its brash tone to become a global media company with about 3,000 employees. Backed by media giants like the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox, as well as the private equity firm TPG, Vice Media now includes an advertising agency, a TV network and a film production arm.
Refinery29's financial backers include WarnerMedia's Turner group and the cable giant Discovery. Both are effectively trading their Refinery29 investments for stock in Vice Media, since the deal includes little cash.
Vice Media's valuation has become a point of contention even among its own investors. Earlier this year, Disney decided the value of its investment in the company was effectively nothing, meaning it did not expect a return on its investment. In a filing this year, Disney said it had taken a $ 353 million write-down on its stake in the company.
This year, Vice announced that it had raised $ 250 million in debt financing from investors who included the billionaire George Soros.
In June, HBO canceled the nightly program "Vice News Tonight," and Josh Tyrangiel, Vice Media's executive vice president of news, who had overseen the show, announced that he was leaving the company. Jesse Angelo, a onetime publisher of The New York Post, joined Vice Media as president of global news and entertainment soon after Mr. Tyrangiel's departure.
Ms. Dubuc has also been working to bring about changes in the company's culture and workplace behavior. A 2017 New York Times investigation uncovered four settlements involving Vice Media employees and allegations of sexual harassment or defamation.
In her memo to the staff, Ms. Dubuc anticipated the remarks of critics concerning the merger of Vice Media and Refinery29.
"Predictably, after we make this announcement, we know some will think of the old Vice stereotypes and ask, how can the 'bros' ever mesh with the feminists of Refinery?"
She went on to note that, before the acquisition, half of Vice Media's work force was made up of women, and after the merger, "our company will now be majority women."
"And for all of us who don't identify in the binary," she added, "our company will remain committed to celebrating gender in all its beautiful expressions."

Texto completo: On Wednesday afternoon, news broke that Plácido Domingo, an international opera megastar who was accused of multiple instances of sexual harassment in an Associated Press investigation published in August, had resigned from his position as director of the Los Angeles Opera. Domingo has also reportedly withdrawn from his upcoming performances with the same organization. The famed singer’s resignation follows his abrupt departure last week from the Metropolitan Opera’s fall production Verdi’s Macbeth , in which he was scheduled to appear as the titular character. According to the New York Times, Christopher Koelsch, the president of the Los Angeles Opera, told his employees this week that an independent investigation into Domingo’s behavior would continue.
“I hold Los Angeles Opera very dearly to my heart and count my work to create and build it as among my most important legacies,” Domingo said in a statement LA Opera emailed to Observer. “However, recent accusations that have been made against me in the press have created an atmosphere in which my ability to serve this Company that I so love has been compromised. While I will continue to work to clear my name, I have decided that it is in the best interests of LA Opera for me to resign as its General Director and withdraw from my future scheduled performances at this time.”
As the New York Times pointed out, Domingo is still scheduled to perform this month in a concert in Moscow, in Verdi’s Nabucco at Opernhaus Zürich and in Verdi’s Macbeth at the Vienna State Opera. Whether these appointments will go forth as planned remains to be seen.

In the immediate aftermath of the publication of the AP story, organizations including the Philadelphia Orchestra and the San Francisco Opera cancelled upcoming engagements that involved Domingo. As of last week, Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, was reportedly more reluctant to sever ties with the star. According to NPR, Gelb expressed doubts to his team about the veracity of the allegations against Domingo.
“Plácido Domingo’s contributions to the cultural life of Los Angeles have been unprecedented and profound,” the Executive Committee of the LA Opera Board of Directors said in a statement to Observer. “He is not only an outstandingly talented artist, but also the driving force behind the creation, development and growth of LA Opera. Under his leadership, LA Opera became known for its spirit of collaborative creativity and its ability to attract superb performers from across the globe—including Plácido himself, who delivered more than 300 performances in 31 different roles and conducted more than 100 times in Southern California over the course of the past five decades. We thank Plácido for popularizing opera in the consciousness of Los Angeles and are deeply grateful for his inspiration and dedication to our institution and our community.”

‘Not going to take a fall': Kurt Volker, former Ukraine envoy, poised to dispute Giuliani in congressional testimony

Texto completo: Kurt Volker, the former special representative for Ukraine negotiations, will dispute Rudy Giuliani’s account of back channel meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, sources told the Washington Examiner.
“He's not going to take a fall needlessly for people if it's not warranted,” said Evelyn Farkas, a friend who worked as deputy assistant secretary of defense for three years under Barack Obama.
Volker, 54, who resigned his post as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine last week, will testify Thursday in a deposition that congressional Democrats scheduled as the first major step in an “an expeditious, coordinated” probe to impeach President Trump. Volker, who took the unpaid diplomatic assignment in addition to his work at the McCain Institute for International Leadership, is expected to prioritize defending his own reputation in a controversy that threatens to consume the administration.
Volker resigned amid a deepening controversy over Giuliani’s efforts to find evidence implicating former Vice President Joe Biden, a perceived front-runner in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, in a Ukrainian corruption scandal. In the whistleblower complaint that sparked the inquiry, Volker was portrayed as advising Ukrainian officials on “how to ‘navigate’ the demands” that Trump made during a July 25 phone call in which the president asked the Ukrainian leader to open an investigation into Biden.
“It's fair to say [Volker] resigned his position as envoy so he could assure that he could defend himself and cooperate with the committee,” said Frances Fragos Townsend, a trustee at the McCain Institute, where Volker works as executive director.
Farkas said: "He likely got involved in something sort of inadvertently, meaning he was asked to do one thing and it may have become bigger. But, he certainly would never have condoned anything that would subvert American democracy, or Ukrainian democracy, for that matter."
Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, maintains that Volker orchestrated his outreach to Zelensky’s team. “He should step forward and explain what he did,” Giuliani said in a television interview last week. “I got a call from Volker. Volker said, ‘Would you meet with him? It would be helpful to us. We really want you to do it.’”
Lawmakers await the explanation slated for Thursday.
"I believe that Kurt will take the position that he was not directing Rudy,” said Townsend. “If anything, Rudy was asking for his assistance and Kurt was not fully aware of what [Giuliani wanted] from the Ukrainians."
That forecast suggests that Volker, who rose through the ranks of the Foreign Service to be U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008, will not sacrifice his reputation and future prospects in order to protect Trump.
“If he doesn't cooperate with Congress, he certainly would have a much more difficult time assuming, in the future, a Senate-confirmed position, for obvious reasons,” Farkas said. “I think that may be a motivation, which is fine, and there may be other motivations, so let's let him speak for himself.”
Volker might not be able to convince lawmakers of his ignorance, given that he has made public statements acknowledging that some Ukrainian officials were trying to curry favor with Trump by working with Giuliani.
Farkas believes that Volker aimed to "block Giuliani from doing damage to the United States or Ukraine.”
“I think he's acknowledging that on some level he knew what was going on and he was trying to prevent it from getting out of control,” Farkas said, adding that she hadn’t spoken directly on the subject to Volker.
Friends and colleagues in both parties hope Volker can prove that he put Giuliani in contact with Zelensky’s advisers in order to shut down the effort to investigate Biden by allowing the Ukrainian leader’s team to “set him straight.”
“That would be the good news story for Kurt coming out of all of this. Or another possibility that it ends up being that he was playing more of a compromised role,” another foreign policy expert who knows Volker told the Washington Examiner on condition of anonymity. “I certainly hope it's the former, not the latter.”

Trump administration to implement DNA testing of detained undocumented people

Texto completo: The Trump administration will reportedly begin DNA testing migrants who are detained trying to enter the country illegally, according to the New York Times.
The tests will put hundreds of thousands of detained immigrants into a national criminal database and would be a large expansion of the Department of Homeland Security's use of technology to enforce the immigration laws that are currently in place.
The current FBI DNA database is generally made up of people who have been arrested, charged, or convicted of major crimes, but this move would allow for more than 40,000 new entries, as there are that many people in detention facilities.
Immigration activists have argued that the idea of testing everyone could infringe on American citizens' privacy rights in the event they are accidentally detained.
“That kind of mass collection alters the purpose of DNA collection from one of criminal investigation basically to population surveillance, which is basically contrary to our basic notions of a free, trusting, autonomous society,” Vera Eidelman, a staff lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told the Times.
The idea has already been implemented on a smaller scale at the southwestern border. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began using rapid DNA testing this summer in order to identify "fraudulent family units," however the testing that will be implemented in the coming weeks will be more comprehensive.

Texto completo: Los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) tienen diversas estrategias para vigilar física y virtualmente a los inmigrantes que buscan detener y deportar y, constantemente, modifica sus estrategias para mejorar.
Así lo reporta The New York Times, que señala que el “negocio de la deportación… ha sido transformado por el poder del big data” , lo que ha obligado a los agentes migratorios a modificar sus estrategias, sobre todo considerando que el Pew Research Center reporta que hay 10.5 millones de indocumentados en el país contra 6,100 oficiales de ‘La Migra’. Entonces, necesita hacer más con menos.
“Hay una escasez continua de personal en la agencia, donde la satisfacción laboral, aunque en aumento con (Donald) Trump , sigue siendo notablemente baja”, indica el reporte. “Existe una presión incesante de la Casa Blanca para deportar a las personas. Por lo tanto, ICE intenta encontrar eficiencias donde pueda, y utiliza tecnología, alguna de ésta diseñada para los consumidores, otras para espías o la policía, para hacer más con menos” .
La agencia no quiso compartir sobre sus técnicas de investigación, pero el Times revisó registros públicos que los oficiales de ICE revisan “terabytes de información de cientos de sistemas informáticos”.
Esos datos sobre inmigrantes provienen de gobiernos estatales y locales, de corredores de datos privados y de redes sociales.
Oficiales actuales y retirados indican que el perfil de capturas de indocumentados ha cambiado, ahora no solamente se captura a criminales, sino aquellos que hayan violado la ley migratoria, incluso los agentes completaban los procedimientos cuidadosamente antes de realizar un arresto.
“Antes de intentar un arresto, completaron un formulario, la ‘hoja de trabajo de operaciones de campo’, y lo aprobaron dos niveles de supervisores. Cuando se les da la opción, siempre perseguirían a alguien con antecedentes penales graves en lugar de a alguien sin él”, indica el Times, aunque ahora eso ha cambiado. “Las decisiones de segmentación también dependen de quién se puede encontrar. Y hoy, a quién pueden encontrar depende de quién ha dejado un rastro para que los oficiales lo sigan: personas con licencias de conducir , personas con seguro de automóvil , personas con facturas de servicios públicos , personas que pagan impuestos estadounidenses , personas con cuentas de redes sociales , personas con hogares estables , personas con niños nacidos en Estados Unidos… personas que alguna vez pensaron, aunque solo fuera por un momento, que no estaban en la lista”.
La agencia se basa en software y acuerdos de intercambio originalmente destinados a investigadores criminales y antiterroristas, “fusionando pequeños trozos de información perdida” en reportes.
“El trabajo está regulado solo por un conjunto de leyes de privacidad obsoletas y los límites de la tecnología” , alerta el Times que indica que los agentes revisan llamadas de voz y video de los detenidos en las instalaciones de ICE, así como las bases de datos de DMV sobre licencias y otros sistemas de información como CLEAR, de Thomson Reuters, dirigidos a inmigrantes.
La agencia revisa prácticamente todo en tiempo real, incluso a estadounidenses.
“Hay monitoreo mundial de los residentes estadounidenses. Todavía es una vista parcial. Pero es suficiente para mostrar la escala de la máquina”, indica.

Texto completo: Madeline Miller built a writing career on giving new life to classic tales, and a University of Scranton group will honor her for that work this weekend.
The Philadelphia-area author, who wrote the novels “The Song of Achilles” and “Circe,” will receive the 2019 Royden B. Davis, S.J., Distinguished Author Award from the Friends of the Weinberg Memorial Library at U of S on Saturday, Oct. 5. Established in 1997, the award honors notable authors of fiction and nonfiction.
During her visit, Miller will hold a free book signing at 4 p.m. in the U of S’s DeNaples Center that is open to the public, but reservations and tickets are required for the dinner and award program that follow there at 5. Proceeds benefit the Friends of the Library Endowment Fund, which supports the university library. Books will be for sale at the event.
Speaking recently by phone, Miller said meeting with fans is “always a privilege” and that receiving such honors for her work “feels like a dream.”
“Really I’m incredibly grateful,” she said. “I feel like I get to write about and talk about things that I love and have been passionate about for a long, long time. I wake up every day feeling grateful.”
A graduate of Brown University with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in classics, Miller continued her education at University of Chicago’s Committee on Social Thought and Yale School of Drama’s dramaturgy department, focusing on adapting classical texts. She spent 20 years teaching Latin, Greek and Shakespeare to high schoolers and in 2012 published “The Song of Achillies,” which follows the legendary Greek warrior, his actions in the Trojan War and his relationship with a fellow Greek prince, Patroclus. The novel became a New York Times best-seller and earned Miller the 2012 Orange Prize for Fiction.
For “Circe,” Miller returned to the mythological world of Greece, this time expanding on the story of the goddess and witch who appears in “The Odyssey.” The novel won numerous awards and was a No. 1 New York Times best-seller.
Miller developed an interest in mythology as a child, when her mother would read pieces of Homer’s “Illiad” and “Odyssey” to her. She read children’s books that told the Greek myths and took Latin as soon as she could. She credits her Latin teacher, who learned of her love for mythology, for offering to teach her Greek as well.
“Once I was reading the stuff in the original language, I fell in love,” Miller said.
Although she pursued the classics at Brown, Miller loved writing and worked on contemporary writing projects, but her first shot at telling stories herself and not just writing about or studying them came when she directed a production of Shakespeare’s “Troilus and Cressida” in college. Miller called it “this lightning bolt moment” in which she realized she could adapt classic texts for a modern audience.
“I think I (had) felt so respectful of the text and I loved the text so much that I didn’t really feel like I had anything to add to them,” she said.
She spent a decade working on the novel that shot her to fame, “and there were a lot of moments along the way that I threw out an entire draft,” Miller said. But when she finally held the finished book in her hands, she added, “it was really thrilling.”
With “Circe,” Miller tells of the goddess’ search for “a place for herself in a society that doesn’t want to give her a place,” the author explained.
“I really wanted to tell a very human story even though Circe’s a goddess,” Miller said. “It’s part of what I love about these myths, is how human they are. ... I wanted this to be a story of a woman who is born into a terrible family, a terrible situation, who has to get herself out, and what is the cost of getting herself out and how can she find a voice for herself.”
That story eventually will come to television, as HBO Max recently ordered an eight-episode series based on the novel.
“I’m thrilled, and I know there are a lot of ways for these things to detour,” Miller said, “(but) I’m so excited about the writers they have, and I’m so excited about the people who are working on it.”
Until then, Miller has some other projects to attend to: potential takes on the Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” and another mythological tale, Virgil’s “Aeneid.”

Man who threatened the Globe, other papers sentenced to four months in prison

Texto completo: For more than a week in 2018, Robert D. Chain repeatedly called the Boston Globe news desk from his Encino, Calif. home and threatened to shoot and kill employees of the newspaper.
“We will hunt you down and kill you and your dogs," Chain said in one call. “We're gonna shoot you [expletive] in the head, you Boston Globe [expletive]. We're gonna shoot every [expletive] one of you."
On Wednesday, a remorseful Chain appeared in US District Court in Boston and said he never intended to hurt anyone.
“Making those phone calls was the worst decision I've ever made. I really can't believe I said those things," Chain told Judge William Young. “I just hope that those ... people can forgive me. I truly wish them nothing but the best."
Young sentenced Chain to four months in prison, a punishment he said was necessary to reflect the gravity of making violent threats against a pillar of US democracy.
The press can be shallow and messy, at times coddling of the rich and famous, Young told Chain.
“But they're free," he said. “In today's world, where the truth is a precious commodity, done right, journalism is perhaps our last best hope of having that truth upon which this democracy depends. You attacked that."
Chain, 69, was also ordered to pay a $3,500 fine and more than $16,500 in restitution to the Globe. Federal prosecutors had sought a 10-month prison sentence for Chain.
Chain's calls began on Aug. 10, 2018, at the time the Globe's editorial page was calling on other newspapers to sign onto an editorial protesting President Donald Trump's attacks on journalists as the “enemy of the people." In June of that year, a gunman opened fire in the newsroom of the Annapolis Gazette, killing five employees.
Chain's threats were especially chilling in light of those circumstances, said Andres Picon, a Boston University senior who answered some of Chain's calls.
“The days between Mr. Chain's first call to the Globe newsroom and his subsequent arrest were undoubtedly some of the most frightening in my life," Picon told Young in a victim impact statement. “I had no idea whether Mr. Chain's threats were credible. In a time when members of the media are constantly being attacked for doing their jobs … it seemed anything was possible."
Chain had also threatened reporters at the New York Times, leaving messages filled with racial slurs and threats.
The FBI traced the calls to Chain's home. On Aug. 30, 2018, 12 days after the first calls were made to the Globe, agents searched Chain's house and found 19 firearms, including a shotgun and semiautomatic handguns, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.
Assistant US Attorney George Varghese said Chain carried out a “campaign of terror against the Boston Globe newsroom." On one call, he threatened to shoot Globe employees in the head later that day.
“That threat alone caused panic in the newsroom," Varghese said.
In May, Chain pleaded guilty to seven counts of using interstate and foreign commerce to transmit a threat to injure another person.
Chain's lawyers attributed his actions in large part to serious mental health problems that began in 2012 when his 25-year-old son committed suicide. Chain sank into a deep depression, withdrew from his friends and neighbors, and began watching cable news, said William Weinreb, one of Chain's lawyers.
After his arrest, Chain began attending anger management classes, stopped smoking marijuana, and began seeing a therapist four times a week, Weinreb said. He asked that Chain be sentenced to six months home detention and two years of supervised release.
Chain declined to comment to reporters after the hearing. His wife, son, daughter in law and grandson, a toddler, attended the sentencing.
Weinreb said Chain was “grateful" for the chance to apologize again for his actions. He said Chain's calls were “absolutely not" a threat against the press.
“It was an expression of pain and anger," Weinreb said. “He's looking forward to putting this behind him and leading a better life."

Texto completo: Les Winkeler is sports editor of the Southern Illinoisan, and will be retiring next April after 30 years on the job. He and his wife, Judy, live in Harrisburg.
1 What were your thoughts when SIU Athletic Director Jerry Kill decided to leave SIU again to become assistant coach at Virginia Tech?
Disbelief and a little disappointment. I thought Jerry had really come back to SIU to stay. He didn’t explicitly say this is where he would end his career, but I think people believed he would be here for the long haul. Jerry did a lot of good in his short tenure as SIU’s AD, but I, like of lot of other people, feel there is still work to be done. Having said that, I know how much coaching means to him. A person has to follow his/her dreams.
2 What is your favorite sport to write about?
Baseball/softball is my favorite sport to write about. Because I spent so much time playing the game, I feel I have a better grasp on the nuances and quirks of the game. On the other hand, there is nothing I like better than watching Saluki basketball. The speed of the game, the athleticism of the players is breathtaking.
3 You will retire in a few months from The Southern, where you were a reporter, sports editor and outdoors editor. What is your take on the future of print journalism?
I think it will always exist. Small-town papers are vital to the health of their communities. Newspapers cover school boards, city councils and county boards. Someone needs to serve as watchdog of the taxpayer’s dollar and newspapers are uniquely positioned to do that — either in print or augmented by online coverage. And, in these trying political times, The New York Times and Washington Post are thriving because of their investigative work. Again, newspapers are better able to devote time, resources and space to in-depth investigative journalism.
4 You have also been a member of the Southern Illinoisan editorial board. What do you think about the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump?
No person is above the law. Members of Congress, of both parties, have taken an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States. When evidence grows that a president has abused his power or broken the law, it is the constitutional duty of the House of Representatives to investigate. In this political climate, at least at this moment, it is unlikely the Senate would convict the president. However, I believe it is important for the House to proceed if for no other reason than to make it clear to future presidents the limits of executive power.
5 What would you consider to be your single greatest accomplishment in the newspaper business?
Surviving. And, that’s only half-facetious. Over the years, I’ve covered presidents, governors, big time athletes, goose callers, high school athletes and the everyday hobbies of the guy/gal who lives next door. The best accomplishment? Having people say this story or that story made me smile. Thanks. That makes it all worthwhile.

'To Kill a Mockingbird': a story for white people

Texto completo: When I first met Atticus Finch, the hero of "To Kill a Mockingbird," I did not have the vocabulary of critics who described him as a "moral compass," but he served that role for me in my formative days. Like many a person who pursued law as a field of study, I had Atticus Finch in mind when I went to law school: a man who literally faced down a mob of his own neighbors to protect an innocent black man in the darkest of dark times in the rural South.
I was introduced to Atticus in the film version of the book that starred Gregory Peck, and I saw it where I generally watched movies while growing up in then-rural Conyers, Georgia: on television. The American Film Institute has named Atticus the greatest movie hero of the 20th century.
Last week, I could hardly wait to visit with him again, this time at the Shubert Theater in New York City. There the 1960 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that became the 1962 film for which Peck won an Academy Award is a critically acclaimed play. The star, Jeff Daniels, is leaving the role next month, so I wanted to experience his Atticus.
Mr. Daniels is magnificent and the play written by Aaron Sorkin is, as a New York Times critic said, "a Mockingbird for our moment." But as I was transported to the fictional Maycomb, Alabama, of the 1930s, along with about 1,400 other members of the audience, I was struck by something I had not considered before: This is really a story for white people. More specifically, it provides an opportunity for them to feel good about themselves for recognizing injustice and imagining themselves as Atticus' allies.
This mature black woman now realizes just how flawed Atticus Finch is as a moral compass. Had he not been so stubbornly wedded to the notion of decency in everyone - even hardcore racists - he might have provided a better defense for Tom Robinson, the innocent black man accused of raping a young white woman. Had his glasses been less rosy, he might have known what his wise black housekeeper, Calpurnia, knew: Those jurors came into the trial as monsters and left, after convicting Tom in 37 minutes, as murderers.
As 19th-century investigative reporting by Ida B. Wells and more recent studies by the Equal Justice Initiative attest, black men in real life have often been accused of raping white women when the truth was something else. In Mockingbird, Tom Robinson had the audacity to feel sorry for a young white woman who was burdened with rearing a gaggle of younger siblings while fending off her drunken and abusive father - the actual rapist. She flirted with Robinson, who did chores for her out of pity - and that was an affront to her father's sense of white superiority. So at dad's bidding, she hollered rape.
Standing up for racial justice is always commendable. But those on whose behalf one is standing need to be heard. What makes Mr. Sorkin's version of Mockingbird palatable in these times is that, unlike in the novel or the movie, Calpurnia (superbly played by the actress LaTanya Richardson Jackson) is not just a quiet servant. She stands up to Atticus and tries to set him straight on the matter of deep-seated racism and its mauling of justice. She tells him that while he insists on respecting Maycomb's racists and giving them the benefit of the doubt, he is actually disrespecting people like her.
In the fight for justice, as that old church song goes, "there's plenty good room." Sometimes the differences in experiences and expectations make for uncomfortable alliances. For instance, some black people come to the reproductive rights struggle knowing that black women were experimented upon and subjected to eugenics and forced sterilizations in the past. Next year, we will celebrate the centenary of the 19th Amendment, knowing that some of the leading suffragettes were racists and that in Alabama and Georgia and other parts of the Old Confederacy, black women - and men - had to wait for passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 to celebrate.
So, yes, the Broadway production is "a Mockingbird for our moment," with lessons for all the would-be Atticuses who realize that the fight can succeed only when they listen to, and treat as equals, the Toms and Calpurnias.

On his new album "Sound & Fury," Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer. Instead, he ventures deep into the underbelly of fuzzy, futuristic guitar rock.
Simpson recorded "Sound & Fury" at Michigan's McGuire Motor Inn, working alongside bandmates Bobby Emmett, Chuck Bartels and Miles Miller. John Hill, known for his work with Portugal. The Man and Cage The Elephant, co-produced the album.
And, if Simpson tapping into a no-nonsense dystopian soundscape wasn't enough, Simpson teamed with leading names in anime to team the 40-minute stack of new tunes with a Netflix film of the same name.
How's the album sound? And what can you expect from the Netflix film? Here's what we know about "Sound & Fury."
'Sound & Fury,' the album Simpson's 10-track "Sound & Fury" follows the subtle country storytelling of 2016's "A Sailor's Guide To Earth," which earned the major label newcomer international acclaim – including an unexpected nomination for Album of the Year at the 2017 Grammy Awards (he'd fall to Adele, but brought home Best Country Album that year).
As outlined in a New York Times profile earlier this month, Simpson found "Sound & Fury" by way of Nashville nonconformity, worn-down months on the road ("There was a point in 2017 where I thought I was just going to just go away," he said) and the immobile weeks after a sinus surgery that led him to rediscover the music of his formidable years.
In his time recovering from surgery, Simpson told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that he turned to hip-hop, the Cars and Black Sabbath, each influencing the rip-roaring sound that boils with audacity and swagger on "Sound & Fury."
A cathartic output, Simpson told the Times he wanted it to hit "like a Wu-Tang record." From the article:
"I could've very easily probably made the same record five times by now and just gone right down that middle lane and played it safe, and I'd have $80 million in the bank," Simpson said, dryly. "And I'd probably be hanging from a (expletive) rope on one of these trees over here by now, you know what I mean? So it's not worth it."
The result? A sonic onslaught that explores galaxies between genre.
Simpson blurs between disco itches and gritty guitar scratches on the album. There's the groove of instrumental opener, "Ronin;" The slick, funky flair of "A Good Look;" southern-soaked bombast with closer "Fastest Horse In Town;" and an ode to longing, reflective guitar-pop with six-minute album standout "Make Art Not Friends."
On the subtly spacey "Mercury In Retrograde," Simpson sings to the dog-and-pony show that once greeted his rising success: "They come back stage and on my bus, pretending to be my friend/ Shaking hands behind grandstands, wearing the same 'ole grin."
The songs come from "a weird spot," Simpson told Lowe earlier this year – including his distaste for the industry behind the art.
"It is a dirty toxic industry," he said. "And I wanted to express a lot of that."
'Sound & Fury,' the film A 41-minute "Sound & Fury" anime epic, now streaming on Netflix, puts colorful (and unapologetically violent) context to the album.
Simpson, a Navy veteran once stationed in Japan, enlisted acclaimed creative Jumpei Mizusaki to direct, with "Afro Samauri" creator Takashi Okazaki serving as character designer.
The film draws blood-soaked lines between good and evil, a tension illuminated by dystopian chemicals and city-sprawling guerrilla warfare.
It took about $1.2 million to produce, the Times reported and follows "hegemonic structures, politics, corruption, greed – you know, things that usually lead to really (expletive) music," Simpson said.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Sturgill Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer.

Texto completo: There is no gentle word in the American vernacular for someone who would put his own country's fundamental interests at risk in order to advance his own personal ambitions. But, based on his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, it is clear that U.S. President Donald J. Trump did just that.
And that is why the House of Representatives must proceed with impeachment even though many of its members are reluctant to do so because of the action's potential impact on next year's presidential elections. An already whiny Mr. Trump is itching to present himself as "victim."
The matter is made even more complicated by the fact that Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, apparently went for a dip in the proverbial Ukranian swimming hole, a very muddy and corrupt sort of place.
Anyone who has been a parent knows the frequent futility of trying to head an offspring off a bad course. At the same time, if the elder Mr. Biden had said to young Hunter, "Look, son, I am planning to run for president next year, could you just stay away from Ukraine? Look at what it got Paul Manafort," it is well possible that Hunter would have sought and found other employment.
As it is, it is quite possible that impeachment of Mr. Trump - with Ukraine as the centerpiece - will do as much damage to Mr. Biden as to Mr. Trump.
So Democrats might want to begin hedging their bets behind a candidate other than Mr. Biden. As for Mr. Trump, it remains unimaginable that he would invite the Ukrainians and Russians into the 2020 election in return for dirt on a Democratic candidate and his son.
Parallel to the talk around impeachment has been discussion of climate change. To that end, I'd like to once again express my concern at the Trump administration's inattention to this issue. It is part of the job of presidents to look at long-term concerns and address them. Forty inches of snow in Montana at the end of last month is the latest loud fireball in the night signaling the importance of this subject. Not to mention the hurricanes in Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and elsewhere. (Could Mar-a-Lago be next?)
This is a long-range issue. Members of Congress are not going to take it on. It is existential to the Earth's inhabitants, which, by the way, include Americans. We all know that Mr. Trump opposes American participation in global efforts to address climate change because his predecessor, Barack Obama, was active in that area. That flatly won't do. This issue has dire consequences not just for all of us, but for all the generations to follow.
Finally, I'd like to note the passing of a friend of mine, Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson. He was best known for having gone to Niamey, the capital of Niger, to attempt to verify the claim of the George W. Bush administration that Niger had sold uranium to Iraq, which would have reinforced the Bush administration's case for war against Iraq. Joe found that the sale did not occur and, when the Bush administration rejected his conclusions, he took them to The New York Times in an opinion column. Even when the administration responded by outing his wife, Valerie Plame, as a career undercover CIA agent, Joe stuck to his guns.
He was among the best of career Foreign Service officers, spending his life in places like Brazzaville and Baghdad. I remember him picnicking on a sandy island in the middle of the Congo River. I'll miss him.

ELECTION 2020; They kiss babies with those mouths; Does cussing alienate voters or make candidates more relatable?

Texto completo: The subject line, targeting President Trump, was purposely provocative: A string of angry emojis and a call to "dump the *^*%#%/!!!!!!!"
"Sometimes," read the email launching a progressive fundraising drive, "cursing is required."
Sometimes actually seems to be quite often, as the path to the White House has become a blue streak of vulgarity, cuss words and four-letter effusions.

Trump and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker have employed a barnyard-related expletive numerous times. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock has offered a crude reworking of his campaign's catchphrase, "Governors get stuff done." Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke markets T-shirts echoing his profanely stated concern about gun violence and proudly boasts of his off-color vocabulary.
"I was talking to some people today," he said during a recent stop in Los Angeles, "and somebody said, 'I'm so glad that you say f--, because I say f--.' "
The profusion of profanity, which has drastically increased during the 2020 campaign, stems from numerous factors, including the mores of a less decorous society, the cultural influence of anything-goes cable TV and the internet, and, not least, a president who began shredding political norms and behavioral boundaries the moment he launched his candidacy.
Because of Trump's success, "politicians on both sides of the aisle are thinking, 'Maybe profanity, which seems less scripted and guarded, is something I should try out,' " said Karrin Vasby Anderson, an author and political communications expert at Colorado State University.
Indeed, GovPredict, a public affairs software firm that aggregates data for trade groups and other clients, has found a notable rise in foul-mouthed political speech in the last five years, and especially since the presidential campaign began in earnest this year. Researchers scouring Twitter found more than 2,400 uses of profanity by state and federal lawmakers so far this year -- "jackass" and "crap" being the mildest of the 13 expletives tallied -- compared with fewer than 850 in all of 2018.
The cussing has become so contagious that ABC warned participants in the last Democratic debate there would be no broadcast delay, hence no time to bleep four-letter words. "Candidates should therefore avoid cursing or expletives in accordance with federal law," the network urged. (Save for the odd "damn" and "hell," the 10 spirited contestants complied.)
Other broadcasters and news organizations have had to relax their standards or find creative means of quotation to avoid offending their audiences.
It's not as though politicians are national arbiters of good taste.
Columnist Judith Martin, who has spent decades defending standards of decorum and politesse under the pen name Miss Manners, said no one should look to elected officials to model upstanding speech or good behavior.
"That would be pretty pathetic," she said, though "not as bad as looking to rock stars and movie stars."
Nor should the occasional -- or not so occasional -- curse word come as a surprise. Politicians are people, after all, and not plaster saints. That said, the many indelicate utterances of President Nixon, famously rendered as "expletive deleted" in transcripts of his secret White House tapes, still held the capacity to shock when they were revealed nearly half a century ago.
Eyebrows arched in 2000 when George W. Bush, running for president, described a New York Times political writer as a "major league asshole" and again in 2010 when Vice President Joe Biden used an unprintable modifier -- "this is a big f--ing deal" -- to express his enthusiasm over the signing of the Affordable Care Act.
In each of those episodes, however, the statements were meant to be private. Nixon appealed to the Supreme Court to fight public release of the raw tapes -- along with their evidence of criminal wrongdoing -- and Bush and Biden were both inadvertently caught speaking on live microphones.
What's different about today's cursing candidates is the deliberate nature of their unrefined language.
Trump, a virtuoso at reading a crowd, cannot help but note the frisson of excitement at rallies when he employs "hell" for emphasis, as in suggesting those in the country illegally need to "get the hell out" of the United States. (It's a word his pious vice president, Mike Pence, would never use.)
Trump's use of the bovine epithet to impugn the White House investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III went over so well at a gathering of conservative activists that the president repeated it days later on the campaign trail; soon a variant, #RidiculousBull, surfaced on Twitter.
The White House declined to comment on Trump's use of profanity.
John Murphy, an expert on political rhetoric and its evolution, sees a degree of calculation in the cussing.
"It's a way to say, 'I'm so passionate about this issue it's just bursting out of me,'" said Murphy, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "It's a sign of authenticity: 'I'm real.' "
O'Rourke suggested as much when asked recently about his not-infrequent dropping of f-bombs. Earlier this year, he forswore their use after being confronted by a concerned voter in Wisconsin.
"We already have one vulgar in chief," said the man at a meet-and-greet in Madison. "Do we need to replace him with another?"
"Great point," O'Rourke responded. "And I don't intend to use the f-word going forward."
That changed in the aftermath of August's mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, when the candidate fell back on his old speech pattern, offering four-letter commentary on both Twitter and national TV. In defense, he said the normal parameters of debate are too confining for these highly contentious times.
"Our political rhetoric and our language has really been insufficient in describing just what is happening in this country today and the threat posed by Donald Trump," O'Rourke said after a heartrending tour of Los Angeles' skid row. "I think the focus-group-driven, poll-tested, triangulated, careful language has kept us from seeing things for what they are, calling them by their true name.
"And when something's f--ed up," he said, "saying it's f--ed up is really important."
Kathryn Jones, who heads the Collective Agency, a digital media company for progressive organizations, offered the same crisis-mode justification for her provocative news release referring to the president as "*^*%#%/!!!!!!!"
"The idea of being nice and [politically correct] just feels useless and old news," Jones said. "These past three years have been taxing on all of us, personally and politically, and now is not the time to be worried about who we're offending."
There is, however, a risk of backlash from voters accustomed to more dignified language and comportment from those who aspire to sit in the Oval Office.
Judging from her 90-year-old mother, for one, Penn State's Mary Stuckey believes older voters are far more likely to cringe than thrill to the sound of a White House contestant in unexpurgated flight.
"She's used to my potty mouth. But she doesn't want to hear it from her president," said Stuckey, who studies political communication and campaign rhetoric. "Many people would prefer their professionals to be professional."
Other experts agreed.
"Right now 'appropriate' and 'authentic' are in a war," said Murphy, hoping his preference for the former doesn't make him "sound like an old fuddy-duddy." (He's 59.)
But it seems as though the generation gap, a cultural touchstone of the 1960s, is alive and well.
O'Rourke, 46, recalls being admonished during his 2018 Texas Senate campaign by a woman who brought her grandson to a campaign stop in San Antonio and asked the candidate to stop swearing. "It really turns people off," she said.
As they were leaving, he recounted, the young man turned and offered his advice. "Keep it up," he whispered.

Texto completo: She traveled in the same circles as Pollock and de Kooning, but recognition in a male-dominated genre often eluded her.
Mary Abbott, who was at the heart of the Abstract Expressionist movement in New York in the 1940s and '50s but, like other women painting in that genre, received far less recognition than her male counterparts, died on Aug. 23 in Southampton, N.Y. She was 98.
Thomas McCormick of the McCormick Gallery in Chicago, which represented her, announced the death.
Ms. Abbott painted bold, colorful works, often inspired by nature or music, and traveled in the same circles as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and other artists who were redefining painting in the years after World War II. De Kooning in particular, 17 years her senior, became a friend, lover and protector, including from some of the other male artists.
"I didn't like Pollock much," Ms. Abbott related in an interview for the biography "de Kooning: An American Master," by Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan (2004). "When he was sober he didn't talk, and when he was drunk Bill had to keep pulling him off of me."
That vivid description conveys what women trying to make a name for themselves in that world were facing.
"Mary Abbott was an early participant in the development of Abstract Expressionism," said Gwen Chanzit, curator of the 2016 Denver Art Museum exhibition "Women of Abstract Expressionism," which included works by Ms. Abbott, "but like other women painters, she was mostly left out of historical accounts of this male-dominated movement. Only now are the women of Abstract Expressionism beginning to be recognized for their contributions."
Unlike some of her contemporaries -- among them Lee Krasner (1908-84), Pollock's wife, and Jay DeFeo (1929-89) -- Ms. Abbott lived to see a resurgence of interest in the work of female Abstract Expressionists.
"To see this and other early works by Ms. Abbott together is a treat," Benjamin Genocchio, reviewing a 2008 show at the Spanierman Gallery in East Hampton, N.Y., featuring several of her paintings, wrote in The New York Times, "for most come from private collections and have rarely been publicly shown. Few of her works are on permanent display in New York-area museums. That is a shame, for she is one of the last great Abstract Expressionist painters of her generation."
Mary Lee Abbott was born on July 27, 1921, in New York City, and for her first two decades seemed headed for an entirely different sort of life. Her father, Henry, was a Navy captain and recipient of the Navy Cross, and her mother, Elizabeth, a poet and syndicated columnist, was a member of the socially prominent Grinnell family. Ms. Abbott was first singled out in The Times and other newspapers not as an artist but as a debutante, her high-society activities documented in painstaking detail.
"Debutantes of this season, headed by Miss Mary Lee Abbott, granddaughter of Mrs. William Morton Grinnell, were among the groups rehearsing this morning at Conscience Point for the Southampton tercentenary pageant, 'Founded for Freedom,"' The Times reported on Aug. 9, 1940, "which will be given next Wednesday and Thursday at North Sea, within sight of the landing place of the community's first settlers."
By then, though, Ms. Abbott had already begun taking classes under George Grosz at the Art Students League in Manhattan. After a foray into modeling -- she appeared in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and other magazines -- she moved in 1946 into a cold-water flat at 88 East 10th Street, near Washington Square Park, and plunged into the artist life.
De Kooning, according to "An American Master," used to bring her kerosene to make sure she had heat. They were romantically involved for some years.
"There were no dinners," she was quoted as saying in that book. "There wasn't money for that. Then later we went to the Cedar Bar." That tavern was a famed gathering place for avant-garde artists and writers. Pollock, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell and other noted Abstract Expressionists congregated there.
Ms. Abbott was by then separated from Lewis Teague, an artist she had married in 1943, and in 1949 she went to the Virgin Islands to obtain a divorce from him. There she met Tom Clyde, a retired investor, and they married the next year. They had a residence on Long Island, but because he had back problems, they spent winters in Haiti and St. Croix, and Ms. Abbott's paintings began to be influenced by the people and lush landscapes she found there. Later, when she had once again settled in Southampton, her garden inspired her work.
"Mythology and religion were touchstones, but nature was Abbott's lifelong interest," Ms. Chanzit said by email. "Her free brushwork was particularly inspired by place and by the variations of color and light in the natural world. Her paintings were never documents of specific sites, but her personal responses to them."
She and Mr. Clyde divorced in 1966, and she spent the 1970s teaching at the University of Minnesota. Then she returned to the East Coast, for some years dividing her time between a loft on West Broadway in Manhattan and a small house in Southampton. A decade ago she finally gave up the loft.
Ms. Abbott is survived by a half sister, Elizabeth Abbott.
In 2017 the online gallery IdeelArt wrote about Ms. Abbott, pondering why she was not better known.
"How is it that an artist whose work is considered to have had a profound impact on one of the most important art movements of the past century is also somehow practically unknown to contemporary audiences?" the article asked.
"Based on interviews Abbott has given, things like having her accomplishments touted, getting credit for her influence and being recognized for her contributions to art history are of little importance to her.

Texto completo: A whistle-blower said advisers improperly restricted access to a record of President Trump's Ukraine call. Here is how that storage system works.
WASHINGTON -- The whistle-blower who revealed President Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine's leader to open investigations that could benefit him politically also accused White House officials of essentially hiding a rough record of the conversation by placing it in the same highly restricted computer system for closely guarded government secrets.
In his complaint, the whistle-blower cited White House officials who portrayed the storage of the call record in that system as "solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive -- rather than national security sensitive -- information" and labeled it an "abuse." Here is how the restricted storage system works, according to interviews with more than a half-dozen former National Security Council staff members who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
How do aides usually store records of presidential calls with foreign leaders?
Most of the time, the National Security Council -- the foreign policy arm of the White House -- memorializes presidential phone or video calls with foreign heads of state on the so-called TNet system, the officials said. This is a top-secret-level computer network that is the main platform the aides use to do their jobs. It connects with a top-secret network called JWICS, which is more widely used elsewhere in the executive branch.
TNet has access controls and auditing safeguards. For example, it keeps track of who created or uploaded files, who looked at them, who modified them and how and who printed them out. When officials create a "package" -- essentially, a new file -- in TNet, they can set controls so any colleague who works on a particular subject, like European affairs or counterterrorism, has access.
What goes in TNet?
Officials can store any file that is classified to the top-secret level -- the highest classification -- so long as it is not "code word," a term referring to a specialized category of even more delicate top-secret information that officials are permitted to know about only if they have been granted specific access to it.
Officials with a general top-secret security clearance will not be given code-word clearance to learn about covert activities unrelated to their work. For example, an aide working on North Korea policy would not have been told about planning for the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan. Similarly, files containing intelligence supporting the planned raid were not stored in the ordinary TNet system.
Where does the National Security Council store its more sensitive files?
The council also has an even more locked-down system called NICE, for N.S.C. Intelligence Collaboration Environment. NICE appears to be what the whistle-blower was referring to as a "stand alone" computer system managed by the council's directorate for intelligence programs. One former official said it was better understood as a subdomain of TNet.
Foreign policy aides typically use NICE to develop and store documents related to code-word programs. For example, staff members working on a covert activity might use NICE to draft a presidential finding or decision memo about it. When they are done, they would print a copy for the president to sign.
Why store secrets in NICE?
It significantly reduces the number of people who can gain access to it. About only 20 percent of National Security Council staff members are NICE users, one former official said. They can log into the system from their work computers using virtual private network software that limits each of them to using that particular workstation.
When NICE users create or upload a new file, they can give only other individual NICE users access to it by name; unlike in TNet, they cannot invite entire groups, the former official said.
Is it an "abuse" to use the NICE system to store a file that is not top-secret code word?
Using the NICE system to curtail access to the record of Mr. Trump's call with the leader of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, may very well be, as the whistle-blower also wrote, a sign "that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call." But calling it an "abuse" appears to be subjective.
Generally, the national security adviser can decide who can see what files. No rule prohibits putting a file with a lower-level classification into the NICE system in order to take advantage of its greater access restrictions, a former official said.
By contrast, the official said, it would clearly be an abuse -- violating a specific prohibition in an executive order governing classified information -- to mark something classified at an unjustifiably higher level in order to conceal violations of the law or prevent embarrassment. Here, however, the released call record was merely marked "secret," a lower level of classification than "top secret."
How do readouts of head-of-state calls get put together?
According to multiple former officials who have helped create the records, the process typically starts with a note-taker who works for the White House Situation Room and monitors the call. The Situation Room uses voice-to-text software to create a rough transcription in real time -- no recording is made -- and then the note-taker takes a first pass at cleaning it up by correcting any obvious garbled moments.
That draft is then passed to a subject-matter expert on the National Security Council staff who was also listening to the call. That specialist -- who has a greater familiarity of foreign names and places -- edits the record. At the end of the process, the aides give the record to the national security adviser.
Is the White House account of Trump's Ukraine call accurate and complete?
Beyond the fact that the memo is not a verbatim transcript, it contains three ellipses where Mr. Trump was speaking -- and each in a place where he was asking the Ukrainian president for investigations.
It is not clear if this indicates that Mr. Trump trailed off or that something was cut out of the reconstruction. It is also not clear whether any notes exist by American officials that would indicate whether he said anything more in those spots.
But one official said that any notes or draft documents discussed by two or more National Security Council officials count as a "record" that may not lawfully be destroyed under the Presidential Records Act. However, the initial file produced by the voice-to-text software would not count as a record and could be lawfully deleted, the official said.
What about in Ukraine?
It is not clear whether the administration of Mr. Zelensky recorded his call with Mr. Trump. Previous Ukrainian governments did not record calls with world leaders, according to a former senior Ukrainian official familiar with the process. Instead, with high-profile and strategically important foreign officials, Ukrainian leaders would have advisers listen in and take detailed notes, he said.
The transcript released by the White House of Mr. Trump's July call with Mr. Zelensky was accurate and comprehensive, a Ukrainian official familiar with it said, adding that significant information was not omitted, including by the ellipses.

Texto completo: Headnote IMPEACHMENT PROBE
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump pushed the Australian prime minister during a recent telephone call to help Attorney General William Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Trump hopes will discredit the Mueller investigation, according to two U.S. officials with knowledge of the call.
The White House restricted access to the call's transcript to a small group of the president's aides, one of the officials said, an unusual decision that is similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president that is at the heart of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Trump. Like that call, the discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia shows the extent to which Trump sees the attorney general as a critical partner in his goal to show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt and partisan origins and the extent that Trump sees the Justice Department inquiry as a potential way to gain leverage over America's closest allies.
And like the call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the discussion with Morrison shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.
Trump initiated the discussion in recent weeks with Morrison explicitly for the purpose of requesting Australia's help in the Justice Department review of the Russia investigation, according to the two people with knowledge of the discussion. Barr requested that Trump speak to Morrison, one of the people said. It came only weeks after Trump seemed to make military aid to Ukraine contingent on Zelenskiy doing him the "favor" of helping Barr with his work.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment nor did a spokesperson for the Australian prime minister.
In making the request, Trump was in effect asking the Australian government to investigate itself. The FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election began after Australian officials told the bureau that the Russian government had made overtures to the Trump campaign about releasing political damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
Australian officials shared that information after its top official in Britain met in London in May 2016 with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who told the Australian about the Russian dirt on Clinton.
Papadopoulos also said that he had heard that the Russians had "thousands" of Clinton's emails from Joseph Mifsud, an academic. Mifsud, who was last seen working as a visiting professor in Rome, has disappeared. Trump allies, like the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have put forth an unsubstantiated claim that Western intelligence agencies planted Mifsud to trap Papadopoulos.
Barr flew to Italy last week and met with Italian government officials Friday. The Justice Department spokeswoman would not say whether he discussed the election inquiry in those meetings, but former Justice Department officials said that Barr would need to ask foreign countries for cooperation in turning over documents pertaining to the 2016 election.
Barr began a review of the Russia investigation this year with the stated goal of determining whether law enforcement or intelligence officials acted inappropriately in their decision during the height of the 2016 presidential campaign to begin investigating whether the Trump campaign was conspiring with Russia's election interference. But the president has made no secret he sees a larger purpose: to validate his victory and to settle scores with his perceived "deep state" enemies.
The Justice Department said last week that it is exploring the extent to which other countries, including Ukraine, "played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign." At the very least, Barr has made it clear that he sees his work treading into sensitive territory: how the law enforcement and intelligence agencies of the United States' closest allies share information with U.S. officials.
Mueller's investigation confirmed that Australia played a central role in the origins of the original FBI investigation, even if his final report does not mention the country by name. It said that information from a "foreign government" prompted the FBI to "open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities."
But like so much about the preelection period, the episode has been the subject of a counternarrative marbled with conspiracy: that the Obama administration had dispatched the Australian official, Alexander Downer, to spy on the Trump campaign as part of a broader effort to help Clinton get elected. There is no evidence to support this, but the conspiracy has been advanced by some of the president's allies in Congress, by some Fox News commentators and in frequent tweets by Papadopoulos.

Want to learn how to draw? Tech can help

Texto completo: "Any one who can learn to write, can learn to draw," John Gadsby Chapman wrote in his 19th-century instruction manual, "The American Drawing-Book." This can-do sentiment dates back to an era when lead pencils and chalky pastels were standard. Today's artists - and wannabe artists - also have the option of easy-to-use digital gadgets.
If you mainly doodle, your device's notes app may suffice. But if you're serious about sketching in pixels as a way to relax, to focus and to express your creativity, a responsive art app with a suite of precision tools is a more fulfilling choice.
Here's how to get started, even if you don't know how to draw (yet).
Step 1: Select your stylus
If you want fine lines, you'll need to ditch your fingertip for a stylus. But not all styluses are the same. Nor are their prices. Inexpensive models use simple capacitive touch to interact with the screen, and pricier styluses have wireless connections and pressure-sensitive tips. Just make sure your choice works with your device.
If you want designed compatibility, Microsoft has its $100 Surface Pen for its Surface tablets, and Google's $99 Pixelbook Pen is made for its Pixelbook. Have an iPad? Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, recommends the Apple Pencil; prices range from about $99 to $129, depending on the Pencil model.
If those options don't fit your budget, Wirecutter also likes the $10 Adonit Mark, which works with any touch screen. Adonit makes several stylus models in a range of prices, and the Friendly Swede sells a 4-in-l Stylus for $25 on Amazon.
Step 2: Choose a drawing app
Visit your app store and search for drawing programs. For the cost-conscious, Autodesk Sketch-Book is a versatile app that can take a project all the way from a basic line drawing to a finished illustration with color, textures and shadows. It's now free for individual use and runs on Android, iOS and Windows 10 touch-screen devices.
Adobe offers its free Adobe Photoshop Sketch, as well as Adobe Illustrator Draw (for vector-based art that can be resized without losing quality) for Android and iOS. And Procreate ($5 for iPhone; $10 for iPad), is an extremely powerful and well-reviewed art app for iOS hardware.
Using Windows 10? Microsoft's Paint 3D (or classic Paint) offers basic drawing tools and a shape library for making art from stock objects.
Step 3: Dive in
Some drawing apps can feel overwhelming at first, especially if you're new to making digital art. Look for an integrated tutorial to point you to the pen, brush, shape and color tools tucked under the menu icons. Then just start freestyling with your stylus.
It may take a while to get the hang of the software, but be patient and allow yourself time to explore and experiment with your digital art supplies. (Need more help? Jump to Step 5.)
Step 4: Take Art Lessons
If you have the tools but fear you lack the talent, let technology be your teacher. Look for "drawing lessons" in the Education section of your app store to get you started with the fundamentals and build your fine motor skills.
ShadowDraw (free, with new lessons as in-app purchases) for the iPad and Apple Pencil is one program that teaches drawing forms by having you follow along the animated pen strokes of another artist in an updated take on the "copying the masters" approach.
Although it can be finicky, SketchAR is another inventive program with a collection of instructional aids; it's free with in-app purchases (for extra lessons and tools) and works on Android, iOS and Microsoft HoloLens.
For drawing directly on the screen, SketchAR includes a library of animated lessons to follow. The app can also convert your photos into outlines that you trace with your stylus to train your hand and eye.
Step 5: Read the friendly manual
Feeling lost in a screen of cryptic menus and complex tools? Look for support-site guides that walk you though less-obvious tasks - like varying the line weight of the pencil tool, working with image layers or adjusting the program's sensitivity to the stylus.
Autodesk Sketchbook's support page is full of tips. Adobe has an online Help Center and builds basic guides into its apps. Procreate has an extensive handbook available for download as a PDF or as an Apple iBook.
The web is full of video tutorials for art apps and drawing instruction. And, if you really want to go old school, there's a downloadable digital copy of "The American Drawing-Book" in the Internet Archive.

2 big reasons why Trump's Australia ask is different from his Ukraine call

Texto completo: Critics of President Trump are trying to lump together a story that he asked the Australian prime minister to assist Attorney General William Barr's inquiry into the origins of the Robert Mueller investigation with his decision to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Joe and Hunter Biden. But this is a mistake. The episodes are different from each other in two important ways.
The first important difference is that Trump asked Zelensky to "look into" Biden, a leading political rival, for something that is not under investigation in the United States. In contrast, Barr has been quite open about the fact that the Department of Justice has been looking into the origins of the Russia investigation. Due to the international nature of what is being looked at, that investigation requires the cooperation of multiple foreign governments. Though we do not have a transcript of the Australia call, it would be perfectly appropriate for Trump to make sure that Barr gets all the cooperation he needs overseas to conduct a thorough investigation.
The second important difference is that when it came to Ukraine, Trump involved his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in discussions with a foreign government about investigating a political rival. It is much more difficult to make the case that Trump was acting out of the national interest to rid Ukraine of corruption when he's dispatching his personal lawyer to look into the case. In May, Giuliani told the New York Times that he was seeking information from Ukraine that "will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.”
Now there are various criticisms that can be leveled against Trump for the Australia call. Such as, that in his interactions with foreign leaders, he's overly prioritizing issues that have implications for him politically. That can also be countered by the legitimate reasons the president would seek cooperation for a DOJ investigation.
But lumping these two calls together only muddies the issue and makes it more difficult to articulate exactly what was so especially egregious about Trump's call with Zelensky.

Texto completo: Support for removing President Donald Trump from office has leapt since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened an impeachment inquiry against him, but his Republican backers appear to represent an increasingly loyal minority, according to polls released this week.
As support for impeachment grows, the president’s base is digging in its heels. But he remains disliked and untrusted by most of the country, suggesting that Democrats could find sufficiently broad support for impeachment without converting many Republican voters.
A majority of registered voters now approve of the House’s inquiry into impeaching the president, a poll released Monday by Quinnipiac University showed. A Monmouth University poll of all Americans released Tuesday, meanwhile, found that 49% support the inquiry — just shy of a majority, but still an 8-point jump from August.
Back-to-back Quinnipiac polls in late September — one conducted in the days leading up to Pelosi’s announcement last week, then another taken just afterward — showed that support for Trump’s ultimate removal from office jumped 10 points after the House opened its inquiry. This was driven by a surge among Democrats and a gentler uptick from independent voters.
Voters are now evenly divided on whether Trump should be removed, with 47% saying he should be and the same number saying he should not, according to the latest Quinnipiac survey. Last week 37% of voters said he should be, and 57% said he should not. (The Quinnipiac polls were of only registered voters; most other recent polls have included all American adults.)
Even as Democrats and independents become more supportive of impeachment, there are signs that Pelosi may have a hard time building nationwide consensus.
The share of Republican voters expressing strong approval for Trump’s job performance rose by 12 points since last week, from two-thirds to nearly 4 in 5, according to the Quinnipiac polls. And the share of Republican voters saying Trump is generally an “honest” person has spiked since March, when Quinnipiac last asked the question: from 66% then to 83%.
This suggests that the Republican base’s support for the president might be hardening as he comes under increasingly serious fire — even with evidence mounting that Trump pressured Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate the son of a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
“The number of Republicans who say they approve strongly has risen since last week,” said Mary Snow, a polling analyst at Quinnipiac. “So there is a real partisan divide to these questions.”
The percentage of voters saying they think the president “believes he is above the law” also remains stuck exactly where it was in early May: at 56%, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll. Just 15% of Republican voters hold that view of him.
Independents are split on whether the president should be impeached and removed, but they generally express support for the House’s inquiry. According to a CNN poll of all Americans taken after Pelosi’s announcement, support for impeachment among independents for Trump’s eventual removal is now 11 points higher than it was in May. It stands at 46%, roughly even with the 45% of independents who say he should be allowed to remain in office.
That number appears poised to move in one direction or the other. When asked in a CBS News poll released Sunday whether it was too soon to say if Trump should be impeached over the Ukraine scandal, roughly a quarter of independents said it was.
In the Monmouth poll, respondents were asked how much they had heard about reports that Trump had asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden’s son; 27% said they had only heard “a little,” and another 21% said they had heard nothing at all about it.
Whit Dickey, a Republican pollster, said that given the steadiness of Trump’s approval rating throughout his term in office, it seems unlikely to drop significantly during the inquiry. But that approval rating has remained at just over 40%, suggesting that a decisive majority could end up supporting impeachment anyway, Dickey said.
“The group to watch over the next few months is the 15 or so percent of the American electorate that disapproves of Donald Trump’s job performance, but until the Ukranian news has opposed impeachment,” he said. “If that 15% that oppose Donald Trump moves to support impeachment, then you’ll have between 55 and 60% of the country supporting impeachment and removal from office. That becomes a significant development.”

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump habría sugerido medidas ilegales para detener la llegada de inmigrantes a Estados Unidos el pasado marzo.
Un informe del New York Times revela las discusiones que tuvo Trump con varios de sus asesores por los días en que la caravana de migrantes se instalaba en la frontera con el objetivo de pedir asilo político.
El reporte describe a un Trump desesperado y agresivo con sus asesores, entre ellos su yerno Jared Kuschner.
“¡Me están haciendo ver como un idiota!” , habría gritado Trump en una reunión. “Hice campaña con este tema. Es mi asunto”.
El presidente llegó a sugerir un cierre total de la frontera pero sus asesores le advirtieron que la medida dejaría a atrapados a turistas estadounidense en México y crearía un caos económico. La entonces secretaria de Seguridad Nacional Kirstjen Nielsen añadió que las solicitudes de asilo podían seguir en marcha en un eventual cierre de los pasos fronterizos.
El presidente rechazó las advertencias y sugirió medidas más extremas como disparar a los inmigrantes si tiraban piedras, algo que se conoció públicamente en ese momento. Los asesores le dijeron que eso era ilegal. Trump después pidió balear en las piernas a los inmigrantes para retrasar su arribo a la frontera.
El artículo menciona el momento en el que Trump decide atacar a México con aranceles . También tiene detalles del despido de Nielsen, quien le recordó al presidente que no podía construir un muro de concreto ya que todo estaba contratado con las barrerar de acero.
Trump terminaría resignado a su suerte y en los meses siguientes se dedicó a criticar las leyes de inmigración de Estados Unidos.

Texto completo: DES MOINES — U. S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a long-time defender of whistleblowers and a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, pushed back Tuesday against the president's call to identify the person who filed a complaint about his July phone call with the Ukrainian president.
"This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should always work to respect whistleblowers’ requests for confidentiality," the senior senator from Iowa said in a news release.
The president wrote on Twitter on Sunday that he deserves to meet the person who filed a whistleblower complaint about him, saying that they had represented his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a "totally inaccurate and fraudulent way. "

. oembed-frame { width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; border: 0; }Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called “Whistleblower,” represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way. Then Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress. . . . . .
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019
The whistleblower filed the complaint on Aug. 12 about Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, in which the president encouraged the foreign leader to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, as well as Biden's son, who was on an energy company's board in Ukraine.
Trump has sought to delegitimize the report, saying it should not have been filed because much of it is based on second-hand information rather than the whistleblower's direct knowledge of events.
But Grassley, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, pointed out in the release Tuesday that protections for whistleblowers do not hinge on how the person acquired the information they've reported.
“When it comes to whether someone qualifies as a whistleblower, the distinctions being drawn between first- and second-hand knowledge aren’t legal ones," Grassley said. ". . . Complaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim’s credibility. "
In addition to defending the whistleblower's request for anonymity from the president, he also pushed back against reports on the person's identity from news organizations.
Last week, the New York Times published details on the whistleblower's identity. The paper faced backlash for publishing the information, which critics said could have outed the person's full identity.
"We should always work to respect whistleblowers’ requests for confidentiality," Grassley said. "Any further media reports on the whistleblower’s identity don’t serve the public interest — even if the conflict sells more papers or attracts clicks. "
Although Grassley called for protecting the person who filed the whistleblower report, he has not joined with Democrats who are calling for the president's impeachment. The Iowa Republican criticized Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who announced the House would launch an impeachment inquiry against the president last week.

"Unfortunately, instead of waiting to learn the facts by reviewing that transcript or hearing from the whistleblower, Democrats have moved straight to starting the impeachment process," Grassley said in a September news release. "Democrats have been searching for any reason to impeach President Trump since his inauguration because they couldn’t accept the results of the 2016 election. "
Grassley has fought throughout his career to extend protections to government whistleblowers, beginning in 1986 when he authored amendments to the False Claims Act encouraging whistleblowers to come forward with reports of fraud and abuse.
Grassley wrote a letter to Trump after he took office in February 2017 urging him to hold a Rose Garden ceremony honoring whistleblowers and their service to democracy.
"Whistleblowers are brave, patriotic people who tell the truth about what is going on in our government," he wrote. "They help us identify waste, fraud, and abuse in the vast and unwieldy federal bureaucracy. When others fight tooth and nail to protect wasteful pet projects, avoid transparency and accountability, and put their own interests ahead of the American people, whistleblowers do exactly the opposite.

Sturgill Simpson lets loose with 'old' sounds

Texto completo: Listeners hungry for Sturgill Simpson's familiar croon better keep feasting on the old stuff – because the Kentucky songwriter's new album trades country comfort for rock 'n' roll grime.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," out now, Simpson steps away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer. Instead, he ventures deep into the underbelly of fuzzy, futuristic guitar rock.
Simpson recorded "Sound & Fury" at Michigan's McGuire Motor Inn, working alongside bandmates Bobby Emmett, Chuck Bartels and Miles Miller. John Hill, known for his work with Portugal. The Man and Cage The Elephant, co-produced the album.
And, if Simpson tapping into a no-nonsense dystopian soundscape wasn't enough, he teamed with leaders in anime to pair the 40-minutes of tunes with a Netflix film of the same name.
How's the album sound? Here's what we know about "Sound & Fury."
'Sound & Fury,' the album
Simpson's 10-track "Sound & Fury" follows the subtle country storytelling of 2016's "A Sailor's Guide to Earth," which earned the major label newcomer international acclaim – including an unexpected nomination for Album of the Year at the 2017 Grammy Awards (he would fall to Adele, but brought home Best Country Album that year).
As outlined in a New York Times profile last month, Simpson found "Sound & Fury" by way of Nashville nonconformity, worn-down months on the road ("There was a point in 2017 where I thought I was just going to just go away," he said) and the immobile weeks after a sinus surgery that led him to rediscover the music of his formative years.
In his time recovering from surgery, Simpson told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that he turned to hip-hop, the Cars and Black Sabbath, each influencing the rip-roaring sound that boils with audacity and swagger on "Sound & Fury."
A cathartic output, Simpson told the Times he wanted it to hit "like a Wu-Tang record." From the article:
"I could've very easily probably made the same record five times by now and just gone right down that middle lane and played it safe, and I'd have $80 million in the bank," Simpson said, dryly. "And I'd probably be hanging from a (expletive) rope on one of these trees over here by now, you know what I mean? So it's not worth it."
The result? A sonic onslaught that explores galaxies between genres.
Simpson blurs between disco itches and gritty guitar scratches on the album. There's the groove of instrumental opener, "Ronin;" The slick, funky flair of "A Good Look;" southern-soaked bombast with closer "Fastest Horse In Town;" and an ode to longing, reflective guitar-pop with six-minute album standout "Make Art Not Friends."
On the subtly spacey "Mercury In Retrograde," Simpson sings to the dog-and-pony show that once greeted his rising success: "They come back stage and on my bus, pretending to be my friend/ Shaking hands behind grandstands, wearing the same 'ole grin."
The songs come from "a weird spot," Simpson told Lowe – including his distaste for the industry behind the art.
"It is a dirty toxic industry," he said. "And I wanted to express a lot of that."

Texto completo: Readers react positively to an editorial laying out the case for a congressional inquiry into President Trump's actions, and respond to other opinion essays on impeachment.
To the Editor:
"The Only Option" (editorial, Sept. 29) speaks to the urgency of this inflection point in our history.
The framers of our Constitution were learned men who knew that in the course of human events, one day our democracy might be tested by a president of low moral character and self-serving venality -- a man who harbored kingly ambitions and brooked no dissent.
Indeed, it is time for, in your words, "the most radical check of all."
The Republican Party has abdicated its pledged responsibility to uphold and to defend the laws embedded in our Constitution. The Democratic Party must now move forward expeditiously to prove its case to the American people for bringing forth articles of impeachment against this dangerously hubristic president.
Our country and the world are watching how the process unfolds, as our presumed fail-safe system of government is under siege from within. Can we self-correct? Are we a nation of laws or of men?
"The majesty of representative government," in the words of the editorial, demands that we not shirk our patriotic duty to uphold and to defend the Constitution from the corrupting encroachments that subvert our democracy and, if unchecked, set a course toward the authoritarian rule of unaccountable men who presume to govern as if by divine right.
Barbara Allen Kenney
Santa Fe, N.M.
To the Editor:
Your editorial echoed the words of our forefathers in the Declaration of Independence, which spoke to the oppressive actions by King George III against the colonies.
You addressed the constitutional reasons for a House inquiry into the offenses perpetrated by the president of the United States. In the midst of passionate rhetoric on all sides, the editorial, unburdened by rancor or divisive claims, clearly lists the president's unlawful offenses.
It was heartening to read this eloquent and timely editorial.

To the Editor:
The framers of the Constitution, in their wisdom, provided impeachment as a mechanism to protect the integrity of our democracy from the abuse of power. But starting impeachment proceedings now is not a "traumatic recourse," though you support the inquiry, but rather a much-needed and lawful means to address the traumatic harm that President Trump's callous, corrupt, lawless and self-dealing practices have inflicted on our country and our residents.

To the Editor:
Re "Trump Can't Take a Punch," by Jamelle Bouie (column, Sept. 29):
President Trump has brought Vice President Mike Pence into the investigation. Mr. Trump said, "I think you should ask for V.P. Pence's conversation, because he had a couple conversations also."
And so the door is open for the investigators to begin an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Pence.
How many more will go down with the ship?

To the Editor:
Re "Last Exit From Trumpland," by Ross Douthat (column, Sept. 29):
Instead of relying on a group of feckless senators to provide the votes to impeach the president, Republicans who want to salvage the electoral prospects of the party would be better served if the cabinet would invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Donald Trump unfit for the office.
At least this way the base would focus its outrage on a bunch of Republicans who are not running for re-election, and senators would be free to say they were not responsible for the president's political demise.
While these cabinet Republicans run the risk of being ostracized by their fellow Republicans, one could imagine a scenario where their reputations would be enhanced once the dust has settled, when people in both parties realize what a relief it is not to have to deal with such a mercurial and lawbreaking president.

To the Editor:
Re "Impeachment Is an Act of Desperation," by Christopher Buskirk (Sunday Review, Sept. 29):
What I find amazing about this article is the absence of an ethical compass applied to the actions of our president. Mr. Buskirk calmly acknowledges that some of the abuses are probably true, yet he dismisses them.
How jaded are we to so casually dismiss such activity at the highest level of office?
My question for Mr. Buskirk is, "Have you no sense of decency, sir?" We have no choice but to pursue impeachment if President Trump has committed crimes. Our democratic system requires it.
